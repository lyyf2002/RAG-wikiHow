Prevent the plants from flowering and setting seeds.,
Avoid breaking the roots and leaving pieces of root in the soil.,
Apply herbicides to the Canada Thistle Plants.,
Try some or biological control to kill the Canada Thistles.",How to Root Out Thistles3," When you see the plants growing starting early spring and seedlings popping up mow the plant to the ground. If this continued over the years the repeated mowing will wear the plant out as thistles are not really long lived plants. Throw these clippings into the trash not into your compost because roots and pieces of plant along with seeds can sprout to new thistle plants.

, If you leave pieces of broken roots of Canada Thistle or break the runners or rhizomes which are creeping roots near the surface these will grow into new plants! If you are digging Canada Thistles roots pick up all the pieces thoroughly. Don't put these pieces of root into compost.

, Read the label to make sure the herbicide is approved for this species. If you are treating an entire area for a new garden you can use what is called an all green killer. If you are getting a weed out of a garden with desired plants use precautions making sure to get a special weed killer that doesn't kill the desired plants or keep the pesticides from drifting onto neighboring plants.

, This is a good idea if you are into organic gardening, your weeds are in a vegetable garden, you have kids or pets or you or someone in the home is allergic to pesticides.


Orellia ruficauda feeds on Canada thistle and has been reported to be the most effective biological control agent for that plant.Its larvae parasitize the seed heads, feeding solely upon fertile seed heads.
The rust species Puccinia obtegens and Puccinia punctiformis are fungi that kill thistle plants.
Aceria anthocoptes a microscopic mite also eats and kills Canada thistle.
The other perennial species are controlled in the same way and are easier because they are not so vigourous as Canada Thistle. Use similar procedures listed for the Canada thistle.

Avoid disturbing the garden soil deeply.,
Plant your plants in the garden closer together if possible and consider underplanting.,
Try not to leave your soil naked.,
Know that birds such as goldfinches eat thistle seeds and spread them naturally.",How to Root Out Thistles4," Rather digging a new garden or digging up plants from the garden try to disturb the soil deeper than necessary. Sleeping thistle and other weed seeds will be brought up to the surface of the soil and this will help them wake up and start growing. Remember the thistle seeds under the ground are waiting to sprout under the soil.

, Planting your plants closer together will limit sunlight from hitting the soil surface which will keep thistles and other weeds from growing. Planting lower height plants like a blanket under taller leggy plants will look better than just plain soil as well. Make sure your plants aren't going to get mildew or mold disease from such plantings.

, If your not planting the garden into it right away cover it with a thick plastic to block sunlight from causing weeds to sprout. On new planted soils use mulch or be prepared for spotting and pulling thistles out promptly. Consider also planting a cover crop like annual rye to help limit the amount of weed seedlings in the following season.

, Niger seeds is sometimes called thistle or black thistle. This important ingredient in many bird foods made for feeding small finches however is not a thistle but an African daisy species.

Buy bird netting.,
Install poles or stakes along the berry bushes.,
Secure the netting over the poles.,
Check the netting for any trapped birds or animals.",How to Protect Garden Berries1," Bird netting has ¼ inch holes, making it near impossible for a bird or squirrel to get into the netting. Use commercial bird netting made of plastic or nylon. You can find bird netting online or at your local hardware store.Buy enough bird netting to cover the entire berry plant, or row of berry plants, in your garden.
You can also use chicken wire over the berries. Chicken wire can be hard to drape over the berries so use this material with caution.;
, Dig small, deep holes and place five to seven foot poles made of wood, bamboo, or metal into the holes. You may need to use a shovel or pick axe to make the holes, depending on how hard the ground is. Arrange the poles along the berry bushes, lashing them together to create a teepee shape at the end of each row. You can then make V-shapes with the poles along the center of the berry bushes.You can also use wooden stakes to install the netting over the berry bushes. Make sure the wooden stakes are tall enough to allow the netting to drape over the berries.

, Drape the bird netting over the poles. Make sure the netting covers the entire berry bush from top to bottom. Use staples or upside down flower pots to keep the netting in place.Make sure the netting is firmly attached to the poles and there are no holes or gaps between the poles and the netting.

, Once the netting has been installed over the garden berries, check it periodically for any birds or squirrels that get trapped in the netting. You will need to remove them to ensure they can get back to their nesting area.You should also confirm that the netting is secure and has not shifted or moved around. You do not want any birds or squirrels to find an open spot in the netting and get at the berries.

Choose large, leafy plants that shade the ground from the sun's rays, which cause weeds to proliferate.,
Rotate crops.,
Clear the vegetable garden area of all weeds and non-beneficial plant matter.,
Lay down ground cover.,
Schedule regular weed pulling sessions.,
Avoid disturbing soil when harvesting garden plants.,
Rent a rototiller.",How to Prevent Vegetable Garden Weeds," When designing your seasonal vegetable garden, plan to include shade plants that suppress weeds include squash, pumpkin, melons, tomatoes and potatoes.;
, When planning your garden at the beginning of the season, vary the placement of your favorite vegetable plants to slow down weed growth in last year's exposed garden areas. Rotate shade plants with those plants that have smaller leaf spreads, such as lettuce and garlic.

, If your dormant garden area is covered with weeds, be sure to remove as many as possible before planting this season's crops. The fewer of last year's weeds that you start with, the less you will have to remove this year.

, A black plastic layer placed over garden rows will prevent the sun's rays and heat from expediting weed germination. Other weed prevention covers include covering bare soil with organic mulch mixes such as bark chips, straw and layered newspaper., Pulling weeds by hand or utilizing a mechanical weed pulling tool on a regular basis prevents weeds from becoming unmanageable and difficult to remove. Remember that the more a weed's root system spreads, the harder it is to pull up from the soil.

, When breaks in the soil around your vegetable plants appear, weed seeds can easily burrow into the soil. Harvest your vegetable plants as gently as possible to prevent soil disturbances.

, If weeds become unmanageable, a rototiller can quickly remove them without too much physically-demanding labor by the operator. Rototillers are one of the fastest mechanical weed removal methods but overuse can deplete the soil of nutrients and beneficial worms. Use rototillers sparingly.

Use plastic snakes.,
Put out shiny pinwheels.,
Create a decoy food area.",How to Protect Garden Berries2," Decoys are a good way to scare away rodents and pests from eating your berries. Get cheap plastic snakes in bright colors that are realistic looking from afar. Put them in the garden just as the berries start to ripen. Place them all around the berry bushes in areas where they are easy to spot. Move them around every few days in different spots in the garden.Once the harvest is over, remove the plastic snakes so the birds and squirrels do not get used to them being in the garden.

, Shiny pinwheels will reflect light and create noise in the garden, which will deter birds and squirrels. Place the pinwheels on stakes or fences near the berry bushes right as they start to ripen. Make sure they are positioned so they will be exposed to wind.When the harvest is done, put the pinwheels away so pests do not get too used to their presence.
As an alternative to pinwheels, you can hang CD-Roms from string on stakes by the berry buses to deter birds.

, Create a food station far away from the berries in your garden so squirrels and birds can feed somewhere else. Have sunflower seeds, peanuts, and food corn in a feeder in an isolated corner of the garden. You could even plant some tomatoes to feed squirrels. This can encourage birds and squirrels to eat only from the decoy food area and leave your berry plants alone.Keep in mind a decoy food area could attract other animals to your garden that you may not want around. Weigh this risk before you set up the food area.

Use predator pee.,
Try peppermint oil.,
Apply vinegar spray.",How to Protect Garden Berries3," The scent of urine from dogs, cats, or wolves scares animals like squirrels, rabbits, and deer. You can buy predator pee in vials online or from pet stores and spray it around the garden. Only apply it on spots that you do not plan to eat, such as the stalks or ground by the berry plants.You will need to reapply predator pee after it rains to ensure the scent is present in the garden.

, A mixture of peppermint oil and water can be sprayed in the garden to repel birds and squirrels. Mix a few drops of peppermint oil in water and use a spray bottle to apply it to the parts of plant you are not going to eat, such as the stalks or leaves.Make sure you apply the peppermint oil mixture to the berry bushes again after it rains.

, A mixture of white distilled vinegar or apple cider vinegar and water can help to deter squirrels and birds from picking at your garden berries. Combine one part water with one part vinegar. Spray the mixture on the stalks or leaves of the berry plants. Do not get any spray on parts of the plant that you plan to eat.Always apply the vinegar spray to the plants again after it rains to ensure the scent remains in the garden.

Do not disturb the mound in any way.,
Tell family members and visitors that you have fire ants.,
Tell your neighbors about the infestation.,
Select a pest control method to treat the infestation.,
Use granular products.,
Use a spray.,
Use dusts.,
Place down baits.,
Use the two-step method:


Step one – Use indoxacarb bait for fast acting control of mounds.,
Use cornmeal.",How to Prevent Fire Ant Stings," Disturbing, playing with or breaking an ant mound will enrage the fire ants, who will respond by defending what is, after all, their home. If you can, rope the area off to prevent people from accidentally walking into the area. If you have pets and young children, consider a way to block off the area until you can deal with it properly.;
, Explain where they are in the yard and ask everyone to stay away from the area until the ant problem has been dealt with.

, One of the most effective ways to prevent further infestations is to engage in a neighborhood-wide prevention program in which every person who has the problem deals with it. This will reduce the likelihood of the fire ants returning to treat any part of the area as a new home.

, There are many possible ways of dealing with the fire ants. You can call in a professional who will likely take care of everything, or you can try one of the DIY methods suggested in the following steps.

, Granular products, such as those containing the active ingredient fipronil, are undetectable to fire ants. Fipronil blocks the inhibitory nervous system of fire ants. It is a dual-use treatment and can be used as a preventative or a curative method, providing season-long control of treated areas. Fipronil products are ideal for fire ant treatment because one application should last an entire season. It kills the existing fire ants and prevents new colonies from forming.


Granules are spread with a broadcast or drop spreader and then watered to release the active ingredients into the soil where they kill fire ant queens and foraging ants.







, Sprays are an effective, yet costly treatment option. The aerosol spray comes in a can equipped with a rod that is placed within the mound to distribute the chemicals. Once sprayed, fire ants die immediately. When treating with sprays, wear protective clothing, as treatment involves close contact with the fire ant mound.

, Dusts are long-lasting and highly-repellent. They are ideal if moisture conditions permit. Dusts are applied by evenly sprinkling dust over the fire ant mound. The dust particles then stick to the bodies of ants as they walk through treated soil; all ants that contact the dust die.

, Baits are insecticides that have been mixed with ant attractants. Worker ants carry bait particles back to the mound and feed them to the queen, and the colony cannot survive without the queen. Baits are fairly slow working and do not work in wet environments.

,






Step two - follow by using a fipronil broadcast, for year long control.







, Apparently ants don't like cornmeal. So it's time to make fresh cornmeal! This can work for both outdoors and indoors but beware––it's rather messy.


Get some fresh corn (seeds) and put them in the mixer, turn it on and keep it on 'till it is fresh cornmeal.






Pour a cup of cornmeal where the ants are, the ants will relocate. Put the cornmeal around your house if it is indoors, if you are outdoors just place some more cornmeal within a few feet so they don't relocate further away.






This is a safe way to prevent the stings and getting the ants out. You may remove the cornmeal once you start noticing the ants are gone.

Check your plants on a regular basis for any signs of infestation.,
Ensure that any plants that you purchase are not already infected.,
Space your plants fairly far apart.,
Keep plants misted (inside greenhouse and outside).,
Allow the air in your greenhouse (if applicable) to circulate.

,
Install screening over any open windows (if applicable).,
Remove any already infected plants.,
Prevent migration from plant to plant by using sticky paper strips.,
Use natural predators such as those that feed on spider mites (""Phytoseiulus persimilis,"" ""Neoseiulus californicus"" or ""Mesoseiulus longipes"").,
Pick off any mites or eggs by hand.,
Spray plants using a stream of water to knock mites off the underside of leaves.,
Spray hot pepper wax onto leaves (underside) to kill the mites.,
Smother the mites by spraying with a 1/2 cup (113.4 g) of flour and 1/2 cup (118.3 ml) of milk mixed with 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water.,
Spray plants with an insecticidal soap to kill the mites but not damage the plants.,
Prepare a garlic mixture.,
Spray plants with a horticultural oil.,
Use any popular insecticide spray if necessary.",How to Prevent Spider Mites on Tomato Plants," Look for signs such as movement, or clusters of eggs. It may help to use a magnifying glass.;
, Check them carefully before purchasing or bringing them home.

, Provide enough space so that mites cannot easily move from plant to plant. A few inches or centimeters will be far enough.

, Also, keep the humidity high (if using a greenhouse).

,, This will prevent bugs and insects from entering.

, Discard or burn these plants; do not compost them as this will spread the disease.

, Place these around your pots.

, It is important that you introduce them before there is a large infestation, so that they can adequately control it.

, Destroy them by squishing or drowning. This works with only very mild cases of infestation.

, Be careful to not spray them onto another plant.

, Repeat this application every few days. The spray will not destroy eggs so you must continue to apply to kill all the hatched mites.

, Repeat this application every 4 to 5 days.

,


You can make your own insecticidal soap as follows: Mix together 2 tablespoons of liquid dish soap, 4 oz. ethyl alcohol (use the cheapest vodka you can find) and 12-16 oz. water. Transfer the resulting solution to a spray bottle. Spray on the tomato plants. You'll find that it works on other insects too.

, Place 1 oz. (28.4 g) of garlic in a blender with 2 to 3 oz. (57 to 85 g) of onion, 1 oz. (28.4 g) of cloves, 1 oz. (28.4 g) of cayenne pepper and 1 cup (237 ml) of water. Blend to combine. Add this mixture to 1 gallon (3.79 l) of room-temperature water and spray 3 times over 5 days. This is a preventative measure but will also kill young mites.

, This will suffocate the mites but won't damage the plants.

, Follow the directions on the label for safety measures.

Find out which garden plants are considered to be weeds in your area.,
Grow plants that spread easily in large containers.,
Trim the plant after it has flowered and before it can set seed.,
Dispose of plant clippings properly so that they cannot spread.,
Avoid leaving plants you don't want lying just anywhere in the garden.,
Think twice before even growing some plants.",How to Prevent Your Favorite Plants from Turning Into Weeds," You might be surprised to find some of your favorites are listed as invasive species within your locale. You can find this out in various ways:


Check out government sites online; look at departments responsible for plants, such as agriculture or science.
Ask at your local government advice service for pamphlets, booklets, etc. on such plants.
Talk to someone who knows about local plants and invasive plant issues at your local nursery or garden center.;
, By confining an easily spread plant in a container, you can still have the appearance of growing the plant in the garden but it's under your control in a container.

, If you stop the plant from going to seed, you'll stop it from spreading. Remembering to do this is the key; keep a note on your calendar for seed time. You might even make some of your child's pocket money contingent on plucking the seeds off before they spread, as a great way to learn about plants and to learn about the importance of taking responsibility for the impacts of your own garden on the local environment.

, Compost them in high heat compost bins if they don't have seeds or disease. If they have seeds or disease, dispose of them using proper green waste disposal methods, such as council (local government) collection or drop-off or tip disposal. In some places you may be allowed to burn piles of plant clippings; check with your local council.

, This is especially important with plants that contain bulbs (tubers) or still have roots intact––these can take root easily in the right conditions. Instead, dispose of properly.

, They may be your favorites but if you're aware that they're already a problem plant in your area, choose plants that are more suitable for your area instead. In many cases you may be able to find plants that smell or appear similar or produce similar characteristics to the one you can't grow but are native or non-invasive.

Know the signs.,
Plant with care.,
Soak the root ball in fungicide before planting the clematis.,
Keep using fungicide.,
Keep young plants watered throughout the dry, hot season.,
Feed regularly.,
Keep young plants stable.",How to Prevent Clematis Wilt," Clematis wilt will cause the stems to die back to ground level. Older plants may be able to recover but younger plants will usually die completely from this occurrence.;
, When planting clematis, plant it at the level of the first node. Doing this will allow the root system to develop more strongly, and new shoots will quickly form from the base of the plant. While this is not a preventative measure, it is a way of ensuring that there are plenty of regrowth opportunities should clematis wilt strike.

, This will kill off any wilt pathogens residing in the root ball and give the plant a good start.

, As the clematis grows, continue to spray the fungicide around the zone of the roots. Once the plant appears well established, you can stop doing this.

, Don't let them dry out.

, Use a mild liquid fertiliser to nourish the plant and give it steady growing strength.

, If the clematis is exposed to wind and snaps, this creates a possible entry point for fungal spores. If needed, shelter or tie up young plants so that they don't risk snapping off.

Use hot pepper spray.,
Consider using peppermint oil to deter rodents.,
Use ready made repellents according to directions.",How to Protect Plants from Animals1," Many animals don't like the taste of hot pepper or how it burns their noses. Any commercial brand of hot sauce dissolved in water will do or you can create your own version taking any hot peppers and water using any recipe and putting this in a spray bottle. You have to repeat this every week or after it rains for it to work effectively.

Wear gloves and don't get hot peppers in your eyes or in an open wound. Capsaicin oil that is produced in such plants also burns the skin, nose and eyes.
This will not work with birds. Birds are not affected by hot pepper and will still eat plants treated with it.;
, Simply dropping peppermint oil throughout the landscape grounds will keep rodents away for a very long time. Peppermint oil makes rodents hair fall out! Also peppermint is non-toxic and smell good too., There lots of to choose from in the local home-improvement and hardware stores as well as on the web. Some of them are sprayed on from a spray bottle onto the plant and others are granules you sprinkle around in the soil. However many of these are for small scale repelling for like a small tomato row and not a huge tomato field.

Read the ingredients and do a little research to be certain that there aren't any hidden dangers or surprises within the repellents before it is purchased. Some repellents are only made for non-edible plants that are grown for beauty and not for plants grown for eating. Some repellents may be safe to eat but affect the taste of the food.
The directions and descriptions will also indicate rather or not the repellent is rainproof and how often it needs to be applied all over again.

Try using a mock predator.,
Scare birds and other pest away by imitating fire.,
Use sound to scare unwanted critters away.",How to Protect Plants from Animals2," Animals want to eat and not be eaten. Give the pest an illusion of the pests' main enemies by creating an illusion of the predator being present. When animals sense that a main predator is in the area and notice signs they will stay away from that area. Using these tips in combination can be very effective.

Let your cat or dog chase the animals away! In the wild cats and dogs are top predators many animals are afraid of. Even a bark or purr can send an annoying creature into fear and flee mode immediately. Make sure however your pet knows the boundaries of the garden, is a breed that doesn't prefer to dig or is trained not to dig up yards, and that it's tested/shot for rabies. Also keep an eye out for animal battles that are likely to put the pet in danger. Also keep the pet within property lines and from running away from home whatever means necessary.
There are predator scent and/or urine kits you can purchase in many garden centers. It can sound gross, however these are urine scented sachets you tie to plants or granules you add to the ground around the landscape. The scent of a predator and it's urine will make many pest not want to visit the area for a long time.
Use an artificial duplicate of an predator animal. If there's a nice duplicate of a snake in the toy store or a Halloween owl decoration purchase it and put in the yard and move it around every few days. If you don't change the location of the mock predator the animals will know it's fake and get back into the garden. Animals will want to stay away from anything that resembles a creature that'll eat them. There are also lots of these models of predators available in any garden center. There are also things that resemble large eyes that can hung from fruit trees to scare birds and squirrels away from eating the fruit off fruiting trees and bushes.

, Any animal is scared of fire. There's a flashing tape you can buy that flashes in the sunlight that can resemble flames to a bird flying overhead. Also hanging old CD disk from a tree can also cause anxiety for any animal with similar flashing., Some wind chimes and other devices are hung in the garden and make noises that really get on the birds' nerves Also on the market are some high tech options that scare animals away from landscapes. Some use recorded sounds of predatory animals and there are others that use ultrasound. Humans and pets can't hear the very high-pitched ""sounds"" produced by ultrasound devices but the pest can. This hurts their ears and sends them foraging somewhere else. Loud neighbors and noisy garden and power tools can also help!

Don't use loud noise as a deterrent for or around the killer bees or any wasp or bee nest. Vibrations can set the hive into attack mode very quickly. Killer bees which are called Africanized Honeybee or Fire Ant attacks can be fatal as these species are more aggressive and and attacks last longer.

"

Search for critter-resistant plants when doing important plantings.",How to Protect Plants from Animals3," As the deer population explodes throughout the United States it's wise to select plants that deer don't normally eat. These plants are not deer-proof as a starving deer will eat anything. However these deer-resistant plants are last on the menu. Other plants will be munched on by critters regularly but grow back so rapidly they survive the attack.

Many garden catalogs, plant reference books, tags and websites will list plants that are deer resistant and rodent proof. There are some plants any animal won't touch because it's poisonous. Euphorbia lathyris Gopher Spurge is very toxic to gophers and moles and they don't like even it's smell. Toxic as well for humans if eaten. Many bulbs are also toxic to eat for both rodents and humans. Garlic and related plants are not very appetizing to many wild animals but a delicacy for humans.
Consider buying yellow cherries which birds don't like. If your interested in growing cherries as a food crop, you might want to try growing cultivars with the fruit being pink or yellow in color instead of traditional red. These taste the same as the red ones and birds don't eat them for some reason.
Choose more suitable plants for a landscape as well. Sturdy tall ornamental grasses and shrubs will be very much able to withstand a playful dog, munching deer better than delicate annual flowers.
Try planting a species of plant that you know the wildlife favors in your landscape somewhere in your landscape along with your desired plants.If you plant a sunflower patch or a native wildflower bush that produces berries the birds are going to most likely eat those more aggressively than your prized blueberries.

Cover precious crops with netting.,
Try planting your more expensive seeds and bulbs in an indoor situation.",How to Protect Plants from Animals4," Make sure that however these nets are light enough not to break the branches or the tree or bush being guarded.You can purchase special netting from garden centers and garden catalogs that let light in but is strong enough to keep hungry beaks and bills from reaching the fruit.

Cover spring bulbs and new planted seed beads with chicken wire to keep squirrels from digging down to the bulbs and seeds until they grow.
Cover the trunk of newly plant trees and woody shrubs with a trunk wrap. Without it even a bump of a deer can damage or kill the baby tree. Deer and rabbits like to eat bark of young trees which can be a death sentence for a young sapling.
Cover the soil around your plants with something sharp to keep, dogs,cats, rabbits and deer from stepping into the garden to get to the plants. Rocks or even sharp sticks will work or broken glass pebbles. Make sure you don't cut yourself while working in the garden.

, Grow these in the house on a window, in a greenhouse, or in a cold frame that is kept secured so the critters don't get in. There are also handmade versions and portable options for ease of relocating the plants if necessary. Unless an animal get pass the lock or into the house or enclosure the plants are safe."
"
Compromise!,
Consider having extra plots or plants for back-up.",How to Protect Plants from Animals5," The key here in most cases to limit losses. You can't prevent every little seed, plant, fruit or flower from being eaten or destroyed. Animals normally eat only their share of a food plant and move on. Are you really going to eat all those berries on that raspberry bush? When nature is involved expect loses and hope they are minimum., If space allows plant more than you think you'll need and have a back-up batch if possible. If the seed packet is very cheap buy multiplies to replant in case of disaster. Plant a species of plant or vegetable in two or more different spots instead of one single spot. Planting one species in mass can also be useful. This will reduce the possibility of a total loss."

Choose the right time for the task.,
Find a pair of gardening gloves.,
Pick up your weeding tools.,
Protect yourself from the sun.,

Look for any garden hazards and remove them.,
Identify the weeds you want to remove.,
Kneel down or stand above the weed you want to remove.,
Loosen the soil where the stem of the weed meets the top of the garden bed.,
Grab the taproot or main root of the weed with your hand or weeding tool.,
Pull up the weed.,
Collect the weeds and dispose of them.,
Stretch before you start weeding.,
Sit with your legs bent, parallel and one leg slightly in front of the other.,
Maintain a straight back while weeding from a standing position.,
Install raised beds to avoid back pain while weeding.,
Purchase ergonomic gardening aids to ease back pain.",How to Pull Weeds," Pulling weeds is much easier when the ground is wet, so working soon after a rain will make the job easier.Typically, a good day to weed is one day after a nice rain., Try to find gardening gloves with some kind of wrist closure such a Velcro band that can be tightened around the wrist. In general, you want to find a pair of gardening gloves that are comfortable and reasonably durable.Use whatever pair of gardening gloves you have in your shed. Any pair will do for weeding, but it is preferable to have a pair with wrist closure.
Purchase a new pair of gardening gloves from a home and garden center. Look for a pair that fits your hands and has some design features such as reinforced fingertips, double stitching, and wrist closure., Weeding tools are great if you want to keep your hands clean or if you are weeding in an area that is particularly tough, such as an area with hard soil or a high concentration of weeds. Weeding tools are also great if you want to save some energy, since using your hands to weed can be quite exhausting. You should go to the shed and pick up the weeding tools you need for your job. If you are weeding in a tightly planted area and will be working on your knees, you will need a short handled weeding tool. If you are weeding a large area of the garden and plan to complete the weeding standing up, you will need a long handled weeding tool.If you do not have the right weeding tools for your job, you may need to visit your local home and garden center to purchase an appropriate weeding tool.


If you are buying a new weeding tool, you may want to examine the sharpness of the tool, whether it is made with good materials (for example, a stainless steel blade), and whether or not it will work for the most common weeding tasks in your garden. You should also consider whether you can comfortably grip the tool in your hands.The Japanese farmer’s knife is a type of short handled weeding tool that can be used to stab and saw through roots and pull up tough weeds.The Cape Cod weeder is a type of short handled weeding tool that is especially good for weeding in tight spaces of your garden.The radius pro weeder is a long handled weeder that has a circular handle, which is great for people with arthritis or wrist troubles.The weed dragon garden torch cooks your weeds to eliminate them for good. It emits a flame that cooks the weeds and eventually kills them, since they are then unable to take in nutrients., You should put on a hat and some sunscreen lotion. Weeding is exhausting work that usually involves exposure to the sun, so you will need to protect your face, neck and any other exposed parts of your body.


Use a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher. If you have fair skin, you should be using at least SPF 30. The SPF number tells you how well the sunscreen protects you from burning.Choose a sunscreen that has good water or sweat resistance. Weeding is tough work that involves some sweating, so you should make sure your sunscreen can stand up to the job.If you are weeding in a greenhouse or indoors, you can skip this step.

, You will need to stay hydrated while weeding, so fill up a water bottle or two. You will need to drink water before, during, and after weeding in order to keep hydrated. Keeping hydrated will prevent heat stroke due to prolonged exposure to the sun while you are gardening., If there are hoses left lying about, put them aside so you don’t trip on them while weeding. If there are pitchforks lying on the ground, remove them so you don’t trip on them. Remove any such hazards so that you can weed in peace.If there is stinging nettle in the area, take a note of where it is located so you can avoid being stung.If there are poisonous snakes in your area, take a look to make sure there aren’t any in your garden. On hot days, watch out for snakes in cool and shady areas. In general, snakes will be attracted to any area of your garden that is cool, moist and cavernous.Check to make sure you know where the first aid kit is located in your garden or house, so that you can get it if you get a scrape or cut while weeding. Although weeding is not generally a dangerous activity, it is good to be prepared just in case., Walk around the garden bed you plan to weed and identify the areas that need to be weeded. While you are surveying the bed, take a close look to identify edible weeds that you may want to keep such as dandelion, amaranth, plantain or lamb’s quarters.Once you have an idea of what you want to pull up and what you want to leave, start weeding the bed.


Consider whether you want to harvest edible weeds to eat later. Many edible plants are commonly seen as weeds but are great additions to salads and stir fries. For instance, dandelions are commonly seen as a weed but are actually a very tasty vegetable that can be added to salads, stir fries, and soups.You may not have planted these edible plants yourself, but they can be desirable nonetheless. Pull them up and store them in a mason jar in your fridge.

, If you are using a short handled weeding tool or your hands, kneel down in the bed and get ready to pull up the weed. If you are using a long handled weeding tool, you can position yourself standing directly above the weed you want to remove.

, If you are working in wet soil, it will be quite easy to loosen up this soil. If you are working in dry conditions, you may need to work a little harder to loosen it up.Stab at the soil with your weeding tool and break up any large clumps of soil. Gradually break up the soil around the weed so that you can access the taproot with your hands or weeding tool.

, It is important to grab as much of the root as possible, otherwise the weed will simply grow back., Using your weeding tool or your hand, pull the weed out of the garden bed. Whether you use your hands or a garden tool is partly a matter of personal preference. For example, some people prefer to wear garden gloves and use a weeding tool in order to keep their hands clean. However, many gardeners enjoy the feeling of getting their hands dirty and are happy to use their hands. Grip the bottom of the weed tightly and pull it sharply out of the ground. Try to pull the whole weed out of the garden in one piece by pulling straight up rather than at an angle, so you don’t have to repeat this step. Repeat the process until you have a weed-free garden


If you are unsuccessful in pulling up the roots of the weed, you can use your weeding tool to dig a little deeper and pull up any remaining roots.
If you have trouble pulling up the taproot, you can use your weeding tool to cut deeper into the root system.

, If you have a compost pile, you can put the weeds in your compost bin. You can use the composted soil next year. If you have a curbside lawn waste program, you can put your weeds in a bag and dispose of them on the appropriate day for lawn waste pickup.If you compost your weeds, you should be aware that some weeds will survive the composting process.Avoid disposing of your weeds on public lands. Many weeds are invasive species and will have a damaging impact on public parks and conservation areas., Fifteen minutes prior to weeding, you should do a stretching routine to loosen up your muscles and prepare your body for the task. Start by doing a lateral stretch to loosen up your back and shoulders, then stand forward and bend to loosen up chest, legs, back and shoulders. You can finish your routine with a goddess pose to loosen up the hips.The lateral stretch is great for your back and shoulders. Standing with your feet together and slightly bent, place your left hand on your hip and extend your right harm overhead. Lean to the left while keeping your body aligned.Then, repeat the stretch on your other side.
To complete the forward bend: lean forward over your knees with your arms behind your back and your fingers interlaced. Relax your neck and shoulders.To complete the goddess pose: lie on the floor with your knees bent and your feet touching. Allow your knees to lower to the floor. You can put your arms above your head at the same time, with your fingers touching., Sit with your back straight. Your legs should be straight in front of you, parallel to one another and slightly bent. Try to anchor your sitting bones into the ground and keep your back perfectly straight. This will help you relax, conserve energy and avoid back pain.If you have bad knees or a bad back, you may prefer to sit on a gardening chair or a gardening stool.

, If you are weeding with a long handled weeding tool while standing, it is best to bend from the hips instead of the back. This will help you avoid back pain and conserve energy while weeding., If you find you experience a lot of back pain during weeding and other daily gardening tasks, you may consider installing raised beds. A raised garden bed elevates the height of your garden so you don’t need to lower your body as much when weeding.Make your own raised garden bed. You can use logs, bricks, branches, cedar, sandbags and other common materials to make your own raised beds. If you are less inclined to do it yourself, you can also purchase a raised garden bed from many home and garden centers., You might consider buying some kneepads or a garden seat to ease the daily task of weeding.


There are a wide range of supports such as kneepads, benches, seats and combination kneepads and benches. Look for a support that fits your body and price range. These products range from $35 to $90."

Note the favored conditions of botrytis.,
Check the airflow around your plants.,
Avoid watering plants in the evening.

,
Water plants direct at their base, on the soil, and not on their leaves.

,
Remove dead or old leaves from plants.,
Compost or bury plant parts that you remove.",How to Prevent Botrytis," Botrytis loves warm and damp or wet conditions. If it is hanging around, these conditions will cause it to thrive.;
, One of the best ways to prevent the growth of botrytis is to ensure that air is flowing freely around plants.

,,,


For example, dead or old leaves on tomato plants can harbour botrytis.

, Any part of a plant that has signs of a silver to grey mould should be treated as suspect and disposed of quickly to prevent further spread of the fungal disease.

Start with 2 cups (400 ml) of cider or white vinegar.,
Add 2 to 3 tablespoons (29 to 44 ml) lemon juice concentrate.,
Mix in 1 ounce (30 ml) of cheap gin, or use an equal amount of rubbing alcohol.

,
Add 1 to 2 teaspoons (7 to 14 ml) dish soap.,
Dilute the weed killer with water.,
Pour the solution into a plastic spray bottle.",How to Make Weed Killer1," Vinegar contains acetic acid, which effectively kills weeds and other plants.;
, Lemon juice contains high levels of citric acid and may also be effective either used with the vinegar or alone.

,, Either dish washing or dishwasher soap, in liquid or powder form, may be a helpful addition to weed killer. The soap attacks the outer protective layer of the plant, making it more vulnerable to attack.

, You can use the full-strength solution, but many report success after diluting the mix by 50 to 90 percent. Start with a 50/50 diluted mix, and then mix up a more or less concentrated solution depending on the results you have.

, Set the nozzle to ""stream"" rather than ""spray"" if the weeds are growing close to plants that you do not want to kill. Weed killer does not discriminate: it will kill any plant it comes in contact with.

Use salt as a weed killer.,
Kill the weeds with boiling water.,
Boil some eggs in the water.",How to Make Weed Killer2," Try this method only if you want to eradicate weeds in an area where you do not plan to grow anything for several years -- perhaps around paving stones and in pavement cracks. Salt kills the weeds and absorbs into the ground, preventing all plant growth. You can apply salt in one of two ways:


Dissolve 1/2 cup (120 ml) salt into enough warm or hot water to fill your spray bottle. Any type of salt should work. Some people recommend common table salt; others suggest using rock salt.
Apply the salt dry. Instead of dissolving the salt into water, you could apply the water and the salt to the weeds at the same time. Hose the weeds well leaving them wet, liberally sprinkle them with salt, and then soak them with water again.

, Dump a large pot-full on them if there are no other plants close by that you don't want to hurt. You might have to repeat this several times over several days to kill all the weeds.

, Some people have found that the waste water left over from boiling eggs kills the weeds faster than water alone. Pour the water on the weeds immediately after you remove the eggs.

Determine the ideal height of your grass.,
Mow your lawn as regularly as necessary to keep grass at its ideal height.,
Spread stones or mulch around your flower beds to prevent weeds from growing.",How to Kill Weeds1," All lawns have an ideal grass height that promotes healthy growth. Depending on climate and geography, your ideal grass height is between 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) and 3 inches (7.62 cm).


Talk to a landscaping expert or a professional at your local home and garden retailer to get an understanding of the type of grass you have and how high it should grow.
Keep grass a little bit longer when in doubt. This will provide shade to your lawn, depriving potential weeds of sunlight.;
, This will eliminate weed heads before they are allowed to mature or germinate in your lawn.


Use a weed whacker or a trimmer on the weeds that grow at the edge of your lawn every time you mow.

, The cover will keep the ground cool and deprived of sunlight, discouraging the growth of new weeds.

Identify and find herbicides for the weeds in your lawn.,
Apply the herbicide with whatever applicator it comes with.,
Treat entire patches of weeds and spot-kill the few isolated weeds that sprout up around the yard.

,
Attach a sprayer to your garden hose if you have an entire lawn of weeds that are out of control or have not received any attention for a long time.",How to Kill Weeds2," Select a broad leaf herbicide that matches your weeds. If the weed you want killed is not on the label, don't buy it.


Watch for child and pet warnings!
READ and FOLLOW ALL DIRECTIONS on the container.

, Products are frequently supplied with spray bottles so you can apply them directly to the weeds.


Make sure it's not windy or you can end up killing plants you wanted or were going to eat.

,, This will allow you to efficiently apply a large amount of chemical weed killer to the whole lawn.


Remove any toys, furniture, pets or clothing before you spray. The chemicals can be dangerous to people and animals.

Lay the paper or curtain down on the grown and cover it with mulch, pebbles or dirt and plant your flowers. Weeds will be unable to take root or move past the buffer.

, Corn gluten meal prevents germination of weed seeds but it will not bother your established plants. Best used in early spring.

, This is especially useful on weeds you notice in your driveway or walkway, because the water will have an easy time running off without bothering your plants or grass.

, Do not do this too close to plants or flowers, or cover them up before you spray. Vinegar will kill good growth as well as weeds.

, Stump remover is available at most nursery and hardware stores.

, Angle the holes down at a 45-degree angle.

, The plant absorbs the herbicide through the trunk and circulates it through the plant's root system.

, You might see some sprout up after the main plant is killed. Any roots that are not destroyed by the herbicide will still make new shoots.

, You may need to repeat the herbicide application several times to get rid of them.

Cut small problem roots.,
Dig a trench to block roots.,
Kill suckers with herbicide.,
Replace damaged pavement with crushed stone or mulch.",How to Kill Tree Roots1," Although labor-intensive, this directly addresses the issue with no risk to nearby plants. Dig out the soil around and under the root first, then cut with a root saw or loppers.Cutting roots aggressively can put the tree in a long decline, potentially killing it over many years.Follow these rules of thumb to prevent this:


Multiply the diameter of the tree by eight. That's the minimum distance from the trunk you can cut with low risk of serious harm.Cut roots on one side of the tree only, especially if you're risking a cut closer than the minimum distance.;
, Cutting roots once is only a temporary solution. To maintain the area, you may need to dig a trench and cut away the roots annually — or up to twice a year for aggressive root systems.You can save yourself from this chore if you dig one deep trench (ideally through the entire topsoil), then install one of these barriers before backfilling:









Galvanized metal roofing. Fold the top over to avoid a dangerous sharp edge.A double layer of HDPE plastic,
Overlap sections of barrier by at least 12"" (30 cm) so roots can't slip through.
sometimes available free from feed storesFor best results, buy a commercial root barrier treated with herbicide. Trifluralin is a common option unlikely to harm nearby plants., Some trees respond to cut roots or other damage by sending up new suckers from the root system. To kill these selectively, sever the root so the herbicide does not travel to the main tree. Apply an herbicide that contains glyphosate or triclopyr amine carefully to the sucker so it does not spray to nearby plants.Many suckering plants grow aggressively. If you are not willing to kill the main tree, you will need to repeat this treatment or periodically dig up the suckers by hand.









If you've cut down the main tree but suckers are still appearing in your yard, your only option may be to apply a broadleaf herbicide. This will kill all vegetation in the area. Repeat each time suckers appear until the roots run out of nutrients., It may not be possible to kill large surface roots without killing the whole tree. If that's not an option, you can install a surface the tree cannot break through. Since this does not kill the roots, it will not protect garden areas or sewage pipes.








Carefully remove any damaged concrete with minimal damage to roots.
Cover the area with geotextile fabric. Leave 6"" (15 cm) of clear ground around the trunk, or 12"" (30 cm) for large trees.Cover with 3–4"" (7.5–10 cm) of crusher run (a type of crushed stone aggregate) or 6–8"" (15–20 cm) of coarse mulch. Mulch is less effective, and may wash away in rain.
Edge the material with stones to minimize shifting.

"
"
Pour copper sulfate or rock salt down your toilet.,
Treat your pipes with a foaming herbicide.,
Have a professional clear clogged pipes mechanically.,
Repair the pipe.",How to Kill Tree Roots2," This is the easiest treatment, but it risks killing the whole tree or surrounding plants. Flush either product down your toilet bowl (never into a sink or shower) in ½ lb (¼ kg) increments or less, until you've added 2 lb (0.9 kg). Avoid running water into the pipe for 8–12 hours so the salt has time to kill the roots.Follow all safety information on the label.Both chemicals can cause major damage to aquatic life. Their use may be regulated by your state or country, especially near water treatment plants.







, Foaming herbicides expand to fill the pipe and take some time to break down, making them the best option for sewage line root removal. Contact herbicides kill the roots quickly, while systemic herbicides can take a couple weeks but may kill the whole tree. Different foam consistencies are appropriate for different sizes of pipe, so read the label before buying.








Some herbicides are toxic to fish or other wildlife. The label should describe the environmental impact, and may include information on how to minimize it.
For best results, hire a professional plumber to apply metam-sodium. This is a corrosive chemical that requires training and safety equipment to use.

, If roots have clogged a pipe completely, they will block the flow of chemical treatments.Hire a plumber instead to clear the pipe with a Roto Rooter or similar mechanical tool. This also has the advantage of avoiding environmental impacts from herbicide.

, Unless you're willing to repeat this treatment regularly, the cleared pipe will need structural repairs to prevent root regrowth. Installing a lining inside your pipe requires less digging and disruption, but a complete pipe replacement is often cheaper.








You may also need to remove or relocate any large trees near the pipe, or the roots will keep growing into the sewer pipe.

"
Research your tree first.,
Cut the tree to a stump.,
Excavate the stump.,
Attach the stump to a winch.,
Winch slowly.,
Grind a stump down if necessary.,
Fill hole.",How to Kill Tree Roots3," Some tree species can produce root suckers, growing whole new trunks some distance from the stump. Removing the trunk will not kill the roots, and can even trigger new growth. Avoid this method with these species (not a comprehensive list):


Elms, cherries, plums, and lilac trees can regenerate from roots after the trunk is damaged.Use herbicides instead.
Aspens, poplars, sumac, and black locust form ""clonal colonies"" of many trunks during normal growth.Their roots are very difficult to control even with herbicides.A local agricultural extension can recommend an effective herbicide treatment for your species.

, If the tree still needs to be cut down, cut it so about 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) of the trunk is still left above ground. This ensures that you have enough wood to grab onto to pull the trunk out of the ground.
Warning: Felling a tree is very dangerous. If you do not have experience and the proper tools, the tree may fall in an unexpected direction.Hire a professional if you have not done this before.









, Dig around the stump using a shovel, mattock, digging bar, or backhoe. Cut through the largest roots with an axe or saw as you reveal them. Clear a radius of about 4 feet (1.2 m) around the tree, or as much as you need to detach the main roots.









Before taking a chainsaw to a root, place a board underneath it. This protects the chainsaw from dirt and rocks.
Once you've made some progress on the hole, spray the area with a hose or pressure washer to reveal more roots., Most stumps are much too secure to remove manually, especially when freshly cut. Secure the stump to a hand winch anchored to a strong tree instead, or chain to a truck.








, Even a hand winch can send a stump flying with lethal force when it bursts out of the ground. Pull in short, slow bursts to avoid this risk. If you are in a truck, alternate forward and reverse movement. Ideally, the stump should pull loose from the ground gradually, and fall gently on its side.








, Some large stumps may not budge even with a winch. For these, you'll need to rent a stump grinder (or hire a professional). These are dangerous machines, so wear protective glasses and ask the rental agency to train you. Here's the basic process:








Clear away any rocks near the stump that could damage the grinding wheel.
Position the wheel a few inches above the stump's front edge.
Start spinning the wheel, then lower it slowly about 3 inches (7.5 cm) into the stump.
Slowly move the wheel from side to side to cut away wood to a 4 inch (10 cm) depth. Repeat with the next section of stump until it is level.
Repeat the process until the whole stump is ground at least 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) below the ground, or deeper if you want to plant a new tree., Pull out any remaining tree roots and fill in the hole where the tree was with soil. Plant grass seed on the top, water it, and you’re set to have a tree-free area that blends in with the rest of your yard.The tree's roots should stop growing and eventually decompose.








"
"
Know the risks.,
Select an herbicide.,
Wear safety equipment.,
Apply herbicide to a stump.",How to Kill Tree Roots4," Roots of the same species often grow together when they touch. This means that an herbicide applied to one beech tree might spread through the roots and end up killing more beech trees in the same area.This is especially likely with species that can form ""clonal colonies,"" including aspens and black locust.








, Herbicides that contain glyphosate or triclopyr amine are effective at killing trees and available at garden stores.Your species may respond to one of these more than the other. For example, glyphosate may do a better job controlling Russian olive, while triclopyr is the better choice for locust, maple, oak, and willow.Triclopyr amine should work at concentrations of 8.8%.For glyphosate, try to find a concentration of about 40%, then dilute with an equal amount of water. If that isn't available, apply undiluted product with at least 20% concentration.Herbicides containing 2,4-D, dicamba, or picloram are risky, as they may spread to nearby vegetation and kill it as well. This shouldn't happen with careful application of glyphosate or triclopyr., Follow the herbicide label instructions to prevent dangerous exposure to the chemicals. At minimum, wear long sleeves and pants, closed-toe shoes, latex or nitrile gloves, and safety goggles.Choose clothes you don't mind ruining.


You do not need to wear a mask, since you will not be spraying herbicide into the air., This treatment should prevent all or most of the roots from spreading and growing new suckers after a tree is cut down. It does require a fresh cut surface, but as long as the tree was cut less than a few weeks ago, you can create a new one:








Cut the stump close to the ground. Keep it as level as possible, so herbicide doesn't run off into the ground. Clear away sawdust.
Using an old paintbrush, apply herbicide just inside the bark ring. This is where the living tissue is that will carry the herbicide to the roots.
Dispose of the paintbrush and empty herbicide containers at a hazardous waste center."
"
Kill a tree with herbicide.,
Remove the dead wood.,
Remove the stump.",How to Kill Tree Roots5," This is an easy alternative to chopping down the tree, although it may not be safe if the dying tree could drop branches on a path or road. Also, this may not work in springtime on trees that produce a lot of sap, since that tends to push out the herbicide. If neither of these are issues, apply herbicide with the ""hack and squirt"" system:








Chop downward into the trunk at a 45º angle to make a wedge.
Insert a spray bottle with a narrow nozzle directly into the wedge. Squeeze in a little herbicide, trying not to get any outside of the cut.
Consult your herbicide label to find out how many cuts to make, and how much herbicide to place in each cut (usually 1 mL or less).
Some extra-aggressive trees require girdling instead, with herbicide applied to the freshly exposed wood., After a few days or weeks, branches of the tree should start to deteriorate and fall apart. As chunks of dead wood fall off the tree, remove and dispose of them.









Some trees or root systems may require multiple coats of herbicide to fully penetrate the wood. If the tree survives, check your herbicide label for multiple application instructions. Expose a fresh layer of wood with each application.

, After the tree is dead, dig up the stump using a shovel or backhoe. Keep in mind that it could take years for the tree to decompose on its own, so you do not want to wait. Make sure to remove the stump completely to prevent the roots from growing.

Remove the mushrooms from the ground as soon as you see the caps appear.,
Dispose of the mushrooms properly.,
Apply a nitrogen fertilizer to deter mushrooms from growing in organic matter.,
Use soap and water to kill off the mushrooms.,
Take care with potted plants.",How to Kill Mushrooms1," If you leave them for too long, they will release spores, which will lead to more mushrooms. When you see mushrooms appear, simply pull them out of the ground.


You can also try mowing or raking over the mushrooms, but this will heighten the chances of them spreading spores across your lawn.;
, Do not toss them into your compost pile. Instead, keep a plastic bag with you, and put them into the bag as soon as you pull them out of the ground. Once the bag is full, tie the bag up tightly, and toss it into a trashcan. This will help prevent the mushrooms from spreading spores across your lawn.







, The fertilizer will quicken the decomposition of the matter, which will leave the mushrooms nothing to feed off of. Plan on using 1 pound (453.59 grams) of nitrogen for every 1,000 square feet of lawn.









Do not use slow release or water-soluble nitrogen fertilizer.
You will need to do this annually.
Consider adding some phosphorous and potassium as well. You will need 3 parts nitrogen, 1 part phosphorous, and 2 parts potassium., Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons (29.6 to 44.4 ml) of dish soap with 2 gallons (7.57 liters) of water. Poke holes into the soil around the mushrooms using a shovel, trowel, or screwdriver. Fill the holes with the soapy water.








, Potted plants are often subject to mushrooms and other types of fungi. They are often subject to over-watering, and stay indoors, where the air is warm and still. This is a perfect environment for mushrooms. Here are some simple ways to keep your potted plants mushroom-free:








Pluck mushrooms as soon as you see them appear, and toss them in the trash immediately.
Provide ample air circulation by keeping the plant need a window or fan.
Avoid over-watering. Let the soil become dry at top between watering.
Use a watering bulb to keep the soil deep inside the pot moist, and the upper layer dry.

Make sure that your lawn has proper drainage.,
Make sure that your lawn has well-drained soil.,
Trim down tree branches to minimize shade.Cut close to the trunk, just beyond the bark ridge.,
De-thatch the lawn to minimize shade and create more air circulation.Manually go over the lawn with a convex rake.,
Make sure that there is enough air circulation by aerating your lawn.,
Eliminate decaying elements that enhance the growth of mushrooms.",How to Kill Mushrooms2," Mushrooms love damp and humid places. If your lawn holds too much water, you will need to make sure that it drains properly. Here are some ideas on how you can introduce proper drainage to your lawn:








If water is flowing down a slope, build up soil to redirect excess water to a more desirable location.
Add a pond or water garden to catch excess water. They are easy to maintain and can act as a decorative feature to your garden.
Place rain barrels beneath waterspouts to collect excess water during storms. This will prevent the water from soaking into your lawn.
Consider adding an underground drain, such as a French drain (an underground ditch filled with gravel) to help disperse water and prevent it from becoming stagnant.

, If your garden has a clay base, the water will have nowhere to go once it soaks through your lawn. It will sit and become stagnant. If you can, try mixing some sand or other well-draining material into your lawn to help disperse the water better.









When watering your lawn, try to water it in the morning instead of at night. The sun will help the excess water evaporate instead of sit and become a breeding ground for mushrooms.

, Do not leave any stubs. Angle the cut downward, so that rainwater does not collect in the hole and cause rot.









Keep your trees fungus free by trimming out any dead or diseased branches.,
Use a power rake. You can rent it from some hardware or home improvement stores. Once you are done power raking your lawn, you will need to use a regular rake to sweep up the debris.
If you have cool-season grasses, de-thatch the lawn between late summer and early fall.
If you have warm-season grasses, de-thatch in late spring.

, Not enough air circulation will lead to moisture being trapped—and where there is excess moisture, there will be mushrooms. Get an aerator from a home improvement or hardware store, and go over your lawn with it. The aerator will pull out plugs of earth out of your lawn. This will help loosen the soil and let more air in.Consider aerating the ground with an aerator to prevent the mushrooms from sitting in a stale, moist environment.

, Remove decomposing wood chips and small branches, a favorite of many mushrooms. Also keep your lawn clear of pet waste and any other decomposing matter the mushrooms could feed off. Keep grass clippings off your lawn by raking them up after mowing, or by attaching a grass catcher to your mower. Clean up pet waste. Have tree stumps ground and removed.

Locate the fairy ring.,
Determine how deep the fairy ring goes.,
Use a lawn aerator on fairy rings if the fungal mat is fewer than 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) thick.,
Dig out fairy rings if the fungus mat is deeper than 3 inches (7.62 centimeters).,
Discard the mushrooms and contaminated soil.,
Fill the plugs in with fresh soil.,
Consider patching up the soil with a quick-growing grass.",How to Kill Mushrooms3," A fairy ring is a ring of mushrooms growing in grass. They're usually easy to spot, but sometimes the mushroom caps are not visible. In these cases, the fairy ring will appear as a ring of dark green grass. In some cases, the ring will appear as a circle of dead grass., Get a trowel, shovel, or screwdriver, and prove the soil around the mushrooms. You may notice some white, fibrous stuff in the soil. This is known as the fungal mat. Depending on how thick it is, you will need to employ different methods of eradicating the ring.








, Start aerating 24 inches (60.96 centimeters) outside the outer rim of the ring, and work your way inward towards the center., Get a shovel, and dig out the soil containing the mushrooms. Go about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) deep. Once you have dug out the mushrooms, you will need to expand the ring you just dug by 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 centimeters) to either side.24 inches (60.96 centimeters) would be better. Some experts advise digging all the way to the center of the ring.


As you dig, try to determine the cause of the fairy ring. Look for rotting wood, construction debris, or anything that could keep water from draining. Remove any of these causes as you go.

, To avoid spreading the mushroom spores all over your garden, toss everything into a large garbage bag. Tie the bag up tightly, and toss it into the bin. Do not throw the mushrooms or the soil into your compost pile.








, Avoid using immature compost, which could contain mushroom spores. (Mature compost is great for soil drainage and sterilized by the composting process.)









If you have heavy clay soil, add sand to the mix to help with drainage.

, The grass will cover the soil on its own, but it can take a while. If you are in a hurry to get your lawn looking green again, you can cover the bare soil with some fresh sod (turf). You can also sprinkle some grass seeds over the soil instead.

Identify poison oak plants.,
Cover yourself from head to toe.,
Dig out the plants by the roots.Smaller plants may be pulled out by hand, but you might need a shovel to dig out larger ones.,
Discard the plants.",How to Kill Poison Oak1," Poison oak has green, shiny leaves that turn red in the fall and die off in the winter. The leaves are thick and have a rumpled surface. They have a similar shape to oak leaves and grow in groups of three (hence the ""leaves of three, let it be"" adage). In open sun, poison oak grows in the form of bushy shrubs. In areas with partial shade, it can grow as a vine, climbing up trees and stumps.


Look for poison oak along trails, near the edges of woods, and in abandoned lots.
Left to grow, poison oak plants can become quite large, but you'll also see baby plants sprouting from the ground. Look for the classic leaves for positive identification.
Even when a poison oak plant has lost its leaves, the dry sticks left behind are still poisonous, so don't dismiss a plant just because it doesn't have leaves.;
, Manual removal requires actually touching the plants, so you need to make sure you're completely covered to protect your skin from urushiol, the toxic (to humans) oil they produce. Put on thick gloves, several layers of long shirts, long pants, socks, and heavy boots. Since some people get affected by simply breathing the air near poison oak, you should cover your face as well. This is the most effective removal strategy, but it's also the most dangerous.


This method is not recommended for people who are severely allergic to poison oak - and you are, you probably already know you shouldn't attempt to do this. Either find someone who's immune - 15% of the population can touch poison oak without getting a rash - or try another method.
Be aware that if you only had a mild rash in the past, it's possible that another exposure could have a worse effect.
Be very careful when you remove your clothes after the job is done. The oils from the poison oak plants will be on your gloves, shoes and other clothing. It should all be promptly washed using the hot cycle in your washing machine.

, It's very important to get the entire plant, including the roots. Otherwise the plant will grow right back.


It's easiest to manually remove plants in the spring, when they're green and the ground is relatively soft. Waiting until the ground gets dry or cold will make it difficult to get all the roots, since the plants will tend to break off at the stems.

, Once you've collected all of the plants and their roots, either stack them in an out-of-the-way area or put them in garbage bags to be thrown away. Dead poison oak plants are still poisonous, so don't leave them in a place where other people will come into contact with them.


Don't use the plants as mulch or compost. Again, it's just too risky, since they're still full of the oils that can cause an extreme rash.
Don't burn the plants. Breathing the smoke from burning poison oak plants is extremely dangerous.

"
"
Apply a chemical treatment to poison oak stumps.,
Use an early-season spray.,
Use a late-season spray.,
Consider getting a professional involved.",How to Kill Poison Oak2," You can use glyphosate, triclopyr or a combination of these chemicals to kill the poison oak plants. Do this at the beginning of the growing season, while the plants are still green. The plant will will drink in the chemical down to the roots. Once the plants are dead, you'll need to go back and dig them out.Start by covering yourself from head to to. You won't be directly touching the plants this time, but you still need to be careful.
Use long-handled loppers to cut down the poison oak plant so that the stems are just 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) above ground.
Immediately after cutting the stems, apply a of chemicals with a 1-inch wide paint brush or a squeeze bottle.
Thoroughly cover each stump with the chemical. You will have to re-treat any new growth that shoots out of the stump.
When the stems turn brown a few days later, use a shovel to dig out the dead roots.
Don't mulch or burn the dead material; throw it away, since it could still cause a rash.

, Choose an herbicide made with triclopyr. This chemical is most effective early in the growing season, and you can it from spring to mid-summer when plants are growing rapidly and flowering.


Don't spray on a windy day. The chemicals will kill nearby plants in addition to the poison oak, or they may blow back in your face.
Don't spray trees.
Spray when it's dry, not when it's rainy out. The herbicide will need at least 24 hours to work effectively.

, Use an herbicide made with glyphosate late in poison oak's life cycle. You can use glyphosate after the poison oak has flowered, but while its leaves are still green. Apply a 2 percent solution of glyphosate to the poison oak, spraying it directly on the poison oak plant's leaves. Glyphosate will damage or kill other nearby vegetation, so be careful where you spray it.


Don't spray on a windy day. The chemicals will kill nearby plants in addition to the poison oak, or they may blow back in your face.
Don't spray trees.
Spray when it's dry, not when it's rainy out. The herbicide will need at least 24 hours to work effectively.

, If you don't want to go near the poison oak, it might be best to hire someone else to do it. A licensed professional will apply a high-powered pesticide such as Imazapyr to wipe out the poison oak. It's best to do this in spring or early fall.

"
"
Cover the plants.,
Use boiling water.,
Employ a goat to do the job.,
Try a vinegar spray.,
Plant your yard with healthy groundcover.",How to Kill Poison Oak3," Use plastic sheeting to cover poison oak plants that are in a contained area. This works best if you first cut the plant down to a few inches above the ground. The dead roots must be removed and discarded properly, or they'll come back.

, Heat up your tea kettle until the water has come to a rolling boil. Take it outside and pour it near the roots of the poison oak plant. The boiling water should kill the plant - but again, you'll need to get rid of the roots. This method is better for small plants. Large shrubs probably won't be affected.


If you use this method, be very careful not to breathe in any steam that rises from the boiled plant.

, Goats love to eat poison oak - they aren't affected by the oils - and since they're always hungry, they can clear out an are riddled with the stuff in no time at all. This is a great natural way to get rid of poison oak plants. Check around to see if there's a goat farm in your area. It's becoming increasingly popular for goat owners to hire out their goats for natural landscape management.


If you go this route, you'll need to get the roots in order to make sure the plants grow back. However, you could instead hire goats every spring to keep them maintained.
Interestingly, goats that eat poison oak produce milk that's free of the toxic oils., This method might be worth a try, especially for smaller plants. Fill a spray bottle with undiluted white vinegar and spray the leaves and stems of the poison oak plants in your area. In a few days, the plants should die. Remove the roots if you don't want them to grow back.

, Since poison oak tends to thrive in ""disturbed"" areas with bare soil, you can prevent it from invading by planting other plants to take up that open space.

Design your lake properly.,
Keep your lake deep.,
Create a buffer zone around your lake.,
Be proactive.",How to Kill Lake Weeds1," Many species of lake weeds flourish when they can take root in underlying soil. You can prevent this by creating steep banks on the edge of your lake or pond, that descend directly into deep waters. Consider constructing lake banks with a 3:1 grade that descend into a water depth of 5ft. This strategy will prevent submersed plants from rooting in the lake, but it will not help with algae or free floating plants.;
, Make sure that your lake maintains a depth of 2-3ft at its most shallow point.This will help prevent weeds from taking root if they continue to proliferate throughout your lake or pond. Keep in mind that this will only work for rooted weeds, not algae or free-floating plants.

, Lake weed proliferation is usually caused by an overabundance of nutrients in the surrounding soil. The runoff from fertilizer in the soil feeds these lake weeds and causes them to grow in large numbers. Create a riparian buffer zone by planting 100ft of natural plants or trees between your fertilized land and your lake to prevent runoff from entering the lake. Choose plants that will prevent erosion and that do not require any chemicals to be applied.If you have livestock, nutrients from their feed and animal waste may also enter runoff and cause weed proliferation. Consider building a fence around your livestock or keep them at least 100ft away from the lake's edge. , Once you notice a significant lake weed issue, be sure to address it as soon as possible. Continual overgrowth will lead to more serious weed problems. The more you allow the weeds to grow, the more expensive and time-consuming it will be to address the problem at a later date.


If you notice too many ducks or feeding fish around your lake, you may want to take steps to reduce their presence. Their waste can contribute to the growth of weeds.

"
"
Use a benthic barrier.,
Remove weeds by hand.,
Use weed removal devices.,
Dredge and deepen the lake.",How to Kill Lake Weeds2," A benthic Barrier is a sheet that lays on the bottom of the lake preventing sun from reaching the lake bottom so it kills lake weeds it targets. This is a non chemical reusable product that is safe for fish.

Some vegetative growth is necessary for the health of the lake. If you use a benthic barrier, leave some area uncovered to allow for natural vegetative growth.
Don't cover fish spawning or bird nesting areas.

, You can easily cut up lake weeds from the roots, collect the cut weeds, and remove them from your lake or pond. They can be cut with a sickle or pulled up by hand, then removed from the water with rakes or hoes. Most lake weeds are perennials, meaning they will continue to sprout throughout the season due to underwater roots. You must remove them from their underlying roots in order to be properly control them. , Depending on the size of your lake or pond, and the weeds you are trying to remove, you may need an underwater or motor-driven device. Controlling lake weeds by hand can be labor intensive and difficult, as these weeds usually grow back quickly. Motor-driven underwater removal devices can help cut lake weeds loose under water, like water lilies and water milfoil. There are also aquatic weed harvesters that collect weeds for removal. Motor-driven devices often leave cut-up weed fragments in the water. New weeds may grow from these pieces so be careful when removing weeds this way. For surface algae in smaller bodies of water, water pumps can circulate the top layer of water to prevent algal scum from settling. Mechanical control of lake weeds can be likened to mowing a lawn. These devices will trim the weeds, but it is a temporary solution. , If the weed problem is severe, and weeds cover over 25% of the lake surface, consider dredging and deepening the lake. This will remove existing weeds and the bottom layer of sediment, as well as any underlying nutrients that cause weed proliferation. Dredging and deepening will reveal a layer of nutrient-poor soil, limit the amount of sunlight weeds are exposed to, and make it more difficult for weeds to take root. "

Choose the correct herbicide.,
Apply under the proper conditions.,
Dose properly.,
Reapply as needed.",How to Kill Lake Weeds3," It is necessary to properly identify the weed before purchasing herbicide. Different species and types require different herbicides. If you are unsure of the weed, call your county extension office or an herbicide dealer to make sure you buy the effective herbicide. Make sure you understand the effects and implications of applying an herbicide before doing so. Read the label on your herbicide to understand the restrictions and wait time on boating, swimming, and fishing before applying. This may be an important factor when choosing an herbicide. Herbicide comes in both liquid and solid form, as sprays or granules.
For algal weed control, consider using copper sulfates or copper chelates, such as Cutrine Plus. These can be applied directly to the infested area as per the instructions on the label. For certain submersed plants, such as pond weeds, and free-floating plants, such as duckweed, consider using a diquat or fluridone. Rooted-floating plants, such as water-lilies, and emergent plants, such as cattails, are best treated with glyphosate. Check your local and state regulations before using herbicides in a body of water. Permits are required for some types of applications.

, Herbicides are best applied in late spring when plants are youngest and weakest. If you wait until late summer when vegetation is thick, you risk major fish kills by depleting oxygen all at once. Apply when water temperatures are in the upper 60s (Fahrenheit). Herbicides do not work effectively when the water is too cold. , Make sure that you are using the proper dose when applying herbicide. The herbicide label will describe how to calculate dosage. Dosage is usually measured based on acre-feet, which can be determined by multiplying the surface area acreage by the average depth. The label will then tell you how much to apply based on this measurement. Never apply a larger dose than listed on the label. , Herbicides will need to be reapplied in subsequent years to come. Underlying seeds are unaffected by herbicides and will therefore emerge the next year despite initial treatment. Make sure to continue to apply in the spring to treat any structures that lay dormant in the winter. "

Check your local laws.,
Introduce swans to the lake.,
Release grass carp into the lake.,
Research which insects may be helpful.",How to Kill Lake Weeds4," Depending on the type of biological control that you use, you may need to get a permit from your local department of wildlife or agriculture. Some species that can control lake weeds are considered invasive in particular areas, and you may not be allowed to introduce them. Always learn what your local laws are before introducing a new animal or fish into your lake., Mute swans can be released onto small lakes. As they feed on both submerged plants and algae, they may be ideal to control vegetation. Keep in mind that swans require extra care, husbandry, and protection from predators., Also known as the white amur, grass carp feed on the submersed plants in your lake. They are usually introduced into a lake to control vegetation. Keep in mind that grass carp will eat almost any submerged vegetation, not just invasive species or weeds.

Grass carp will not help much with duckweed or watermeal.
It is recommended that you stock 15 to 30 fish per acre of lake. Get carp that are at least ten or twelve inches long.Grass carp can be invasive. Check your local laws to make sure that you are allowed to use them as a biological control before you release them into your lake.

, If you want to target a specific weed, you may look into using insects as form of biological control. You will need to find insects that are host-specific; this means you pick a species of insects that will only eat the specific weed that you want to remove. You can research your particular weed to see if there is an insect species that may help. You might also reach out to your local department of wildlife or agriculture, Noxious Weed Control Board, or an ecologist.Do not release non-native insects until you have verified that they will only eat the plant in question and that they will have no other impact on your local ecosystem.

Isolate the affected plants.,
Spray down your plants with a hose.,
Repeat the process once a week.",How to Kill Spider Mites1," If you notice that you have spider mites and want to minimize their damage to your plants, it's best to separate the mite-infested plants. Move them to a different part of your garden or indoors before you try to remove them., Water from a hose is strong enough to kill spider mites. Point a hose towards your plants and spray the leaves down with cold water. Remember to spray under the leaves as well so that you kill all of the mites., Keep the mite infested plants isolated for at least a month so that the spider mites don't spread to your other plants. Water from a hose is not strong enough to destroy spider mite eggs, so spraying the plants down once a week for a month will ensure that you kill the new mites that are hatching."
"
Dilute horticultural oil with warm water in a spray bottle.,
Move the plants with the mites inside a garage or shed.,
Throughly spray the plants with the oil.,
Spray every 2-3 weeks until the mites are dead.",How to Kill Spider Mites2," Horticultural oils are oil-based products that smother insects and their eggs. You can purchase horticultural oil at a home and gardening store or online.Before diluting the horticultural oil, make sure to read the instructions that came with it so that you know how much water you should use and whether it's safe to use on your plants.Use traditional horticultural oil in the summer.
Use dormant horticultural oil in the fall and spring., Horticultural oil may be affected by rain or high humidity and moving them inside will help prevent this. Avoid using horticultural oil on maple trees, hickory trees, cryptomeria, and spruce trees and read the instructions to make sure that they are safe to use on your plants., Since water and oil separate, it's important that you shake the bottle regularly as you use it. Saturate the top and bottom of the leaves with the oil. Allow the oil to soak in and kill the mites and their eggs.Horticultural oil works by suffocating the mites, so it's important you get complete coverage.
Do not use the oils on flowers because it could damage them.

, Check for spider mites periodically throughout the rest of the week. If you notice that mites are still hatching, spray the plant down again."
"
Look for yellow or brown dots on your plant's leaves.,
Examine your plants for webbing.,
Search for mites with a magnifying glass.,
Shake your plant's leaves over a white piece of paper.",How to Kill Spider Mites3," Spider mites will weaken your plant, and the leaves will often form small yellow or brown dots. You may also notice leaves drying up and falling off your plant., Spider mites will leave webs under the leaves and stems on the plant. Look at your plants daily to see if there is webbing on any of your plants., Since spider mites are less than 1 mm in size, they can be hard to see with the naked eye. Purchase a magnifying glass from a department store or online and examine the leaves on your plants. If you see small specks moving on the leaves, there's a good chance you have spider mites., If you don't have a magnifying glass, you can use a white sheet of paper to see the mites. Hold a piece of paper under the leaves of your plant and then shake them. If you see green, brown, or black specks start to move over the surface of the paper, you have spider mites.You can also crush the bugs with your finger. If they streak green, they are plant-feeding mites. If they are orange or yellow, they are probably beneficial predators.

"
"
Prune affected portions of your plants.,
Mist your plants with cold water.,
Place a humidifier near your plants.",How to Kill Spider Mites4," If you notice webbing on branches or spots on your leaves, you should prune these parts of the plant with hand pruners or shears. Discard the infested parts of the plant in the trash.Throwing away mite infested portions of a plant near your garden may spread mites to other plants.

, Moisture will keep mites away from your plants. Moving the plants indoors and misting them with water 2-3 times a day will reduce the likelihood of mites infesting the plants. You can also keep the plants over a saucer of water to prevent your plants from attracting mites., Spider mites thrive in dry conditions, and a humidifier will help keep them away. Do not use a humidifier when applying horticultural oils."
"
Get your equipment ready.,
Cut the vines around the base of the tree.,
Cut another circle around the tree at shoulder level.,
Examine the tree trunk for uncut vines.,
Cut away the ivy on the ground.,
Wait for the ivy to die.,
Monitor the area for new ivy growth.",How to Kill English Ivy1," The most important tool you'll need in order to kill ivy is a sharp pair of clippers or loppers, depending upon the thickness of the vines. Older vines can grow as thick as one's arm, while newer vines are as thin as flower stems. In addition to gathering appropriate cutting supplies, put on a thick pair of gardening gloves to protect your hands as you pull the ivy back.;
, One by one, walk around the tree and cut through every vine growing up the tree at ankle height.Even one remaining uncut vine can nourish the ivy further up the tree, so it's important to make sure no vine is left behind.


For very old, thick vines, use a handsaw to carefully saw through the vine.
As you work, be careful not to make cuts on the tree itself. Ivy weakens trees and makes them more susceptible to disease. Cutting through the bark could cause further damage.

, Use the same technique to cut all the vines again. This time, pull the cut sections of vines gently from the tree as you go. By making two cuts and pulling away the section of ivy at the bottom of the tree, you're blocking the vines higher up the tree from getting essential nutrients, and they'll soon die. Put the cut vines in a pile, then mulch them later so they won't take root again.


As you pull the cut vines from the tree, be careful not to remove too much bark with the holdfasts.
The same method works for removing ivy from outdoor walls.

, Take a close look to make sure no vines were left uncut. Cut and remove any you happen to find, taking care not to damage the bark.

, If the tree is surrounded by a mat of ivy on the ground, you'll need to remove the ivy from the ground so that it won't climb back up the tree. Removing a donut-shaped mat of ivy from around the base of the tree is sometimes referred to as a ""lifesaver"" cut. Here's how to do it:


Start by cutting a line through the ivy along the ground, from the base of the tree to a distance 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) away. Cut several more lines radiating from the tree. Cutting the ivy into sections will make it easier to remove.
Make a cut that connects all the lines 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) from the base of the tree.
Start pulling up the mats of ivy section by section. Keep removing ivy until you've cleared the area around the base of the tree such that no ivy reaches within 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) of it.

, Now that you've cleared the base of the tree, the ivy growing above shoulder height will begin to shrivel and turn brown. Do not attempt to cut away or pull off vines that have grown above your shoulders. Yanking off the holdfasts will pull away the tree's bark, leaving it susceptible to disease. The dead ivy will look unattractive at first, but eventually the leaves will fall away and it will become less noticeable.

, After you've taken these measures, check back every few weeks to make sure new ivy isn't crawling in the vicinity of the tree. When you find some, cut it away.

"
"
Cut the ivy into sections.,
Roll the sections off the ground.,
Use herbicides as an alternative.,
Use mulch to contain ivy you want to keep.",How to Kill English Ivy2," Cut lines through the ivy along the ground in order to divide it into large sections. This will make it much easier to remove the ivy from the ground. Pull the sections apart from one another as you cut. Work carefully around plants and saplings you want to keep.


If you're working on a hill, cut vertical lines from the top of the hill to the bottom to create sections that you can roll downhill.

, Lift the edge of one section of ivy and roll it forward on top of itself. Keep rolling the ivy forward until the entire section has been rolled up into a big log of ivy. Move the log to a separate area and continue rolling up sections until you've cleared the area.


Mulching the ivy rolls is the best way to dispose of them and ensure they won't take root in the area again.

, English ivy is difficult to kill with herbicides alone because the plant's leaves contain a waxy barrier that is difficult for products to penetrate. Therefore, the most effective method is to combine manual removal with the use of a herbicide. Glyphosate is the chemical that works most effectively to kill English ivy.Spray the area of ivy you wish to kill, but be careful the glyphosate doesn't reach other plants you want to keep.
Herbicides are slow-acting, and must be reapplied every six weeks or so.

, If you have a patch of ivy you want to preserve, but you'd like to prevent it from spreading, you can use mulch to keep it contained. Simply cover the border of the the ivy you want to keep with several inches (about 7 to 8 inches) of shredded or wood chip mulch. You will need to give this method some time; leave the mulch on the ivy for at least 2 seasons. You may need to add new mulch one or more times during a growing season.


Another option is to trim the ivy back to contain it. Use a weed eater or edging tool to cut the vines along the border.

"
Check the base of the tree for suckers from the tree.,
Cut the ivy two weeks later.,
Allow natural die-off.,
Keep an eye on your handiwork.",How to Kill Ivy Without Damaging a Tree," If there are, do not even consider spraying as the tree will take up any poisons you spray. If there are none, and the tree has brown bark, spray glyphosate on the ivy that sits on the tree trunk., The lapse in time permits the glyphosate action to work on the entire ivy. Cut the vines as close to the ground as possible and cut out a section to prevent rebonding. Brush the glyphosate directly onto the cuts.

, Be aware that this will take around 1 - 2 years for the stems above the cut. Trying to remove the ivy will cause a lot of dust inhalation, and can damage the tree if the ivy has clung to it for quite a while. Over time the dead ivy will wither off. Overall natural rotting of the ivy can take 3 - 10 years., If the ivy sprouts up again anywhere, deal with it immediately by pulling it off.

Cover the soil.,
Repeat tilling.",How to Kill Blackberries1," Place a covering around the area in which you plan to remove the blackberry plant. This can make clean up easier and minimize the risk of seeds or stems escaping and forming new plants.


Use trash bags or tarps to cover the area to till.;
, Using your hands or a pair of heavy-duty garden scissors to cut the stems of the blackberry plant. This will make it easier for you to remove the roots and source of life for the plant., Using the covering you used around the blackberry bush, bundle the stems together. Then dispose of the stems in your garbage or a place in which they are not exposed to the soil to prevent regrowth.Make sure to get every bit of stem off of the ground because a new bush can still grow even from a short cutting.Check with your community to inquire about local regulations on disposing of organic plant material.

, Once you’ve removed the stems, you can more easily access the root ball. Using a trowel or shovel, dig the surrounding soil until you expose the entire root ball.Make sure to dig around the root ball so that you don’t break it up and potentially release seeds or stems into the soil.Be aware that digging up the root ball will not kill the plant since some plant material may remain, but this does make tilling the soil much easier., Gently take the root ball out from the soil around which you’ve dug a hole. Not only can this ensure easier tilling, but can also remove a major source of rhizomes that can propagate the bush.However, keep in mind that blackberry plants do not form a tight root ball like some other plants and the roots can run a long way underground. Follow the roots to the ends and then carefully dig them up with a trowel.


Use gloves when you remove the root ball to minimize the risk of cutting yourself.
Dig further around the root ball if it doesn’t come out when you pull on it. This may allow you to get most bits of root in one movement.
Dispose of the root ball in the same way you did the stems.

, It’s important to till, or break up and turn over, the soil after removing the stems and root balls.This can help remove or starve any material, including rhizomes, which are also called rootstocks, that can propagate further plants.


Use a cultivator fork or deep spade to turn over and break up soil in small areas.You can purchase these at most home improvement and hardware stores.
Rent an engine-powered tiller for larger areas. You can rent (or buy) these at home improvement and hardware stores.Be sure that you’ve broken up and turned over your soil by examining it. The soil will often look darker if it’s come from under the surface.
If you do not want to till the soil, then you can also just mow over any shoots that do come up. This will weaken the plants and stop the shoots from coming up.

, Use a heavy layer of plastic to cover the soil and minimize the risk of more blackberries growing.Then cover the plastic with 4-5 inches of mulch to further deter growth., Follow up your removal and tilling with frequent care of your soil. Repeating your tilling efforts can minimize the number of plantlets and eventually kill all of your blackberries.Till once a week or any time you see plantlets. Eventually, the blackberry plants will die.

Identify suitable areas for manual removal.,
Remove leaves and vine growth.,
Pull up the roots thoroughly.,
Dispose all clippings and roots.,
Add mulch to deter regrowth.,
Remove the creeping charlie as it regrows.",How to Kill Creeping Charlie1," This works best in small areas covered with or affected by the plant. Areas with widespread creeping charlie will take a long time to manually remove, so you might consider sunlight deprivation or chemical treatment in these cases.


It is recommended you wear gloves for protection if you plan to pull the plant out by hand. Gloves can prevent blisters, friction burns, and callouses from forming during manual removal.
Creeping charlie is a common skin allergen that can cause itching or a rash from contact. Wearing gloves will prevent you from having an unexpected allergic response while weeding.;
, For plants that are especially thick, you should cut off the leaves and vines to make the roots more accessible. You can do this most easily with a few snips from a pair of pruning shears. Once the protective upper foliage is removed, you'll be able to target the roots in the ground.


Keep bits and pieces of creeping charlie collected together off to the side or put it in a bag for disposal later. Lost bits and pieces can reseed your plot with the plant.
You may want to avoid doing this on windy days. The wind might blow a stray leaf or vine somewhere else you don't want the plant growing.
It is not recommended you use a hoe to break up the soil or cut through the top layer of the plant. This can spread creeping charlie even further., In loose, loamy soil, you may find that the roots pull free with relatively little effort. However, in some cases, the roots may be very stubborn. Grasp the root by its topmost part and apply firm, steady pressure until the roots pull free.


You may need to use a rooting tool, which is shaped like a long, flat-tipped screwdriver, to assist in removing difficult plants or those with deep-sunk roots.
You should investigate the soil following the hand removal of roots. If you leave behind root pieces, the creeping charlie may return., The leaves and vines you have cut from the plants could serve to further seed creeping charlie, so be careful when disposing this plant. Avoid places like open compost piles where the wind might carry seeds or leaves back to your plot.


Using a thin tined rake can help you sift through dirt to find remaining creeping charlie plant debris. Even small pieces can contribute to regrowth.
Throwing the creeping charlie away in the garbage should be sufficient, but you could also dispose of trimmings by burning them. Be sure you have a fire permit before burning, if your region requires one., After you've weeded out the creeping, you can help prevent regrowth by adding mulch, like wood chips, over the area the plant was growing. Use a regular cover of 2 - 3 in (5 - 7.6 cm) of your mulch for the best effect., Getting the whole root system and removing every seed-carrying leaf can be a tall order. It's likely you'll miss a few and see the plant return. Every time you see the scalloped leaves of creeping charlie reappear, pull it out. Eventually it should stop coming back.


You should see the creeping charlie diminish after each weeding, but it can take up to a year or longer before the plant is fully removed."

Place an herbicide in the soil.,
Apply an herbicide directly on the plant.,
Treat the basal bark.,
Spray the dormant stems and leaves.,
Hire a landscape professional.",How to Kill Blackberries2," In areas not used to grow other crops, you can apply tebuthiuron (Spike) to your soil. This can kill blackberry bushes, but may also harm other surrounding vegetation.Place tebuthiuron pellets to the base of blackberry plants to control their growth long-term.Be aware that tebuthiuron is toxic not only to vegetation, but can also be to mammals, too.It is also water soluble, so it can easily contaminate ground water.
Wear protective clothing when you apply tebuthiuron to minimize your exposure to the pesticide.Make sure to check and see if it is legal to use tebuthiuron where you live. It has been banned in Europe since 2002 because if its toxicity.

, One of the most effective ways to kill blackberries is by applying an herbicide directly to the plant while it is actively growing. This allows it to get into the plant’s structure and kill rhizomes, thus deterring regrowth.Use foliar-based herbicides, which you apply to the part of the plant visible above the ground, in early summer or at the start of the growing season when their tissue is rapidly expanding.Spray herbicides such as glyphosate, dicamba, or triclopyr on the blackberry bush.You can purchase these at many home improvement and hardware stores.
Be careful when mixing and applying these chemicals because they can kill other plants. Make sure to avoid contact with your skin as well.

, Since the bark at the base of the bush helps transport the nutrients needed for the plant to survive, treat it with an herbicide. This can help kill the bush at any time of year and also minimize contact with chemicals.Use a concentrated form of triclopyr to treat the basal bark.Spray the solution directly at base of the bush directly on the bark.Cover about 6-12 inches of the basal bark with spray, depending on how large the plant is.Make sure to not oversaturate the bark with the solution, which can cause toxic runoff., An alternative way to administer triclopyr is to spray the dormant stems and leaves of your blackberry bush. This can also kill the plant while minimizing your contact with the chemical.Use this solution only in the fall and winter when the plant stem and leaves are dormant.Spray the plant until it is thoroughly wet, again avoiding oversaturation that can cause toxic runoff., If your blackberry bush growth is especially pernicious, consider hiring a landscape professional. He can help you assess and deal with the problem without killing off all of your other vegetation.Discuss your concerns with the landscaper and ask about how to manage the situation more effectively after his treatment.
The Landscape Contractors Association can help you find a qualified landscape professional in your local area.

Starve the planted of sunlight.,
Cover the area affected with creeping charlie.,
Protect your light cover from disturbance.,
Wait until the plant dies.,
Remove the plant and clear the area of remains.",How to Kill Creeping Charlie2," Creeping Charlie, like other plants, needs light for growth. However, this plant can survive even in low level light, like strong shade. Because of this, if you intend to use this method, the light must be completely blocked to the plant., There are many items you could use for this purpose. For example, you could lay down a large piece of cardboard, a heavy drop-cloth, or a tarp over top the plant for maximum light blockage.


When creeping charlie is growing among plants you want to keep, you might consider cutting a circular hole around in a heavy cloth or tarp. This way you can block light to the creeping charlie around the wanted plant without denying it of light.
Any surrounding plants that are deprived of light will die along with the creeping charlie. This likely means you'll need to reseed your plot later., Stray wind, animals, or other environmental factors can cause your light cover to shift in position. Stabilize your light cover by heaping some soil, rocks, or some other kind of weight on top of it to hold it in place.


To ensure the light is completely blocked, you should make sure that the cardboard is large enough to cover at least six inches beyond any protruding stems., In many cases, a week of light deprivation will cause the creeping charlie to wither and die, though depending on soil richness and other factors this can take longer. Peek under your light cover periodically to check whether or not the creeping charlie has died.


When you notice that all parts of the creeping charlie are withered, shriveled, and lacking in green color, the plant should be dead., There is a risk of creeping charlie reseeding even after the plant has died. In order to prevent regrowth, you should gather up all of its plant matter, including roots, and dispose of it by throwing it away or burning.


Be sure you wear gloves when handling or removing creeping charlie directly. Many people are allergic to this plant.Many places require you to request a burning permit to prevent false fire alarms. Be sure you have a burning permit before attempting to dispose this plant with fire.

Select a suitable herbicide to treat the creeping charlie.,
Treat the plant with herbicides in fall.,
Re-treat the creeping charlie in spring, if necessary.Treating creeping charlie in the spring with herbicide is a useful follow-up to fall treatments, though spring applications won't be as effective.,
Apply annual treatments for best results.",How to Kill Creeping Charlie3," There are many herbicides you might use, though you should be aware this plant is resistant to many common treatments. Regular herbicides used for dandelion control won't likely be strong enough to kill creeping charlie.


Three way herbicides, often called ""trimec herbicides,"" should be prioritized, as the special compounds in these are effective at eliminating creeping charlie.Some herbicides may affect other plants around the creeping charlie. You should consult the label of your herbicide to understand the full effects before administering it.
Some herbicides leave behind residue for a period of time after its application that can be harmful to children or animals. In these cases, you should block off the area and/or keep an eye around children and pets until the next rainfall or until your label indicates the herbicide has diminished to safe levels.

, This is the ideal time for chemical treatment of creeping charlie. At this time of year, the plant begins storing nutrient in the stem and root system for the winter. This means your herbicide treatment will have a greater effect on the plant.When using a herbicidal treatment, more is not always better. Follow the directions that came with your herbicide for best results.

, A follow-up spring application is best suited to severe or especially stubborn cases., If you have a plot that is susceptible to creeping charlie, or if this plant is common in your area, even if you kill or remove it completely it'll likely spring up again from another source. In this situation, you'll likely have to apply herbicide yearly to your lawn to ensure the plant doesn't come back.


You can also make your lawn less hospitable for creeping charlie by creating a bright sunlight environment by pruning shade casting branches.
A thick cover of grass can also make your lawn less hospitable for creeping charlie. By planting grass that grows well in shade, it's less likely creeping charlie will pop up in shady areas that are more susceptible to the plant."

Remove any loose bark.,
Put on safety gear.,
Make a cut around the circumference of the tree.,
Make a second cut around the circumference of the tree.,
Apply herbicide.,
Wait.",How to Kill a Tree1," Girdling is a method for killing a tree by interrupting the flow of sap between the roots and crown of the tree. You can girdle a tree with or without the use of herbicides to speed the process along. Girdling is the easiest and most popular method for killing a tree without chemicals when no herbicides are used, but the tree will take many months to die from the process. Start by pulling away any loose bark that gives you easier access to the trunk.You should clear the bark in a band approximately four or five inches wide.


The height where you girdle the tree is flexible, so choose a level at which you’re comfortable working around the trunk and making cuts.;
, You have a wide variety of choices when it comes to how you make the cuts. You can use a chainsaw, an axe, a hatchet, or even a wood chisel for very thin-barked trees.Take the proper safety precautions for the cutting tool you use, including protective eyewear.

, The depth of the cut you need to make depends on the thickness of the tree. For very thin trees, you can make the cut around 1/2” into the wood whereas large, sturdy trees require a depth of 1-1.5” Try to make the band as level as possible as you move around the tree.

, To girdle the tree effectively, you will need a second band. The distance apart between the two bands should be roughly 2-4”. Make the second cut to the same depth as the first cut.


If you’re using an axe or a hatchet where it’s more difficult to make exact horizontal cuts, then you can cut a groove into the tree instead. To make the groove, make one downward-angled cut followed by one upward-angled cut where the two cuts meet in the middle. For small trees, this groove around the circumferences can be as small as 2” wide, whereas the groove should be roughly 6-8” wide on large trees. Make the groove to the same depth as you would the two bands.

, If you choose to use herbicide, you’ll want to apply it to the cuts in the tree within five or ten minutes of making them before the sections begin to dry out and harden.Adding herbicide to the girdling can kill the tree in as little as six weeks whereas refraining from the chemical usage can take many months.Commonly available, effective herbicides include glyphosate (Roundup or Killzall) and triclopyr (Garlon or Brush B Gon).Mix the herbicide appropriately according to the directions on your specific brand and apply to the cuts with a spray bottle.You should definitely mix the herbicide ahead of time in order to apply it to the girdling cuts as quickly as possible.

, Now that you’ve interrupted the flow of sap in the tree and possibly introduced herbicide to the root system, you simply have to wait for the tree to die.

Get an axe or a hatchet.,
Mix the herbicide in a spray bottle.,
Make a downward cut into the tree trunk.,
Spray herbicide into the cut.,
Repeat the downward cuts as directed.,
Keep adding herbicide to each cut.",How to Kill a Tree2," If you do plan to use herbicide on the tree, then the hack and squirt method can be just as effective as the girdling method with even less work involved. The hack and squirt method uses precise chops to coat with herbicide instead of an entire band around the whole tree. Start by getting an axe or a hatchet., The hack and squirt method requires fewer cuts than girdling, but you will still use the same herbicides. Mix the herbicide in a spray bottle before you begin cutting.


Commonly available, effective herbicides include glyphosate (Roundup or Killzall) and triclopyr (Garlon or Brush B Gon)., Using the axe or hatchet, make a downward cut into the trunk of the tree roughly 2” long. The cut needs to be deep enough to get into the lighter-colored sapwood, so you can effectively introduce the herbicide.

, Once you have made the cut, pull the head of the axe or hatchet to the edge of the cut rather than out completely. Then use the spray bottle to spray the herbicide down the top side of the hatchet, allowing it run down into the deep sapwood portion of the cut.Make sure you spray in the herbicide immediately before the softer wood in the cut has a chance to start drying out and hardening.
Your specific brand of herbicide will instruct you regarding how much herbicide to spray into each cut, but the amount is generally 1-2 milliliters.
Various specially made injectors are also available for this purpose if you need to treat several trees.

, Your specific brand of herbicide will have directions for how many cuts you need to make based on the circumference of the tree. Most trees will require additional cuts with the spacing 1-3” apart from edge to edge.

, For each cut in the trunk that your brand of herbicide suggests, you want to add the same amount of herbicide. Continue using the injector or the flat side of the axe or hatchet to spray the herbicide into the cuts until you’ve gotten each one.

Take all of the proper safety precautions.,
Mix the herbicide.,
Cut down the tree.,
Apply a coating of the herbicide to the top of the remaining trunk.",How to Kill a Tree3," Unlike the other methods that require leaving the tree standing, this method involves cutting the tree down, making it the best method for trees blocking a view or any other reason where you want the tree gone immediately. Since you will have to cut the tree down, start by taking every precaution involved with operating the chainsaw and keeping the area where the tree will fall secured.

, As with the other herbicidal methods, you will need to coat the cuts with glyphosate or triclopyr as soon as the tree has been cut down. You should mix the herbicide in a spray bottle prior to cutting down the tree.

, For smaller trees, the tree’s drop zone is much shallower and easier to work with, but if you’re dealing with a larger tree, you will need to take more precautions in cutting it down. For a full explanation of how to cut down the tree safely, check How to Fell a Tree.


For large trees, consider hiring a professional to cut down the tree for you.

, Many people don’t realize that cutting down a tree alone does not kill the root system. Often, the root system will send up new sprouts instead. By applying a coating of herbicide to the exposed sapwood in the trunk, you can treat the root system and keep it as well.For smaller trees, you can simply coat the entire cross section of the trunk. For large trees, the hardened middle section of the tree will not absorb any herbicide, so you can simply coat a band of the herbicide around the outermost ring where you can still see the lighter-colored sapwood."

Treat with a strong herbicide.,
Strip the Bermuda grass and cover the area with cardboard.,
Try landscaping fabric.,
Bake the Bermuda grass.,
Dig up the Bermuda grass by hand.",How to Kill Bermuda Grass," A popular option is to use glyphosate to impede the spread of Bermuda grass and eventually kill off the grass in patches. The product is available in a spray, making it easy to coat an entire section of the lawn with relative ease. Available in many home and garden shops, the process will likely require several treatments, removing portions of the dying grass between each treatment.;
, Apply a layer or 2 of mulch on top of the cardboard. This helps to prevent the root system for the grass from regenerating and will over a period of a few months kill any remaining roots.

, After stripping the Bermuda grass from the area, put down the fabric and cut small holes to allow planting of shrubs or other plants. The fabric is dense enough to prevent any remaining roots from receiving sunlight and nutrients while also making it possible to go ahead with the permanent landscaping.

, After trimming the grass as close to the soil as possible, cover with clear plastic. The intense heat will kill the remaining grass and part of the root system. This approach is particularly effective in areas that experience high temperatures for extended periods of time, and the patch of grass is not covered with shade during the hottest part of the day.

, While labor intensive, this approach minimizes the amount of roots left in the soil. Water the area to loosen the soil, then pull the grass out by the roots. After cleaning a patch, turn 1 or 2 layers of soil over and use the hands to filter the loose dirt and capture any remaining root fragments.

Make sure that it is certified organic.,
Smell the compost.It may sound odd, but checking the odor is an important part of determining the compost's quality.,
Examine the compost with your hands.,
Avoid composts with garbage.,
Avoid composts laced with bio-solids.Sewage sludge is often marketed as an organic soil amendment because it does contain nitrogen and other nutrients that are beneficial to plants.,
Look for diversity.,
Do not write off composts that contain insects.",How to Buy Organic Compost1," Federal law requires that products labeled as ""organic"" must pass USDA organic standards, but untrustworthy sellers may attempt to pass off non-organic compost as organic, especially if they are a small seller. To avoid this, look for bags of compost that are marked with the USDA Organic seal. These products will be labeled either ""100% organic"" or ""organic."" Products labeled as simply ""organic"" contain less than 100 percent organic materials but at least 95 percent.;
, Even though composts are made from decaying materials, a finished compost should smell decent. It should not smell like garbage or like ammonia. If it does, there is a good chance that the composting process has not been completed and that it will not do your plants sufficient good.

, Another simple yet important means of determining a compost's quality is by physically examining it. Compost should appear dark, and when felt with your hands, it should be light and fluffy. The material should also be consistent the entire way through. If you can still determine what the raw materials are simply by looking at it, the composting process is not complete.

, If, upon examination, you see non-biodegradable materials littered in the compost like plastic or glass, do not use it. These materials do not offer any nutritional benefit to your plants, and oftentimes, they may have been produced using various chemicals.

, For the most part, though, this sludge is also full of pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, industrial waste, and chemicals that disrupt hormones. Compost containing biosolids should generally be avoided.

, Avoid composts that only contain one type of organic matter. Instead, gravitate toward composts made from many organic sources, including leaves, grass clippings, food scraps, plant scraps, and manure. The greater the variety, the bigger the range of nutritional benefits.


You should not, however, buy composts made from a variety of wood-based products, like sawdust or bark chips. These composts are not nutritious at all and may contain toxins from the wood.

, While you do not want composts crawling with damaging pests like aphids, composts that contain earthworms or other waste-consuming insects can actually be beneficial. By selecting a compost with insects in it, you can be assured that the compost is nutritious enough to support life.

Contact organic farmers.,
Go to the municipality.,
Check out the supply at a garden center.,
Use caution when buying from a big box store.,
Order online or by phone from compost manufacturers.You can purchase organic compost directly from the manufacturer by locating the manufacturer’s contact information.",How to Buy Organic Compost2," Farming often produces a good amount of biodegradable waste in the form of decayed crops and grass, and many farmers use these materials to create and sell compost. Buying from organic farmers is the only way to guarantee a completely organic product, however, since compost from other farms will likely contain trace amounts of pesticide residue from grass clippings and leaves. These pesticides will like break down during decomposition, creating a mostly organic product, but the compost will not be 100 percent organic unless it comes from an organic farm.

, Many municipalities sell compost and other farming materials, especially if those municipalities include agricultural regions. Contact your municipality or nearby municipalities to find out if they sell organic compost and how you can obtain it.

, Compost is a common soil amendment, and most garden centers will carry some even if the store is small. As time passes, the interest in organic farming and gardening continues to grow, organic composts are found more easily at a range of garden supply stores. You can further increase your likelihood of success by going to an organic garden center, though, since organic garden centers specialize in carrying organic products.

, You can find high quality, certified organic composts at big box or chain retailers, but your likelihood of running across low quality composts is increased at a big box store. Many of these products are poorly labeled and tightly sealed, making it difficult to check the content and quality prior to purchase. If you do purchase organic compost from a major store, make sure that you check the quality once you bring it home. Do not use it if it appears poorly made., If buying from a manufacturer, buying in bulk rather than by bag is generally more cost effective. Moreover, since you cannot check the quality in person before buying the compost, you should only buy from reliable manufacturers and you should also check the quality of the compost once it is delivered.

Expect some natural fruit thinning.,
Assess the level of water provided to the citrus tree.,
See if the tree has been frost affected.,
Check the nutrient levels of your citrus tree.,
Look for a mite if you have fruit discoloration problems.",How to Troubleshoot Citrus Fruit Failure," Citrus fruit that is less than 2.5cm/1 inch in diameter is often in abundance and the tree cannot carry all these fruits to maturity. Some of these will fall naturally as part of a thinning out.,


Citrus trees that are not watered adequately have a tendency to drop their fruit prematurely. The next season, be sure to mulch adequately around the tree to improve water retention and keep an eye on its need for more water.
Equally, over-watering can force fruit dropping.

, A citrus tree subjected to frosts as the fruit develops is more likely to drop the fruit.

, A lack of potash is a common cause of citrus trees dropping fruit before it is ready to eat. Always prefer a specialized citrus fertilizer over a more general one as the nutrient balance will be right for the tree.

, The citrus rust mite can cause discolored portions on citrus fruit; the mite is best squashed rather than sprayed as you will also lose beneficial life on the tree. And the fruit still tastes just fine and is not damaged by this mite."

Understand raspberries.,
Prepare your raspberry patch for the growing season.,
Eliminate damaged areas.,
Prune after harvesting too.,
Remove the pruned canes.,
Treat different raspberry varieties differently.,
Recognize signs of poor pruning.",How to Prune Red Raspberries," Knowing how raspberries grow and produce fruit may help you yield a more plentiful crop each year. For most varieties, the canes tend to produce on an every-other-year schedule. In its first year, the cane will focus on growing. The second year is when the mature cane yields fruit. So, if your version of pruning is to mow everything down to a few inches off the ground every fall, you could be hurting, not helping, your berry production. After the cane produces fruit, the cane dies. The plant produces a new cane for every cane that dies.;
, To help make sure you get a good crop of raspberries, inspect the patch in the spring--late March or early April--for most areas. Since all cane in the patch compete for food and light, thinning out raspberry patches by removing the dead and weak canes will allow the other canes to grow strong and give them enough space to produce a bountiful crop.

, Prune any canes that are dead or damaged to the ground. Some canes will have tips that deaden over the winter. Trim these canes back to the green growth. Do not worry about cutting out too many. Raspberries flourish when the canes are about 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart.

, When the fruit crop is done, pull out your trimmers and head to the raspberry patch. Cut out the canes that have just finished producing. Leave the other canes, especially for everbearing varieties that will produce fruit on those canes in the fall.

, Do not leave the pruned canes in the raspberry patch as this could encourage disease. Instead, take the waste canes to the trash, burn pile or compost pile.

, Red raspberries need different pruning care and attention than black or yellow raspberries. You will also need to consider if the variety of red raspberry you have is a spring bearer or an ever bearer, which produces 2 crops per year: one in the spring and one in the fall.

, Aside from an obvious unkempt appearance, there are a few other ways to tell if you need to alter your raspberry pruning technique. If your canes produce no or very little fruit or if the berry size of your crop is small, you need to thin more canes out of the patch. Further pruning is also necessary if you have a hard time harvesting your berries. Your patch needs more attention too, if it seems to be plagued by disease.

Enjoy ripe watermelons in the summer.",How to Save Watermelon Seeds for Planting," They generally ripen 35 to 45 days after the plant blooms.When the watermelon is ripe, the curly tendril on the vine will dry up and turn brown and the white spot on the bottom of the watermelon will turn yellow. The watermelon will also lose its shine and become dull-looking.;
, These are all indications of diseases like bacterial wilt and anthracnose.The seeds could be infected, which means they will produce diseased plants.

, Watermelons cross pollinate, so seeds collected from a watermelon that was cross-pollinated with a different cultivar may produce watermelons that do not have the desired characteristics.


While you can use seeds that have been collected from a watermelon that has been purchased from a store or local vendor, there is no way to tell from the watermelon whether or not it has been cross pollinated. So, the watermelons that grow from the seeds may be different from the watermelon you bought., Wash the soil off the watermelon with clean water before cutting it open.


Seeds can be collected when the watermelon is eaten or you can cut the watermelon open and pick the seeds out by hand.

, Stir the seeds around with a spoon to wash off the pulp. Let them sit in the water at room temperature for two to three days, stirring them gently once each day., Leave any seeds at the bottom in the container.

, This will give the seeds a good rinse.

, Spread the seeds out on several layers of paper towel or newspaper and let them dry at room temperature.


Dry them in an area that is slightly warmer than room temperature and has good air circulation, like the top of your refrigerator.
Do not expose the seeds to direct sunlight.

, A plastic container with a lid that seals, a plastic sandwich or storage bag with a zipper seal or a clean glass jar with a lid that screws down tight will work., Put the container in the refrigerator to keep them cool and dormant.


The seeds can be stored for up to five years.

, Do this two to four weeks before the last expected frost.

, The soil temperatures should rise above 65 °F (18 °C)., Once the seeds are planted in the garden in the spring, you should expect ripe watermelons in the summer every year."

Plant plenty of strongly scented herbs and plants, both in your garden and nearby.",How to Kill Bugs in Herb Gardens1," You may be planting it near other edible plants. Although this is beneficial to creating a productive garden, different bugs are attracted to different plants, so you may need to defend your herbs from more pests.;
, Not all bugs are bad. Many flying creatures eat bugs and make it less likely that they will infest your plants.


Plant dill, fennel, yarrow, Queen Anne's Lace and golden marguerite to attract ladybugs. Ladybugs feed on aphids, some of the worst pests in a garden.
Plant parsley, buckwheat, sweet alyssum, cosmos and sunflowers to attract parasitic wasps. These insects feed on aphids and leaf hoppers.

, Many of these plants are already included in herb gardens, such as mint, chives, basil, yarrow and catnip. Also include garlic and onions nearby, as non-bug pests, like rabbits, hate these strong scents.

, Keeping the area healthy and clean will allow you to spot bugs more easily. It will also attract fewer bugs.

, It may take as little as 1 night for the bugs to produce holes and begin to change the color of the leaves. Some plants respond by growing slowly and producing fewer leaves.

Keep your all-natural insecticide and strong-smelling water on hand for 1 to 2 weeks.",How to Kill Bugs in Herb Gardens3," This mixture is especially useful for soft-bodied insects, such as aphids, caterpillars and parsley worms. The soap is absorbed by the pest and then causes dehydration and death.


Mix 1 to 2 tbs. (15 to 30 ml) of plant-based soap with 1 qt. (0.95 l) of water in a spray bottle. Many people use Dr. Bronner's Liquid Castille Soap, a product made with olive oil. Shake the mixture up and spray it regularly at any sign of bugs.

, Insects and other pests are deterred by strong smelling plants, herbs and spices.


Find a mixture of plants like garlic, rhubarb, mint, onions, cayenne, ginger and horseradish. Cut them up into large pieces and place them in a pot or saucepan. Cover them with water and boil. Turn off the heat and allow the ""tea"" to sit overnight. Strain the liquid away and pour it into your natural insecticide bottle.
Create a caffeine mixture, if you are having a problem with aphids. Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of yarrow, lavender and/or catnip with 2 tbs. (10 g) of used coffee grounds and 2 cups (473 ml) of water. Allow the mixture to sit overnight. Strain the liquid and pour into a spray bottle.

Determine the tree variety; each must be thinned differently.,
Thin the bottom seven feet of the tree by walking around and it on foot.,
Use a picking ladder to thin the top of the trees.,
Thin the inside of tree.,
Check the tree.,
Next tree!

",How to Thin Mandarin Trees," The two main varieties are Imperial and Murcott. Imperials have thin, waxy leaves and soft, dark green fruit. The fruit hangs mostly inside the tree, hidden from the sun, draped down off the branches in big patches. Murcotts can be identified by an abundance of thorns, dense, hard fruit in large patches, and high exposure of fruits to sunlight.;
, Mark the spot which you begin, and circle around the tree, moving clockwise if you are right-handed, and counter-clockwise if you are left-handed. Murcott fruits burn easily and grow together in thick patches of doubles, triples, and quadruples; leave no doubles or triples and space each fruit a fist apart minimum. remove external fruits on the outside six inches for the bottom sixty centimeters, and the outer twelve inches above that. Keep the larger and unmarked fruits. Imperials have more smalls, which must be removed, and the internal fruit is least valuable, so all outside fruit must be left on and spaced properly. Any sunburned fruits can also be removed. Moving once around the tree is sufficient.

, Throw the ladder inside the tree, hooking the ladder over branches if necessary to reach the inside and top of the tree. Remove all fruit off the top twelve inches of a Murcott. Simply space the Imperials and remove the smalls.

, Climb inside the tree, up the branches, reaching all the remaining fruits hiding or otherwise out of reach.

, Go around the tree once more to check your work. Look for any remaining spacing, sizing, or quality issues and correct them. Examine the tree from different distances, looking at the bottom external branches, inside and under the branches, and outside the top.

Prune at the right time.,
Cut the tree to size after planting.,
Create a scaffold whorl.,
Create more scaffold whorls in the third year.,
Keep pruning the trunk.,
Continue with this pattern until the tree has reached your desired height.",How to Prune Plum Trees1," You can prune the tree while it is dormant in winter or in summer. Dormant pruning is pruning the tree during the late winter, when no new growth is happening and the tree doesn't have any leaves. Pruning while the tree is dormant encourages vibrant growth come spring, and it's less likely to cause damage to the tree than summer pruning. Summer pruning can be used to slow the growth of a tree that is getting too big and to thin new growth that is overcrowding.









Prune as late in the winter as possible before new growth occurs, since heavy freezes after pruning could damage the tree.
Save some pruning for the summer. Pruning too much in late winter can lead to vegetative overgrowth and reduced fruit production.;
, It's important to prune a young tree during its first dormant season to encourage good growth and a suitable shape. As soon as possible after planting, cut it down so that it's only about 30 inches (76.2 cm) high.Make the cut just above a bud.









New growth will occur where you make each cut.
Use loppers to make clean, sharp cuts. Gouges and jagged edges leave the tree vulnerable to pests and disease.
After this first pruning, you might wish to paint the tree with white latex paint to keep it from getting sunburned and protect it from pests.

, Choose four branches evenly spaced around the tree to serve as the tree's ""scaffold whorl."" These branches provide structure and keep the tree's shape balanced. Cut each of the four branches back so that each one has just 1 or 2 buds. Make the cuts just above the buds. Cut the remaining side shoots and branches flush against the trunk.









For the first two years of the tree's life, prune only during the dormant season and keep the scaffold whorl cut back to 10 inches (25.4 cm).

, By year 3, the tree will have produced another set of strong lateral shoots. Create more sets of scaffold whorls that are evenly spaced around the tree. Cut the whorls closer to the top of the tree back to 1 bud, and leave the whorls closer to the bottom 2 buds. The plum tree should take on a vase or Christmas-tree shape, which allows sunlight to filter through and encourage healthy growth.







, Cut back the trunk by a foot or two each year to control the height of the tree and encourage bushy growth toward the bottom. Prune it so that a bud is left at the tip.








, For the first 3-5 years of the tree's life, continue creating new scaffold whorls and cutting back the trunk during the tree's dormant period. When you're happy with the tree's height, move on to pruning techniques suitable for older trees.

Prune dead and diseased branches.,
Prune branches that don't bear fruit.,
Cut back the suckers.,
Cut branches that cross over other branches.,
Prune in the summer to discourage growth.",How to Prune Plum Trees2," Branches that are dead or diseased should be cut away each year so that the tree can stop wasting energy on them. Use a tree saw or loppers to cut the branches flush with the tree trunk. Be sure to make clean cuts so that the tree isn't vulnerable to further disease.









If larger branches have developed a collar, cut just outside the collar, a few inches from the trunk.
Dead and diseased branches can be removed any time of year, since taking them off won't affect the growth of the tree.

, If you notice a branch or two that don't seem to be producing fruit, you may want to remove them. Make your cut flush with the tree's trunk, rather than just cutting back to a bud, since new growth on the same branch isn't likely to produce different results.








, Suckers are new shoots that come up from the root system around the base of the tree. Cut them away so that the tree's energy is directed into the main tree trunk and won't get sapped by the suckers. Cut the suckers all the way to the ground using loppers.







, Each season, the tree is likely to produce new branches that cross over existing branches. It's important to prune the tree carefully so that no crossover branches remain. Crossover branches crowd the tree and prevent sunlight from filtering through the branches. They also inhibit air flow and can leave the tree vulnerable to disease and pests.








, If your plum tree is getting too big for your yard, you can prune in the summer to slow down its growth. Whereas dormant pruning encourages vibrant spring growth, summer pruning cuts away the tree's energy and limits growth for the season.









If you prune in the summer, be careful not to cut away too much of the tree.
Pruning too late in the summer can make the tree vulnerable to cold winter temperatures. In the US, don't prune after July to reduce the risk of frost damage to new growth.
Beware that summer pruning can cause the tree to put its energy into leaf growth rather than fruit production.

The terms ‘primocane’ and ‘floricane’ refer to two different types of canes that the raspberry bramble produces. Primocanes are the canes that grow during the first year while floricanes are the second-year canes. Additionally, fall-bearing plants bear fruit in the fall and may have a second season in early summer, while summer-bearing plants fruit only in the summer.Because of their different growth patterns, they require different pruning measures in order to be effective.
Fall-bearing raspberries will bear fruit both primocanes and floricanes, while summer-bearing raspberries will only bear fruit on floricanes.;
, Sometimes also called everbearing raspberries, fall-bearing raspberries require much more pruning than summer-bearing raspberries. Fall-bearing raspberries contain three separate types of canes: primocanes, floricanes, and non-fruiting suckers.


Primocanes are green and flexible shoots that grow directly from the ground; instead of branches, they may have small buds attached directly to the cane.
Floricanes are tall, thick branches that have a darker brown bark on their stems. Floricanes have smaller lateral shoots attached at the sides where the fruit will grow.
Non-fruiting suckers are small, spindly canes that are typically ½ the size and width of primocanes and floricanes. As the name suggests, non-fruiting suckers don’t produce any fruit, and serve no productive purpose.Fall-bearing raspberries are typically red and yellow varieties, although they may also be purple or black.
Fall-bearing raspberries may not produce twice a year, especially if they are older plants that have never been pruned.

, Although technically both fall and summer bearing raspberries fruit in the summer, summer-bearing raspberries only bear fruit in the summer, and they only bear fruit on floricanes. When pruning summer-bearing varieties, you will need to allow the primocanes to grow and become floricanes in order to produce fruit.Summer-bearing raspberries include some red varieties, as well as most of the purple and black varieties of raspberries.
When cut open, floricanes will be brown and dead on the inside. They tend to be grayish/tan.

, Raspberries of both summer and fall bearing varieties should be pruned in the winter. This is because the berry canes are fully dormant during this time, so any pruning will stimulate growth, rather than damaging the current growth pattern. Raspberries can be pruned any time between November and March. Some horticulturists prefer pruning around February or March, because the root system has had time to store more carbohydrates, leading to a better harvest.

, For pruning, you’ll need a good set of gardening shears or loppers, a pair of gardening gloves, and safety goggles. Raspberry brambles tend to be thorny, or at least have pointed branches, making safety a priority while pruning.

, The easiest way to prune fall-bearing raspberries is to cut everything down to ground level in spring.Instead of having a summer harvest, you will only have one harvest in the fall. This fall harvest may produce higher quality raspberries., If you would like both a fall and summer harvest, do not cut down all of your canes. Instead, you should thin out the canes so that there are about four or five primocanes per foot. Raspberry bushes need lots of space to spread out and grow, so having too many canes will restrict growth and overall harvest. Cut the extra canes at ground level, and discard them when done., Floricanes should be cut down every second year, after they have produced a crop. This is because they will not produce another crop. Use your shears to cut them to the ground. Remove them in the summer after you harvested the berries and before the fall crop has come in., Non-fruiting suckers are small, thin, short canes that take up space in the raspberry bramble. Because they don’t bear fruit and use up valuable space, they should all be removed. Use your shears to cut them at the ground, leaving none of the cane above ground. Don’t pull them out from the ground, as this will pull up the root system of the healthy primocanes, thereby killing your raspberry bush.

, These one-year branches would have produced fruit in the fall. Dead or sickly primocanes will be gray or black-ish in color, and when broken in half, won’t contain any green wood in the center. They will appear dry, thin, and brittle.

Do not leave old canes in your raspberry patch, as they carry disease that could contaminate your new fruiting crop., Although you don’t have to prune the tips of the primocanes, it may make it easier to harvest them later if the canes are particularly tall. It might also encourage a larger crop. Use your shears to cut about six or twelve inches off of the tips.Do not remove more than 25% of any one primocane. Doing so will significantly reduce the overall harvest.


This practice of cutting the tips off is also known as ‘pinching’.
A good time to do this is in July. This will delay the harvest slightly to avoid the heat of summer.
This is not recommended in the north-eastern United States because it may leave the plants open to winter injury., Summer-bearing raspberries only bear fruit on floricanes, which means that you need to let the canes grow for two years to produce fruit. Generally, you will prune floricanes to the ground after they have fruited. Allow primocanes to grow so that they will develop into floricanes and fruit in the second year. If there are too many primocanes, however, you may need to suppress them by thinning out their crop.


Primocanes are often pruned in late spring while floricanes will be cut down after they have fruited or during the winter.
Do not suppress primocanes until the plant is three years old. Thinning the primocanes too much may reduce the yield of your harvest., Floricanes die off after a single harvest, so leaving them will do you no good. Once they have produced a crop in the second year, use your shears to cut them at ground-level, and then toss out the branches when you’re done.


You can also cut out non-fruiting suckers.

, When your raspberry plant begins growing canes again, you may need to thin them to create a bigger crop. Too many canes will restrict the growing of each individual cane, limiting the total number of berries and the size of berries it will produce. Remove canes so that each cane is 9-inches from the next, keeping only the biggest, healthiest canes in the process.


When pruning in late spring, you should leave four or five primocanes per foot, and let these grow into floricanes in the next year.
Some people will prune the first set of emerging primocanes completely in late spring. Primocanes that emerge later are allowed to grow to produce fruit in the second year. This method should be skipped every third or fourth year, and it is not recommended for black raspberries., Pinching the canes in the process of cutting off a small amount of the tip, to stimulate more growth. Because your raspberries grow from the ground up each year, they likely won’t need to be pinched or pruned - they don’t have time to grow very large. However, if they become particularly tall, you can cut down 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) from the tips of the canes., Raspberries need plenty of sunlight to grow a good harvest; to provide them with this, you can trellis them post-pruning. Use a ‘T’ shaped trellis with two parallel wires for a single row of raspberries. A 'T' shaped trellis is made by putting two t-shaped boards opposite each other. A piece of wire is strung from one arm of the 'T' to the arm opposite it, on both sides. This creates a row down the center for the berries to be planted in.


Each row should be no wider than 2-feet wide.

, A row of raspberries will grow between two parallel trellis wires. Each cane from the plant should be tied to the wire, with 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) of spacing between canes. As a result, you will switch sides with the wires - one cane on the left wire, the next cane on the right wire, back and forth down the trellis. This will create a ‘V’ shape with all the canes, when viewed from one end of the trellis. Doing so allows for sunlight to reach the entire stalk of the cane, increasing the overall fruit production.

, Bend each cane so that it touches the trellis wire on one side. Use a small piece of twine, a twist-tie, or another tying instrument to secure the cane to the wire. Don’t tie it too tight - only enough so that the wind can’t move it out of place, and so that the center of the cane is fully exposed to sunlight."

Thin fruit by plucking it off to produce larger fruit and to allow the canopy to grow in young trees.",How to Prune a Lemon Tree," Lemon trees are evergreen trees that do not demonstrate a true dormancy, such as the loss of leaves. However, the growth and metabolism of the trees slow down after the fruit harvest. Lemon trees in cooler climates show slower activity just before the rapid spring growth. Pruning should occur during this period of dormancy or right when the new spring growth appears.;
,,,, Lemon trees are made by grafting normal-sized fruit-bearing branches on smaller tree stock (for dwarf trees) or more hardy stock. Suckers are shoots from the rootstock that will reduce fruit yield and adversely affect the health of the lemon tree. They often surpass the height of the main plant in a couple of months if left unchecked, ""sucking"" the nutrients from the bearing part of the tree.


Suckers that are green and newly formed can be gently broken off at the base.
Suckers with woody stems should be cut with pruning shears flush with the trunk of the lemon tree.

, This will also depend on the type of lemon tree that you have. A small potted lemon tree may produce better with and open look, whereas some people may want a bushier plant.


Traditional lemon pruning results in a tree that is bigger at the bottom than the top. This allows for equal sunlight to all parts of the tree.

, If the tree has more branches on one side, remove some on the heavier side until the tree balances out.

,,,, This will force the branches to grow thicker and sturdier. Over the next several growing seasons, concentrate on the main branches that you have chosen, cut them back as needed, and allow secondary branches to grow out from them. Cut back anything that is not strong or that blocks the light from entering the tree.

, Trees should not be allowed to bear fruit until they are mature, which is between 3 and 4 years old.

Branches over four years may have a smaller crop. You must prune the bushes so that they provide enough new growth for blueberry production next year.;
, If blueberry bushes are not pruned back every year, they can overproduce in one year. That can lead to the bushes only producing fruit every other year.You also prune to keep the bush under control, as you don't want it to be too tall. If it's too tall, it will be difficult to harvest the blueberries.Additionally, you need to thin out the middle so that it can get proper airflow, discouraging disease.Pruning also opens up the middle to sunlight, providing nutrients and ripening the fruit., For the first two years of life, you must train your blueberry bushes so that they grow properly.


Remove crossed branches. In the first two years, you need to cut any branches that cross each other. By doing so, you're allow the bush to focus its resources on canes growing straight up, which will be stronger and help you create a better-shaped bush. It will also keep the fruit off the ground.Focus on creating the right shape of bush. In the second year, cut away any branches that didn't grow much in the last season. Leave the ones that have grown taller, though you may prune them back some in the next step., Following the first season, you can cut the longest canes back to 2/3rds of their length if the bush didn't grow much in the first year. This pruning will help it branch out., Any time you see a fat fruit bud in the first 2 years, as opposed to the flat buds of the leaves, you need to remove the bud. Cut away any of these buds you see with sharp shears. The bush needs to focus on growing, not producing fruit.Sometimes flowers might grow from fruit buds that you missed previously. Cut these away as well if you find them.

, Prune over the winter. You can prune as early as November or as late as March. However, the best time to prune is late February to the beginning of March.This time of year is best because you can see which new buds will produce fruit (fat buds) and which ones will produce leaves (flat buds)., Dull shears can cause you to use too much pressure, which can lead to injury. It will also make cutting more difficult and may damage your plant.Wear the gloves while pruning to protect your hands., Cut any canes that have diseases on them first. Look for shriveled branches or discolored branches., Between bushes, dip the shears into the disinfectant to stop the spread of disease. Shake off the disinfectant before moving on to the next bush.You can also use a rag or towel that has been soaked in rubbing alcohol. Wipe down the shears to disinfect them.

, Cut any branches that look damaged due to weather or other circumstances. Damaged branches will lose leaves, look shriveled, or be broken due to wind., That is, cut out growth that doesn't look strong.Look for growth near the bottom that started late in the previous season, as it will not have had enough time to develop fully.Remove this late growth near the bottom of the plant, preserving resources for the top of the plant.These twigs are the ones that didn't grow enough in the last season, so they are too small to produce any fruit this year.Additionally, cut out any lower branch that will produce fruit that touches the ground. Fruit should not touch the ground while growing. These will branches that go out at an angle rather than straight up or branches that are bending towards the ground., If a cane did not produce fruit this year, cut back the extra growth from last year.You can recognize the twiggy growth because it will have an abundance of smaller twigs, more than other branches. Also, the wood that produces this type of growth will not be as shiny as newer wood growth.When cutting, take it back to a place where the branch looks stronger, one that is growing upwards rather than sideways.Make the cut right above an outward facing bud, or do it on the next branch.

, Bushes are too tall if you can't reach up to harvest easily. You should leave at least seven canes, however. Prune the canes back to where a new shoot is taking off from the cane.You should not have any canes that are older than six years old.

, Only remove 2 or 3 mature canes per year to help sustain growth. Because canes stop producing as many blueberries after four years, start with the oldest canes. Mature canes are at least two years old.

Know when to prune.,
Decide how much you need to prune.,
Get the right tools.,
Know which trees to prune.",How to Prune Apple Trees1," As soon as you realize your apple tree needs pruning, it can be tempting to jump to it and start lopping off branches immediately. However, it is important to prune at the right time to avoid damaging your tree. Prune in the first month or two of spring, at least two weeks after the last frost.









If you need to, pruning can occur later in the spring and early in the summer.
Avoid pruning in the fall, as new growth will be stimulated but will die off from the cold of winter.;
, A well pruned healthy apple tree will be a poor shade tree; it should have significant spacing between branches.








, Pruning requires some specific tools in order to prevent damage to the tree. The blades you use to cut branches should be proportional in size to the branches you cut. For small limbs, use hand pruners. Larger branches that are about 1” thick can be cut off with loppers. Use a saw (a folding saw works well) to cut any branches wider than 3”.







, If your apple tree is a good shade tree, then it is an obvious candidate for pruning. However, pruning should not be done on all trees. Hold off on heavy pruning until your tree is at least three years old. If a significant amount of pruning needs to be done for a tree, do portions of it over several seasons.









Pruning young or small trees is done to encourage a strong framework and starting shape.
Pruning large or matured trees encourages larger, healthier fruit and maintains the overall shape."

Determine when to do your first pruning.,
Trim the tree back by half.,
Prune for fruiting wood the following winter.,
Do most pruning during the winter.Once your fig tree reaches its third dormant season, or third winter, the vast majority of your pruning should take place during the late portion of the season since the tree is not actively growing during that time period.,
Remove suckers growing on the base of the tree.,
Cut away dead and diseased wood.,
Remove branches that do not come from the fruiting wood.,
Trim down the secondary branches.Secondary branches are the branches that grow off the main branches of fruiting wood.,
Consider cutting back the main branches considerably.,
Pinch out new growth during the summer.Allow five or six leaves to grow on new branches during the peak summer months.,
Remove potentially harmful fruit in autumn.",How to Prune a Fig Tree," Some sources recommend that you prune the tree immediately after you transplant it. Others argue that you should wait until the end of the first dormant season.


Pruning the tree immediately after you transplant it gets the tree off to an early start. You are essentially training the tree from the start to focus its energy in a more concentrated form rather than allowing it to spread its energy out in a diluted manner. As a result, by the end of the growing season, the tree will likely be stronger and better establish.
On the other hand, there is some risk of shocking the tree if you trim too much of it away immediately after transplanting it. Most fig trees are resilient and will not fall victim to damage, but if the sapling you obtained is already somewhat weak, pruning it so soon after transplanting it can backfire and cause it to stop growing, and it may even begin to wither.
As a general rule, if you trust the source and stock of the tree, you can prune it immediately. If you are uncertain about the integrity of the tree, you may want to wait until the first dormant season before you prune it.;
, During the first pruning, you need to clear away a large portion of wood. This is an important aspect of training pruning.By cutting away so much of the fig tree, you force it to focus on developing strong roots.


As a result, the tree will establish itself better and be stronger in the long-run.
Doing this can also encourage the tree to grow branches horizontally, creating a bushier tree instead of a lanky one.

, At the start of the second dormant season after transplanting, choose four to six branches of strong, new wood, and prune away the rest.This process promotes healthier fruit and restricts the height of the tree.


At the beginning of the tree's life once you transplant it, most of the fruit is grown on old wood, or branches that have already produced fruit in the past. These branches have less strength now, so you need to promote the growth of new fruiting wood by trimming the old wood away.
Choose four to six of the strongest branches, but you should also make sure that they are spaced around the main trunk in fairly even intervals. These branches should be spaced apart widely enough so that they can eventually grow to 3 or 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) in diameter without bumping into each other.
Note that fruiting branches that grow too close will be unable to reach an adequate thickness, and as a result, they will be unable to support secondary branches or a healthy crop. Such branches also tend to split under stress or in harsh weather.
Completely remove all other new shoots or new branches.

, Wait until after the coldest part of the season has passed, though.


Pruning during the winter reduces the risk of shocking or damaging the tree during its early stages of growth, but doing so also makes the process easier since the lack of leaves will make the branches more visible.
You could wait to do this pruning until early spring, if desired, but it should be done before the fig tree shows signs of new growth.

, A sucker is a branch that begins to grow from the base or roots of the fig tree. It can look similar to the tree itself but can be identified by the fact that it does not stem from the main branch or trunk of the tree.


Suckers result from a tree's attempt at growing more branches, but if the tree is stressed or spliced, it can put out suckers instead of healthy branches from the main trunk.
Suckers need to be removed. If you do not prune these branches, they will drain energy from the main, healthy tree, and your fig tree will gradually weaken and produce a smaller yield as a result.
Similarly, secondary lateral branches should also be removed if they grow close to the ground. These plants will be unable to adequately support fruit or foliage, so they would only be a drain on the tree's resources if they remained, just as most suckers are.

, If part of your fig tree shows signs of disease, you need to remove those branches to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the tree. Similarly, you need to cut off dead or dying wood. Dead wood is unsightly, but more importantly, it can invite disease as it decays.


Note that if one of your main fruiting branches becomes damaged, you should remove it and select a newly formed sucker or branch late the following winter as a new fruiting branch for your tree.

, New growth that does not emerge from the fruiting wood you designated during the previous growth season should be cut away if you want to continue directing the energy of the fig tree to the fruit produced on those branches.

, Do not remove all of these branches, though. Instead, you need to cut away those that are growing at less than a 45 degree angle from the main branches.


Secondary branches growing at a smaller angle to the main branch can eventually grow too close to the main trunk. This positioning can cause problems, and these branches will usually produce weak fruit even though they are still draining resources and energy from the tree overall.
Note that secondary branches which have begun crossing or intertwining should be removed for similar reasons.

, Usually, you will cut back the main fruiting branches by about one-third to one-quarter their current height. Doing so keeps the tree small and ensures that its resources are more concentrated.


The end result is that the fruit produced by your tree during the following growing season will be stronger, larger, and sweeter.
While you do not want to over-prune the tree, most fig trees are notably resilient in regards to pruning and can come back stronger and healthier than ever after a significant amount has been removed.
If you are dealing with a large fig tree that has not been pruned in several years, you can even cut down the main branches by a full two-thirds without damaging or shocking the tree.
If you are not sure about how far to cut back these main branches, just ask yourself how low they need to be in order to make harvesting the fig crop feasible for you. You may not be able to determine an exact height from this estimate, but at the very least, it should serve as a good starting point as you figure out the right height for your tree.

, After these leaves establish themselves, use your fingers to pinch away additional leaves as you spot them emerging.


If you do not have a fig tree that produces edible fruit, this step is not especially important. The main purpose in this action is to direct the minimal necessary energy to the leaves of the tree. By removing extra leaves, you stop the tree from directing its energy to them. With less energy directed to the leaves, more energy can be dedicated to the production of fruit.

, Examine your fig crop during the autumn months. If you spot any large figs that fail to begin ripening, you should remove and discard them.


Note that you can leave pea-sized fruit alone, though. This fruit is in an embryonic stage and will not drain resources away unnecessarily.
Most fig trees bear their fruit during early summer and late summer. As such, fruit that has not matured by autumn is unlikely to mature at all.
As with most other types of pruning, the point of removing fig fruit that will not ripen to maturity is simply to redirect resources to other areas of the tree that can benefit from it more. This is important in the fall since the tree is storing energy and preparing to go into dormancy. Removing fruit that will steal away energy to no benefit can allow the tree to store up more of its energy, thereby strengthening it for winter.

Prune fruit trees in the winter.,
Prune your trees in the summer.,
Prune young trees right after you plant them.,
Trim young trees that aren’t growing well.,
Trim healthy young trees less frequently.",How to Prune a Fruit Tree1," In the winter, your fruit tree is dormant (and therefore not producing any leaves or fruit). This makes it easier to target the areas you want to prune and promotes the best production possible.Most fruit trees are best pruned during winter.;
, Some fruit trees need to be pruned during the summer. Cherry trees and apricot trees, for instance, should be pruned in summer.Plus, summer pruning increases the speed of the tree’s branching, and redirects the tree’s energy into growing only the most desirable branches.Summer pruning, however, comes with certain risks. It could slow down the fruit’s ripening process and expose fruit to sunburn.Generally, untrained trees do not need summer pruning.
Summer pruning is appropriate for trees with visibly dead or damaged limbs, or leaves that are visibly sagging under the weight of excess fruit or leaves.
To determine if your tree needs summer pruning, consult a botanist. Botanists are specially trained experts who know a lot about plants. They can help you determine whether or not summer pruning is appropriate for your tree.

, After planting a new, young tree, trim the main trunk down to between 24 and 30 inches (61 and 76 centimeters) high. Trim any side growths down to no longer than two buds. This will equalize the tree’s top with its root system.If you’d like a taller tree that is good for sitting under in summer and fall, make this initial pruning cut at a higher point on the young tree., If you have a young tree that is not growing well, prune it heavily for its first three years. Heavy pruning during the first few years means a lower fruit yield at first, but in the long run your fruit trees will be strong and productive., If your young tree is growing well, allow it to continue doing so. Trim it irregularly or not at all.Irregular pruning does not have a universally constant definition. It refers instead to the practice of trimming the tree to a lesser extent than you would a normal, mature tree. You might trim it once each winter, or not at all.
There are some physical signs that your young fruit tree is ready for pruning. Look for healthy growth characterized by a strong framework of permanent branches. Absent this framework of branches, prune your young fruit tree more often.

Get the right shape.,
Choose your scaffold branches.,
Remove ""suckers"".,
Cut off any dead wood.,
Cut off downwards growing branches.,
Prune down whorls.,
Prune the remaining branches.",How to Prune Apple Trees2," Your apple tree should be slightly conical in shape, with more volume near the base than at the top. This will allow sunlight to reach more of the branches. Before you begin pruning, keep in mind that you want to create a pyramid-shaped framework of branches on the tree.








, Apple trees grow with their trunk connecting to a central lead branch, and then with scaffold branches (the next largest branches) connecting to these. Viewed from the top, your tree should have only a few scaffold branches that don’t cross and allow even spacing between each. Depending on the size of your tree, it should only have 2-6 primary scaffold branches. The rest should be removed.








The angle of scaffold branches is very important. Good scaffold branches will have a 45 to 50 degree angle from the trunk. If the angle is any smaller than this, the branch will likely break off from the weight of the fruit. If the angle is any larger than this, then the tree won't bear as much fruit.
Seen from an aerial view, the scaffold branches of the tree will look similar to a star or the spokes on a wheel., Suckers are the unwanted shoots that grow near the base of the trunk. Remove all of these shoots up to the base of the main canopy of the tree to encourage a good shape. Suckers are the only part of the tree which can be pruned or removed even near the end of summer and beginning of fall.








, Remove any dead, diseased or damaged wood which is flaking or discoloured. You can remove diseased, dead, or damaged wood any time of year and you should do this as soon as you notice it. Remove the whole branch if it doesn't have any buds. If it does have buds towards the base of the branch, make a cut just above an outward facing bud. Angle each cut so rain can drain off the stem rather than sitting on top and rotting the plant.








, If there are any branches on your apple tree that grow downward, they will need to be removed. These will not be able to bear large and healthy fruit, and will take up valuable space and sunlight that other branches can use more effectively.








, Especially common in more mature trees, whorls are locations in which three or more small branches originate from the same location. Because so many limbs are growing from the same place, the branch is weaker and unable to support the branches as they grow. Determine which is the largest and healthiest of the smaller bunch, and then cut off the remaining branches from the whorl.








, Cut back the rest of the branches by about 1/3 of their length, to encourage the stems to thicken and develop flowers the following season. Make each cut just above an outward facing bud to encourage a healthy shape.

If you cut above an inward-facing bud, the branch will grow incorrectly inward toward the tree, which you don't want to happen., A thinning cut is used to thin out the tree branches and allow more sunlight to reach the limbs. Perform a thinning cut by clipping a branch as close to the collar of the tree as possible, taking care not to leave an exposed node.Perform thinning cuts on branches that are at least 50% smaller than the diameter of their parent branch., A bench cut is used to thin out the center of the tree and get rid of strong upright shoots and branches. To perform a bench cut, identify horizontal branches, then cut the branches and shoots coming out of their top side (especially those close to the trunk).

Choose the right tools.,
Sanitize your tools to prevent infection.,
Select which branches to prune.,
Develop a single leader.,
Ensure all branches receive adequate light.",How to Prune a Fruit Tree3," Use sharp shears on young trees with branches that are 1/2 inch (1.27cm) in diameter or smaller. Use pruning saws or long-handled loppers for pruning mature trees.If you don’t have pruning tools of your own, you might be able to rent some from your local hardware store – a good option for a tool you might use for only a few hours each year.

, After pruning a particular tree, dip the blades of your shears or pruning saw in a solution of one part alcohol and one part water for at least 60 seconds before moving on to the next tree. This will prevent disease from spreading to other trees. Alternately, you could use a solution of water and commercial cleaning solutions like Pine-Sol, chlorine bleach, or Lysol. Just mix one part cleaning solution with a volume of water five times that of the cleaning agent and dip your pruning tools in it for at least 60 seconds., Always cut dead, damaged, and diseased branches (the “three D’s”). Additionally, cut any suckers – short, new branches sprouting from the trunk. Watersprouts – branches that grow straight up from an outward-facing limb and typically appear in spring – should be pruned, too.Remove competing and downward-growing branches. Downward-growing branches generally do not produce a very high fruit yield.
Generally, do not prune branches that are growing out of the trunk at about a 45-degree angle. Anything growing at a much smaller or larger angle should be pruned., If the trunk of the tree splits into several parallel and competing trunks, your tree will have trouble growing and will be more difficult to prune. Prune your tree in such a way that discourages direct upright growth, except from the central trunk. Only the uppermost bud of the leader should be allowed to remain during pruning sessions.This system is appropriate for most trees, and crucial for apple, pear, cherry, and European blue plum trees.
For a few fruit trees – peach, nectarine, apricot, and Japanese plum trees – pruning to a central leader is unnecessary.

, Try to prune the top of the tree more heavily than the undergrowth. This allows more sunshine to reach the shaded branches, encouraging them to produce fruit.Additionally, cut branches that are too close together. Every branch should have six to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of space around it. If you have a cluster of close branches, prune the thinnest of the bunch."

Immediately before transplanting the plant into your garden, you should cut the shoots off, only leaving the strongest intact., Look at the buds on your remaining shoot. Count off the lowest three buds, and cut the shoot back just above the third bud.

, After you transplant the grapevine, new green shoots will begin to form. Once these shoots reach a length between 8 and 12 inches (20.3 and 30.5 cm), choose the best one and remove all the other shoots.


The shoot should be strong and nearly upright, and it should also come directly out of your original stem. Do not choose a shoot coming out of the underground root system.

, Support your remaining shoot by tying it to a stake or fence. Tie both the top and bottom of the shoot.


Throughout this first summer, continue tying your shoot to its support system, keeping it as straight as possible.
This shoot will act as the permanent trunk of your grapevine and will last throughout the duration of the vine's life.

, Toward the end of your plant's first dormant season, check the previous year's growth. The vine should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm) tall.


If the vine is not yet tall enough, cut it down to three buds again and repeat your initial pruning routine. This step is necessary if you want your grapevine to have a sturdy enough trunk to last over a long lifespan.
Do this in February or March, just before the plant exits dormancy but after heavy frosts are over.

, If the trunk of your vine has just reached past a height of 30 inches (76.2 cm), locate the first bud positioned above that height. Cut down the top of the vine to a point directly above this bud.


When done, tie the shoot to the vine's support system near the top of the vine.

, If the shoot is longer than 30 inches (76.2 cm), you should tie the vine to your support system at the 30-inch (76.2-cm) mark and count four or five buds above it. Bend down the remaining length so that it reaches your tie, and tie that in place, as well.


If the shoot has already started to put out side laterals, choose the two laterals closest to the 30-inch (76.2-cm) mark and tie them down to your supports. Prune these down to three, four, or five buds. Tie the main stem to the support and cut it off just above the side laterals.

, Monitor any new shoots that form throughout the summer. Cut off any shoots that sprout from the root area or lower trunk.


Good shoots should be trained throughout the summer. Tie them to your support system.

, Choose two canes that are roughly the same thickness as your pinky finger. Ideally, they should grow as near to the head of the vine as possible, and the buds should be close together.


The ""head"" of the vine is the point at which the trunk intersects with the top wire of your support system.
The two canes should be positioned on either side of the trunk. These two canes will be your primary canes. During the following season of growth, they will grow new shoots that can bear fruit.
Selecting canes close to the trunk head prevents the arms from becoming too long. Excessively long arms can create nonproductive gaps in the vine.
Make sure that your chosen canes have firm wood with a brown outer layer of bark nearly all the way to the tip. They must not have any visible damage, either.

, Prune your two chosen canes down so that only 8 to 10 buds remain.


Tie the remaining portions of both canes to your support system.

, Choose four additional shoots that are thinner than your two primary canes. Trim these down to two buds each.


These spur canes will act as sources of renewal during the following year's cane production.
These shoots should all be close to your primary side canes.

, Remove any other cane not already selected by cutting it away at trunk level.

, Choose one cane on either side of the trunk. The canes should be about as thick as your pinky finger and grow close to the head of the vine.


The ""head"" of the vine lies at the intersection between your main trunk and the top of your support system.
The canes you choose should have close buds and a brown outer layer of bark from base to tip. Make sure that they have not suffered any visible damage, either.
Note that this method of pruning is not recommended for American grape varieties. It is suitable for use with most wine grapes, but you should do some research about your particular grape variety before you choose to use this method of pruning.

, Bend the canes down to either side of your trunk and tie them in place.


These canes will become permanent arms that will remain intact for the life of your vine.

, Cut off the top of both permanent fruiting arms, leaving only four buds on each arm.

, Cut off the remaining canes at trunk level, leaving only your two permanent arms in place.


This is the last bit of pruning you will do during the second year.

, During each following year, new spurs will grow on your permanent fruiting arms, and fruit will be produced from these spurs. Trim each new spur back during the end of the dormancy season so that they are only two to three buds long.


As the vine ages, you may need to cut back older spurs to two buds, as well.

, If you want to grow grapes on an arbor, you will need to follow the same transplanting and first year steps you would follow for standard grape vines grown on a trellis or fence.


Grow one grapevine per post. If you have a two post arbor, grow two vines, training each one on a separate post. Grow four vines if you have four posts, or six vines if you have six posts.Allow the main trunk to grow to the top of your post during the first year. Tie or secure it to the post as it grows.

, During the first winter, cut down the main trunk to a bud just above the top of the post. Allow any lateral side canes to grow on top of the arbor.


Lateral side canes growing below the top of the arbor should be pruned down to trunk level.

, Any cane that produced fruit during the previous growing season should be cut off completely.


While these old canes can remain on the vine without causing disease or damage, keeping them on the vine will cause dense shade to form with little to no fruit.
You should also remove any weak, thin, or diseased canes, even if they have not yet produced fruit.

, Select one to three healthy, used canes from each vine and trim them down to two or three buds instead of cutting them off completely.

, Canes that developed during the previous growing season should be kept, but you will need to cut them back to only five or six buds.


Ideally, the canes on your arbor should be spaced 2 to 3 feet (60 to 91 cm) apart by the time you finish pruning.
After your first two or three years, you should have a well-established set of vines that can fill in the arbor top by the end of your growing season without becoming hopelessly tangled.

, All heavy pruning is done during the dormant season, but shoot trimming and training is done at the beginning of your growing system, usually in June.


Grape shoots need to develop 14 to 16 well-exposed leaves for grape clusters to ripen, but if there are too many shoots clustered together, the leaves will not receive enough light.
Thinning out your shoots early on can provide more light and more energy to the shoots you plan on maintaining.

, There should be 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of space in between your shoots. When done early on, you should be able to remove the shoots by hand.


Use pruning shears to remove any shoots that you cannot twist off by hand.

, Each shoot should only have one fruit cluster on it. Trim the shoot down to a point just above that cluster.


Note that the lowest cluster will usually ripen quickest.
You might be able to leave multiple clusters on one shoot if the clusters are notably small.

, A few days before you intend to harvest your grapes, cut off the leaves surrounding your grape bunches.


Doing so improves air circulation, thereby limiting the risk of disease.
This step also allows the grapes to ripen more efficiently.

Sterilize and sharpen your pruning shears.,
Measure your cherry tree.,
Cut the top of the central trunk in the fall or winter.",How to Prune a Cherry Tree1," Using dirty, dull pruning shears to make cuts on a tree leaves it prone to disease. Make a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water. Dip your shears in the solution and rinse them off with hot water. Once your shears are sterilized, dry them off with a clean towel. It might take a few extra minutes, but it's worth it to ensure your tree won't be harmed by the pruning process.
Make sure your shears are sharp, so that they don't damage the wood on your cherry tree.
Sterilize your pruning shears every time you prune your tree.;
, Before you prune the tree, measure it with measuring tape or a yardstick to see if it's tall enough. If the sapling is short, wait until it's well over 30 inches (76.2 cm) before inches before heading it. Waiting until the tree is more established before you cut the top will ensure that the cut won't weaken the tree., Cutting the top of the tree is called heading. Use your sharpened shears to cut the tree with your to 24 to 36 inches (61.0 to 91.4 cm) in height, on a 45-degree angle. Heading the tree will reduce the potential for disease and rot. Do this within the first year or two of planting the tree so you can control the shape the tree takes as it grows.If you wait until spring, the tree will have developed buds and the energy that went into bud formation gets wasted.
Making the cut before buds have formed allows the tree to use that energy to produce healthy branches.

"
"
Wait a year before pruning a scaffold.,
Choose 4-5 branches spaced 8 inches (20.32 cm) apart.,
Cut each of the four to five branches back to 24 inches (61.0 cm).,
Keep two secondary branches on each branch on your scaffold whorl .,
Prune away the remaining branches.,
Create a second scaffold whorl the following winter.",How to Prune a Cherry Tree2," A scaffold whorl is a set of 4 lateral branches that extend from the tree. This shape of branches provides structure and keeps the tree's shape balanced. In order to promote healthy growth in your tree, you mut promote it's growth in this way. However, do not attempt this too early or you may hurt your young cherry tree. After a year has passed, you can take the steps to create a scaffold whorl.

, Find four to five branches that will form your scaffold whorl. Branches growing at a 45 to 60-degree angle to the cherry tree make the best branches. Find the healthiest looking branches that are growing from the main tree and use them to create your scaffold whorl. The lowest branch should be branch about 18 inches (45.7 cm) above the ground., Make angled cuts 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above the buds on the four branches that you chose earlier. New growth will emerge where you make the cuts. Dispose of the cut branches in the waste bin.

, Look for two well-spaced, strong secondary branches to keep on each of the 4-5 branches that you just cut. Cut back the remaining branches flush with the base of the branch, leaving the two strongest branches remaining on each piece of your scaffold whorl. This will help the tree focus its energy on the branches that remain and produce a greater concentration of fruit.

, Make clean cuts flush against the main tree, so that only the branches that are part of the scaffold whorl remain. Any leftover branches excluding the main branches should be cut off.

, After another season of growth, the tree will be taller with more branches. Assess the tree and determine which branches you want to keep to create a second scaffold whorl about two feet higher than the first one.Choose branches that don't fall directly over the older primary branches. Create a scaffolded shape so that sunlight can reach all of the branches of the tree.

Trim new vertical branches.,
Trim dead matter while the tree is dormant.,
Cut back new shoots and seedlings.,
Prune any excess branches.,
Clean up all cut branches and trimmings.,
Do an emergency pruning if necessary.",How to Prune a Cherry Tree3," After the third year, it is no longer necessary to create new scaffold whorls. Outward-growing branches bear more fruit than upright branches. To get the maximum amount of fruit out of your tree, you might consider tying a string to the branches in the scaffold whorl and staking them in the ground during the growing season. Doing this will force the branches in the whorl to grow outward instead of vertically.Loppers and pruning saws are suitable pruning tools for trees that are too thick to handle with pruning shears. Be sure your tools are sharp and clean before you use them.

, No matter how old the tree is, always try to prune during the winter, while it's still dormant. Trim away any dead or dried branches, dead leaves, and dead fruit. Throw them in the compost heap or garbage.Always remember to sterilize your pruning shears before using them, even if you're just cutting away a few dead branches.

, If you see shoots growing at the base of the cherry tree, cut them. Pull out seedlings as well, so that the cherry tree's roots don't have to compete with a new tree., Each season, step back and look at your cherry tree is growing properly. Prune new branches that aren't part of the scaffold whorls, as well as branches that cross over one another. Remember that the goal is to create an open shape so that sunlight and air can reach the middle of the tree to help it bear fruit.If you see crossed branches, choose one to remove.
Branches that don't produce fruit can be cut back flush with the leader.

, Cherry trees are quite prone to disease, so it's best to remove all the trimmings after you're finished pruning, especially if you pruned away dead branches. Pick the dead matter off the ground and make sure to dispose of them far away from the tree to prevent disease., You might come upon a diseased or dying branch during the spring or summer, the least ideal time to prune a cherry tree. If this happens, prune away the branch, even though the tree is not dormant. The disease might spread to other parts of the tree if you don't remove it right away.If you're working with a diseased tree, you should clean the pruning tools you're using between every cut. Dip them in a bleach solution, wash them with hot water, and dry them off before proceeding.

But you might get a new and beautiful tree, and either way you'll have fun along the way.


If you want better odds, plant a young tree instead. A local nursery can recommend a grafted plant suited to your climate and soil.;
, Ideally, find fresh cherries from a local tree or farmer's market in mid to late summer. Early-fruiting varieties are often sterile, while grocery store fruit can work but tends to have a low success rate.Get a good large handful, since not all of them will sprout. There are two common species of cherry to choose from:Almost all fresh cherries for sale are sweet cherries. These are the best for eating, but most are only hardy in USDA hardiness zones 5–7.
Sour cherries tend to be easier to grow, and can survive in zones 3-8 depending on variety. The fresh kind can be hard to track down, so ask around at your farmer's market.

, Lucky for you, the flesh of the fruit needs to go before planting. Enjoy the fruit and wipe off the last bits clinging to the seed with a damp paper towel.


If it's still early or mid-summer, let the seeds dry on a paper towel for a couple days, then store in an airtight container in a cool spot.Retrieve them in late summer and continue to the next step.

, Cherries need to experience constant damp and cold for 3–5 months in order to germinate. If you get cold winter weather about this long but don't get below -20ºF / -30ºC, you can go the easy route and plant the cherries in fall. If you decide to do this, skip down to the next section. If you don't live in this climate or you prefer a method with a higher success rate, continue to the next step instead.


Sweet cherries do best with a couple weeks of warm weather before the cold. Planting in late summer or the very start of fall can accomplish this. However, a ""warm snap"" after the cold weather has started can send some cherries back into dormancy.Refer to an almanac or other long-term weather prediction to avoid this.

, Many people skip this step and still see a few cherries sprout, but this should increase the germination rate for most sweet cherries.Here's how to set up this process, called warm stratification:Buy fresh, sterile milled sphagnum moss. This material fights off mold, which is the biggest risk at this stage. Handle moss with clean gloves to avoid introducing spores.
Put the moss in a plastic bag or container and add room temperature water (68ºF / 20ºC).Let it absorb the water for 8–10 hours, then squeeze out the extra moisture.
Pop a few air holes in the lid. If using a plastic bag, leave it slightly open at the top.
Add the cherry seeds and leave them there for two weeks at the same temperature. Check after the first day or two to pour out standing water, then weekly to throw out moldy seeds (if any).

, Next, you need to convince your indoor cherries they're going through winter. This ""cold stratification"" treatment is very similar to the last step, with a few details changed:


You can use sphagnum moss again, but peat moss or a 50/50 mix of peat moss and sand may work best.Vermiculite will work as well.Add enough water to moisten the material without getting it soggy, then add seeds.
Place in the refrigerator or other area between 33º and 41ºF (0.5 to 5ºC) (ideally at the top of this range)., Most cherries need three months of cold treatment before they're ready to plant, and some prefer five. Check on the seeds every week or so. Pour out standing water if present, and add a little more water if the material is drying out.


Check more often toward the end of this period. If the hard seed coats have begun to crack, plant right away or reduce the temperature to 32ºF (0ºC) until you're ready., As soon as the last severe spring frost passes, the cherries can go in the ground.Check out the next section for detailed instructions.


If you want to get started early, you can plant the cherries in a large indoor pot.

, Cherries need plenty of sun and good air circulation. They prefer fertile, sandy soil with excellent drainage and neutral or slightly acidic pH.The young tree needs room for a taproot. If planting in a container, it should be at least 8 inch (20 cm) deep.
Cherries are very hard to grow in clay soil. If you want to make a serious attempt, build a raised bed 1 foot (0.3 meters) high.

, Poke a hole with your finger down to the first knuckle, and drop a cherry seed into the hole. Plant the cherries 1 ft (0.3 meters) apart for now, but expect to transplant the survivors 20 ft (6m) apart eventually.You can plant the cherries closer together, but you'll need to thin them once the shoots reach 2 inches (5 cm) high., If you went with the fall planting method, cover with 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) of sand. This prevents a frozen crust from blocking the shoots once they come up. If you're planting the seeds in spring, just fill the hole you created up to soil level., If planted directly in the ground instead of pots, the seeds will be a major target for digging and burrowing animals. Cover the area with a wire screen or hardware cloth, bend the edges, and sink them several inches into the ground to form a barrier.Remove this barrier once the first sprouts appear.

, Water the seeds lightly after the last spring frost date for your area. Water only once the soil is almost dry. Young cherries cannot stand waterlogged soil, but can't stay dry for too long either.

, Cherries are slow to germinate. If you followed both the warm and cold stratification steps, you can expect to see some sprouts within the next few months. Even then, some seeds might take an entire year to germinate, breaking ground the following spring.

, You'll want to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Once the cherry develops a taproot, test the soil to a depth of 3 inches (7.5 cm) and water whenever this feels dry. Water in a slow trickle until the soil is wet to the depth of the root.This won't take long at first, but remember to adapt as the cherry grows to a proper tree.

, Once the plants have grown to about 6 in (15 cm), or large enough for their roots to compete or hit the base of a pot, give them some extra space. Either thin out the shortest sprouts or transfer them further apart. Each tree should have 20 ft (6m) of space. Keep in mind that transplanting is best done when trees are dormant, which is during the winter. Transplanting trees when they are actively growing will stress the trees and could kill them.


Keep in mind that cherries can grow 25–50 ft (7.6–15.2 m) tall, depending on variety. With pruning, you can keep this to 15 ft (4.6 m) or less., Top dress the trees with well-rotted compost every year in early spring.Start this the year after they sprout, since mulch can block seeds from breaking through.


Fertilizer is best avoided with young trees, since it's easy to burn them. The compost should give plenty of nutrients.

, The most difficult part of growing cherry trees is their susceptibility to pests and disease. Take these steps to protect them once they grow into proper trees:Surround young trees with a cylinder of wire fencing to protect against deer. Do this as soon as the trees start to come up.
Once a month, look for holes in the trunk leaking ooze or sawdust-like frass. Poke a needle into these holes to kill insects.
In spring, wrap trunks with mosquito netting to stop boring insects from laying eggs.
In late fall, sink a hardware cloth barrier 2 inches (5cm) down into the soil on all sides to protect against rodents. This barrier should be high enough to protect against a rodent standing on expected snowfall.

, In early fall, whitewash the south side of the tree with white, nontoxic latex paint, diluted with water to a thin consistency. The trees are susceptible to sun damage during this time of year.Whitewash the north side instead if you are in the Southern Hemisphere.

, Cherry trees aren't too difficult to prune, but a little will go a long way toward fruit production and aesthetics. Generally speaking, sour cherries just need a little pruning to keep the branches symmetric. For sweet cherries, prune back the central leader to promote lateral growth instead.

, Left alone, your cherry tree will often take five or more years to bear fruit, if it can manage it at all. Grafting is a little risky with seed-grown trees, since you don't know the variety, but your local nursery may be able to recommend a fruiting species. You can graft this onto a two-year old tree and have fruit by the third or fourth year if the graft takes.

, The beautiful flowers alone are reason to grow cherry trees. If you'd like to see them replaced with fruit, though, they'll need to be pollinated. For most sweet cherries, this means you'll need a second variety of sweet cherry nearby, blooming at the same time. Honeybees are the most common pollinator for cherries. If you're using pesticides, make sure they don't affect this important species., No one has ever grown cherries without giving birds a share. If you're lucky enough to see fruits starting to form, set up your defenses before they finish ripening. There are several ways to distract or scare off the birds, including planting mulberries (which they find even tastier) and hanging shiny objects from the cherry branches.


Commercial growers will also drape netting over their trees to keep birds and other pests away from the fruit.

Remove apple seeds from the cores of several apples.,
Dry the seeds on a paper towel.,
Mix the seeds with peat moss.,
Put the seeds and peat moss in a bag and refrigerate.",How to Plant Apple Seeds1," Purchase several ripe apples, then eat them or cut them until you reach their cores. Carefully remove the seeds from around the cores of the apples, being sure to pick out every seed before disposing of the cores.Be aware that most apple trees grown by farmers and gardeners come from grafted trees, and are not planted directly from the seed. Planting trees from apple seeds produced highly variable fruit, since apple trees are not guaranteed to grow according to their type or variety.
The more seeds you plant, the more likely it will be that one of the trees will produce edible apples, as opposed to less edible varieties like crab apples. There is about a one in ten success rates of seeds growing into apple trees that produce fruit good enough to eat.
Try to start the process of preparing the seeds during the fall, so that by the beginning of spring, the seeds are ready for planting.;
, After you extract the seeds from the apple or apples, add the seeds to a bowl of water. If they float, throw them away, because they are less likely to grow. Lay the other seeds out on a paper towel and allow them to dry for three to four weeks.Flip the seeds over every two days so that they dry evenly on both sides.

, After a couple days of drying, purchase some peat moss. Pour a few tablespoons of the peat moss on the paper towel, then sprinkle on a few drops of water. Use your hands to mix up the peat moss and seeds., After you mix up the seeds and peat moss, pour the mixture into a ziplock bag. Write the date on the bag with a marker, then place the bag in the refrigerator for three months.The process of storing the seeds in moist, cold conditions is called stratification. Stratification softens the hard outer coat of the seed and encourages the embryo inside the seed to start germinating.
After three months, remove them from the refrigerator, and allow them to warm up so that you can plant them.

Switch to other shiny objects periodically.,
Add noisemakers if necessary.",How to Protect Your Cherry Trees from Birds1," Keep track of bird sightings in your garden or orchard, either with a formal count or by intuition. Once the number of birds starts to grow, and the fruit shows the first hint of color, it's time to protect the trees.These scare tactics are very effective, but only last a few weeks.Starting too early may leave your trees vulnerable later, once the birds are used to your tactics.;
, Pick exactly one of these proven ideas, or another bright object:


Aluminum pie tins
Scrunched up sheets of tin foil, coiled into a spring shape
Old CDs or DVDs
Strips of white cloth
Mylar streamers
""Scare eye"" balloons

, Tie a string about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long to each object.


If using CDs/DVDs, slip a second CD onto the string to sit on top of the first one.This will sit at an angle, reflecting light upward.

, Tie the shiny objects onto the trees. Space them about 5 feet (1.5 m) apart, or just enough to be visible from every angle. Five or six should work for a small tree, but a large tree may need many more.

, Once birds learn that the objects are harmless, they'll start to eat your cherries again. The repellent tends to work longer for tart cherries or yellow cherries — sometimes a full season, if you're lucky. Birds will spend more effort for sweet red cherries.To protect them, change the repellent every week or two.For instance, put up CDs. When bird activity increases, replace them with foil springs. Replace again with aluminum pie tins, then return to CDs.

, Commercial orchards often add scary noisemakers as well. This is more effective than visual repellents alone, but birds still get used to them. When birds start to approach again, replace either the visual repellent or the noisemaker.


If you only have a couple trees, just hang aluminum cans or other clusters of noisy objects. Anything louder may not be worth the annoyance in a home garden.
The cheapest commercial devices are handheld noisemakers that fire a small, loud explosive. These require frequent patrols.
To save labor, buy a stationary gas cannon or electric distress signal. Place these above the canopy, one for every 5 acres (2000 square meters)."

Weed your garden plot.,
Spread compost over the soil.,
Create a furrow in the soil.,
Plant the sprouted seeds in the ground.,
Cover the seeds.",How to Plant Apple Seeds2," Locate an area of your yard or garden where you intend to plant the apple seeds. Prepare the ground by removing any weeds from the soil, pulling the weeds up by the roots. Also remove any large rocks or stones and break up any large clumps of soil.Pick an area of your yard that receives direct sunlight and that has rich, well-draining soil.
Well-draining soil means that water drains through the soil easily, rather than pooling on the surface of the ground. Well-draining soil is usually dark and fertile looking, as opposed to thick and clay-like.
Try to plant the seeds in early spring.

, Before you plant your sprouted apple seeds, you want to be sure that the soil is as hospitable and nutrient-rich as possible. After weeding, spread a one inch (2.54 cm) layer of compost over the soil. You can prepare garden compost or buy it at a gardening store.


Compost enriches soil with essential nutrients and also makes soil airier so that it can drain better.

, Use your hands or a garden spade to create an inch-deep (2.54 cm) furrow, or small trench, in the soil. If you are planting a number of seeds, create one long furrow. You need to extend the furrow 12 inches (30.4 cm) for every seed that will be planted., After you dig the furrows, plant the apple seeds in the ground, spacing each seed 12 inches (30.4 cm) apart from the next. Spacing the seeds gives them the space to grow and ensures that they won’t compete for soil nutrients., After planting the sprouted seeds, brush a thin layer of soil over the furrows to protect them. Then sprinkle on a one inch (2.54 cm) layer of sand on top of the soil you brushed over. Sand protects the ground from crusting in cold weather, which can impede the sprouting of the seedlings above the soil."

Separate the seeds from the peat moss.,
Fill degradable pots with potting soil.,
Place two seeds in each pot.,
Water and cover the seedlings.,
Keep the pot in a warm, sunny location in your house.,
Water the plants twice a week.,
Prepare your outside garden for transplanting.,
Dig holes in the soil and place the pots inside.,
Replace the soil and water.",How to Plant Apple Seeds3," To begin potting your plants, take the ziplock bag of seeds and peat moss from the fridge. After three months in the fridge, the seeds are ready to plant. The best time to do this is in early spring.It’s possible to start the growth of apple trees in indoor pots rather than outside. Keep in mind that apple trees are healthier when they are initially planted outdoors instead of in pots.

, Purchase several small 6 inch (15.2 cm) degradable plant pots, depending on how many seeds you want to sow. Fill the plant pots with potting soil, leaving about an inch (2.54 cm) at the top. Make sure that the plant pots have drainage holes at the bottom.Degradable pots, like peat pots, make transplanting easier and less shocking for the seedlings.

, After filling the pots with loam soil, poke two one-inch (2.54 cm) holes in the soil of each pot about three inches (7.6 cm) apart, then place a seed in each hole. Because not every seed is guaranteed to grow, plant five to ten times as many seeds as you want apple trees., After you place all the seedlings in the holes, water the soil in each pot. This should shift the soil so that it covers the seedlings. If the seedlings are still exposed, gently brush soil over them so that they are just covered., Move the pots of seedlings to direct sunlight, preferably in a greenhouse, but anywhere in your home that is warm and has plentiful windows.Apple trees ultimately will have to be transplanted outdoors, where conditions are better for growth., Because the apple tree seedlings are growing indoors, they will need to be hand-watered twice a week. Water until the soil is moist and dark, but be sure not to overwater and flood the soil., You don’t want to keep your apple tree seedlings indoors indefinitely. Apple trees thrive outdoors, where they have space to grow, as well as improved sunlight and soil nutrients. In the fall, when the seeds are dormant, clear an area of garden of weeds and large rocks.Choose an area of your garden with well-draining soil, meaning that when you pour a large amount of water into the soil, it quickly drains into the ground.
Also choose an area of your garden that is in direct sunlight.
Add a one inch (2.54 cm) layer of compost to the soil to enrich it.

, Use a small shovel to dig into the soil. Make holes that are the same depth but twice the width of your pots. Then gently place a degradable pot with the seedlings inside each hole.


The biodegradable pots will eventually decompose, so that the apple tree seedling will be entirely surrounded by earth.
After burying the pot, you should just be able to see the rim poking up out of the soil.
Some biodegradable pots come with bottoms that easily pop out. You can also cut out the bottom of the pot to speed up the process of integrating the plant into the soil.

, Pat any displaced soil around the rim of the pot until there is no space between the pot and surrounding earth. Then water the plants and soil generously.Consider adding an inch-thick (2.54 cm) layer of sand over the soil if you live in a cold climate. Sand helps prevent the ground from crusting over in colder weather.

Try this for small to medium trees only.,
Buy fine mesh netting.,
Cover the entire tree.,
Secure the netting at the base.",How to Protect Your Cherry Trees from Birds2," Before you buy your netting, make sure you can drape it over the tree. Trees more than 8 feet (2.4m) tall are impractical to cover. For trees near this height, use ladders and/or a device that can lift the netting on a tall pole, then drape it outward.

, You can buy bird netting, but ordinary garden fabric (row cover) will work as well.The mesh should be fine enough to avoid tangling the birds..A ¼ to ½"" (6–12mm) mesh should work even for small birds.

, This part can be a pain, and requires at least two people for most trees. Wait until your cherries have formed, then cover the tree once you see them starting to take on green color. The netting will catch against the branches, so hold the netting flat above the tree and lower it. It should cover the entire tree, and hang fairly loosely, since cherries tight against the netting will still get eaten.


To protect fruit at the edges, plant stakes around the tree to lift it above the cherries. Top the stakes with upside down milk jugs, which won't tear the netting.Valuable or important fruit can be protected by a full frame around the tree., Birds can fly underneath the netting and get trapped. To prevent this, tie the base of the netting securely to the base of the tree with twine or hog rings.


You can also stake the netting down to the ground around the drip line of the tree.

Plant mulberry trees.,
Get approval for shooting or trapping.",How to Protect Your Cherry Trees from Birds3," Fruit-eating birds love mulberry trees. Plant a female mulberry tree nearby, from a variety that fruits just before the cherry trees. The birds should flock to the mulberry tree much more than the cherries, as long as the tree still has fruit.


Avoid the mulberry variety Illinois Everbearing, which have slow-ripening fruit too large for many birds., Some orchard growers shoot larger cherry thieves such as jays and magpies, and/or trap starlings and other small birds. You may need government approval.In the US, contact the Department of Fish and Game or the local Agriculture Commissioner. In the UK, contact Wildlife Management.
Local university agriculture extensions can teach you how to choose and set traps. Traps are much more effective when matched to your bird population and set by an expert.

Stir the mixture.,
Water the soil gently.,
Place the jar in a warm place where there is enough sunlight for the seeds to sprout.

,
Wait until the seeds sprout.,
Keep tending to the strawberries.",How to Plant Strawberries Indoors," Make sure it is not too squishy and are ripe.;
, Quickly flick your wrist to get the seed out. You need to use a flicking motion because strawberry seeds move fast, and if you try to push it out, you'll just dig a hole in your strawberry.

, Collect as many as you think you'll need but a good amount is around 20-30 seeds, to ensure that at least one takes.

,, It should be damp, not dripping wet. Take the tip of the toothpick and poke a couple of your seeds, they should stick onto the toothpick without falling off.

, Flick the top of the toothpick (not the seeds) with your middle or forefinger. The strawberry seeds should fall off and scatter into the cup.


Do not push the seeds down.

,, Add two thirds hydrogen peroxide.

, Dip the toothpick in this solution. Then drip some of the solution over the seeds. This will help them grow, as hydrogen peroxide is a natural oxidizer.


Note: You do not need to do this every day––every other day is fine until the seeds have sprouted, then once a week is all you need.

, Don't overdo the watering or the seeds will drown and can turn moldy. Keep the soil moist but not wet, watering about once or twice a week.

,, In a few days, the seeds should have sprouted. If enough plants take, you can transplant them after a few weeks, into separate pots.

, When the plants grow large enough, fruit will form and the plant should be sprouting some yummy strawberries for you to eat.

Clip the stalk of the fruit.",How to Plant Loquat Seeds," If you're wanting to grow a loquat tree in cooler area, the white-fleshed fruits are a better bet than the orange-fleshed fruit. The white-fleshed fruits also do better in coastal areas.Loquats can be found in Asian markets and other exotic fruit stores.;
, If you're wanting to grow a tree from fruit you already have, you need to start by pulling the seeds out of the fruit. Most loquats have three to five seeds in them. The seeds are fairly large and brown.Some growers caution against growing loquat trees from seeds if you plan on eating the fruit, as you don't know exactly how the fruit will turn out. In fact, it may not produce fruit at all.However, it will make a perfectly fine ornamental plant either way.Purchasing a small sapling is a better idea if you want it to grow fruit.

, Make sure all the fruit is off the seeds by removing it with your fingers. Next, run the seeds under cool water, removing any remaining pulp and fruit juice residue., Another option for loquat seeds is to purchase them. Your best bet for finding them is an online retailer. For instance, heirloom seed sites or specialty seed stores will likely carry them., Peat pods work well for growing loquat seeds, which you can buy at your local garden center. Place one seed in each starter.However, the seeds are fairly hardy and will likely germinate in potting soil, as well.

Loquat seeds don't need special treatment to germinate like some seeds do. You won't need to score them or anything like that.Water the seeds after you plan them in their pots. Keep watering them once a day until they begin sprouting. After that, water the pods when they're dry.

, When they reach about half a foot, you'll need to transplant the seedlings to a larger pot.You can also transplant them outside if you have mild weather. Loquats can do well in most soils, but you can make the conditions more favorable. Mix in organic material to lightly fertilize the soil. Add in something to improve drainage, such as peat moss., Make sure the roots are somewhat exposed before replanting. You can turn a hose on the roots if you need to.Place dirt in a larger pot, and gently set the new seedling (with the original media) into the the pot. Surround the root system with soil until you reach the base of the plant., Pick a sunny spot for your tree. Dig a hole that's bigger than the root system, though only slightly. Make sure the roots are partially exposed by turning a hose on them. Set the tree in the ground, and pack the dirt around it.If you are planting in a place with mild winters, plant it outside in the fall. If you have colder winters, plant the tree outside in early spring.If you are planting more than one tree, it should be planted 25 to 30 feet away from the next loquat tree. If it's a dwarf tree, you may get away with only 13 feet or so apart.

, Inside, water the plant when the soil is dry. Outside, water when you put the tree in the ground. After that, water three times a week for at least three to four months, which will help the tree take root.Give enough water to soak the roots but don't leave standing water.

, The tree needs to be free from competition. Therefore, it's best to kill off any vegetation in a 3-foot diameter around the tree. You can use a herbicide to kill off the vegetation. Add mulch after the vegetation dies so you don't have to use herbicide again., Once the tree is well established outside, it will need fertilizer from time to time. When you see new growth, you can apply a general lawn fertilizer (without a weed killer) to the tree.The tree will need 1 cup (240 milliliters) of fertilizer for each year of growth in the first 3 years (1 cup in the first year, 2 cups in the second year, etc.). However, you should spread it out in three to four applications over the year.
Once the tree is older, you'll need to use a pound per inch of trunk, spread out over the year.

, If your goal is to get fruit from the tree, you're going to have to wait a while. Fruit may arrive as early as 2 to 3 years after planting.However, it can take as long as a decade for the tree to bear any fruit., Loquats are not easy to pull off the tree, even when ripe. To get them off, you'll need to clip off clusters with pruning shears. Otherwise, you may bruise or damage the fruit.When it does bear fruit, wait for the fruit to ripen on the tree. These fruits don't ripen well off the tree. Look for the proper color based on the variety you're growing to determine ripeness.

Purchase a young peach tree at a nursery or tree farm.,
If you live in a colder climate, select your peach variety carefully.,
Aim to plant your tree in spring.,
Select an area for planting a peach tree.,

Add peat moss and organic matter such as compost to the prepared soil.,
Plant your peach tree in the middle of the prepared soil.,
Care for your peach tree.,
Apply a mild pesticide to your peach tree after about a week to prevent insects and disease from damaging it.,
Add a nitrogen fertilizer about twice a year to your peach tree.,
Prune your tree.,
Thin the fruit.,
Harvest when the fruits are ripe and mature.",How to Plant a Peach Tree," You certainly can try to grow one from a seed or pit, but that is much more time consuming and a bit more difficult. A peach seed will grow into a flowering peach tree in about 3 to 6 years; if you buy a peach tree at the nursery, aim for one about a year old – and the reward will be much more imminent.If you do end up purchasing a young tree, look for a dormant one with few to no leaves. These are best purchased between fall and early spring. If you try to plant an active tree with green leaves and full branches, it may put too much strain on the tree, and it is likelier that the tree will fail.
As for using a peach seed, make sure it comes from a delicious, juicy peach, so your future peaches have the traits of “their mother” (although you should keep in mind that there is no guarantee that it will share these traits). When you find a tasty peach, set out the pit to dry for a few days. When it’s brittle, crack it open to reveal the seeds – they’ll look like almonds.;
, Talk to your local nursery about what type of peach would grow the easiest. In the USA, peaches grow well in zones 5-9, but are best in zones 6 and 7. “Frost” and “Avalon Pride” are two varieties that can withstand a bit of cold weather.


And if you’re looking for a smaller variety that you can grow on your deck or patio in a pot, “Pix-Zee” and “Honey Babe” are good choices. They only reach about 6 feet (1.8 m) tall., The best time to plant a peach tree is in spring while the tree is still dormant. Do not try transplanting an active peach tree in summer as this may harm the tree. , Peaches love sun – at least six hours of direct sunlight each day is good. They also like it hot, so the warmest place in your garden (like next to a south-facing wall where it can receive plenty of reflected heat) is great.Look for a spot that has well-drained, sandy, moderately fertile soil, is elevated to give your tree proper airflow (and to reduce the risk of frost) and, as mentioned above, will also provide direct sunlight the majority of the year.

, Thoroughly break up the soil with a garden tiller or garden spade. This amount of space makes it easy for the roots to spread out, helping the tree grow. What’s more, grass is greedy – making sure it’s not around the base of your tree will prevent it from inhibiting your tree’s growth.


Go 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep into the soil for the best support for the peach tree's roots. Spread the roots away from the base of the tree, but be careful not to bend them.

, Mix it up well, loosening the soil. Then, water the area where you will be placing the peach tree. Just a bit more than a light sprinkle will do; you do not want to saturate the dirt.


If the pH of the soil is too low (you want the pH to be around 6.0-7.0), mix a few limes into the soil., Place the tree in your hole on a small mound of soil, and fill the hole back up. Pat the soil around the peach tree gently with a garden spade to secure it.


If you have a grafted tree, position the inside of the curve of the graft union away from the sun., Check your peach tree each day and water it lightly if it appears wilted. General rainfall is all a peach tree needs, but if you live in a particularly dry area, it may need a light watering.


Apart from this, to take care of weeds and nutrition, an organic mulch will likely do the trick. Just make a circle of mulch over the root zone that’s a couple of inches (5cm) deep and 3 feet (0.91 m) (1m) or so in diameter. With the right amount of rainfall, you can literally just sit back and watch your tree grow.

, You may also want to consider deterring insect borers by wrapping the trunk with scraps of garden row cover.


To keep rodents at bay, you can surround the tree with a cylinder of mesh hardware cloth.
Use a lime-sulfur spray to raise your tree’s chances against peach leaf curl, the most common disease culprit.

, After six weeks or so, 1 pound of nitrogen fertilizer spread evenly over the area will help your tree flourish.After the initial year, you can decrease the amount to ¾ of a pound.


After the third year when the tree is mature, add 1 pound of actual nitrogen to the soil. This is best done in the spring.
To make your tree hardier, don’t fertilize it within 2 months of the first frost or when the fruits are maturing., You want it to take on an open center shape. After the first year and in the summer, cut the shoots that are forming on the top of the tree by two or three buds. In a month, check the tree for progress. If you have three wide-angled branches spaced equally apart, cut back other branches to keep these as your three main branches.


A year from then, again in summer, prune any shoots growing below these main branches. From then on, remove any shoots in the center of the tree to help it keep its shape.
Prune the tree in late winter or early spring to shape the tree. Cut off any branches that are rubbing against others as well as any that might be growing up into the open center of the tree.
Pruning annually encourages production, not diminishes it. It encourages new growth, allocating more resources to the parts of the tree you want growing. You'll get 10 to 18 inches of new growth each season., After the tree blooms, which will take about 4 to 6 weeks, thin the fruit by spacing them out 6 to 8 inches apart. This ensures that the fruit left over becomes large and juicy. You also want the sun to be able to reach all branches and fruit – if some fruit is flowering in the shade, thin it – that way you can allocate the nutrients to the fruits that will grow faster.


You always want an ""open canopy"" for your fruit. Try to have every branch have access to plenty of sunlight. Remove dead, dying, and crossing branches and blooms to give your fruit the best chance.

, Watch the fruits on the top and outsides of the tree – they'll likely be ready for harvest first. When there are no longer any bits of green on the fruits, they're ready. They should come off with a slight twist.


Peaches are notorious for bruising easily, so be careful when you pick them.
They can store in a resealable bag in the fridge for up to 5 days.Or, of course, you could make peach jam.

Water your mango plant regularly and use fertilizer sparingly.",How to Plant a Mango Seed," Mangos are native to the hot, humid tropics of Asia and Oceana. Outside of that area, mango trees grow well in USDA hardiness zones 9B or above (minimum annual temperatures 25ºF/-4ºC or above). In cooler areas, mangos can still be grown in containers and brought indoors during freezing weather.The Cogshall mango variety is a popular choice for growing indoors, and can be kept permanently at 8 ft (2.4 m) tall with regular pruning.Even smaller dwarf varieties exist for people with limited space.;
, The best way to make sure you get a seed that will grow well in your area is to find a parent tree nearby. A nearby tree that produces good fruit will give you a seed that's the right variety for your climate. If you live in a warm climate with mild winters, you can probably find a healthy mango tree in your area.


If you can't find a mango tree, you can order seeds or buy them in a shop. Make sure to choose a variety that is known to grow well where you live.
You can also try to plant a seed from a store-bought mango. However, it will be a lot more difficult to make sure the seed stands a chance to survive in your climate, especially if the mango traveled to your grocery store from another state or country. Still, it's worth a try!

, Cut away the mango's flesh to find the seed husk inside. Carefully cut away the husk to reveal the seeds. A healthy mango seed will look tan and fresh. Sometimes seeds shrivel up and turn grey if they're exposed to cold temperatures, and if this happens, the seeds aren't usable. Slice both cheeks off as close as possible to the seed: Place a cheek in the palm of your hand, carefully scoring the flesh side of the cheek, both ways, approximately 2cm/1 inch each way. Then turn the the cheek up, exposing cubes of delicious mango flesh. Eat as is from the skin, or scrape off with a spoon, directly into a bowl.
You might want to wear gloves when handling the seed. Mango seeds produce sap that can cause skin irritation.

, You can use either the drying method, or the soaking method, as noted below. The soaking method reduces germination time by one to two weeks, but increases the risk of mold.

, Place it in a sunny and airy dry place for around 3 weeks. After this time, with one hand, try to crack open the seed, trying not to let it slip in half; you just need to slightly separate the two halves, and leave for another week.

, Dig a small hole approximately 20cm/8 inches deep. With the belly button of the seed face down, push the seed in.

, After around 4 to 6 weeks, you will have a mango tree / seedling about 100mm to 200mm high. Depending on the variety of mango you earlier devoured, it may be a deep purple, almost black, or a bright vibrant green.

, Many people grow mango trees indoors for one to two years before planting them outside.

, To ""scarify"" is to slightly abrade the outside of the seed, making it easier for the seed to germinate. Carefully make a small cut in the mango seed or rub the outside of the seed with sandpaper or steel wool just enough to break through the outer skin of the seed.

, Place the seed in a small jar of water, and place the jar in a warm place such as a cupboard or on a shelf. Soak the seed for 24 hours.

, Place the wrapped seed inside a plastic bag with one corner cut off. Keep the towels moist and wait for the seed to sprout - it usually takes 1 to 2 weeks. Make sure to keep the seed in a warm, moist place to help it germinate., Start your seedling's growth in a pot. Choose one big enough to hold the seed and fill it with a mixture of potting soil and compost. You could plant the seed directly in the ground, but planting it in a pot first allows you to control temperature exposure during the vulnerable early stage of growth. , Place the pot outside in partial sun; this allows the seedling to get used to the sun, or harden, before being transplanted to its final place in the full sun.

, Choose an area with full sun to plant your mango seed. Be sure this is a place you want a large tree to grow — they get up to 65 feet (20 m) tall!


When planting in its final position, find an area in your backyard that has good drainage. Also think about the future; it must be an area that will not interfere with any buildings, underground plumbing, or overhead power.
Transfer the seedling when it has established a good, healthy root system. The thickness at the base of the trunk should be the size of an Australian 20 cent piece (about 5cm/2.5""). Most trees take about two years to reach this size.

, Leaving a mango tree in the pot is ideal if you live in a place with cool winters, so you can take the pot inside when the temperature drops. As the tree grows, you will either need to prune it to keep it small, or transfer it to a larger pot., Dig a hole big enough for the seedling's tiny root ball. The hole should be three times the size of the root ball. Add one third quality potting mix, one third garden sand (not loam), and the rest back filling with soil from the hole. Place the seedling in the hole, pat the soil around its base, and water it thoroughly.


Be very careful not to break the seedling as you transplant it.
Keep the base of the trunk clear to avoid ring barking the young Tree of the Gods.

, Most mango trees take five to eight years after planting to bear fruit.They are slow to reach maturity but worth the wait.


Do not over fertilize. If you do, the tree will focus more on leaf growth than on fruiting.

, The vines quickly mature if you prune them every three months or so. Blooms come right after pruning a new shoot of purple leaves on a mature vine no less than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.

, Don't let your coffee grounds go to waste! Dump them at the base of the vine. The coffee will add acidity to the soil. acidic soil will encourage the jade vine to give more blooms.

To be sure, check the roots for rusty-red or brown discoloration in spring, before the plant is due to fruit.Discolored roots confirm the presence of the Red Stele Root Rot pathogen. The pathogen likes to live in wet soil, which suggests your strawberries don't have enough drainage.To treat the pathogen in home gardens, use organic fungicide like Aliette WDG and follow application instructions. For commercial operations, you’ll need to use commercial grade pesticides in accordance to regional rules.If you have to plant your strawberries in consistently wet soil, you can plant Red Stele resistant plants like Allstar, Sparkle, Sunrise, and Surecrop.;
, If you notice these symptoms, your strawberry plants are suffering from Black Root Rot, which can be caused by a number of pathogens or poor environmental conditions.

It can be hard to tell if your plant is suffering because of pathogens or environmental conditions.You can fix environmental conditions by improving the soil with organic matter, making sure the soil is well drained, and following proper watering and fertilization practices, based on the specifications of the strawberry variety you are growing.
Pesticides that fight Black Root Rot are extremely regulated, so if your plant is suffering because of pathogens, it’s better to remove and discard the plants.

, If you notice purple, tan, gray, rusty-brown, or white spots on your strawberry leaves, your plants are likely suffering from Leaf Spot. Spot color varies depending on local environmental conditions. The disease is caused by a fungus that favors humidity.

Severely infected plants will likely die, but you can save newly infected plants by mowing the strawberry bed after fruiting has finished, which will eliminate diseased growth and stimulate new healthy, growth.You can also try to treat the fungus with organic fungicides like Captan 50 WP and Cooper compounds. Be sure to follow application instructions., Black or gray mold on your berries indicates Fruit Rot or Blossom Blight. The mold is caused by a fungus that the berries and blossoms pick up because they are touching the ground or come in contact with decaying material.Prevention is the best means of control for this fungus, so be sure to keep plants properly spaced, fertilize at correct times (this will depend on what type of strawberries you are growing), remove dead undergrowth after fruiting, and spread straw mulch under the plants to avoid fruit contact with the soil.You can also use chemical treatments like fenhexamid and potassium bicarbonate.
Leather Rot is a similar disease that causes areas of the fruit to become gray or purple in color and leathery in texture. You can use Captan to treat the fungus., Powdery Mildew is a disease caused by a fungus that can also cause strawberry leaves to roll in late summer.Remove infected tissue by mowing strawberry beds and treat with fungicides like JMS Stylet oil, Nova 40W, and Rally 40 W, once flowering begins.The best defense against powdery mildew is to plant resistant varieties of strawberries.

, Extremely wet environmental conditions harbor a fungus that causes a purple splotching disease known as Leaf Scorch.. The best way to treat this disease is to alter watering practices and allow for dryer conditions, but if that isn’t possible, you can treat with the same chemicals recommended for Leaf Spot.., Verticillium Wilt is caused by a fungus that can be particularly aggressive during a strawberry plant’s first year of growth, which causes the older, outer leaves of the plant to wilt, dry, and turn a reddish yellow to dark brown. The inner, younger leaves remain green.

Pathogens harbored in the soil from previous crops can be the disease culprit, so the best means of control are proper crop rotation methods.
There are no easy soil or chemical treatments recommended for Verticillium treatment.Strawberries exposed to lower levels of nitrogen seem to withstand the disease better than plants exposed to high levels of nitrogen, so one way to fight the disease is to use fertilizer with lower levels of nitrogen., Many pathogens are transmitted by infected soil, surrounding fields, birds, and wind. To reduce exposure to pathogens and to keep soil healthy, rotate your strawberry crops every few years.

Strawberries should never follow tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers, or stone fruits for 5 years, because these plants can harbor diseases like Verticillium and Red Stele Root Rot in the soil., Certain varieties of strawberries are better adapted to certain types of regions and their climates. Visit a local fruit stand or greenhouse to talk to an expert on the strawberries best suited to your region. Growing the best variety for your region will help eliminate diseases caused by environmental stressors., The best way to prevent strawberry diseases is to plant disease-resistant strains. Conduct an online search for the most prevalent strawberry diseases in your region and then pick a strawberry variety that is resistant to all or most of those diseases., Never plant strawberries with visible signs of disease. Not only will you contaminate the soil for years, but you may also contaminate neighboring fields. Only plant healthy strawberry plants., Direct sunlight is best for strawberries to grow, but it also helps fight disease by allowing strawberries to dry quickly after heavy rains or thick dew., Mulching around your strawberries will fight disease by providing protection from frost, dehydration, and soil temperature fluctuations., Strawberry plants are most likely to acquire disease when they are stressed. Stress can be caused by planting strawberries in clay or soil with high salt contents, too much or too little water, incorrect planting depth, and too much shade.Follow your strawberry variety’s specific planting instructions as closely as possible.

, Strawberries don’t like to be crowded and dense areas of planting can cause extra humidity and poor drainage, which allows fungus to grow. Space plants based on the variety’s specifications., When blossoms or berries touch dead or decaying matter, they will start to rot. Keep dead leaves and fallen berries clear from the plants.Decaying material also includes organic matter in the soil. Keep plants watered and fertilized in accordance to the variety’s directions in order to produce higher-growing fruit. Spread a straw mulch underneath the plants if contact with the soil cannot be prevented.

Obtain a healthy tomato plant.,
Use a large pot with drainage holes.,
Be mindful about material.,
Scrub your pot clean.,
Prepare your potting mix.,
Mix fertilizers into the soil.",How to Grow Tomatoes in Pots1," Most varieties can be grown in pots, but larger tomatoes will need larger containers. Tomato plants are also significantly easier to grow by transplant, rather than by seed.;
, Most tomato plants require a 15-gallon (60-liter), 18-inch (46-centimeter) pot in order to have adequate room to develop. Some small varieties may fit inside a 12-inch (30.5-centimeter) pot, but the roots will be restricted and your yield may not be very impressive.

, Sturdy clay pots may look nice, but a pot this large will get very heavy and you will not be able to move it without some strain. As a result, plastic pots with drainage holes and saucers may work best.

, This step is crucial if your pot once held another plant, since it may have left bacteria and microscopic insect eggs behind. At minimum, you should wash the pot out with hot water and soap. You can also use a little bleach for a more thorough cleansing.

, Never use garden soil, which may contain harmful pests and bacteria that can damage tomatoes, which are susceptible to disease. An all-purpose potting soil provides an excellent base, but you can also mix it with equal parts perlite, sphagnum peat moss, and compost to improve drainage and provide additional nutrition. Make sure that any compost you use has been heated to high enough temperatures to kill off potentially harmful organisms.

, You can use a commercial fertilizer safe for vegetables, or you can mix in organic fertilizing components, including soy meal, blood meal, bone meal, kelp meal, and greensand.


Organic fertilizing components can purchased online, and a few common types, like blood meal and bone meal, can usually be found in big chain garden and home improvement stores, as well as specialized nurseries. Feed stores that sell food for livestock may also carry a few organic components, like kelp meal.

Loosen up the soil around the plants and earth up the plants 3 – 4 months after planting, raising the soil level at the base of the plant by about 10” – 12”.

,
Remove dry leaves when seen.

,
Remove side shoots until the emergence of flowers.,
Deflower them.,
Prop up your plants.",How to Plant and Care For Tissue Cultured Banana Plants1,";
,,


Planting is done after removing the polythene cover and making sure the roots are not damaged. Planting is usually done in the evenings. Partial shade is provided for the first two weeks to protect the plants from the sun. Irrigation is given daily until plants are established.

, Bananas require 25 liters (6.6 US gal) of water per plant per irrigation. In larger varieties like Nendran, up to 40 liters (10.6 US gal) of water per irrigation is required during summer months. Irrigation is done once every 3 days in summer. It is important the base of the plants are not water logged.

,,, Retain 1-2 suckers produced after emergence of bunch.

, Once all the hands have developed the rest of the inflorescence is removed.

, In certain varieties the heavy weight of the fruit bunch causes the plant to go out of balance. This may cause the plant to break up. To avoid this, plants should be propped up using a ‘V’ shaped pole.

Place a fiberglass screen at the bottom of your pot.,
Pour pebbles or river rocks into your saucer.,
Fill your pot 1/3 full with potting mix.,
Place the tomato plant in the container.,
Continue adding soil around the plant.,
Give the tomato plant a thorough watering.,
Set the pot out in a sunny location.,
Fill the rest of the pot with soil as your plant continues to grow.",How to Grow Tomatoes in Pots2," The screen should be cut to fit the size and shape of the bottom. Having it in your pot will prevent your soil from draining with the water, keeping things much cleaner.

, The rocks create air gaps in between the underside of your pot and the surface it sits on, which allows water to drain more thoroughly.

, For a 15-gallon (60 liter) pot, you should cover the bottom 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) with soil.

, Push the stem of the plant into the existing soil, just enough to give it a base of support.

, Pack the soil around the stem of the tomato plant as you go, making sure that it remains securely fixed in the pot and does not wiggle around. By the time you finish, about half of the stem should be beneath the soil.

, Soak it with water once, and then wait another 10 minutes before soaking it again. The soil should be completely saturated, soaking the root, as well.


After soaking it so thoroughly, your tomato plant may not need additional watering for an entire week. Constantly saturating your tomatoes will destroy them.

, Your tomatoes need at least six hours of sun per day in order to grow and eventually produce fruit.

, Trim the leaves from the stem before adding more of the planting medium, packing it around the stem as before. By filling the pot in with soil as the tomato plant grows, you help the plant build its root mass.


Continue to fill the pot with soil until it reaches the near top, with only 3/4 to 1 inch (2 to 2.5 centimeters) of empty space in between the surface of the soil and the rim of the container.

"
Insert a tomato cage once the pot is filled with soil.,
Wrap nylon netting around the tomato cage.,
Water your tomatoes as often as necessary in order to keep the soil moist.,
Continue giving your tomatoes plenty of sunlight.,
Provide your plants with shade once mid-summer heat comes along.,
Mulch your soil.,
Fertilize your tomatoes once a week, starting in the sixth week.,
Keep an eye out for garden pests.,
Harvest your tomatoes one by one, once they develop their red color.",How to Grow Tomatoes in Pots3," Carefully push the legs of the cage into the soil, centered over the tomato plant. Stop once the cage is firmly fixed in place. If you feel any resistance, pause, and readjust the position of the cage before continuing. Pushing down too recklessly can damage the roots.

, This serves as a defense against insects like tomato worms and stink bugs. Wrap the netting around the entire cage, holding it on the cage with clothespins or other sturdy clips.

, Do not allow the soil to get soggy, however, since this much water can drown your roots and cause them to rot. During dry, hot weather, you may need to water once a day.

, They need a minimum of six hours per day, especially during late spring and early summer when temperatures are still moderate.

, Excessive sun and heat can cause the container to heat up, drying out the soil in the process. Pin a shade cloth to the lower part of the cage using clothespins. The shade cloth should extend a foot above the top of the pot.

, Mulching is another technique used to keep your plants from drying out too fast. Spread a little mulch over the top of the soil and around the stem of the plant.

, Apply a water soluble fertilizer after you water your plants in the morning. Follow label directions concerning application.

, Even when you use netting, there is a chance that some pests, like aphids and flies, will get through. If an infestation occurs, use neem oil or a safe-for-humans pesticide to ward off the bugs.

, The fruits should almost be completely red, with only trace amounts of green remaining. Ripe tomatoes can be plucked or snipped off their branches.

Finally, locate where you want to plant the blueberries.,
Remove the flowers for the first two years.",How to Plant a Lowbush Blueberry," If you have natural lowbush blueberries growing in the local woods, you may be able to use these directly. It is possible to take rhizomes from existing blueberry clones and grow them in pots. These can then be planted in your yard for native landscaping and berries. If they are grown in their native environment, there will be no need to amend for pH; check your soil, as the pH should range between 4.5 and 6.0.;
, Blueberries are highly variable plants. You may even find huckleberry. This is the time to select for:
size






berry color






fall leaf color






flavor; and






species.







,, Taking pieces between 6 and 12 inches in length. Some of the pieces may have above ground stems which can be left attached. Select from several clones, this aids in pollination and fruit set.

, Fill the bottom half with sand and the top with peat. Plant the rhizome in the peat just above the sand.

, Keep pots moist but not waterlogged.

, After a few weeks some of the plants with above ground parts will break bud. At this time move them to a sunny location until ready for out-planting. Fertilize sparingly with a soluble fertilizer designed for acidic plants, available at most garden centers. Keep pots moist.

, Try to get as much sun as possible if fruit is desired. Also avoid close proximity to concrete walks and foundations (high pH). Simply dig a shallow hole and set the rootball in and backfill. Because these are rhizomatous plants, planting depth is not super critical but deeper is probably better than shallow. Cover with a shallow mulch (bark). Weeding is important as blueberries do not tolerate heavy competition.

, This forces the plants to put their energy into vegetative growth. The first few sets of fruit aren't much anyway; doing this will pay good dividends in the fruit set approximately 3-4 years later.

Choose the best variety of pear tree for you.,
Plant your pear tree at the right time of year.,
Consider planting more than one pear tree.,
Follow the correct planting technique.,
Water the young tree regularly in dry periods until established.",How to Keep a Pear Tree Healthy1," Choose a fire blight resistant variety that will thrive in your local climate. If you plant a pear tree that doesn’t do well in your area, you will most likely have a sick tree on your hands, no matter how well you take care of it. Remember some pear varieties are better for cooking and some better for eating straight from the tree.


Talk to an employee at your local plant nursery to determine what kind of pear trees thrive best in your area.
When picking out your pear tree, consider what you plan to use the pears for.;
, If you purchase bare-root plants then plant them quickly to keep them healthy. They need to be planted between the late fall and early spring.


If you purchase a pear tree in a container with soil, try to plant the tree in winter if possible.

, Ideally you should plant at least two pear trees because they need to be pollinated by another tree in order to bear a good crop of fruit.If you can’t manage to plant more than one then you’ll need to rely on there being another pear tree fairly nearby that can fertilize your own tree.
Try to pick out two different kinds of pear trees; it is beneficial if your pear is pollinated by a different cultivar that flowers at the same time. Trees will need at least 20 feet (6.1 m) of spacing between them.

, To plant the tree in the ground, make a hole the same depth as the roots, but at least twice the diameter. Place the plant in the planting hole and fill in the soil, eliminating any air pockets.


Gently firm down the soil and water well. You can add a slow release (granular) fertilizer but avoid other kinds of fertilizers as this will cause damage.
You shouldn’t need to prune your tree the first year but consider fertilizing lightly in the first spring.

, It can take a year or two for your tree to become established. Even established pear trees will appreciate a watering in dry periods. Try to water deeply at long intervals rather than giving less water at shorter intervals.


As a guide, you should water your tree when the soil feels fairly dry about three inches below the surface of the soil. Don’t water against the trunk but instead keep the water at the edges of the leaf canopy.

Water the strawberry plants via the gravel at the top of the jar.,
Place the strawberry jar on a saucer if keeping it on a surface that cannot absorb the water or handle soil stains.

,
Place the strawberry jar in a sunny area of your home.",How to Plant a Strawberry Jar," This will keep the moisture of the soil from leaching out to the terracotta jar.;
, Use pebbles or similar items to do this.

, The opening of the tube needs to be above the jar rim. Fill the tube with gravel.

, Do this around the inserted tube, keeping it centered.


Use soil specifically labeled as suitable for strawberries. This will contain the right type of soil for the strawberries and helps them to grow well.
Ensure the soil comes out into the jar's outlets where the plants will be sitting once planted.

, The gravel will stay in place while the soil compacts around it.

, Plant these in the various outlets of the strawberry jar.

, This will ensure that they receive adequate water as it trickles through the gravel into the soil but are not overwatered.

,, Alternatively, place it on a patio or outdoors in the garden.

Apply a small amount of fertilizer early in the year.,
Adjust the amount of fertilizer depending on the tree’s growth.,
Avoid over-fertilizing your tree.,
Follow some general pruning guidelines.,
Prune for your variety.,
Thin the fruit.,
Remove any unhealthy growth.",How to Keep a Pear Tree Healthy2," An effective way to apply fertilizer is to sprinkle a granular fertilizer around the base of the tree in early spring. If your soil is very fertile, use less fertilizer.


Fertilizer will keep your tree growing strong and healthy. Fertilizer gives your tree an added boost of nutrients that can help it to flourish.

, If you see pale or yellowish foliage on your tree over the summer then use a bit more fertilizer the following spring.


If your tree grows by more than about a foot over the summer, apply less fertilizer the next year.

, While the right amount of fertilizer can keep your tree healthy, too much fertilizer, especially if high in nitrogen, makes trees more susceptible to fire blight. Don’t feel you have to fertilize your tree regularly.

, Pruning timing and method depends on your variety but these general rules apply:


Don’t prune pear trees heavily but do prune them regularly.
Prune when the tree is dormant and before the spring growth period starts.

, Dwarf pear trees need a different approach to pruning than standard-sized trees. Timing and method will vary depending on your variety.

If you do not not when you should prune your tree, talk to an employee at your local plant nursery, or run an online search for your specific kind of tree.

, Try to thin your tree’s fruit, leaving around six inches of space between each cluster of fruit on a branch.


When possible, thin the fruit out by picking the ripe fruit from the tree; that way, both your tree and your belly stay happy and healthy.

, Always remove any crossing, rubbing, weak, dead, diseased, damaged or dying branches. Any diseased growth should be burnt rather than placed in the compost bin so as to keep the disease from spreading.

Understand what fire blight is.,
Take steps to prevent fire blight.,
Prune away parts of the tree that have been affected by fire blight.,
Learn how to deal with other potential diseases.,
Know that the weather can work against you.",How to Keep a Pear Tree Healthy3," Fire blight is an especial problem for pear trees and can severely damage or kill your tree. Affected trees look like they have been burnt. This disease is caused by insects that bring the disease to the tree., To keep fire blight at by, select a pear variety that is resistant to the problem. Help your tree resist fire blight by keeping it well watered during the spring and summer; mulching will also help conserve water.


Don’t prune your tree too heavily as new growth is more susceptible to fire blight than old.

, If your tree is affected, prune each affected bit of growth to at least three inches below where the damage is visible.


Sterilize your cutting tool after making each cut. Use a solution of chlorine to do this. This is a precaution to take to keep the disease from spreading.
After removing the affected growth, be sure to burn it and avoid composting the diseased growth.
If your tree is very badly affected it may need to be replaced. Select a resistant variety when replacing it.

, Apart from fire blight, pear trees can be affected by other diseases:


Brown rot is sometimes a problem in wet summers. You’ll see the fruit rot into a brown color with white patches. Dispose of the affected fruit.
Pear rust causes orange leaf spots; you just need to remove and burn affected growth as you would for fire blight.
Pear leaf blister mite causes yellow or red leaf blisters that turn black. Again you just need to remove and destroy affected foliage; it’s still okay to eat the fruit.

, Despite all the care you put into your tree, sometimes you just have to accept the weather can work against you. Late frosts and hail storms will dislodge buds, leading to poor fruit set. It’s difficult to protect against this.

It’s also normal to see pear trees drop fruit in the summer. It’s especially likely if the tree is young or under pressure from lack of water or pest attack.

Determine what variety of strawberry plant fits best with your needs.,
Find the plants.,
Always inspect your potential plants for disease or signs of poor health.,
Decide where to grow your strawberries.",How to Grow Strawberries1," There are two basic types of strawberry plants, namely summer producing strawberries and perpetual (ever-bearing) strawberries. Summer producing strawberries can be broken down into early, mid and late summer plants. There are many varieties within each grouping of strawberries and some are likely to be very localized, so ask your local garden center for more specific advice. Very generally, some of the varieties are as follows:


Ever-bearing or perpetual strawberry plant: This is the most popular of the strawberries because it keeps on growing for a good five or so years. It produces a fair amount fruit throughout the year (outdoors in temperate climates, in an indoor container for colder areas). Both of these features make it a good choice if you are looking for a continuous supply.

June fruiting bearing variety: This plant will provide you with one large supply of strawberries in early to mid summer, depending on planting time (summer crops will produce fruit about two months after planting). Purchase this variety if you're looking to cook with and/or freeze your harvest.
Day neutral strawberry plants: These are similar to ever-bearing but will produce much smaller numbers of strawberries throughout the year. This is an ideal variety if you're looking to eat strawberries fresh out of the ground.
Alpine strawberries: This strawberry plant is a very small types of strawberry. The fruit may be small but it's packed with flavor, making these strawberries ideal for jam makers.
;
, Most garden centers will stock strawberry plants but if you want a specific variety, you might need to check online or ask for specific stock to be ordered in. It is always helpful to get the advice of the local garden center as to what type of strawberry grows best in your local conditions.


It is best to buy strawberry plants at the exact time you intend to plant them into the ground or container. Leaving them for too long in their store-bought pots can cause them to become root-bound, unhealthy and lacking in enough vigor to grow well when replanted.

, Your strawberry plants should have vibrant green leaves and are free from spots, brown edges, or wilted ends. The roots should be plentiful and very light in color.


Consider purchasing disease-resistant strawberry plants. Though this option is generally more expensive, these plants are well-known for withstanding the numerous types of fungal diseases that strawberry plants are susceptible to.

, Strawberries are happy in both garden beds or containers, provided you give them what they need by way of soil and fertilizer. It's up to you, take into consideration the space you have available and the temperatures in your location. For example, if you want to grow strawberries all year round in a cold climate, consider growing them in a container that can be easily moved indoors and outdoors during the different seasons.


Strawberries grow well in all but the most tropical of climates.

"
"
Understand that strawberries grow from the crown.,
Note that you'll find strawberry seeds on the outside of the fruit.",How to Grow Strawberries2," This is what looks like the base of the plant before the roots start. This crown cannot be covered when planting the strawberry plant, either in garden beds or containers. However, it should not be left too exposed either––always check to ensure that the crown is sitting just above the soil.

, This is a fairly unusual placement for seeds in fruit but it is part of what makes the strawberry such an interesting fruit. If you do intend to grow from seed, a section has been provided below to help you do this.


Be aware that growing from seed can be tricky and it'll be a year before the plant bears fruit.

"
"
Plant at the right time.,
Choose a warm and sunny spot.,
Dig the soil over well.,
Remove the strawberry plant from the store container.,
Dig a hole in the soil.,
Press the soil firmly and gently around the base of the strawberry plant.

,
Continue planting in the same way if you have other strawberry plants.,
Water regularly.,
Use a liquid fertilizer to provide nourishment.,
Pluck off the first flowers.,
Check regularly.,
Harvest the strawberries.,
Continue to tend the plants.",How to Grow Strawberries3," This will be determined by the strawberry variety you've chosen, so read the label or consult the retailer from whom you're purchasing the plants.Large fruiting varieties of strawberries are best planted in summer, usually in the second month of summer and at the latest, by the first half of the last month of summer.
Alpine strawberries are best planted during the second and third months of spring.
Perpetual strawberries can actually benefit from an autumn/fall planting rather than a winter planting, as this gives them more time to grow accustomed to the new plot and establish a healthy root system. (This planting time is appropriate for gardens in temperate climate zones.)

, Strawberries love areas that get a lot of direct sunlight without shade. They also appreciate minimal wind. A strawberry plant will produce strawberries in partial shade if need be but the crop will never be as prolific as a plant kept in full sun.

, Add lots of compost to enrich the soil and remove any weeds, including the roots of weeds.


Strawberries like rich soil the most. If the soil is heavy clay or poor sand, add well-decomposed organic material. Mulch after planting, to protect the surface soil and to keep the strawberries clean.
If the soil is very acidic, add three quarters of a cup of dolomite per square meter of complete plant food before planting.

, Place the root ball into a bucket of water to soak for an hour or so. This helps to ease the shock of the transition from pot to ground, and ensures that the roots stay moist enough.

, Place the strawberry plant in the hole, keeping the crown above the soil line.

,, Keep each plant about 35–40 centimeter (13.8–15.7 in) apart. It making rows, keep the strawberries about 90 centimeter (35.4 in) apart.

, However, don't overdo the water––the shallow roots need water in hot weather but don't like being soggy. Avoid letting the soil dry out and avoid making it into a mud bath! The time for a decent soaking is when the soil appears dry at the surface to about 1cm/ 1/2 an inch down (stick your finger in to check).


Water the crown of the plant. Avoid watering fruit––this can cause fruit to rot.

, Choose a fertilizer suited to strawberries.


Strawberry plants that are given water-soluble fertilizers that are high in nitrogen will perform poorly, producing lots of leaf growth rather than focusing on bearing fruits. If you wish to use this type of fertilizer, minimize its application.

, By removing the first flowers that appear, you will give the strawberry plant a chance to grow more vigorously and produce a stronger root system. Allow subsequent flowers to keep growing.


Runners are also best removed. If the strawberry plant is going to produce these, you'll see them about a month into growing. Runners deplete the energy of the strawberry plant, so keep them under control until the plant is well established. Later on, you can leave one runner to grow to establish new plants if you're growing the strawberries in the garden but never let a plant have more than one runner at a time or it will be weakened and the energy will go into growing plant rather than strawberries.

, The first signs that the strawberry flowers have turned into fruit will be small green strawberries. These will continue to grow and then turn red when they're ripe.


You may need to deal with the birds. Birds love strawberries too, and if you discover that they're pinching the strawberries, you will need to create a barrier. You can use fine garden mesh/strawberry net to throw over the plants; this will stop most birds from getting in to take the strawberries. Another option is one for the birds and one for you. If the birds aren't too greedy, you can leave some for them and take some for you; this tends to work best where the birds are often scared off by something like a cat, the flash of something bright like hanging CDs or noise.

, When the whole strawberry is red, it's ready to pick. Take a bowl or basket to your plant or strawberry patch and pick straight from the bush. Always pick so that the stem is left intact; hulling should occur only when eating or preparing for a dish.


Give freshly picked strawberries a quick, gentle wash in cold water before eating fresh.

, Strawberry plants are fairly hardy and they'll continue to produce fruit year after year, for at least five years before they need to be replaced. For overwintering in temperate climate zones, clear away weeds, straw, mulch, etc. and leave to grow untended. If it snows where you live, use container strawberries and bring them indoors.


Consider replacing strawberry stock every two years if you experience problems with viruses destroying the plants. Discard the old stock completely and bring in new stock that is virus free.

Choose a potting container with drainage holes.,
Fill the pot two-thirds full with potting mix.,
Water the soil until the water starts to drain from the bottom of the pot.,
Gently lift your strawberry plants from their nursery pots.,
Fill a bucket or other container with water.,
Remove the plants from the soaking water and set a plant on top of each soil mound.,
Fill the pot with more soil, bringing the soil to the level of the plant’s crown.,
Water the plants thoroughly.,
Done.,
Harvest when ready.",How to Grow Strawberries4," Although you can buy special strawberry pots that have multiple openings, it isn’t absolutely necessary; strawberries can grow and produce fruit in any container that has good soil and gets enough sunlight.


Place broken terracotta or ceramics at the base of the container, or large pebbles/small rocks. These will help ensure good drainage.

, The strawberry pot should have at least an 18” diameter. Even though strawberries have shallow roots, they do produce runners that need some space to extend.


Strawberries thrive in soil that has a pH between 5.3 and 6.5, so select a potting soil with that ratio. It’s a good idea to keep your soil rich by adding a handful of compost to the container once a month.
If growing in a tall and narrow unglazed strawberry jar, add a quarter peat moss before adding the soil, to increase the moisture-retaining ability of the jar.
If growing in a hanging basket, line the basket with sphagnum moss and use peaty soil. Again, this is to retain moisture for the plants. Sphagnum moss will also allow for the plant to grow out the sides of the pot, which looks nice.

, Then make 5 or 6 mounds of soil about 1” (25.4 mm) tall. Space the mounds at least 6” (152.4 mm) apart so that the runners will have room to roam. The mounds themselves shouldn’t be more than 3” (76.2 mm) wide.

, If necessary, cut the pot with scissors if the plant is wedged in too tightly. Carefully shake off the extra soil while separating the delicate roots with your fingers.

, Soak the strawberry roots for an hour, so they can absorb enough to keep them hydrated.

, Arrange the roots so that they extend down the sides of the mounds.

, The stems emerge from the crown, so don’t bury it under the soil.

, Continue to gently water until the pot begins to drain. (Add more soil if necessary—the thorough watering will often collapse air pockets and reduce the soil level.)


Use a watering can with a sprinkler attachment to avoid eroding the soil.

, The container can now be placed outside (hanging or sitting on the ground), or in a warm and sunny spot inside.

, Wait for a few to accumulate or simply eat them as they ripen. How many you'll get per harvest will depend on the amount you've grown and the container's size.

Remove the plastic wrap from the planter when the seeds have sprouted.,
Thin the strawberry plants after the seeds have sprouted.",How to Grow Strawberries5,",,, The seeds are small; some people use tweezers to transfer the seeds from the package to the soil.

, Tamp down the soil over each seed hole. You can simply press your finger over the soil. Don't push too hard because that can cause the soil to compact and the seeds will have to struggle to emerge.

, This will keep the soil moist while the seeds germinate.

, The strawberries will benefit from a warm spot with plenty of light. Put your planter near a radiator or other heat source during the winter.

, Keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Check the soil daily to make sure it doesn't dry out.

, Once the seedlings reach the top of the plastic, they will need room to keep growing, so don't leave the plastic on. The soil will dry out more quickly when it is uncovered, so check for dryness every day.

, Do this by pinching or snipping off the smallest plants. Leave about 6” (152.4 mm) between the remaining plants.

Fill a container with soil.,
Pick up the runner and push it into the pot of soil.,
Let the runner sit attached like this for at least one month.,
Separate the runner from the mother plant.",How to Grow Strawberries6," Place it next to the strawberry plant that is sending forth runners.

, Leave attached to the main plant and cover only a portion of the runner––the other side will need to stick out over the pot to keep its balance.

, During this time, water regularly, at the same time as the mother plant; this is to keep the soil moist and encourage root growth.

, After a month, cut the runner from the mother plant––use clean or sterilized garden snips to do this, so as to avoid introducing a disease at the cut site.

Choose a good container.,
Fill with good quality soil.,
Select suitable soft fruit for container growing.,
Grow according to normal instructions.,
Keep pests off.",How to Grow Soft Fruits in Containers," There are special containers pre-made in pottery, ceramic etc. for growing strawberries and these come with many drainage and growth outlets. The key to good soft fruit containers is excellent drainage. A really good alternative to pre-made containers is to use a barrel. Drill a lot of holes in the barrel to provide drainage points (and in the case of soft fruits that creep, such as strawberries, you create places for the plant to spill out). Also consider adding castor wheels to the barrel so that you can easily move it indoors to protect the plant from frost and snow. Soft fruits that grow on canes can be grown in barrels or other large containers with good drainage. Large terracotta pots with adequate drainage can also be considered, provided they are large enough to prevent waterlogging.;
, Pebbles at the base of the container are a good idea to assist with drainage, then add good quality soil over the top to about halfway. At halfway up, add another round of pebbles to create a break-up layer in between the soil, then add the rest of the soil.

, There is a variety of suitable soft fruits for growing in containers. For example:
Strawberries






Raspberries






Blackberries






Blueberries






Figs (Brown Turkey is the best container choice) - figs fruit happily when their roots are restricted







, Follow the growing instructions for the fruit selected, and keep nutrients and watering up as normal. Move container to more or less sun as required and bring indoors or into frost-free area during colder months.

, The introductory image shows one method of keeping the birds off strawberry plants. It is a little easier to keep pests off container fruits as you can move the container around the yard or into sheltered areas. Other means for keeping birds off include netting, which can be suspended above a tepee arrangement situated over the pot, and whirly garden decorations that move in the wind - many of these come on sticks and can be easily stuck into the container.

Buy strawberry plants from your local nursery.,
Choose a potting container with drainage holes for your strawberry plants.,
Fill your pot 2/3 full of potting mix.,
Water the soil until the water starts to drain from the bottom of the pot.,
Gently lift your strawberry plants from their nursery pots.,
Fill a bucket or other container with water.,
Remove the plants from the soaking water and set a plant on top of each soil mound.,
Fill the pot with more soil, bringing the soil to the plant’s crown.,
Water the plants thoroughly.",How to Grow Strawberries in a Pot1," Make sure they don’t have brown leaves and that they look healthy and green.;
, Although you can buy special strawberry pots that have multiple openings, it is not necessary. Strawberries can grow and produce fruit in any container that has good soil and gets enough sunlight.

, Your strawberry pot should have at least an 18” diameter. Even though strawberries have shallow roots, they do produce runners that need some space to extend.

, Then make 5 or 6 mounds of soil about 1” (25.4 mm) tall. Space the mounds at least 6” (152.4 mm) apart so the runners will have room to roam. The mounds themselves shouldn’t be more than 3” (76.2 mm) wide.

, If necessary, cut the pot with scissors if the plant is wedged in too tightly. Carefully shake off the extra soil while separating the delicate roots with your fingers.

, Soak the strawberry roots for an hour, so they can absorb enough to keep them hydrated.

, Arrange the roots so they extend down the sides of the mounds.

, The stems emerge from the crown, so don’t bury it under the soil.

, Use a sprinkler can so you do not erode the soil. Continue to water gently until the pot begins to drain. (Add more soil if necessary—the thorough watering will often collapse air pockets and reduce the soil level.)

Purchase seeds at your local nursery.,
Use plastic wrap to cover the top of the planter.,
Place the planter in a sunny location.,
Water the seeds.,
Remove the plastic wrap from the planter when the seeds have sprouted.,
Thin the strawberry plants after the seeds have sprouted.",How to Grow Strawberries in a Pot2," Once you have filled your planter with soil and watered it thoroughly:


Use your finger to make 1/4"" (6 mm) depressions in the soil, spacing the holes 6” (152.4 mm) apart.
Place 3 seeds in each hole. The seeds are small; some people use tweezers to transfer the seeds from the package to the soil.
Cover the seeds. Tamper down the soil over each seed hole. You can simply press your finger over the soil. Don't push too hard because that can cause the soil to compact and the seeds will have to struggle to emerge.

, This will keep the soil moist while the seeds germinate.

, The strawberries will benefit from a warm spot with plenty of light. Put your planter near a radiator or other heat source during the winter.

, Keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Check the soil daily to make sure it doesn't dry out.

, Once the seedlings reach the top of the plastic, they will need room to keep growing, so don't leave the plastic on. The soil will dry out more quickly when it is uncovered, so check for dryness every day.

, Do this by pinching or snipping off the smallest plants. Leave about 6” (152.4 mm) between the remaining plants.

Enjoy the grapes.",How to Grow Scuppernongs," Scuppernongs thrive in areas with plenty of light. The yield will decrease dramatically if the vines sit in shade for more than a few hours each day of the growing season.;
, These grapes need to be planted in soil with good internal drainage. Watch the area after a rainstorm. If water stands for more than an hour, you may need to amend the soil to improve the drainage.


Completely avoid soils with hardpan or clay.
If you need to amend the soil for drainage, consider mixing wood chips, sand, or perlite into the soil several weeks before planting.
Check the soil pH. The pH should be between 6.0 and 6.5. If you need to raise the pH and lower the acidity of the soil, add dolomitic lime. Doing so will also improve the drainage of the soil.

, You should install a trellis system before planting the vines. One-wire and two-wire systems are better than fences, posts, garden arches, or similar systems.


For a one-wire system:Space two 5-inch (12.7-cm) wide, 5-foot (1.5-m) long end posts 20 feet (6.1 m) apart, centering one grapevine in between them.
String number nine wire between the tops of both posts. The vines will be trained and supported along this wire.


For a two-wire system:

Space two 6-inch (15.24-cm) wide, 5-foot (1.5-m) tall end posts 20 feet (6.1 m) apart.
Place one 4-inch by 4-inch (10-cm by 10-cm) cross arm at the time of each post.
String number nine wire between the two cross arms at both ends.



, Varieties with dark purple skins are less prone to fruit rot and other diseases, so in some ways, they are easier to maintain.Consider choosing ""perfect flowered"" cultivars, which contain both male and female flower parts on a single vine. Some options include:

Nesbitt, Noble, and Regale (black/purple varieties)
Carlos, Doreen, Magnolia, and Triumph (bronze varieties)



, Potted plants are easier to maintain until planting. Scuppernong vines that are already one year in age are ideal.


If you choose bare-root plants, keep the roots moist by misting them with a spray bottle every few days. You should also keep bare-root plants refrigerated until you are ready to transplant them into your garden.

, Plan on transplanting scuppernongs when you no longer have to worry about sub-freezing temperatures. Frost can hinder the development of young vines.


In the southern United States, you can usually plant scuppernongs in late February through March. Plants kept in containers can technically be planted at any point during the year, but if you opt for bare-root plants, you must adhere to this schedule more strictly.

, The hole should be at least as deep as the container currently holding the scuppernong vine, if not a little deeper.


Each planting hole should also be about twice as wide as the diameter of the current container. You need to provide plenty of space for the roots to spread without any risk of crowding.

, Gently remove the plant from its current container and center the roots in the planting hole. Partially cover the roots with topsoil, then fill the rest of the hole with loose soil.


Scatter the soil around the roots and use your hands to firmly pack it in as you work.
Water the soil after transplanting the vine and filling in the hole. The water should help settle the soil and will also give the roots a boost of nourishment.
Spread 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of compost or shredded leaves over the soil to help retain moisture around each newly planted vine.

, Separate vines should be 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6.1 meters) apart within a single row.If you plant multiple rows of scuppernongs, the rows should be spaced 8 to 12 feet (2.4 to 3.7 meters) apart.

, Within a week or so after planting, use clean shears to prune the vine back to one stem. Choose the healthiest, strongest stem for best results.


You must also cut this stem back to two or three buds.

, As new growth begins to develop, determine which shoot is the most vigorous and remove the others.

, Use paper-covered wire ties or twine to loosely attach the growing vine to your training system.


Since the vine is still small, it may not be tall enough to reach the wire of your trellis system. For this reason, consider installing a bamboo training stake directly beside the plant. Tie the fresh vine onto this stake, then remove the stake once the vine is tall enough to reach the trellis wires.
You may need to tie the vine on a weekly basis.
Continue to remove any side shoots that develop during this time.

, Once the vine is tall enough to reach the wire of your trellis system, cut the growing tip back to the top bud.


Doing this forces lateral buds to form.
Lateral buds will form cordons that need to be trained down along the wires of your trellis system. Tie them onto the wire loosely.

, After the cordons reach their full length, you can let side shoots develop. These side shoots will need to be cut back to two or three buds each dormant season, though.


These buds will develop into shoots that produce both flowers and fruit.

, You'll need to apply a balanced 10-10-10 (10% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus, 10% potassium) fertilizer between March and early April each year, but the exact amount can vary depending on the maturity of the vine.During the first and second years, apply 1/4 lb (115 g) of 10-10-10 fertilizer after planting, 2 oz (60 g) 34-0-0 fertilizer in late May, and 2 oz (60 g) 34-0-0 fertilizer in early July.
During the third year, apply 2 lbs (900 g) 10-10-10 fertilizer per vine in March and 1 lb (450 g) of 10-10-10 fertilizer in May.
Beyond the third year, apply 3 to 5 lb (1350 to 2250 g) of 10-10-10 fertilizer in March. You may also need to apply 1/2 lb (225 g) ammonium nitrate at the beginning of June.
Scuppernongs also need considerably large amounts of magnesium. If older leaves begin yellowing between their veins, apply 2 to 4 oz (30 to 60 g) of Epsom salts to the soil of one or two year old vines, or 4 to 6 oz (60 to 80 g) Epsom salts for older vines.
Mature vines planted in sandy soils with naturally high pH levels may need a dose of boron every two to three years. For every 20-by-20 foot (6.1-by-6.1-meter) area, apply 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of Borax by mixing it into your usual fertilizer.

, During the first two years of growth, remove any weeks that develop within 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm) of the base of each vine.


If left alone, weeds could deprive the young plants of much needed nutrients they would otherwise use to establish themselves.

, Scatter 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of coarse, non-nitrogen-releasing bark mulch around the base of each vine in the early spring.


This mulch should help reduce weed problems while retaining an appropriate amount of moisture within the soil.

, Even though scuppernongs are fairly drought-resistant, you should water the vines during dry periods during the first two years of growth.


Mature vines are typically able to get the water they need from the soil even during dry spells. The only time you may need to water established vines would be between the bud-break and flowering periods. Only water sparingly and during dry spells, though.

, These grapes can usually be grown without pesticides or fungicides, but when problems arise, you will have to treat the plants with an appropriate product.


The most common insect problems are Japanese beetles, grape berry moths, and grape root borers.
The most common disease problems are bitter rot, Macrophoma rot, angular leaf spot, ripe rot, and black rot.
Make sure that any pesticides or fungicides you use are safe to use with edible plants. Many chemicals can be toxic when ingested.

, Ripe scuppernongs should be uniform in both shape and color, regardless of what color they reach.When ripe, these grapes should also have a sweet scent.

, Instead of clipping whole bunches from the vine, you should pluck individual grapes from the vine as they ripen.


Harvest individual grapes by simply picking them off their stems. Ripe grapes should fall away from the stem without much resistance. No cutting tools should be needed.

, Keep the harvested grapes in a shallow container and place them in your refrigerator.


For optimum nutrition and flavor, enjoy the grapes within a few days. Most scuppernongs can be kept up to a week without a problem.
Inspect the grapes regularly while storing them. Remove any that seem notably soft or otherwise decayed.

, Scuppernongs are usually consumed without their skins, but the skins can be eaten.


To eat a scuppernong, hold the stem side of the grape in your mouth and bite or squeeze the opposite end. The pulp and juice should break free from the skin and pop into your mouth.
The skin and seeds are usually discarded, but they contain antioxidants and other nutrients, so you might want to consume them, as well.

Harvest your raspberries in late summer or early fall.",How to Grow Raspberries," Raspberries come in three different colors: red, yellow, and black. Some variants of black have more of a purplish-black hue. Each color has a different general flavor profile and level of hardiness.


In most cases, you'll find that red and yellow raspberries are the sweetest colors, especially compared to black ones, which have a deeper, richer flavor.
Red raspberries may want to be prioritized for beginning growers. Generally, these can be counted on to be the most hearty of the three colors.Black raspberries are the most difficult of the three colors to maintain. These are more susceptible to disease and environmental changes.;
, Raspberries are either summer-bearers or ever-bearers. Summer-bearers only bear one crop per season during summertime. Ever-bearers, on the other hand, produce one harvest in summer and another in the fall.Popular summer-bearers:

Latham (round, dark red fruit)
Meeker (deep red, extremely sweet, high sugar content)
Willamette (firm and slightly tart)
Brandywine (large, purplish-black fruit)
Black Hawk (deep black, juicy berry)



Popular ever-bearers:

Amity (medium-sized, dark red, firm, and fragrant)
Fall Gold (golden yellow color, very sweet)
September (tart, juicy, with medium sized fruit)Heritage (rich in flavor, firm, large fruit size), Select plants that bear fruit throughout the summer months and well into the fall. By doing so, you can create an ongoing harvest so you can have fresh raspberries throughout the growing season.


One possible combination could be mixing Algonquin (ever-bearing) with Autumn Bliss (midsummer-bearing).
Another summer-bearing only combo might include: Boyne (early summer), Citadel (midsummer), Encore (late summer) Double Delight (early fall), Durham (fall)., When it comes to growing plants, climates are usually broken up into ""hardiness zones."" The lower the number of your zone, the colder its climate and (generally) the farther it is from the equator. Your hardiness zone can be looked up on the USDA website.The zones that plants are best suited for are usually listed with their care information. For the best results in your plants, only choose plants rated for your zone.
In northern areas, you should use hardier, more cold-tolerant varieties of raspberry, like Boyne, Nova, and Nordic.
In southern climates, choose raspberries that can withstand high heat and potential dryness, like Dorman Red, Bababerry, and Southland varieties., Full sunlight, in gardening terms, means at least 6 hours of sun, but in some cases plants requiring full sunlight might need 8 or even 10 hours of light to thrive.For raspberries, aim to expose them to as much light as possible.


Warm sunshine has a tendency to improve the quality of raspberry fruit, making it juicier and more flavorful. Fruit with poor light might turn out stunted and shriveled.
You may have to move garden or yard items that block the sun to your raspberries. Prune back trees or bushes that could block the sun., Although environmentally hardy, raspberry plants are susceptible to wind damage. Plant your raspberry plants near a fence or on the side of a structure to block the wind. Set up a wind block for plants by stringing a sheet or tarp between posts.


Provide additional support for your berries by stringing two guidelines between two row-end T-trellises or V-trellises. Each line should be separated by 3½ ft (1.1 m) to create a space for the berries to grow, and should be about 3½ ft high., You'll be planting your raspberries in rows. Plan for, within a row, red and yellow varieties being separated by a distance of about 2 ft (.61 m). Black and purple varieties should be kept 3 ft (.91 m) from other same-row plants. Distance between rows should be between 6 and 24 in (15.2 and 61 cm).


Spacing your plants adequately will help them receive the most sunlight possible, which will encourage the best possible harvest., Rich, well-draining, sandy loam soil will provide the best growing conditions for your raspberries. Improve your soil quality by using plant formulated soil and mixing in compost with it.Avoid planting in low-lying areas where water may collect after a heavy rain. Standing water can contribute to mildew, mold, root rot, and other kinds of plant disease.Although raspberries fare poorly in standing water or when overwatered, make sure water is easily available. Water supply is especially important during dry times of the season.
Refrain from planting raspberries in soil previously used for bramble berries, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplants, or roses. These can leave behind diseases.
Destroy any wild growing raspberries or blackberries within about 600 ft (183 m) of those you plant. Wild berries can also transmit diseases to your healthy berries., Most berries do best in slightly acidic soil, and raspberries flourish with a pH rating between 5.6 and 6.2.You can purchase pH testing kits at your local nursery or home center, but you might also check out other methods as well.


You should be able to find soil pH testing forms, bags, and instructions at your local agricultural extension office as well.
In most cases, you can easily lower the pH level of your soil by mixing granular sulfur with it. This is available at most nurseries and home centers.

, Seeds should be sown according to their package instructions in a plastic peat pot with sterile soil that is low in nutrients at about mid-winter. Space seeds one inch apart and then use your finger to push them about an inch (2.5 cm) into the ground. Cover seeds with a thin layer of loose soil/sand and store them in a dim, cool place indoors.Keep the seeds lightly moist with a spray bottle. Place the seeds outside in partial sunlight when temperatures reach at least 60ºF (15.6ºC).
Seeds should should be transplanted into your garden after growing at least one inch in height and developing leaves., You'll want these to be at least one year old. Cultivated plants come in two basic types: those with bare roots covered in plastic peat containers and tissue-cultured plants.Check with the nursery or home center where you purchase seedlings to make sure they are certified disease-free and have been propagated from virus-indexed stock., This is the best time to plant both seedlings and grown plants. This will allow the ideal amount of time for maturation. Grown plants should bear fruit by the end of summer. For ever-bearers, expect to find fruit into fall as well. Feel free to add raspberry plants to your patch throughout the summer months.


Check the weather report before planting. If there's a fear of frost or a temperature drop, you may want to keep already dormant plants in stasis by keeping them in a refrigerator. Plant these berries as soon as possible.Lay down a layer of straw over your plants to protect them from frost. Use ground cover, like a tarp or sheet, to prevent frost damage. Remove tarps or sheets in the early morning.

, Plants simply in a root ball should be easy to free from their packaging. Tap plants in containers with the heel of your wrist. This will loosen the roots. Slide the plant out and catch the soil gently.


Be careful not to handle your plants too roughly. Pulling at the stem or the roots can damage your plants.

, Within each row, separate red and yellow raspberry plants by a distance of 2 ft (.61 m) apart. Black raspberries will need at least 3 ft (.91 m) between each plant in a row. Be sure to keep about 6 to 24 in (15.2 to 61 cm) between rows when you are planting.


Newly planted or freshly germinated plants will require about a year before they begin to fill out and can bear fruit., This should be just deep enough to cover the roots without touching the lowest leaves. Place the plant in the hole and cover it with soil. Cover any exposed roots but avoid burying its foliage.


The depth for raspberry plant holes is usually about 3 to 4 in (7.6 cm to 10.2 cm). Use a simple hand shovel to dig the holes.

, Use your best judgement when mulching. You can add up to 4 inches (10.2 cm), but don't add so much that the berries struggle to grow among the mulch. Gardening mulch can be bought at most nurseries and home centers.


Other common inexpensive substitutes for store bought mulch includes hay, leaves, or bark.

, Alternatively, soak the roots of raspberries in water for an hour or two before planting.Add a ½ tsp (2.5 ml) of a vitamin B1 growth stimulant per quart water the roots are soaking in for even better results from your planting.Heavily watering after planting can help plants to recover from the shock of transplanting. At minimum, thoroughly water you plants after planting.

, Generally, you want the soil around your plants to be damp in summer and dry in winter. A soaker hose, where water seeps out of a hose line to water plants, should provide enough moisture for your berries if used for an hour or two every week.In some cases, like during heat or dry spells, you may need to water your berries more than usual.

, Training your plants by pruning them will encourage a rich and productive crop. Remove canes (stems) outside the 12 to 18 in (30.5 to 45.7 cm) total row width. Cut away any canes that are damaged, infested with insects, or appear diseased.


For summer-harvest crops of red raspberries, cut down discolored, grayish canes after they have finished producing fruit. Leave new, healthy plants.
For fall-harvest crops, cut off all the canes at ground level after they have finished producing fruit.
For black raspberries, cut off the side fruit-producing branches after harvesting. Remove weak and untrained branches. When not producing, cut off small canes.
Remove the smallest, ineffective canes from all plants in late winter. Ideally, three to six strong, healthy canes will remain after this process.

, You can apply a few inches of mature compost and/or an organic fertilizer, such as fish emulsion, to promote healthy, productive plants. A homemade, organic raspberry fertilizer might look like:



Organic homemade raspberry fertilizer: 4 parts canola seed meal (or fish meal), 1 part dolomitic lime (to offset acidity in the seed meal), 1 part rock phosphate (or ½ part bone meal), 1 part kelp meal., The berries should be rich in color and come free easily from the plant. Some varieties, however, offer a bit of resistance when being picked. Taste a few berries to determine if they are sweet enough to harvest. As the color darkens, the sugar level increases.Harvest berries early in the morning when it is still cold outside. This prevents them from smashing as you pick them.
Rinse your berries and eat them immediately after harvesting. Though raspberries will keep in the refrigerator for several days, they are best eaten fresh.

Freeze extra raspberries for later use in baking. Try putting putting them in jams or preserves, pies, etc."

Watch your quince tree grow and fruit.",How to Grow Quince,"


Quinces cannot grow in places where the temperature drops below -15 degrees F (-25 degrees C), but must have a cool period during winter in order to produce fruit.
They also prefer inland conditions because in moist, coastal areas they are more likely to be attacked by fleck, which is a streaking of the wood caused by insect attacks.;
,


If you wish to eat the fruits of your quince, be certain to pick a variety that yields edible fruit. Some varieties of quince trees are purely ornamental.
Angers, Orange, Pineapple, Champion and Smyrna are varieties of quince to consider. They are readily available and produce edible fruits.

,


Quince trees prefer sites that receive full sun and have moist, porous and slightly acidic fertile soil.
They cannot tolerate quick changes in temperature and need to be planted in a protected area with a good windbreak.
Also, late frosts can damage quince flowers once they form, so it is best to plant them in areas that are not prone to late frosts.

, While quince trees are capable of self-pollination, they produce more fruit when they are cross-pollinated.

,


Quinces are often propagated from hardwood cuttings. The cuttings should be taken in the late fall or early winter and should be about 10 inches (25 cm) long.
Another common method is to start quince trees from seeds. Seeds should be planted in late winter or early spring. They can be planted directly in the ground or started in a small pot. You can also buy young quince trees from a greenhouse.

,


Dig a hole that is about two times as big and deep as the pot in which the quince trees are growing.
Put some compost or peat moss in the hole to enrich the soil.
Loosen the root ball on the quince tree and plant it at or above the same level that it was planted in its pot.

, Quince trees are not drought-tolerant and frequent watering when they are young encourages the growth of a strong root system.

,,,


Caterpillars, Curculio, moths, borers, fireblight, and bud injury can all cause damage to your quince trees. So look for pesticides that target these particular pests.
Prune the new wood on your quinces as little as possible and no not use excessive nitrogen in the soil around quince trees.

, Trees grown from cuttings will produce suckers, which must be removed as they will rob the fruit and leaves of important nutrients.

,


Quince trees from seeds should yield fruit within about five years. Trees grown from cuttings will begin to produce fruit even sooner.
One quince tree often yields 220 to 330 lbs. (100 to 150 kg) of fruit each year.

Store rhubarb in the refrigerator.,
Use rhubarb in a recipe.",How to Grow Rhubarb," Rhubarb is a cool-season plant that requires temperatures that drop below 40 °F (4 °C) in order to stimulate growth.The northern states in the US as well as Canada are good places to grow rhubarb. Check your growing zone to find out if you can grow rhubarb in the climate where you live.Rhubarb grows best in USDA hardiness zones 3-8. This includes much of the northern parts of the Midwest as well as the northeastern regions of the US.
Rhubarb wilts during the heat of hot southern summers. If you live in a southern region where it regularly goes above 75 °F (24 °C), it will probably be difficult to grow this plant.;
, Rhubarb is best grown from roots (crowns), not seed, since the seeds take a long time to get established and there's no guarantee they'll ever germinate. Go to your local nursery and buy rhubarb roots or purchase some from an online source.


If you have a friend with a rhubarb plant, you may be able to dig up a crown from the side of their plant to get yours started.

, Rhubarb should be planted in an area in full sun. Look for a spot that drains well, since rhubarb won't do as well if water sits around its base. To determine whether soil drains well, dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water sits in the hole, the soil there doesn't drain well. If it immediately soaks into the ground, the soil is great for planting rhubarb.You may want to stick a ruler in the hole so that you can measure how quickly it drains. Ideally the water should drain out at a rate of 1-3 inches per hour. If it drains too fast, your plant will dry out; too slow and the roots may rot.

, Clear out weeds and other plants that may interfere with the rhubarb plants. Till your gardening bed to a depth of several feet and mix in plenty of compost, rotted manure or other organic matter to enrich the soil. This step is essential, since rhubarb needs plenty of nutrients to grow well.


You can also consider building a raised bed to plant your rhubarb and other vegetables. This way you can control the soil drainage and weed population more easily.
Don't treat the area with herbicides or pesticides; rhubarb should only be planted in clean soil.Don't use chemical fertilizer to treat the soil during the first year of growth; only organic material should be used until the second or third year., Rhubarb plants can grow to become quite large, so it's important to give them plenty of space. Dig the holes in rows.

, Place the roots in the holes and gently fill them in with compost-rich soil. Water the roots after planting.

, Use hay and cow manure to keep weeds from growing and continue to nourish the rhubarb plants. Leaf mulch or ramial wood chips also make good mulches.

, Your rhubarb bed should stay moist and well-drained throughout the heat of the summer. Water every time the soil begins to look dry.

, Seed stalks keep the rest of the rhubarb plant from growing tall and strong, since they use up the plant's energy., Rhubarb isn't prone to getting many pests, but you may notice a beetle called the rhubarb curculio on the stalks. This beetle is light gray and about half an inch long. Pick off the beetles one at a time. Don't use pesticide to kill them, as this may damage your rhubarb plants., After the first year has passed, use a light application of high-nitrogen fertilizer to encourage the rhubarb to come back healthy. Do this after the ground has started to thaw.

, Rhubarb needs a year to get fully established, so you'll need to wait until the second year before harvesting any stalks.

, They should be 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) long.Continue harvesting throughout the summer - the season should last 8 to 10 weeks. Harvest rhubarb in late May or June by cutting the stems off with a sharp knife at soil level. It is best to harvest several times, removing a few stems from each plant each time. Harvesting the crop slowly allows the remaining stems to draw on the energy of the plant.


Always leave at least two stalks per plant so that it can store up energy for next year. This will ensure that you have a harvest next year.Harvesting season is over when the stalks start growing up thin. #*Some rhubarb plants will keep coming back for up to 20 years once established.

, If you aren't going to use it immediately, store it in an airtight food storage bag in the refrigerator. It will keep this way for up to a week. You may also cut the rhubarb stalks into chunks and freeze them in a freezer-safe container for several months.

, Cherry red rhubarb stalks are usually cooked in dessert dishes, since they lend a tangy, bright flavor to pies and tarts. Enjoy your garden-grown rhubarb in one of these recipes:



Rhubarb pie. This classic rhubarb dish won't disappoint. The rhubarb is cooked with sugar and strawberries for a delicious filling.

Rhubarb crumble. This is another rhubarb dessert that's quicker to make than pie, but no less satisfying.

Rhubarb cream. The flavor of rhubarb is mixed with honey and cream to make a delightful topping for any dessert.

Rhubarb ice cream. Nothing could be more delicious than ice cream made with fresh garden produce.

",How to Grow Redcurrants,";
, Redcurrants like mild sun. If you have fierce, hot sun, ensure that the afternoon positioning is dappled with shade.

, Till over the soil and add some fertilizer. Dig a hole in readiness for planting the redcurrant bush.

, Gently tease out the roots across the soil of the whole. Place well-conditioned soil over the top, and firm.


Given that redcurrants grow erect, they don't need support structures.






Space plants 120cm (3 to 4 feet) apart in rows.







, Redcurrants have a high need for potassium, so be sure to use fertilizer well endowed with potassium, such as seaweed fertilizers. Don't drown the roots; just keep them damp.


Water well until fruiting, then water less regularly to prepare the bush for winter.
Redcurrants appreciate mulching. The mulch helps to suppress weeds and improves water retention. It will also rot down to provide humus and improve the soil.







, Wait until you have large, firm red berries forming around mid-summer. Cut the whole bunch.

, If you have a free-standing redcurrant, prune it to form a strong, cup-shaped bush. Cut back the main branches about a third in the first winter's pruning. Remove any dead or damaged wood.


After the fruiting season ends, prune back the side shoots to five leaf nodes each.
Bear in mind that redcurrants fruit on the short spurs along older wood. Don't remove the older canes each year; instead, cut t them back like you would do with a rose bush.

Harvest the fruit.",How to Grow Passion Fruit," Freshly harvested passion fruit seeds germinate quickly, but older, dry seeds can take months to germinate if they grow at all.A few days before you intend to plant the seed, buy ripe passion fruit from the store. Open it and collect at least half a dozen seeds.
Spread the seeds out onto burlap and rub them until the juice sacs burst open.
Wash the seeds in water, and allow them to dry for three to four days before washing them again and drying them in the shade.
If you plant the seeds immediately, they should germinate within 10 to 20 days.
If you need to store the seeds, place them in airtight plastic bags and refrigerate them for up to six months.;
, Ideally, you should start passion fruit vines in a separate, protected container and later transplant them to your prepared garden spot. Choose a container that is no larger than 1 square yard (90 square centimeters).


Fill the container with a soil mixture made from equal parts compost, topsoil, and coarse sand. Fill the container with 4 inches (10 cm) of this mixture.

, Scrape a stick through the soil in your nursery container, spacing the resulting furrows 2 inches (5 cm) apart.


These furrows will serve as shallow drains that can help prevent moisture from drowning the seeds or their budding roots.

, Place the seeds 1/2 inch (1 cm) apart from one another inside each furrow. Protect the seeds by covering them with a very thin layer of your soil mixture.


Immediately water after planting the seeds. Moisten the soil, but do not drench it.
After planting the seeds, all you need to do is provide an occasional sprinkle of water when the surface of the soil dries out.

, When the seedlings grow to a height of 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm), they are ready to be transplanted into a permanent location in your garden.

, Fill a plastic flower pot with a mixture made of three parts agricultural sand and one part topsoil. Mix the soil components well so that they are evenly dispersed throughout the container.


Cuttings get most of the moisture they need to grow from humidity since they do not have roots at this point. As such, you do not want to use a soil that will retain a lot of moisture.

, Snip off a portion of the vine that contains at least three buds, if not more, and cut directly below the lowest bud.


Newer growth is more active, so it is recommended that you choose a newer portion of vine rather than and older portion.
Immediately plant this cutting into your sand bed.

, The best place for a vine cutting is a greenhouse. If you do not have access to one, though, you can build a humidity chamber by stretching clear plastic sheeting across a box frame made of bamboo.


Make sure that any humidity chamber you use stays moist. Keep it in full sun, and place it where the air is moist.
If you need to generate additional humidity, you can do so by running a humidifier or by placing dishes of water-covered gravel around the base of the cutting.

, Your cuttings should form new roots within a week or two. They are ready to be treated as established seedlings at this point and may be transplanted into a permanent garden space.

, Ideally, you should find a spot that receives full sun and one that does not have any competitive roots, like tree roots, nearby.""Full sun"" means a full six hours of sunlight daily, if not more.
The area should also be free of weeds. If there are a few weeds, make sure that you remove them before planting.
The vines need space to climb and spread, as well. Ideally, you should look for climbing structures already set in place, like a wire fence, balcony, or pergola. If none of these are available, you could install a trellis, instead.

, Passion fruit needs light, deep soil that contains plenty of organic material. The stuff in your yard probably is not of high enough quality to do the trick on its own, so you'll need to made a few improvements before you can plant either seeds or vines.


Mix the soil with compost before you do any planting. Compost improves both the texture and nutritional value of the soil. You could also try organic rotten manure, leaf mold, or other green plant waste.
If the soil is especially dense, you could lighten it by mixing in a handful of coarse sand.
Pay attention to the pH of the soil, as well. The pH should be between 6.5 and 7.5. If the soil is too acidic, mix in ground dolomite or agricultural lime.

, Dig a separate hole for each seedling. Each hole should be twice as wide as the current width of your plant, and the depth should be at least as deep as the container your seedling currently rests in.


Carefully dig or slide the passion fruit seedling and its root system out of the container.
Place the root system in the center of the hole, then loosely fill in the rest of the hole with soil until the plant feels secure.
Handle the roots as little as possible during the transfer. The roots are very sensitive, and if you damage them during the process, you could destroy the plant.

, Spread pellet chicken manure or another organic, slow-release fertilizer around the base of the plant. Also spread an organic mulch, like straw or wood chips, around the base of the plant.


The entire root system needs access to the fertilizer and mulch. For best results, gently push or dig some of the cover into the top layer of the soil after spreading the fertilizer and mulch around the plant's base.

, Use a watering can or garden hose to gently water the seedlings after they have been planted. Make sure that the water is very moist, but do not allow muddy puddles to form, since this could be an indication that you have provided more water than the soil can absorb and drain.

, Passion fruit plants are heavy eaters, so you will need to provide plenty of water and fertilizer throughout the growing season.


You should apply fertilizer in the spring and once every four weeks throughout the summer season. A final feeding should also be done in the mid-autumn. Use organic, slow-release fertilizers that are low in nitrogen. Chicken manure pellets are a good option.
If the area you live in gets plenty of rainfall, you might not need to water the plant too often. If you are going through a drought, though, or if you only live in moderately moist conditions, you will need to water the vine at least once a week. Never allow the surface of the soil to completely dry out.

, As the vines spread out, you may need to train them to climb up along your fence, trellis, or other support structure. The plant will be healthiest if the vines are encouraged to climb, and a healthy plant will produce the greatest yield.


Training the vines is a fairly simple process once you get the hang of it. When fresh vines or feelers begin to stretch out, tie the vine around its base and around the wire of your structure using thin rope or string. Keep the knot loose to avoid choking the vine.
When the plant is new, lateral branches that come from the main stem should be nipped off to the level of the wire. The two side branches coming from the main stem should then be bent around the top wire of your structure and forces to grow in opposite directions.
Once the side branches are spread apart, lateral branches can develop from them and hang down loosely.

, Since passion fruit plants require so much food and water, the enriched soil often becomes a target for unwanted weeds. You need to remove as many of these nearby weeds as possible so that resources are not being directed away from the passion fruit plant.


Keep 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) of space around each side of the vine base weed-free. Use organic methods of weed removal and do not use chemicals. Mulch can help prevent weeds from shooting up out of the ground, and hand-pulling weeds that do sprout is another good option.
The rest of the garden can have other plants and weeds in it, but you should keep away plants that could spread disease or attract pests. Legume plants, in particular, are dangerous to keep around passion fruit plants.

, The main reasons for pruning the plant are simply to keep the vines in check and to provide adequate sunlight to the lower portions of the plant.


Prune in the spring every second year. Make sure that you do so before the plant flowers. Pruning after flowering has occurred can weaken the plant and limit its yield.
Use shears to cut away branches that are below 2 feet (60 cm). Doing so clears away weak, old growth while also improving air circulation around the bottom of the plant.When pruning, make sure that you are not removing a major branch by following the stem along to its base before you cut it away.
Leave three to five nodes near the base of a branch when you cut it off. New growth can emerge from the stump this leaves behind.

, Usually, bees will take care of the pollination process without any additional help from you. If there are no bees in your area, though, you might need to do some work yourself.


To hand-pollinate the plants, take a small, clean paintbrush and collect the pollen from male flowers. Wipe the collected pollen onto female flowers using the same brush.
You could also touch the anthers and stigmatic surfaces of each flower with your thumb and index finger as you walk along the rows.

, You should not use insecticides until you identify the early stages of a pest problem. When you do use pesticides, use organic options since chemical options can ruin the fruit produced and make it unsafe for consumption.


The biggest pest-related problems are aphids, vine girders, and coleopteran beetle larva.

Aphids can usually be discouraged by sprinkling red pepper around the base of the plant.
Get rid of vine girders by mixing an organic insecticide in a tar base. Spread this solution around the base of the main stem, and get rid of damaged vines.
To get rid of beetle larva, you will need to use a systemic insecticide before the plant goes to flower.



, There are a handful of diseases you should try to prevent. When you spot signs of plant disease, you also need to do what you can to get rid of it and prevent the disease from spreading.


Passion fruit vines can fall victim to rot and viral diseases.

Cellar rot and root rot must be prevented ahead of time by providing adequate soil drainage.
You can attempt to treat virus-infected plants with a commercial solution, but usually, you will need to cut off and burn the affected vines in order to preserve any of the remaining plants. Passion fruit mottle virus, passion fruit ringspot virus, and cucumber mosaic virus are your most common threats.



, It can take a year to a year and a half before your plant will produce any fruit, but once it does, you can harvest this fruit and eat it.Typically, ripe passion fruit will drop from the vine as soon as they are ready for consumption. The drop itself does not hurt the fruit, but you should collect the fruit within a couple of days after it drops to ensure the best possible quality.
If you have a variety that does not drop its fruit, simply pluck off each fruit once you notice the skin beginning to wrinkle.

, Then transfer them to a resealable plastic bag. Store them somewhere cool and dark (in the fridge is a good choice).

, Put them in the cup of water. Put the cup of water with the seeds in it in the fridge for four to five days.

, Drain the water. Any seeds that floated are not viable, so toss them in the trash.

, Place one in each ""corner"" of the cup .

,, Wait for two to three weeks. In this time, the seedlings will shoot up.

,, Ensure that you will live in the same place for a long enough time to make the tree old enough and beautiful enough that no new buyers of the house will chop down the tree or think it's a weed and pull it out. If you must move, make sure the tree is at least healthy before the buyer sees it, as an inherited diseased tree is often not worth the trouble for whoever gets it and will be cut.


By the way, when the seedlings are in large pots, place them outside in the pots as the seedlings grow to strengthen the plants and acclimate them to the outdoor weather. This allows you to bring inside the young trees and care for them extra/overwinter them whenever you think they need it, and then move them outside again.

, If you want, graft a known variety onto the tree. However, you may prefer getting an unknown variety––who knows, maybe it'll be very tasty!

, Tend to the pears over the coming years and you'll get many good harvests of fruit.

Know when to plant your seedlings.,
Choose a spot in your garden that receives plenty of sunlight.,
Enrich the soil using organic fertilizers.For balanced nutrition, an organic fertilizer works best, but fish emulsion is another good option.,
Test the soil pH.,
Trim your seedlings' roots.,
Soak the seedlings in warm water.,
Shove a garden trowel into the soil.,
Insert the roots.,
Pack soil around the plant.,
Space individual seedlings 18 inches (46 cm) apart.",How to Grow Organic Strawberries1," For most climates, early spring works best. Temperatures should not drop below 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 degrees Celsius) however). In notably warm climates, fall planting is generally recommended.;
, The ideal amount of sunlight is 8 to 10 hours, but the strawberries need at least 6 hours daily. If you live in a particularly hot climate, you may want to choose a spot that receives a little shade in the afternoon to prevent the berries from getting scorched.


Avoid planting the strawberries too close to the root zone of a tree. The shade provided by the tree's branches can be overbearing, but the roots of the strawberry plant can also be strangled out by the heavy roots of the tree.
Also avoid planting strawberries in a location where other strawberries, raspberries, or solanaceous plants like tomatoes have grown before. Growing your strawberries in these locations increase the likelihood of growing berries with verticillium wilt.

, Strawberries rely heavily on potassium, though, so you should focus on maintaining a high potassium content. Green sand, kelp meal, and organic sulfate of potash are good options to raise the potassium content.

, Strawberries can grow in soil with a pH between 5.0 and 7.0, but they do best between 6.0 and 6.2. If the soil pH is too high, you can lower it organically by mixing organic coffee grounds or elemental sulfur into the soil. If the soil pH is too low, you can increase it organically by using ground oyster shell, dried eggshells, or dolomite lime that is certified organic.

, Use clean shears to trim the roots to about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) in length.

, Fill a large bucket with water and stir in some fish emulsion for added nutrition. Soak the plants for a full hour before planting.

, Stick the trowel straight in the soil as deep as it will go and firmly move it back and forth until you create a hole.

, Gently insert the roots of one plant in the newly created hole.

, Carefully remove the trowel and firmly pack soil around the plant at the area where the roots and plant meet.

, As the strawberry plants grow, they will expand, so the extra room is necessary.

Water the plants weekly.,
Remove weeds by hand.,
Add mulch during the spring, summer, and winter.,
Add fertilizer every spring.,
Watch out for pests.,
Harvest your berries once they ripen.",How to Grow Organic Strawberries2," If you live in a very rainy climate, additional watering may not be necessary. It is important that your strawberries receive 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week, though. If you live in dryer climates, you should water the plants every three to five days. Water in the early morning, before the heat of the afternoon, and apply the water directly to the soil at the root zone.

, Frequent weeding is necessary to make sure that your strawberries do not need to compete for nutrients, but chemical weed-killers should not be used in an organic garden. Weeding by hand or with the use of garden tools is your best organic option.

, During the spring and summer, mulch should be added between berry plants to keep the soil moist and to control weeds. Mulch should be spread over the entire bed during the winter to maintain moisture and protect the plants from heavy frosts.


Use a mulch with few weed seeds. Reed canary is a good choice, but clean barley straw also works well.

, Fertilizing in the early spring leads to sweet, soft berries. A blend of seaweed and fish emulsion makes a good choice since it is both organic and well-balanced.

, Strawberries can fall victim to a number of insects. If you spot a tarnished plant but, sap beetle, white grub, or aphid on your plant, treat it immediately with an organic pesticide like food grade Diatomaceous Earth, neem oil, cayenne pepper spray, or an organic soap spray., Ripe strawberries will be plump and bright red, and usually appear 30 days after flowering. Test one berry first before harvesting more, and harvest ripe berries every two to three days. Cut the berries off with clean shears, leaving a short stem behind.

Check whether papayas will thrive in your climate.,
Prepare your soil.,
Prepare the seeds.,
Plant seeds.,
Water the soil moderately well.,
Determine which seedlings to keep.,
Once plants are flowering, remove excess male plants.",How to Grow Papaya1," Papayas thrive in USDA hardiness zones 9-11, which corresponds to minimum winter temperatures of 19℉ to 40ºF (-7℃ to 4ºC).They may be damaged or die if exposed to prolonged frost, and prefer climates that are warm throughout most of the year.


Papaya trees do poorly in wet soil. If your climate is rainy, you may plant them on a mound of well draining soil as described further on.;
, Choose a nutrient-rich potting mix for tropical plants, or make your own mix out of garden soil and 25–50% compost. As long as the soil drains well, the exact soil texture doesn't matter. Papaya will grow in sandy, loamy, or rocky soils.If you are able to test soil pH or you are choosing between commercial potting mixes, select a soil with a pH between 4.5 and 8. This is a broad range, so it is likely that any soil that successfully grows other plants in your garden has the correct pH for papaya.
If you want more of your seeds to germinate, use sterile potting mix. You can make your own by mixing one part vermiculite and one part potting mix, and baking this mixture in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celcius) for one hour., You can use seeds scraped out of the center of a papaya fruit, or seeds purchased from a garden center or nursery. Press seeds against the side of a colander to break the sac surrounding the seeds, without breaking the seeds themselves.Rinse thoroughly, then dry in a dark location on a paper towel.

, You may plant seeds directly in your garden to avoid the risks of transplanting them later, or you may plant them in pots to have greater control of plant arrangement once you see which ones are sprouting. Poke the seeds into the soil about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) under the surface and about 2 inches (5 cm) apart from each other.


Plant as many seeds as you have room for to increase the odds of both male and female plants sprouting; you can remove the weaker plants later on. There is no feasible way to tell whether a plant is male, female, or hermaphroditic before planting., Water thoroughly after planting, but do not soak to the point that standing water forms on the soil. Monitor the moisture over the next few weeks and water as necessary, keeping the soil slightly damp, but not soggy.

, Approximately two to five weeks after planting, some of the seeds will germinate, and emerge through the soil surface as seedlings. After giving them a week or two to grow, pull out or cut the smallest seedlings, along with any seedlings that appear withered, spotted, or otherwise unhealthy.Cull plants until you have only one plant per pot, or the seedlings are at least three feet (0.9m) apart. Keep at least five plants for now for a 96% chance or higher to produce both male and female trees.Once you've chosen your most successful plants, move on to the section on planting, if transplanting to your garden, or the section on general care otherwise.

, If you still have more plants than you want to end up with, wait until the plants are about 3 feet (0.9 m) tall to see what sex each plant is. The male plants should flower first, producing long, thin stalks with several flowers. Female flowers are larger and near the trunk. In order to produce fruit, you only need one male plant for every ten to fifteen females; the rest can be removed.Some papaya plants are hermaphroditic, meaning they produce both male and female flowers. These plants can pollinate themselves.

Build a dirt mound if necessary to avoid water.,
Dig a hole otherwise.,
Mix an equal amount of compost into the displaced soil.,
Apply fungicide (optional).,
Add the plant carefully.,
Backfill the soil and water it.",How to Grow Papaya2," If there are heavy rains or floods in your area, build a mound of soil 2–3 feet (0.9 m). (0.6–0.9 m) high and 4–10 feet (1.2–3.0 m). (1.2–3 m) in diameter.This will help keep water from pooling around the papaya's roots, reducing the chance of injury or death.


Read the instructions below before you build your mound, to learn about soil preparation.

, Make the hole three times as deep and wide as the planting pot or root ball, in the plant's intended permanent location. Choose a sunny, well-drained location, about 10 to 20 feet (3.1 to 6.1 meters) from buildings or other plants.Make a separate hole for each papaya plant.

, Unless your garden soil is already rich in nutrients, replace some of the soil in the hole or mound with compost and mix thoroughly.


Do not mix with manure, as this can burn roots.

, Papaya trees can die from disease after transplantation. Follow the instructions on a gardening fungicide and apply it to the soil to reduce this risk., Add the altered soil back into the hole or pile it in a mound, until the remaining depth is roughly equal to the depth of the potting soil or root ball of the plant being transplanted. Remove the papaya plants from their containers, one at a time, and plant each in its own hole at the same depth as it sat in the container. Handle them carefully to avoid breaking or scraping the roots.

, Fill the remaining space in the hole with the same soil. Pack gently to remove air pockets if the soil isn't filling the spaces between the roots. Water the newly planted papaya seedlings until the soil surrounding the root ball is thoroughly moistened.

"
"
Apply fertilizer once every two weeks.,
Water papaya seedlings and established plants regularly.,
Apply bark mulch or wood chips if necessary.,
Inspect the papaya's leaves and bark regularly for signs of disease or insects.,
Harvest papaya fruits when they reach the level of ripeness you desire.",How to Grow Papaya3," Apply fertilizer to growing plants every 10–14 days, diluting it according to the fertilizer's instructions. Use a ""complete"" fertilizer, not a specialized one.Continue to apply at least until the plants are about 12 inches (30 cm) tall.


After the plant reaches this size, commercial growers continue to fertilize papaya every two weeks with 1/4 lb. (0.1 kg) complete fertilizer near but not touching the base of the plant. Follow this practice if you would like to hasten the plant's growth, gradually increasing the amount of fertilizer and length of time between applications until the papayas receive no more than 2 lb. (0.9 kg) every two months starting at seven months old.

, Papayas can be easily damaged by standing pools of water, but may not produce sizable fruit without regular water access. If planted in loam that holds water well, water no more than once every three or four days. In sandy or rocky soils, increase this to once every one to two days during hot weather.Allow a few more days between waterings during cooler seasons.

, Apply pine bark, another bark mulch, or wood chips around the base of the plant if you need to reduce weeds or if the plant looks withered from failure to retain water. Layer 2 inches (5 cm) of mulch around the papaya, no closer than 8 inches (20 cm) to the trunk.

, Spots or yellowing on leaves or bark indicate possible disease. Black spots on the leaf won't typically affect the fruit, but may be treated with fungicide if the infection is severe.Curling leaves may be a sign of picking up herbicide from a nearby lawn.Other problems, including insects or full plant collapse, may require consulting an expert gardener or local agricultural department.

, Tart, green fruits may be eaten as a vegetable, but many people prefer fully ripe, yellow or orange fruits for their sweet taste. You may harvest anytime after the fruit is mostly yellow-green, if you would like them to finish ripening indoors, away from pests."

Find a position in full sun.,
Choose well drained soil.,
Keep the plant well watered.,
Keep the plant well fed.,
Keep tidy.",How to Grow Miracle Fruit," The plant does not tolerate frost, so your garden climate should be free of frost, filled with sunshine, and in the tropical temperature zone. Minimum temperatures should not fall below 3ºC to 4ºC overnight.;
, The soil should not waterlog. Prepare the soil well, dig a suitable hole, and plant the bush in the ground. Add mulch around if wished; this will aid water retention.

, This is especially important during dry seasons as the fruit requires regular watering.

, Use an organic (home-made) fertiliser twice yearly.

, It shouldn't take much to keep the plant tidy. It grows into a small bushy shrub about 1 to 2 meters (3.3 to 6.6 ft) high. It does not need pruning unless you feel it needs a few dead or loose branches tidied out.

Determine whether growing olives in your area is possible.,
Check the pH of your soil and adjust it if necessary.,
Look for areas with good drainage.,
Seek out places that have previously grown olive trees.,
Find an area that gets direct sunlight.",How to Grow Olives1," Olive crops thrives best in climates with mild winters and long, dry summers. Suitable geographic areas, for example, include Europe's Mediterranean region and coastal valleys in the state of California. It is difficult, if not impossible, to grow olives in tropical climates.Frost will kill many olive trees if care is not taken. Temperatures that hit 22 °F (−6 °C) can harm small branches, while large branches and even whole trees can be killed if the temperature dips below 15 °F (−9 °C).Even if branches and trees survive the cold, the flavor of the olives and the resultant oil can be compromised by cold streaks. Avoid growing olives if you live in an area prone to these temperature dips.
Olive trees do need a certain amount of cold, however. Proper flower development depends on the climate dipping to 45 °F (7 °C) or below, although this number alternates with olive tree varietals. This is why cultivation is extremely difficult in the tropics or very warm areas.
Make sure that bloom season is fairly dry and moderate. Bloom season (April to June) should be fairly dry and not excessively warm. Olives are wind-pollinated, so wet conditions can hamper a tree's fruit set.;
, The soil should be moderately acidic or moderately basic, with a pH greater than 5 and less than 8.5. Many farmers believe 6.5 to be ideal. Get your soil tested at the Department of Agriculture or use a home testing kit from a department store. If the pH isn't in the right range, adjust it as necessary.Limestone is used to raise a soil's pH level, while sulfur is used to lower it. You can buy sulfur and limestone powder or pellet form, online or at a local greenhouse or hardware store.You adjust pH by spreading sulfur or limestone over your soil. The precise amount varies based on how much you need to adjust. You can read the instructions on your package. It may take a few days for limestone or sulfur to be adequately absorbed.
Once your pH level is at the right level, keep monitoring it throughout the growing process, especially after using fertilizers which can affect pH level. You may have to adjust pH levels periodically as you grow your olive trees.

, Watch how water affects soil in the area you want to grow. Olive trees thrive in areas that have good drainage. After rain, check the soil. Do not plant in an area where the soil stands above ground during rainy periods. Also, dig a hole that's two feet deep and add water. If water steeps, opt for a different area.Planting your olive trees on a gentle slope can solve a lot of drainage problems. There tends to be better drainage on inclines., The best indicator that an area will grow olive trees successfully is if an area has grown trees in the past. If you know olive trees have previously grown somewhere, grow your trees there. You can also grow your trees near existing olive trees.If you know other farmers or gardeners in your area, try asking them where olive trees have previously grown.

, Full sun, without any shade blocking your trees, is ideal. Any area you choose should at least get some direct sunlight for at least six hours a day. Very shady areas are not recommended for growing olives."

Install dip emitters near the tree trunk.,
Water and mulch the area with straw.",How to Grow Olives2," Frost can be a major danger for young olive oil trees. In general, opt to plant in spring after temperatures have been consistently warm and there has been no recent frost. Most people plant trees during April or May, but adjust for your region.The more time trees have to grow before winter, the better. Plant your trees as soon as possible after the last expected frost date of the season.

, Purchase potted olive trees online or at a local greenhouse. Seeds on their own are fragile and difficult to cultivate. You should plant trees that are 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) high and whose branches start at three feet., Measure the trees pot, including its circumference and height. Dig a hole about that deep and wide. You do not have to get the hole the exact number of inches and measure, but the hole should be roughly the same size so that the tree fits comfortably in the soil., Remove the tree from the container, including all the roots. Cut or untwist any circling roots as best you can, but stay away from the root ball. Cutting into this can damage your plants., Use the previously dug soil and surrounding soil to fill in the rest of the hole. Put an inch of topsoil over the root ball. At this time, things like fertilizer and compost should not be added near your tree. The tree should grow out of the native soil initially., Dip emitters are irrigation systems that keep your olive trees properly hydrated. For the first year, they should be placed right next to each tree trunk. The following year, they should be moved 24 inches away from the trunks. A second emitter should be added, also 24 inches away from the trunk.Installing dip emitter is complicated. While you can purchase them at a hardware store, installation is tricky unless you have extensive gardening experience. It is best to hire professionals to install your emitters.
Usually, emitters are hooked up to a water source such as an outside faucet. You then run the tubing across your garden or yard until it gets to the base of your trees. You will then poke holes in the tubing and install a watering device to help irrigate your olive trees., When using dip irrigators, you should water your trees Other mulches can be used instead of coarse straw. Lucerne, soya bean, and pea hay, to name a few, are excellent mulches high in nitrogen and other nutrients to feed the tree.

Water and irrigate your olive tree modestly or as necessary.,
Prune your trees regularly.,
Address issues with pests and other diseases.,
Use a mild amount of fertilizer.,
Wait several years for your trees to start bearing fruit.,
Decide when to harvest.",How to Grow Olives3," With drip irrigation, trees need watering each day during the summer. Water your trees for an hour. Keeping mini-sprinklers, which wet the ground down at least two feet, can also help trees stayed watered. Look for sprinklers that .1 to .2 inches of water per hour and install these between the trunks of your trees.How often you water your tree may be dictated by whether you want to cultivate fruit or oil. If cultivating fruit, water your trees more often — anywhere from every week to every two or three weeks. If cultivating oil, water your trees less often. This will help concentrate the flavor of the oil.

, Do not prune young trees often. During the first four years, only remove side branches growing below three feet. As the trees mature, they will become to take on their full form and you can remove weak or unwanted branches. Early pruning, however, should be as minimal as possible to avoid stunting a tree's growth., Like most plants, the olive tree is sometimes susceptible to attack, particularly from black scale, or Saissetia oleae. As a farmer, you want to strike a fine balance between letting your trees grow organically and protecting them from infestation and disease. In some cases, an insecticide is required to treat pest issues. Talk this over with a professional for the best results.


Black scales are small black scales on the surface of the bark which can get out of hand fast as they produce eggs quickly.Although black scales primarily infest already diseased olive trees, healthy trees are not immune from attack. If discovered, treat black scale with the appropriate insecticide.
Verticillium wilt may also affect olive trees, causing leaves and branches to unexpectedly wilt. Although certain cultivars of olives come equipped with resistance, there is yet no treatment for this fungal disease.If afflicted branches aren't cut off, wilt can affect the whole tree. In this case, you may have to prune branches even from very young trees. If you've had a problem with wilt in your soil before, avoid planting in that area.

, Olive trees will thrive well enough with correct planting and watering. A mild amount of fertilizer, however, can help trees grow. Choose a mild fertilizer and apply light layers during growing season. The fertilizer's package should indicate appropriate amounts and where/how to apply the fertilizer, which is often sprinkles over the top soil. Err towards the lowest amounts possible.Fertilizer containers have ratios written on them, indicating the amount of things like nitrogen. Olive trees thrive with fertilizers with a 10-10-10 ratio or 13-13-13 ratio.

, Well-watered trees will start bearing fruit two or three times faster than dry-farmed trees. While some cultivars begin bearing fruit as soon as two or three years if properly maintained, many trees won't start bearing until 10 years old. When growing olives, remember this is a long term project. Start watching for fruit after the first two years, but keep in mind it may take much longer for an olive tree to yield fruit., Olives start out green and eventually all turn black as they ripen. Olives that are harvested when they are still green have a peppery, grassy, or more herbaceous flavor, while olives that are harvested when they turn taker have a milder, buttery flavor. Many oils are a mix between green and ripe olives, harvested right when they are turning color. Decide on the type of olive you want and wait until your olives turn that color to harvest.Keep in mind, you cannot eat olives directly off a tree. Most have to be brined, meaning they are soaked in salt water, before they can be consumed.

",How to Grow Melons,"


Because growing melons is easier in warmer climates, you will have to take into consideration how cool the ground is before planting melons.
You must wait until after the last expected frost of spring and allow the wet soil to dry for the melon seeds to germinate properly.;
,,,,


Plant the melons seeds or plants in hills of dirt.
Put 3 to 5 melon seeds about 1 inch deep (2.5 cm) and 2 inches (5.08 cm) apart. Plant starter plants about 2 inches (5.08) apart.

,,


Simply pull out the smaller plants so they don't crowd the larger melon plants.

Acquire a seed.,
Prepare the seed.",How to Grow Pomegranate1," Pomegranates require lots of direct sunlight. While they were originally cultivated in modern day Iran, they can be grown in most climates. If your backyard has a lot of shading from larger trees, consider planting the pomegranate plant in a community garden with more sunlight.


Track the location for a few months before planting to ensure it receives the best of the sunlight.
Keep in mind that the plant can grow to be 12 feet (3.66 meters) in height.
If you live in a colder state, consider using a specific variety of pomegranate from Salavatski or Kazakhe. These are better equipped for the colder winters. The Salavatski pomegranate has been recorded to withstand a winter reaching -6 degrees Fahrenheit.;
, A great way to prepare a gardening space in the off seasons is to plant cover crops. These include a variety of different plants that balance the nutrients of the soil before planting. Pomegranates thrive best with high pH levels and alkaline rich soil.


You can reach this type of soil by adding sulfur, sawdust, conifer needles, or oak leaves.Try some of the common cover crops like hairy vetch, medium red clover, or cereal grains.Always test your soil’s pH level before adding more acidity. Pomegranates like a pH level around 7.5-8.0.

, The seeds from pomegranates germinate easily and should be started indoors before planting outside. If you are growing for ornamental purposes, a seed will work. However, if you are growing to produce fruit, you may want to consider purchasing a hybrid tree from a nursery or getting cuttings from a tree you know produces good fruit.


Visit a farmers market or an organic grocery store.

, Cut open your pomegranate and remove the pulp encasing the seed. Wipe down your seed and allow it to dry for about three days. This prevents the seeds from molding.


Plant the seed indoors around mid-winter ¼” deep in lightweight potting soil.
Keep the seedling in a warm sunny location indoors.
Keep the soil moist, checking regularly if the soil is moist with your hands."

Prepare the location.,
Purchase a pomegranate plant.,
Plant the crop.",How to Grow Pomegranate2," Make sure the location you’re considering has the necessary attributes. Clear an area about a foot in diameter of weeds and other organic material in the location you plan to plant the pomegranate. Dig up a couple inches of soil for your premature plant using a trowel., If you don’t feel like growing your own from a seed, or if you want to grow a tree for fruit, consider purchasing a young plant from a nursery.


You can find pomegranate plants for sale at nurseries. The best time to purchase cuttings are in February or March.
Buy a cutting that is a little more than a foot (30.48 centimeters) long., Plant your plant in spring just after the last frost. Submerge the roots and cover with a blend of soil and compost. Water the plant after planting. A good rule with using compost for edible plants is two parts soil and one part compost.


If you use your own compost, make sure that it is well rotted and resembles dirt. You can also purchase compost at a gardening center.
If you started from a seed, you'll need to let the plant become strong enough before planting outdoors. The best is to start your seeds in February. Watch and care for the seed while it germinates properly. Plants started from seeds should be ready to plant outside after a year or two.

Harvest your fruit once it's ripe.",How to Grow Kiwifruit," Growing kiwifruits from seed is a fun project and will give you a nice ornamental plant. Kiwifruit do not always grow true to type, meaning that your plant may not produce edible fruit like the one it came from.If you want to grow a kiwi plant for its fruit, purchase a grafted plant from a nursery. Three major types of kiwifruit are:



Common kiwi – This is the type of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) typically found in grocery stores. It is a brown, fuzzy fruit with a thick skin and green pulp. For optimal growth, it requires about a month of cool weather with temperatures ranging from 30 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 to 7ºC). Common Kiwi can be grown in USDA hardiness zones 7-9.Golden kiwi – Another popular type of kiwi, the golden kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) is sweeter but more delicate compared to the common kiwi. It is closely related to common kiwifruit but is less fuzzy and more yellow. This fruit grows best in zones that experience winter lows ranging from 10 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit (-12 to -1ºC).Kiwi berry – This name usually refers to two different kiwi species, the hardy kiwi (Actinidia arguta) and the super-hardy kiwi (Actinidia kolomikta). These kiwifruits are much smaller compared to common and golden kiwis and have a thinner, smooth skin. As their names suggest, this type of kiwi is the most cold-tolerant and can be grown in areas that experience harsh winters.These varieties are sometimes able to produce fruit after just one growing season, in contrast to most others that take years to mature.;
, If you've decided to grow common kiwifruit, getting seeds can be as simple as going to the grocery store and buying a fruit. According to some gardeners, seeds from organic fruits are more likely to germinate and grow hardy adult plants. For more exotic types of kiwi, you can order inexpensive seeds online from a variety of vendors.


To remove seeds from a fresh kiwifruit, simply slice the fruit in half and scoop a them out with your fingers or a spoon. Place the seeds in a small bowl or cup and rinse them to remove the fruit. To rinse, swish water around in the bowl and strain it back out a few times.Keep in mind that most kiwi growers favor purchasing young plants created through propagation from nurseries rather than sprouting them from seeds. This is partly because propagated cultivars possess traits that are much more consistent over generations. Additionally, most varieties of kiwifruit are delicious, meaning that both a male and a female plant are required for fruiting to occur. Since the only way to tell the difference between the two is through their flowers and flowering usually takes three or more years to start happening, it's difficult to accurately space seedlings for optimal pollination and fruit production.

, Place your seeds in a resealable plastic bag along with a damp paper towel. Zip the bag up and put it in a warm spot. Check your seeds every day until you see that they have sprouted.


If you notice the paper towel drying out before your seeds have germinated, be sure to moisten it again. The seeds need a humid environment to sprout., Prepare and moisten a few pots of seed starter potting mix, one for every three or four seeds. Tear off a section of the moistened paper towel you used to germinate the seeds that has a three to four seedlings clinging to it. Plant this, paper towel piece and all, into one of your pots. Repeat until all seedlings are planted., Windowsills are generally the best choice unless you have a basement equipped with grow lights.


Young plants are especially sensitive to winter chills, so many growers keep their kiwi plants indoors for the first two years or so.Remember to transfer your plants to new, larger pots as they begin to outgrow their smaller ones. At this stage, begin boosting their nutrition using a generic starter fertilizer., Make sure conditions there are suitable.


You will need adequate space for your kiwifruit plants to grow.
Most kiwifruit plants grow best in either full sun or light shade.Kiwifruit generally need slightly acidic soil that has a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. If your soil is too alkaline, you can try to acidify it to make conditions right for growing kiwifruit.The soil must be moist but well-drained., Remember that kiwifruits are vine plants that can grow up to 30 feet long and weigh a fair amount.Like other vines, they grow best across vertical structures that provide support and greater access to light.


Kiwifruit vines can grow on most types of trellises, gazebos, and fences.
Commercial kiwifruit growers use six-foot-high wire trellises with T-bars spaced 15 to 20 feet apart. , Transplanting kiwifruit plants is largely the same as other types of plants. The major difference is that you must space your plants so that each is at the base of its own support structure. Simply dig a hole for each plant that is a little bigger than their current pots. Carefully lift each plant out of its pot, including the roots and the dirt they cling to, and place the roots into the holes you just dug. Finish by filling in the edges of the hole with loose dirt.


Try to disturb the roots as little as possible to avoid shock.If you plant to grow fruit, keep as many plants as you have room for. Once they flower, which can take up to five years, you can identify the male and female plants and cull the extras.

, Even if all other conditions are perfect, your plants may be destroyed by various pests. Kiwifruit plants will be especially vulnerable until they have fully matured.


The leaves of kiwifruit plants can sometimes attract deer. Keep your young plants safe by keeping deer out of your yard with either a fence around it or chicken wire surrounding your plants.
Cats respond to kiwi leaves similarly to catnip. If you've ever tried to grow catnip, you probably know that neighborhood cats can easily destroy your plants. If there are outdoor cats in your area, take measures to keep them out of your garden. Example strategies include building a fence, putting chicken wire around each of your plants, and spraying with repellents.
Unlike many other commercial fruit-bearing plants, kiwifruit do not have many insect enemies, so regular pesticide use is usually unnecessary., As your kiwifruit plant grows, it will begin to send out shoots. You will need to train these shoots to grow on the support by wiring the vines to the trellis. This will ensure that the plant will grow a strong ""trunk"" section., You should prune your kiwifruit plants once a year. Trim excess canes (vines that have grown a bark-like skin) and any lateral shoots not supportable by its trellis. Lateral shoots are branches that go off to the sides. Your kiwifruit vines will not be able to support the weight of such shoots on their own until they've reached the top of your trellis (when using the T-support system). Once the vines reach the top of the trellis, they will be able to grow more horizontally across it.


The optimal time for pruning female plants is late winter while the plant is dormant.
Male plants can be pruned sooner, right after flowering., Kiwi plants will usually flower within four or five years of planting. When this happens, you can identify the male plants by the bright yellow, pollen-covered anthers in the flower's center. The female plants have sticky stalks (stigma) in the center instead, and white ovaries at the base of the flower.Since only the female kiwi vines produce fruit, you'll want one male plant to pollinate every 8 or 9 female plants, rather than an even split between the two. Remove the excess males and space the survivors an equal distance apart among the female vines., After a few years (or even that same year for hardy and super-hardy kiwi), your plants should start producing fruit. Yields may start out small but typically increase every year as the plant matures.


Kiwifruit usually ripens in September and October. If frosts typically happen by then in your area, you will need to harvest the fruit before it's ripe and let it finish ripening under refrigeration.Snap kiwifruit off at the stalk when their skin begins to change color (to brown for common kiwifruit). Another way to check for harvest-readiness is to look for black seeds in a sample fruit."

Take proper care of your plants, and prepare to wait.",How to Grow Grapes from Seeds," There are thousands of grape varieties in the world. For the greatest success in growing grapes, choose the variety that will work best for you. Do some research on grape varieties, while keeping the following in mind:Your reasons for growing grapes. You may want to eat the fruit, make jam, make wine, or just add the beauty of grapevines to your yard. Find out which varieties are best for your intended purpose.
Your climate conditions. Different varieties of grapes are better suited to certain geographic areas and climate conditions. Learn about grapes that are known to perform well in your area.
Natural variation among grapes grown from seed. There are some genetic differences even among grapes of the same type, so the grapes you grow may not turn out exactly the way you expect. Go into your project with an open mind, and be prepared to experiment.;
, Once you identify the variety of grapes you want to grow, get your seeds. You can get them from grapes you've purchased, from a nursery, from your yard's wild grapevines (in some areas), or from another gardener.

, Examine the seeds to make sure they are healthy and in good condition. Squeeze the seed gently between two fingers. A healthy seed is firm to the touch.Look at the seed's color. In a healthy grape seed, you will be able to see a pale gray or white endosperm under the seed coat.
Put them in water. Healthy, viable seeds will sink when placed in water. Discard any seeds that float.

, Take the viable seeds and wash them thoroughly to remove any pulp or other matter. Soak them in a small amount of distilled water for up to 24 hours., Many seeds require a period of cold, moist conditions to begin the germination process. In nature, this is achieved when seeds sit in the ground over the winter. You can mimic these conditions through the process of stratification. For grape seeds, the best time to begin stratification is in December (the northern hemisphere winter).Prepare a bed for your seeds. Fill an airtight bag or other capsule with a soft medium like wet paper towels or sand, vermiculite or peat moss that has been dampened. Peat moss is the best choice for grape seeds because its anti-fungal properties will help eliminate seed-damaging mold.
Tuck the seeds into the bed. Cover them with about 1/2"" (1.25 cm) of growing medium.
Refrigerate the seeds. The ideal temperature for stratification is a steady 35-40 ºF (1-3 ºC), so the refrigerator is a good place for this process. Keep the seeds refrigerated for two to three months. Do not allow them to freeze.

, In early spring, remove the seeds from the refrigerator and plant them in pots filled with good soil. Plant seeds individually in small pots, or in larger pots with at least 1 1/2"" (3.8 cm) between them.Make sure your seeds stay warm enough. To properly germinate, the seeds need daytime temperatures of at least 70ºF (20ºC) and nighttime temperatures around 60ºF (15ºC). Use a greenhouse or warming mats to keep your seeds at the correct temperature.
Keep the soil moist but not too wet. Mist the surface with a fine spray of water when it starts to look dry.
Check for growth. Grape seeds typically take between 2-8 weeks to sprout.

, When your seedlings have grown to about 3"" (8 cm), transplant them to 4"" (10 cm) pots. For the healthiest plants, keep your seedlings indoors or in a greenhouse until they have reached a height of 12"" (30 cm), have a good network of roots and have at least 5-6 leaves.

, To thrive, grapevines need the right amount of sun, proper drainage and a form of support.Choose a sunny spot. Grapes need 7-8 hours of full sun daily for best results.
Make sure you have plenty of space. Space your plants about 8' (2.5 m) apart to allow for growth.

, Grapes require well drained soil. If you have clay or other poorly drained soil, augment it with decomposed compost, sand or other soil amendments to increase drainage. Alternatively, use a raised bed filled with a good sandy loam mixed with compost.


Check the pH of your soil before planting your grapes. Different types of grapes thrive best with different soil pH levels (5.5-6.0 for natives, 6.0-6.5 for hybrids, and 6.5-7.0 for vinifera), so it is best to either plant in an area with a pH level in the right range, or adjust your soil’s pH before planting.If you are planning to grow grapes for wine, be aware that different types of soil (e.g., sandy, silty, rich in limestone, or rich in clay) will affect the flavor of the wine., Two weeks after planting, add a small amount of 10-10-10 fertilizer to the soil around the base of your young plants.Repeat this process once per year every spring after that., Grapevines need a trellis or arbor for proper support. The first year in the vineyard (2 years after starting from seed), when your plants are still small, stakes will be sufficient to support them and keep them off the ground. As they grow, you will need to train them to the trellis or arbor. Tie the tip of the shoots to the wire, and allow it to grow along the wire., Grapevines take up to three years to start producing fruit. During that time, proper care and training of your plants is essential for the best fruit yield.Year One: Watch for growth. Choose the strongest three shoots on the plant and allow those to grow. Pinch off all others. The three remaining shoots will grow stronger and more vigorous.
Year Two: Fertilize using a balance fertilizer. Remove flower clusters as they emerge; allowing the vine to fruit this early will deplete its energy. Remove any buds or shoots that grow below the three main ones you selected the prior year. Prune properly. Loosely tie long shoots to the arbor or trellis.
Year Three: Continue fertilizing and removing low buds and shoots. During this year, you can allow a few flower clusters to remain and produce a small crop of grapes.
Year Four and Later: Continue fertilizing and pruning. This year and thereafter, you can let all the flower clusters fruit if you wish.
As you prune, be aware that grapes will fruit on one-year-old wood (i.e., wood that grew during the previous season).

Consult your local nursery about whether or not you should plant already potted or wild clippings in your climate.

, Preparing your plot in advance of planting will include choosing a well ventilated site with adequate moisture and making sure your soil is loose to optimize growth. Take a shovel and loosen the soil to a depth equivalent to the height of the rootball, which is the mass of roots under the stem, and over a wide area to prevent compaction and improve drainage.If you have bare root clippings they will not have a root ball. Instead, loosen the soil around a depth of 3 inches.
If your plot becomes waterlogged over the winter, simply loosen the soil again and plant your clippings on a slight mound, approximately 3-4 inches high., Creating a nutrient rich plot is key during preparation as you will not be adding fertilizer during the planting period. Combine your existing soil with organic matter, like compost and fertilizer, during your initial plot preparation. If your original soil is sandy you many need to apply generous amounts of fertilizer.Consult your local plant nursery about your soil type and about acquiring organic matter for plot preparation.

, Gooseberries thrive in cooler climates and will often not produce fruit until a frost has passed. Plant your gooseberries early in spring, or as soon as the ground is workable, as gooseberry clippings can survive temperatures as low as 55 degrees. The earlier you plant your gooseberries, the better and more established the plants will be.Although gooseberries will grow in warmer climates, the produces their distinct tart flavor best in cooler climates.

, Gooseberry plants should have a 1 inch margin in depth and a margin approximately 3 times the diameter in width when planted. This will encourage growth and allow plenty of room for the initial roots to take hold. Once planted, gently pack the soil to firm the ground around the roots.If your clippings are having difficulty staying vertical try attaching them to a bamboo cane with horizontal wires., Spacing your plants apart will ensure that they have enough room and light to grow and will encourage their root systems to grow wide. Clippings should be spaced approximately 12-15 inches apart and replanted bushes approximately 4-5 feet apart., Scatter 2-4 inches of organic mulch in the form of wood chips, pine needles, or compost immediately after your clippings are planted. Mulch cools the soil, conserves water, and suppresses weeds, which is preferable in shaded plots and essential in sunny plots.If you do not have a compost at home you can purchase mulch at your local plant nursery.
Renew your mulch each year after planting.

, After planting, prune all clippings down to 4-6 buds above ground. This will encourage new vibrant and initial growth and the development of vigorous new stems, or canes, that will be able to last years.Prune your plant each year in late winter or early spring to encourage new growth and healthy development.
Consult pruning guides for instructions on how to prune your gooseberry plant as it becomes more established over the years., Insect and disease infestations are rare and uncommon. If they do present themselves it is unlikely that they will ruin your entire crop. However, they are important to look for in order to keep you gooseberry bush as healthy as possible and to not affect its future fruitings.


The best way to prevent insect infestations and diseases is to keep a healthy plant by selecting good planting soil, adequate amounts of water, plenty of light, and consistently removing dead leaves and branches., Powdery mildew can present itself during hotter months, and is therefore less common in cooler climates. However, you can prevent powdery mildew by making sure your gooseberry bush is planted in a well ventilated area with plenty of light, which will inhibit the distribution of powdery mildew spores.Check with your local nursery about potential pesticides or sprays that can reduce the chances of contracting powdery mildew, or inquire about powdery mildew resistant strains.

, Dry and windy conditions are especially likely to cause water shortage in your soil. Even if your soil feels damp the roots of your gooseberry plant may be dry. Set up an irrigation system or set a daily routine of watering your plant to ensure it is receiving the moisture it needs in order to produce the best fruit possible.Keep in mind that even wet and rainy summers rarely give enough moisture to plants. You will almost always need to set-up alternate means of watering., Gooseberries should generally be ready to harvest in early July. Knowing when to harvest Gooseberries depends on their taste and on your intended use for them. If you plan on cooking with Gooseberries try picking them while they a bit unripe and tart. If you’d like to eat them raw keep tasting until the fruit becomes sweeter.

Fertilize your tree twice a year.,
Water the trees enough to keep the soil moist.,
Prune your lanzone tree.,
Harvest the fruit 140-150 days from flower formation.",How to Grow Lanzones," You can get the seeds to grow your lanzone tree from the flesh of the duku fruit. Find a lanzone tree that already grows good tasting fruit. Split open the fruit and extract the largest green seeds within the pulp of the fruit. It's best to plant the seeds as soon as you extract them from the fruit. They will not germinate if you wait longer than eight days.You can also buy the seeds at a gardening store or online.;
, The seed will likely have a sticky substance around it called mucilage. To remove the substance, run the seeds under cold water from your faucet.If you purchase the seeds from the store this substance will already be removed.

, Dig small holes about 1 cm (.4 inch) deep, put the seeds in the holes and cover the seeds with soil. You can do this in an indoor planter with good water drainage. Sandy loam that has a lot of organic material is the best kind of soil that you can use.It's a good idea to plant multiple langsat seeds just in case some of them don't germinate.

, Young seeds require a considerable amount of sunlight in order to germinate. If you are growing indoors, set your light timer to give your seeds 15 hours of light per day, or place your seed beds in a window facing south., After you plant your seeds, water them with a watering can. Make sure that you return to the seeds every day and keep the soil moist, but not flooded. You can check the moisture in the soil by putting your finger into it and checking if the soil under the surface is dry., In around 2-3 weeks, you should start to see your seeds germinate and grow small stalks. These seedlings will take about 10-18 months before they can be planted outside.When growing lanzone trees from seeds, it could take anywhere between 10-30 years or more for them to bear fruit., Lanzone trees thrive in ultra-tropical climates. These trees can be found naturally in hardiness zone 11+. If you plan on growing a lanzone or langsat tree, make sure that you live in a climate that can promote its growth., Lanzone trees prefer shaded areas that are out of direct sunlight. Find a location that has well-drained sandy loam soil or another soil that's slightly acidic. Lanzone trees will not grow in clay or alkaline soils., Use a tape measure to mark 8-12 feet (2.43-3.65 m) from each tree. If you plant lanzone trees too close together, it will make them unhealthy.You can use wooden sticks to help measure the distance between each tree.

, 50 cm wide holes will be large enough to hold the roots of the tree. Use a shovel or a hoe to dig holes that are deep enough to fully encompass the root ball of your lanzone tree., This fertilizer will help promote the growth of your lanzone tree. Adding this same compost to your tree two to three times a year after planting it will help it as it grows into an adult tree., Place the langsat tree into the hole, roots first. Once it's in the hole, cover the hole with top soil and press down on the soil around the trunk of the tree to help stabilize it. Once you're done, water it immediately., Fertilize your tree with 200g of ammonium sulfate fertilizer a month after you plant it and a month before the rainy season. Once the tree starts to bear fruit, you'll want to change the fertilizer you're using to a complete 14-14-14 fertilizer so that you can provide the tree with additional phosphorus and potassium.At the peak of fruiting, 2 kgs of 14-14-14 fertilizer should be applied annually.

, If you are growing your trees outside and there is regular rainfall, you won't need to water them regularly. If you're growing them inside or there is a dry period, however, you should use a watering can to water the plants every day. Keep the soil moist, but not overly wet. You can test this by poking your finger deep into the soil. If it's dry an inch under the surface, it's well watered., Once your tree grows to 1.5 meters (4.92 feet), cut off the top .5 meters (1.64 feet) of the tree. Your tree should be about a meter tall. This will promote the growth of your tree's branches and fruit. Remove dead or dying branches from your lanzone tree. You should also prune off clusters of flowers to promote the growth of the fruit., Harvest the fruit early in the day or later in the evening when the sun is not hot. Cut the fruit stalk with shears or a sharp knife. Do not detach the fruit's branch where it connects to the tree, or it won't be able to grow fruit on that branch in the future."

, Keep submerged for twelve hours.

, Plant each seed in the container. Plant the seeds deep in seed-starting mixture.

, Expect the seeds to take anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months to germinate. Place the cotyledons in a water-based container for faster germination (this can speed up the germination process to between ten to twelve days).

, When they are strong enough, separate and plant them in separate containers or in the garden. Expect fruit in about seven to twelve years; this is a slow process. Refer to the following section for growing the tree itself.

, On the other hand, seedlings will take seven to twelve years before they can bear fruit.

, Opt for a protected location that has full sun with sandy soil. (See ""Tips"" below for soil hints.)

, Blend ten pounds of composted manure into the soil.

, When planting, ensure that its graft union is not over one or two inches higher than the bottom.

,, Increase the amount of manure it receives little by little, until the fully grown tree is being given around one hundred pounds per year.

, It will produce its four-petal red or often yellow flowers in late winter or early spring. This will be followed by its apple-sized yellow or red fruit four or five months later, in mid-summer. Expect those fruits to fall after they are have ripened, at which point you can harvest them and enjoy their nutritional benefits.

Choose a variety of figs.,
Know when to plant.,
Decide where to plant.,
Prepare the soil.,
Prepare your plot.,
Plant your tree.,
Water the fig tree.,
Maintain the soil.,
Prune your figs when necessary.,
Harvest the fruit.",How to Grow Figs," There are many types of figs available on the market, but there are a few common ones that are very popular for their hardiness. Look into the figs that grow best in your region, but consider varieties like brown turkey, Brunswick, or Osborne figs. Keep in mind that figs come in varying colors, in shades from purple to green to brown. Each type of fig typically ripens at a different type of the year as well.Visit a local nursery or call your local agricultural extension to get figs that are suitable for your local climate.
Figs grow best in warm, tropical and desert-like areas, so the largest variety of figs will be able to grow in these environments. Only a select few species can grow in places whose temperatures drop below 40 °F (4 °C).;
, In general, figs should be planted in mid spring. A young fig tree will take up to two years to produce its first fruit, but typically the figs ripen in late summer and early fall. Pruning should also occur in the summer, which is atypical to some other popular fruit trees.

, Because fig trees are so cold-sensitive and also require maintenance of the root ball, it is typically easiest to plant them in a pot if you are growing them in a climate any colder than USDA hardiness zone 7. This way, they can be moved to warmer areas and their roots can be easily maintained. However, you can choose to plant your figs outside with the right conditions; find a location on a southern-facing slope with minimal shade and plenty of drainage.

, Although fig trees aren’t particularly picky about soil conditions, they do thrive with a few minor changes. In general, fig trees grow best in soil that is slightly sandy and with a pH near 7 or just below (more alkaline). Add a bit of fertilizer to the soil in a 4-8-12 or 10-20-25 mix or mulch with a layer of compost., Use a small shovel or your hands to dig a hole for your fig tree. Make the hole just large enough for the root ball to fit, and plant the tree at the same level it was growing in the container.

, Remove the plant from the container and carefully put it on its side. Use a pair of gardening shears to trim off the excess roots around the edges, as these reduce fruit production. Then, place the root ball in the hole and spread the roots carefully away from the trunk. Fill in the areas beneath and around the tree with soil, and pat the soil so it is even and firm., To help your newly planted tree to settle, give them a heavy watering for a few days. However, in general figs don’t like a ton of water, so give your tree a moderate amount of water 1-2 times a week after planting.

, If you planted your fig tree outside, it is important that you maintain the soil and plot that the plant is growing in. Pull any weeds that you see, and replenish the soil with fertilizer every 4-5 weeks. Additionally, apply between 4 and 6 inches of mulch around the trunk of the tree, covering the soil evenly.


Keep in mind that trees planted in containers are more dependent on fertilizer, and they need to be fertilized once per month.
Mulching in the summer will preserve moisture. Mulching in the winter will protect the figs from cold and frost.

, Prune your fig tree in the summer of the second year, as it is not necessary to prune them during their first year of growth. Prune the branches down to 4 strong shoots, which will lead in the production of fruit. After the tree matures, prune back every spring before the figs begin to grow.

, Harvest figs from the tree when they are completely ripe, as they will not continue to ripen after picking (like peaches). A ripe fig will be a little bit soft, and curved at the neck. The color of a ripe fig will vary depending on the variety you have, as figs come in many different colors. Remove the fruit from the tree gently to avoid bruising the fig.


Wear gloves when picking your figs, as the sap from the tree (released during harvesting) is a natural skin irritant."

Choose what type of fruit to grow.,
Choose a suitable container for strawberry bushes.,
Grow other types of fruit in large, deep containers.,
Use potting soil for planting the fruit plants.,
Keep the potted fruit trees in direct sunlight for most of the day.,
Keep the fruit trees well-watered.,
Apply fertilizer every two weeks.,
Make sure the containers are draining properly.,
Once the fruit starts to grow, prevent the plants from toppling over.,
Move the containers indoors over the winter months.",How to Grow Fruit in Pots," Strawberries are the most common kind of fruits grown in pots on patios and decks, but there are other options. Dwarf apple, orange and peach trees can also be grown in containers, as well as blueberry and raspberry bushes.


Some hybrids and cultivars of fruit trees and bushes are self-pollinating but, for best results, you should grow two fruit trees or bushes that are pollen-compatible.
The greenhouse or nursery should be able to help you select compatible trees and bushes.;
, Strawberries can be grown in a variety of containers, including containers called strawberry pots that are specially designed for them.


They can also be grown in window boxes, long rectangular containers that sit on the ground, hanging baskets, vertical stacking containers or just in small- or medium-sized pots that sit on a table.

, Dwarf fruit trees, blueberry bushes and raspberry bushes require large, deep containers that sit on the ground. These fruit trees are commonly sold “bare root,” which is simply the plant without soil or a container, or in 5- to 10-gallon containers.


“Bare root” trees and shrubs can be started in 5- to 10-gallon containers but, as they grow, both container-grown and bare-root bushes and trees will have to be transplanted into larger 25- to 30-gallon pots.
Nearly any type of container can be used, as long as it has several drain holes in the bottom.

, Fruit trees and bushes should be potted up with soil-based potting soil rather than soil from the garden.


Soil from the garden tends to contain insects and diseases and will likely not drain well enough for container-grown plants.
The plant, tree or bush should be planted or transplanted no deeper than it was growing previously.

, Place the planted containers where they will be exposed to at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day.


In very hot climates, it is best if the direct sunlight exposure is in the morning and early afternoon as the hot, scalding afternoon sun can cause damage to the leaves and fruit.
Setting the tree containers on wheeled carts is a good way to move them around with ease. Gardeners might also consider investing in a dolly.

, One downside to growing fruit in pots is the necessity for frequent irrigation. Soil in containers dries out much more quickly than ground soil.


Check the containers every morning and evening. Water the fruit plant, tree or bush when the top inch or two of soil becomes dry and apply the water until it drains from the bottom of the container.
Watering plants with spoiled milk is a good way to both stave off powdery mildew and add some nutrients to the soil at the same time.

, Fertilizer must also be applied to potted fruit plants more frequently. A balanced 10-10-10 water-soluble fertilizer should be given every two weeks or so.


Follow the fertilizer manufacturer’s recommendations for dilution instructions and application frequency. Always water first then apply the diluted fertilizer.
Do not apply fertilizer after mid- to late summer to avoid new, tender leaf growth coming into the winter months.

, Gardeners should make sure that their fruit plants have good drainage. Adding horticultural or washed playground sand to the potting soil prior to planting is an excellent way to improve drainage.


Another idea is to set the plant off the ground by using planter “feet” or bricks. This may also help keep out ants.

, Gravel placed at the bottom of fruit tree pots will prevent the containers from becoming top-heavy. Taller fruit trees may also need stakes or trellises to keep them upright, especially when bearing fruit.

, In the winter, even fruit trees and bushes that are hardy enough to take the cold temperatures should be moved indoors or to a protected location in late fall when they are grown in containers.


A garage where the temperatures do not drop much below freezing is fine or, where winter temperatures tend to get very cold, a basement or cool room in the house works well.
Over the winter, you should water the plants lightly when the soil becomes dry.

,
Use the same methods for growing boysenberries as for growing raspberries.,
Harvest the boysenberries when ready.,
Enjoy the harvest.",How to Grow Boysenberries," Boysenberries enjoy mild winters and warm summers.;
, Add a lot of well-rotted manure to the ground before planting.

, The best method for growing boysenberries is to place a two-wire trellis system in the planting area. Erect this prior to planting.


Tie the fruiting canes to the top wire of the two-wire trellis.
Use the second wire to train new growth that will fruit in the following year.

,, The main difference is that boysenberries require a lot more vigorous pruning to prevent their growth from getting out of hand.

, A well tended boysenberry plant should produce fruit well for up to 15 years. Expect about 5kg of fruit each season from each plant.


Cut back the top growing canes (the ones attached to the top wire) at the end of the harvest. Cut them down to ground level. In turn, transfer the new growth canes to the top wire level in readiness for next season.

, Boysenberries can be made into ice cream, baked in cakes, pies, and crumbles, or enjoyed fresh on their own or with a dollop of cream or ice cream.

Realize first and foremost that cherries cannot be grown in all regions of the world.,
Do some research to learn about the many varieties of cherries that you can grow.,
Know that the most common varieties are the sweet cherry and the tart cherry.,
Plant your cherry trees in a location that will provide sunshine, soil that is well drained and proper circulation of air.,
Fertilize your cherry trees annually during the spring.,
Follow the guidelines in watering, pruning and spraying your cherry trees based on the particular variety that you purchased.,
Realize that birds will be attracted to your plants and that you will need to protect them in order to enjoy the cherries and not to have the fruit eaten before it is harvested.,
Monitor your cherry trees as they grow.,
Plan to treat your cherry trees with pesticides for cherry fruit flies.",How to Grow Cherries," If you are in doubt as to your own particular growing zone and its compatibility for growing cherries, contact your local garden center or landscaping and nursery store to explore your options.;
, Some varieties may do better in certain growing zones than in others.


Select a cherry variety that is compatible with the climate in which you live. Choosing the wrong variety of cherry can result in problems such as cherry leaf spot, brown rot and fruit cracking.

, The type of cherry that you decide to grow should depend on your growing zone and how much work and effort you are willing to put into growing and caring for them.


Choose a tart variety of cherry to grow if you want to use them primarily for cooking such as in preserves and pies. Tart cherries are hardier, tend to have less disease and are more tolerant of extreme temperatures. Tart cherry trees are ornamental and tend to be smaller overall in size, which makes them easier to care for through pruning and harvesting.
Select a sweet variety of cherry if you want to grow them primarily for eating. Growing sweet cherries requires more time in pruning and spraying to protect against disease. The sweet cherry is also the variety that attracts birds more often so extra efforts will have to be made in protecting your cherry trees.

, Choose an elevated site over 1 that is located in low areas where colder temperatures settle.


Do not plant your cherry trees in a location that has previously been used to plant tomatoes, melons, strawberries or peaches. Cherries are very susceptible to several diseases including Verticillium wilt.
Provide space for your cherry trees to grow after you plant them. Allow approximately 12 feet (4 m) spacing between dwarf size cherry plants. Standard size cherry plants require twice the amount of distance between plants.
Use good, rich soil as you put your cherry plants into the ground and cover the roots. In gauging the depth of the hole, it should not be too much deeper than the original container in which it was placed prior to its purchase.

, Once they start to bear fruit, wait until after harvesting time to fertilize the trees.

, Remember that some varieties are hardier than others.

, There are several methods that you can use to protect your cherry trees.


Explore possible options including netting as well as fencing to surround the perimeters of your cherry trees. Birds can easily get caught in netting unless you use the correct gauge and drape it properly. Contact your local garden center to learn about methods to safeguard your cherry trees that will not harm nearby wildlife.

, The initial cherry blossoms that flower during spring will produce a beautiful display. With proper care, your cherry trees can provide you with many years of enjoyment as well as a harvest of fresh fruit for both eating and cooking.

, Cherry fruit flies, common across the united states cause cherry worms making cherries unusable. There are also organic ways to handle birds, pests and fruit flies. Another common pest after cherries are harvested are Japanese beetles.

Harvest your blueberries.",How to Grow Blueberries," This variety grows well in USDA hardiness zones four through seven. Highbush is the most common type of blueberry and it yields large, dark berries on bushes six to eight feet tall.Set highbush blueberries 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
This variety is best for eating fresh and for making desserts.;
, This variety is resilient in cold weather and best for USDA plant hardiness zones two through six. This super-hardy variety grows low to the ground between 6 and 18 inches tall.Set lowbush blueberries 2 feet (0.6 m) apart.
Lowbush berries are small and sweet. They are good for baking muffins and pancakes.

, This variety does well in zones seven through nine and can tolerate heat and drought. The berries are typically smaller than highbush berries and they ripen a bit later in the summer than other varieties.


Set rabbiteye blueberries 15 feet (4.6 m) apart.
If you do not have a lot of space to plant your blueberries, maybe opt for the lowbush or highbush variety instead of the rabbiteye variety.

, Blueberries have both male and female organs on the same flower, but not all are self-pollinating. If you want to be sure that your blueberries will be pollinated, plant different varieties within 100 feet (30.5 m) of each other. Doing so allows bees to travel between plants and cross-pollinate.

, Fruit plants need as much sunlight as possible, especially when the berries begin to develop. Build a raised garden bed to grow your blueberries in. Blueberries do well in raised beds that are 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) wide and 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) high. Make a simple raised garden box out of two 1 x 8-inch cedar boards. Cedar is a good choice for a garden bed because it won't rot with age.Choose a high or raised spot in your garden for the garden beds. Avoid low-lying areas and spaces where water tends to collect and/or flood.

, Mixing peat moss into the soil can improve drain, as peat moss can absorb and hold 10 to 20 times its dry weight in water. Use a planting area approximately 2-1/2 feet in diameter and 1 foot (0.3 m) deep. Remove no more than half of the soil and mix the removed soil with an equal ratio of peat moss. Mix the peat moss/soil mixture back into the planting area.


Keep in mind peat moss can be harmful to the environment and is relatively expensive to buy. There are several environmental costs associated with the peat moss market, including the fuels required to dig drainage ditches, harrow and dry the peat, bale it, and ship it long distances.

, Most fruits do best in slightly acidic soil between a pH of 5.5 and 6.5. Blueberries prefer an even more acidic soil with a pH between 4.09 and 5.0. Your local agricultural extension office should have soil testing forms, bags and instructions available.
If the pH level is higher than 5.0, enrich the soil to make it more acidic using acid compost or planting mix.
If the soil pH is above 4.5, mix in granular sulfur to lower the pH level so it is closer to 4.09.
After making adjustments to the soil, always test its pH level again.

, This way, they will start producing fruit for you quickly. If you start with younger plants, it will take a few years for them to develop fruit.Plant the bushes in early spring. The fruit will ripen toward the end of summer.

, Pat the blueberry plants with the heel of your wrist to loosen the roots. Do this all around the outside of the container and then turn it sideways and slide the plant out by tapping the bottom of the pot. Catch the plant with your hand.Do not grab the plant by the stem as this can dislodge the roots and damage the plant.

, It should be shallow enough that the top of the root base is 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) above ground (for plants about 2 years old, 20 inches deep and 18 inches wide). You can use a simple hand trowel to dig the holes.Make the holes between 2-1/2 and 6 feet apart. If you space the holes closer together, you will end up with continuous rows, but if you space the holes further apart, you will end up with individual bushes.

, Pat soil up around the top of the plant to cover any exposed roots with 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of soil. Then, add 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) of mulch to the planting side. This helps to keep the ground moist, prevent weeds, and enrich the soil.Bark mulch, sawdust, and grass clippings are all good choices for mulch for blueberries. Replenish the mulch every couple of years.
Always water the area thoroughly after planting.

, If you do not want to use grown blueberry plants, you can grow blueberries from seed. Sow seed in a flat, 3-inch deep box filled with finely ground moist sphagnum moss. Keep the moss moist in a warm room between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and covered with a sheet of newspaper.The seed should germinate into seedlings within one month. Place the seedlings in direct sunlight and continue growing them in the moss until they are about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tall. You can then transfer the seedlings to a larger pot or to your garden.
Water the seedlings well and maintain them in a sunny location. After two to three weeks, fertilize the seedlings with liquid fertilizer at 1/2 the recommended rate.

, Use one to two inches of water per week. Be careful not to over-water or drown your blueberry plants., The first year that you plant the blueberries, clip all of the blooms off of the plants. This will allow the plants to become resilient before they start producing fruit. Pruning also removes crowded or stagnant stems and allows productive parts of the plants to grow stronger.Every year thereafter, remove low growth around the base of the bush by clipping at an angle at the node of each branch. Remove any dead branches and/or twigs from the plants, as well as any discolored, blotchy growths.
Prune lowbush blueberries by cutting the stems to ground level, but do not prune the full plant, as the pruned stems will not bear fruit the next season. To ensure your plant produces each year, only prune half of the plant each year.
The pruning process should eliminate about 1/3 to 1/2 of the wood growth on each plant. Thin out the branches further if necessary.

, If your blueberries grow less than a foot annually (or less than 4 inches for lowbush plants), try using a natural fertilizer to boost the plant's productivity. If possible, use an organic fertilizer to avoid hurting the roots and effectively deliver nitrogen to the blueberries.


Seed meals such as soybean and alfalfa are good organic options. Use 1/4 cup to 2 cups of fertilizer per plant depending on the size.
Blood meal and cottonseed meal also work well as fertilizer.
Fertilize the plants in early spring and again in late spring for best results. Always water well after fertilizing.

, Remember, if the pH level is higher than 5.0, you can enrich the soil to make it more acidic using acid compost or planting mix. If the soil pH is above 4.5, mix in granular sulfur to lower the pH level., Do this in late July or early August. Some varieties, including rabbiteye, take a bit longer to fully ripen. Each year, the time of harvest will vary slightly depending on climate conditions."

, They can grow with some shade but prefer full sun.

, Blackcurrants feed well and need a nutritious soil. Till the soil and add blood and bone or potash and nitrogen in the early spring.


The soil needs to be well-drained, light, and kept moist.
Blackcurrants are more forgiving on less nutritious soil than other berries but produce the best fruit when well fed.

, Fruit is borne on the length of the previous year's spring growth, by sending up shoots from under the round yearly. When planting, bury the blackcurrant stem about 5 centimeter (2.0 in) deeper than it was positioned in the container you purchased it in.

, Don't pick the blackcurrants too soon. Once ripened, leave the berries to hang on the bush a few extra days to improve the flavour. When you see some of the upper level berries fall off unaided, the blackcurrants are ready for harvesting.

, Each bush should carry around 6 to 10 shoots. Remove the oldest canes post-harvest yearly. This will stimulate the new growth.


Pruning off the oldest canes will renew the entire bush about every three years.

Howes cranberries are small, red berries native to Massachusetts. They are easy to grow and will stay fresh for a long time after harvesting, if stored correctly.
Stevens cranberries are a hybrid variety of cranberry designed for productivity and disease resistance. They are large and bright red in color.
Two more varieties are Ben Lear (large, burgundy-colored berries) and Early Black (small, deep red berries). However, these varieties are not recommended for first time growers as they are more difficult to care for and are more prone to disease and insect infestation than the other varieties.;
, Cranberries are best grown in cooler climates. Consult a USDA plant hardiness zone map. Cranberries should be grown between zones two and five. This includes much of the northern and Midwestern United States. Cranberries can be planted at various times throughout the year, depending on the age of the plant.


Cuttings and seedlings can be planted throughout autumn, from October to early November. They can also be planted in springtime, from the middle of April to the end of May.
3 year old rooted plants -- which are still actively growing -- can sometimes be planted in summer, provided they are purchased in pots.

, When it comes to soil, cranberry plants have unique requirements -- they need soil with a low pH value and a high level of organic matter. As a result, it is often necessary to replace your existing soil instead of trying to alter it.


The average size for a cranberry plot is 4 foot (1.2 m) by 8 foot (2.4 m). However, if you are only growing a single plant, a 2 foot (0.6 m) by 2 foot (0.6 m) square will do just fine.
Dig out the existing soil in the cranberry plot, to a depth of 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm). Fill the plot in with peat moss, then mix in 1/2 pound of bone meal and 1 pound of blood meal.
Optionally, you can add 1 cup of epsom salts and 1 pound of rock phosphate as well. (These quantities are for a 32 sq. foot plot, so adjust accordingly).
Before planting, wet the soil thoroughly (but do not saturate it). You can do this by misting the plot with the garden hose, mixing the soil periodically to encourage absorption., Cranberry plants are not grown from seeds, but from one year old cuttings or three year old seedlings.


It's important to be aware that cranberry plants do not start to produce fruit until their third or fourth year -- so whether you choose to plant cuttings or seedlings will depend on how quickly you want fruit.
If you choose to plant cranberry cuttings, plant them in the prepared wet soil, leaving approximately one foot of space between each plant. The root ball of each plant should be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the surface of the soil.
If you choose to plant 3 year old seedlings, leave approximately three feet of space between each plant.

, Cranberry plants grow best in a garden plot, where they have plenty of space to spread their runners. However, it is also possible to grow a single plant in a large pot. Choose a pot that is at least twice the size of the plant's root ball.


Fill the pot with peat moss and plant a three year old seedling. Allow the plant to develop runners inside the pot (as these will take root and form fruit-bearing uprights), but trim any that extend beyond it. You can also fertilize the soil with low-nitrogen fertilizer, as this will limit the growth of runners.
Potted cranberry plants will need to be replaced every couple of years (unlike those in plots which sustain themselves indefinitely).

, Cranberry plants do not compete well against weeds, so it's very important to weed the bed regularly, particularly during the first year. Luckily, the peat moss used in the cranberry plot will inhibit the growth of many common garden weeds., During the first year (and beyond) cranberry plants will need constant watering to keep the soil. If the roots dry out, the plants will die.


It is a common misconception that cranberry plants need to be saturated or submerged in water during growing. Although the soil should always be wet (or at least damp) to the touch, it shouldn't be saturated with water.
Too much water can slow down root growth and prevent the roots from reaching the necessary depth.

, Soon, your cranberry plants will start to put out out runners that grow along the ground. The runners should grow until they fill and cover the bed. If they do not, you can fertilize your cranberry bed with a high-nitrogen fertilizer. Only use fertilizer if runners are struggling to grow; too much high-nitrogen fertilizer may cause overwhelming growth.


If fertilizing in the first year, fertilize the soil three times -- once at the beginning of growth, once when the flowers bud and once when the berries start forming.
In order to contain the spread of runners within the cranberry plot, you may want to line the perimeter of the bed with some wooden or plastic edging.
After the first year, you'll need to cut off the nitrogen supply to the runners -- this will encourage them to stop spreading so they will take root and form uprights instead. Use a non-nitrogen fertilizer from the second year onwards.
At the start of the second year (and every couple of years after that) you will need to cover the soil with a thin (1/2 inch) layer of sand. This helps to root the runners and prevent weeds.

, Cranberry plants are susceptible to certain pests and diseases, but these are relatively easy to deal with, provided you know what to look for.


Cranberry fruit-worm is a common problem, where grey moths lay their eggs inside the berries themselves. If you spot grey moths around your cranberry plants, you will need to spray the plot with insecticides to kill the eggs.
If you do not catch fruitworm on time, the eggs will hatch and the worms will eat the cranberries from the inside out. When this happens, the infested berries will turn red before they ripen. You can deal with this by picking off the prematurely red berries (in addition to the surrounding fruit) and disposing of them.
Two other common diseases are red spot (where bright red spots develop on the leaves of the plant) and berry fruit rot. The treatment for both of these diseases is the same -- spray the cranberry plants with an organic, copper-based fungicide between late June and early August, according to the instructions on the label., From the third year of growth onwards, you will need to prune the cranberry plants each spring to control the runners and encourage uprights.


You can do this by combing the cranberry plot with a landscape rake, until all of the runners are going in the same direction. This makes it easier to identify the longest runners and cut them back. Do not prune the existing uprights.
As time goes on, your cranberry plants may begin to spread beyond the bounds of the original plot. If this happens, you can prune each of the plants back in the springtime, until there is only two inches of growth above the soil line. The cranberry plants will not produce fruit that year, but normal production will resume the following year.

, If you planted three year old seedlings, your cranberry plant may by producing fruit by the following autumn. But if you planted one year old cuttings, you may need to wait three or four years before your plant produces fruit.


Once your plant is producing fruit, you can harvest the berries in September and October of each year. When the berries are ripe they will be be bright or dark red in color (depending on the variety) and the seeds inside will be brown.
Although commercial growers harvest cranberries by flooding the fields in order to make the cranberries float (and therefore easier to collect), this is not necessary for home growers. The cranberries can simply be picked off the plants by hand.
It is important that you harvest all of the fruit before the first hard winter frost, as cranberries cannot withstand temperatures below 30 °F (−1 °C)., Once harvested, cranberries will stay fresh for up to two months when stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator -- this is much longer than most fruits.


Cooked cranberries (or cranberry sauce) will last in the refrigerator for up to a month, while dried cranberries (which have a similar texture to raisins) will keep for up to a year.

, It is important to protect your cranberry plants over the winter months to prevent them from freezing and drying out. You can do this by covering the cranberry plot with an opaque white plastic mulch before winter sets in.


You can uncover the cranberry plants in springtime (around April 1st) but you should be prepared to cover them on any night when frost is expected, as a frosty night could kill any new shoots and prevent fruit from growing that year.
Never cover your cranberry plants with clear or black plastic, however, as this can raise the temperature of the bed and potentially kill the plants.
Do not cover the plants with pine needles or leaves, as these might reduce the number of flowers and fruits that the plant produces the next year.

Some cultivars thrive in hot, humid climates while others do better in dry, cooler climates., They should have a good selection of cultivars that will do well in your area.

, Strawberries are highly susceptible to a number of diseases that can devastate a strawberry crop.Because of this, they are commonly grown as annual plants, with the old plants being thrown away each fall and replaced with new, disease-free plants each spring. Disease-resistant cultivars are either immune or much less susceptible to these common diseases.

, A strawberry pot is a barrel-shaped pot with pockets where the strawberries are planted. Growing them this way greatly reduces the likelihood of fungal and bacterial diseases as well as pest infestations.Plant one to three strawberry plants per 10- to 12-inch container or one plant per foot in a window box.

, Do not use ordinary garden soil as it does not generally contain enough organic matter or drain quickly enough for container-grown strawberry plants. It could also contain fungi, bacteria and pests, which would negate one of the bigger perks of growing strawberries in containers.

, Water them when the top 1 inch of soil becomes dry. You may need to water the plants every day or even twice each day when the weather is hot.

, Use fertilizer with a 5-10-10 ratio. The usual dilution rate is 1 tablespoon per gallon but this varies. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.


Apply the fertilizer solution after a regular watering as giving a strawberry plant fertilizer solution when it hasn’t been watered could burn the roots.

, Though early strawberries will grow in average soil, so long as it drains quickly, they grow better in organically rich sandy loam soil., In mild-winter climates in California and in the south, strawberries are planted in early fall. In cooler climates, strawberries are planted in early spring when temperatures reach 40 to 50 °F (4 to 10 °C)., These plants are all susceptible to similar diseases which can survive in the soil and infect the new strawberry plants. Make sure you select a garden area where the strawberries will be exposed to at least six hours of direct sunlight each day.

, Sphagnum peat moss, well-aged cow manure, compost or decomposed pine bark mulch can be used or several different types can be combined. Spread the organic matter over the strawberry bed and mix it into the top 8 to 10 inches of garden soil thoroughly with a rototiller.

, Do this after you incorporate the organic matter as adding organic matter to the soil could change the soil’s pH and fertility levels. Strawberries thrive in soil with a pH of 6 to 6.3.

, Mix it into the top few inches of soil with a dirt rake.The amount of lime or sulfur required to change the pH will depend on the soil texture. More lime or sulfur is needed to change the pH of loam soil than sandy soil.


It takes ½ pound of aluminum sulfate to lower the pH of 100 square feet of sandy soil from 6.5 to 6 but it takes 1 pound to make the same pH change in loam soil. The addition of organic matter should bring the soil fertility to acceptable levels.

, You should use a fertilizer with a ratio of 5-10-10 at the rate of 2 pounds per 100 square feet.Once you fertilize the beds, rake the soil into 8-inch high, 2-foot wide rows that are spaced 3 to 5 feet apart or into 8-inch high hills that are 2 feet apart., When planting in rows, space the plants 1 ½ to 2 feet apart.


Water them generously and spread a 2-inch depth of organic mulch over the soil around the plants to help keep the soil moist.

, The soil should be kept slightly moist but not wet. Strawberries require 1 to 2 inches of water each week., Set a 1-inch deep can next to the strawberry plants before watering. When the can is full, the strawberry plants have received 1 inch of water.

, It’s very important to keep the strawberry bed weed free. Weeds take nutrients away from the strawberries, reduce air circulation and harbor pests, creating a generally unhealthy environment for strawberries.

, You should give them 1 pound of 5-10-10 fertilizer per 100 square feet. Sprinkle the fertilizer in 6-inch wide bands in the furrows between the rows or hills.If the fertilizer gets on the strawberry plant leaves, brush it off quickly with a broom as it can burn the leaves.

, This is especially important for early strawberries as they ripen before other berries that birds usually eat, so if the berries are not protected, birds will eat them.


Spread the netting over the rows and anchor it to the ground with 6- to 8-inch deep stakes that are angled away from the rows so the netting is held firmly to the ground. This will keep the birds from walking under the net to get to the berries., Only pick berries that are completely red.

, Do not keep them over the winter as they will not thrive. Dispose of these plants and till the whole bed.

, Healthy early strawberries that are weed free can continue to produce berries for three to five years.Use a lawnmower with the blades set at a height of 4 inches to mow the leaves off the strawberry plants.
Rake up the leaves and remove them from the garden.
Use a rototiller or hoe to break the rows or hills down to a width of 1 foot.
Thin the strawberry plants so they are 6 inches apart, keeping only the healthiest plants.

, Brush the fertilizer off the leaves of the plants so it does not burn them. Water the plants generously to wash the fertilizer into the soil., These conditions can lead to red stele or phytophthora root rot, which cause strawberry plants to wilt and fail to produce berries.

, Doing this will prevent the plants from developing rhizoctonia root and crown rot, which cause the leaves of early strawberry plants to turn purple and curl.It will also prevent the development of anthracnose, a disease that causes dark lesions on strawberry plant stems, kills the leaves and new, young plants and causes reddish-brown rot on the crowns of mature plants, which eventually wilt and die.
Do not plant strawberry plants given to you by a friend or sold by an un-reputable grower.

, These disease include: leaf scorch and leaf spot, which are caused by fungi that flourish during rainy spring weather. Leaf spot appears as 1/8-inch purple spots that turn gray at the center, while leaf scorch appears as similar spots that do not develop gray centers. Both of these leaf diseases stunt strawberry plants and eventually kill them.


Phomopsis leaf blight infects new strawberry plants right after they are planted and will quickly kill the leaves. The first symptoms are round, red or purple spots on the leaves that turn gray in the center as they get bigger and eventually turn into v-shaped lesions along the leaf veins.
Your local Extension office can tell you if these diseases are a problem in your area.

, Mix 2 tablespoons of light vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons of baby shampoo and 2 tablespoons of baking soda into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.Shake it vigorously until it is thoroughly mixed.


Pour the remedy into a handheld or backpack pressure sprayer and spray the remaining healthy strawberry plants. Cover the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems with this solution until it begins to drip from the strawberry plant.
Spray them early in the morning or late in the evening every five to seven days until berries begin to form. Do not spray them when the sun is shining directly on them.

, This fungal disease turns strawberries light brown and can spread through the whole plant. It infects strawberry plants when they begin to bloom and flourishes in wet weather.


You can also deter this disease by spraying the plants with the vegetable oil/baby shampoo/baking soda solution when flower buds form and every five to seven days until the fruit forms.

, Angular leaf spot is caused by bacteria that lives in dead leaves and stems. The spots appear as small, wet, angular spots on the undersides of the leaves and eventually show up as red-brown spots on the tops of the leaves.


There is no cure for this disease and strawberry plants that are severely infected commonly die. So you will need to start a new bed the following spring as the disease can survive to re-infect the plants again year after year.
This disease occurs when the weather is wet and temperatures are 70 °F (21 °C) during the day and around 32 °F (0 °C) at night. Progression of the disease stops when temperatures warm and the weather becomes drier.

, Aphids are small, slow-moving bugs, most often green or red, that suck the plant’s juices.Spray the plants in the morning so the leaves will dry before temperatures cool in the evening. You may have to spray the plants once or twice each week if the aphids return.

, Use the recommended spray treatment for fungal leaf disease to also get rid of mites on the plants. Mites are barely visible spiders that suck up chlorophyll, the substance that makes plant leaves green.Mites cause the whole plant to become stunted. The plant's leaves will also curl and develop a bronze tint.
There is no need to add baking soda to your solution when treating strawberry plants for mites.
You can also treat tarnished plant bugs like small tan-backed beetles with the vegetable oil/baby shampoo solution. These pests feed on new growth buds at the tips of the stems in early spring.As a result, the strawberry plant will look distorted, very short and bushy. Get rid of these pests by applying the vegetable oil/baby shampoo solution every five to seven days.

, Leaf rollers are moth larvae that roll themselves in strawberry leaves and secure the roll with a fine web. They feed on the leaves while they grow.They are rarely a serious problem and are easily controlled by simply removing the rolled leaves and throwing them in the trash., Nematodes are tiny parasites that burrow into the roots of strawberry plants, interrupting the flow of moisture and nutrients, and causing the plants to yellow, wilt and eventually die.Strawberry plants afflicted with nematodes cannot be saved, but if nematode are present, grow your new strawberry plants in containers to deter the development of pests., Strawberry root weevils are black or brown beetles that are about ¼-inch long, with larvae that appear as ¼-inch long off-white grubs. Adults feed on the plant’s leaves at night and chew notches in the edges of the leaves, while the larvae chew and eat the roots.Strawberry plants with weevils look stunted with dark, blue-green leaves that are bunched together. As soon as you notice these symptoms, set tuna cans in the ground so the top is level with the soil and fill it halfway with water.The weevils will go for the water, crawl in the cans and drown.
Check the cans each morning, empty the weevils into the trash and replace the cans.

, Diatomaceous earth (DE) is actually ground up snail fossils. It scratches the weevil’s shell, causing them to die of dehydration.

, Slugs like to chew on strawberry plant leaves, stems, flowers and berries.You can also place tuna cans filled with beer into the soil to attract slugs as the slugs will crawl into the beer and drown. Check the cans every afternoon, empty them and refill them as necessary.

If you're going to plant some, it makes sense to pick one of these varieties, wherever you live, based on the structure of the cane, its growth pattern, and whether or not the variety has thorns. There are hundreds of strains and varietals to choose from, but knowing the basic categories will help you to make an informed decision.



If you live in a region with very cold winters, it's best to select an erect variety with thorns. These stand up to the elements the best and will provide the most solid-possible base for your climate.

If you live in a region with very dry windy summers, it's best to plant trailing varieties, which will stand up to the elements in especially harsh high-desert climates.
Most varieties are able to grow in regions with at least 200-300 hours per season under 45 °F (7 °C), including USDA climate zones 7, 8, and 9 in the United States.;
, Traditional training varieties grow much like the wild blackberry, shooting out suckers and sprawling all over the place, which means they'll need to be trellised with wires and trained along them to control the growth. Old fruiting canes will need to be removed, but new primocanes (new growth) will not need to be pruned.Trailing varieties often struggle in regions with especially cold winters, and won't fruit until their second year of growth.


Evergreen, Marion, Obsidian, Chester, Hull, and Black Diamond are all popular varieties of trailing blackberry.

, These varieties of blackberry grow more like hedges, and will need to be supported with a T-trellis or a post of some sort. These varieties are easier to control and contain, but require vigorous pruning, shooting stiff new cane straight from the crown of the plant, rather than trailing along the ground. Many of these varieties will produce fruit in the first year of planting. Thorny erect varieties are the hardiest in cold climates.Illini, Kiowa, Shawnee, Apache, Triple Crown, and Natchez are all popular varieties of erect and semi-erect blackberry.

, Trailing, upright, and hybrid varieties are all now available in thorny or thornless strains, meaning that you can make your harvest a whole lot easier on your fingers. Thornless varieties do tend to be somewhat more sensitive to colder weather, making the thorny varieties a much hardier choice for most climates.

, Blackberries will grow in most kinds of fertile soil, especially slightly acidic soil (between 5.5 and 7 pH) that is rich in humus. Especially sandy or clay-rich soil is less desirable. Select a planting location with good drainage and maximum exposure to sunlight to make sure your berries ripen evenly, though some thornless varieties are prone to ""sunburn,"" so some shade isn't a worry in especially sunny regions.



Don't plant blackberries near nightshade, or members of the nightshade family, including tomato, potato, and pepper. Verticillium wilt, a common blackberry blight, can be transmitted through the soil.

Don't plant blackberries in the same vicinity of other brambles, or near any wild-growing blackberry. Start your blackberries on a fresh site to avoid common diseases that can be transmitted.

In colder climates, blackberries can flourish and ripen more quickly inside a greenhouse. Though they're self-fertile, they'll still benefit from cross-pollination, meaning that it's a good idea to grow two different varieties, if you grow them indoors. They'll need to be exposed to at least 200 hours below 40 °F (4 °C), but kept between 60 and 70 F when inside., When you've selected your plot, you'll want to dig into the earth at least a foot and till the soil of your plot thoroughly to aerate. Mix in a 2 inch (5.1 cm) layer of manure and a 2 inch (5.1 cm) layer of organic soil conditioner to fertilize.



It's usually best to start small. Because blackberries can really take over in the proper climate (long, dry summers), it's easy to overwhelm yourself with berries accidentally. If you want to test out how blackberries will do in your area, start with a single erect variety, placed somewhere with room to expand. Plant more rows if you don't get the kind of production you're interested in after starting with one.

If you're going to plant several rows of blackberry, space the rows between 6 and 10 feet apart. Erect plants can be closer together than trailing varieties. You can plant your trellis poles before you put in your plants, or after. Trellising is discussed in the following section.

, If you live somewhere with very cold winters, it's best to wait until spring to put your blackberries in the ground. In areas with more moderate winters, planting them in the fall is appropriate to give them a chance of setting for the growing season.



Blackberry plants should be set into the ground about 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm), and spaced between 3 and 6 feet apart from one another. Upright or erect plants can be closer than trailing varieties, which should be more like 6 or 7 feet (1.8 or 2.1 m) apart from one another. Add as much as a gallon of water upon planting the canes,

Blackberry plants purchased from greenhouses will typically have 6 or 8 inches (15.2 or 20.3 cm) of dormant growth sticking out of the top of a ball of soil protecting the root system. They won't always look like the prettiest plant, but will start shooting cane vigorously in the spring.
Buy your blackberry starts from a greenhouse in your area, a few days before you want to put them in the ground. If you mail-order your starts, try to order your plants a month or two before you want to put them in the ground, and keep the roots moist by setting them in your garden plot and mounding some soil around the root system if you need to wait to put them in the ground.

, Blackberry plants might need between 1 and 2 inches of water per week, depending on the climate. If you've got a large plot of berries, installing drip-line irrigation can be a good option, while smaller plots will be fine to hand-water. In especially dry or windy climates, mulching can help to avoid erosion.


Mulching with pine bark, pine needles, or plastic weed matting can help to protect the soil in the immediate area surrounding the blackberries from weeds and erosion. About 2 inches (5.1 cm) of any type of mulch will be sufficient for blackberry., Plant posts about 6 feet (1.8 m) tall adjacent to each erect plant, with a cross-bar about 3 feet (0.9 m) long, placed about 3 or 4 feet (0.9 or 1.2 m) high on the post. As the canes grow up, you you can train the primocane suckers (new growth) around the post to help support the weight of the canes, leaves, and berries.


Erect and semi-erect blackberry varieties will mostly grow straight up, sometimes quite high. To promote growth, it's important to use a post-system of trellising, as you would roses, or another snaking vine. You want to give the blackberry something to climb on. Typically, you won't need to train or trellis erect plants in the first year.Blackberry posts don't need to be elaborate. Plant along existing fences, or use old fence posts to support blackberry. Ideally, posts will be about wrist-thick, so 2 x 2 boards would work fine.

, When planting trailing varieties, it's important to give them a horizontal avenue on which to cling. Plant 4–6 foot (1.2–1.8 m) high posts every 5 or 6 feet (1.5 or 1.8 m) along the row, then run two rows of fence wire between the posts, one at the top of the post and one about a foot off the ground.


It's also possible to use twine, string, or wood to connect each post to the next. Use whatever materials you have on hand to let the blackberries climb on.
Ideally, trailing blackberries will spread in two rows, one higher and one lower, along each wire. With proper pruning, you can train new hardy growth along the trellis and cut back less-vigorous shoots. Keeping the plants trimmed will promote fruit growth and overall plant health, allowing water and sunlight to reach the most healthy cane.

, Pull weeds that grow around the blackberries and continue watering the plants weekly as the seasons change. You should see leaves and maybe some blossoms in the late spring, or you might not, depending on the climate and variety. Canes and new shoots should be significant, though you probably won't get any fruit.In the late spring, cane should be shooting aggressively and you can practice training it out along the trellis if you want to, or support it with the post. In general, though, you shouldn't worry about cutting anything back, because you won't get any fruit, so you want to let the plant establish a solid root system.

In the winter, after your first season, you can cut cane back to about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall and 2 feet (0.6 m) wide, to let nutrients move back down to the roots. Depending on the kind of growth you got during the season, you can winter your plant accordingly. Winterizing blackberry is discussed in the following section.

, Unburdened shoots will put on more fruit than the same shoots in a cluster of bramble. It's to your advantage, whatever the variety, to prune the blackberry regularly.



When your plant is ready to put on fruit, take action to keep the most hardy shoots healthy by cutting back new shoots from the base of the plant. Train the most blossom-laden shoots along your trellis system, or up the post, and cut back new growth that will sap water and sunlight from the healthy shoots.

Don't be afraid to aggressively cut back blackberry. Over-burdened bramble systems won't put on as much fruit in the same amount of space as a tamed and well-pruned plant.The plant will come back just as aggressively, if not more so next year, so feel free to really hack it back. It's very difficult to kill a healthy plant by pruning aggressively.

, Sometime in early summer, beautiful white blackberry blossoms should form along healthy shoots, which will give way to hard green berries, which will gradually turn red, then deepen into a soft and dark purplish black color.Berries are ready to be harvested when they pull easily from the stem of the wine without much effort. There should be no red remaining on the berry, especially at the top where it meets the stem.

Pick blackberries in the coolest part of the day, usually the morning, before the sun heats them, and store them in the refrigerator to keep them fresh. Blackberries will stay fresh for no more than 4 or 5 days, depending on the variety, and will soften much more quickly when picked warm. If you can't eat all the blackberries you grow fresh, they're great for freezing.

When the blackberries start coming on, it's likely you'll need to pick them every 2 or 3 days, at least, depending on the climate. They'll start coming on all at once, and it's important that you pick them before the birds get to them, and before they over-ripen on the vine.

, Who can blame them? As much as you love a plump, juicy, and delicious blackberry, birds probably like them more. Since there's nothing more frustrating than going out to pick your berries and finding the best ones half-eaten, it's important that you take a few quick and easy steps to head off your bird friends at the pass.



Hang something flashy at the end of each row. Strips of mylar tape or shards of broken CDs are common bird-deterrents. You want something that will catch the breeze slightly and reflect the sunlight, since bright or flashing movement will scare birds away.

Use a scare-owl. Commonly sold at gardening stores, plastic owls can be planted at the edge of your blackberry patch and will often frighten away the lesser birds.

Try bird netting if you've got a serious problem. If the birds won't leave your berries alone, you can get some mesh bird netting to throw over the top of your plants. They'll still be able to get all the sunlight and water they need, but will keep the birds away. It's unfortunately possible for smaller birds to get stuck in some kinds of bird nets, making it a more obtrusive option for some growers.

, Like any cultivated plant, blackberries are susceptible to a variety of diseases, blights, and pests that you can help to control with careful inspection and identification skills. Affected plants and cane needs to be eliminated and isolated from the rest of the plant, either by aggressive pruning or removal.



Yellowish leaves tend to be a sign of nitrogen deficiency in the soil, which you can quickly mend by spreading some coffee grounds around the base of the plants that seem to be struggling. Yellow spots, on the other hand, can be a sign of the bushy dwarf virus or blackberry calico, which means you'll need to remove the affected plants.

Mites, cane borers, aphids, and Japanese beetles can affect blackberries, depending on the region you live in. Keep an eye out for munched-on leaves and berries and take action accordingly. Soap, orange oil, and tobacco are all organic varieties of insecticide you can make yourself.

Various fungi and blights such as crown rot, double blossom, or cane blight can be treated with fungicides like Bordeaux mixture or lime sulfur., After the growing season, the shoots and canes will start browning and dying down. It's usually best, however, to wait to prune it back until it's died off significantly, waiting until the late fall or winter to prune the blackberry entirely. This gives the plant enough time to suck the nutrients back from the long shoots into the root system, keeping it healthy for the winter.



You can trim back erect varieties to about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall, and no more than a foot or two wide, then cover them with matting for the winter, if you're going to have lots of snow, or you can leave them exposed. It's a good idea to trim back the plant to the strongest 3 or 4 major primary canes to give the plant the best possible start in the next growing season.

Trailing vines can be pruned by removing the fruiting canes and leaving the primary branch canes intact unless they've died and no longer put on fruiting cane. Typically, blackberry canes will put on fruit for about 2 years before dying off, though new canes will continue growing from the base.

, After your plants endure each winter, give them the best possible start by layering compost or the fertilizer of your choice around the blackberry before the growing season. Cared for properly and re-energized with fertilizer, blackberry plants can continue fruiting for as many as 20 years. Invest in them, and they'll give back.

Add compost and work through the soil.
Ensure good drainage; elderberry doesn't like waterlogged soil.;
, Take a hardwood or softwood cutting when the canes are still dormant and place in a container of quality soil. Water regularly.

, Plant in early spring, as soon as you can after transporting it from the nursery. If you have propagated your own, plant it when it's ready. Elderberry has short roots, so do not cultivate deeper than 5cm / 2 inches.


Space elderberry 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3.0 m) apart.

,, Wait until the berries are ripe and remove the whole cluster.


The berries should be used as soon as possible after harvesting. Keep in refrigeration until used.
The berries must be cooked; uncooked they have a dark purple juice, and are astringent and inedible.

, Prune later winter to early spring. Prune off dead, damaged, or broken canes. Second year canes fruit the best.


Remove all three year old canes. This will encourage new growth.
Leave an equal number of one, two, and three year old canes.
Remove all canes over three years old. Older canes weaken and lose their vigour.

Prune.",How to Grow Apricots," It should be a cultivar suited to your local climate. Apricot trees tend to prefer cooler climates but can be grown as far as sub-tropical climates provided it doesn't get too warm during the winter (this causes early fruiting).;
, Growing from seed requires a lot of patience and you'll need to stratify the seed to get it to germinate.


Consider the size of the tree. Dwarf trees are best for small garden spaces.
If buying a bare-root tree, get one that is about 2-3 years old.

, The apricot tree needs plenty of warmth during the summer season. The tree needs to be sheltered from frost and wind. This protects the fruit as well as the insects that need to pollinate the blossoms.


An apricot tree is very responsive to being grown fan-trained against a wall. Choose a wall that gets the most sun if you're in a cooler region.
Avoid anywhere that has had the following crops growing: eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, raspberries and strawberries. This is because these crops can be a source of verticillium wilt.
Apricots can be grown in containers successfully. Such a tree can be planted any time except when the weather is extremely hot.

, The soil should be well-draining but moisture retentive and rich and loamy. Apricots prefer a slightly alkaline soil in the pH range of 6.5-8.0. Ensure that the area is well weeded. Dig in well-rotted manure or compost.


Apricot trees don't do well in light, sandy soils.

, The only exception to this is a mild climate, when autumn (fall) planting is acceptable. Water well once planted and add a light layer of mulch around the tree. Don't let the mulch touch the bark though.


If fan-training the apricot, plant it 15 centimeter (5.9 in) (6"") away from the wall or fence.

, Apricots can suffer from root rot, so don't over-water them; a deep soaking once a week is best. Ensure that there is good drainage in the soil.

, Fertilizer (low-nitrogen, complete fertilizer) can be applied in later winter, and then once again during the fruiting period to help it cope with the added requirements of producing fruit.

, Be aware that apricot blossom is very susceptible to frost damage and may need to be protected.

, It is a good idea to thin the fruit at regular intervals. Begin when they are the size of cherries through to almost full size. Focus on removing fruits that don't look of good quality, are misshapen, or unhealthy in appearance. If a cluster has more than three to four apricots, thin these to allow the apricots on the cluster to reach full maturity.

, Apricots are usually ready for harvesting from midsummer through to early autumn. This will be dependent on the variety. They will feel slightly soft. Be gently with picking so as not to break the skin of the fruit.


The yield depends on the variety of tree, its size and age.

, The apricot tree has its best quality and most abundant cropping on short spurs on two to three year old wood. Therefore, don't prune extensively or you will get a poor crop. For the first few years, only prune very lightly, if at all. Cut older shoots out every four to six years to make way for new shoots; choose those no longer fruiting.


If you are fan-training the apricot tree, you'll need to prune accordingly. Do this in early spring, before the growth begins.
For an apricot bush, prune the leaders back in early spring. Over the years, as the central branches become unproductive, cut back one-third of the main branches after harvesting the apricots. This will encourage replacement branches with vigorous growth. Paint the cuts with plant wound paint or rubbing alcohol to prevent infection.

Transfer your banana tree when it outgrows its container.",How to Grow Banana Trees in Containers," Banana trees thrive in well-drained soil. When looking for the right type of soil, consider ones with a good mix of peat, perlite, and vermiculite. A cactus or palm tree soil mixture is an excellent choice for banana trees.You can purchase bags of this soil at most home and gardening stores.


Some soil is not beneficial for banana tree growth, such as standard heavy potting soil or soil that's found in your yard.Your banana tree will do best in soil with a pH of 5.6 - 6.5.;
, A standard banana tree can grow to be over 15 meters (49 feet) in height and will become too large for a regular pot. When purchasing a banana tree, make sure that you go for a dwarf variety of tree. These trees only grow to around 1.5 m (5 feet) to 4 m (13 feet), can be grown indoors, and will not outgrow the pot that you put them in.Look online for different varieties of dwarf banana tree corms for sale.


Types of dwarf banana trees include the Dwarf Red, Dwarf Brazilian, Williams Hybrid, and Dwarf Lady Finger.

, Start your tree off in a 6 inch (15 cm) or 8 inch (20 cm) pot with a drainage hole. Never plant your banana tree in a pot that doesn't have good drainage.Make sure the pot is deep so that the banana tree roots have room to expand. When choosing the material for the pot, decide on how much you want to spend and purchase a terracotta, clay, or ceramic pot.When your tree outgrows the first pot, you can transport it to a larger pot.
Once the tree is big enough for a 30 cm (10 inch) pot, increase the size of your pot by 10-15 cm (4-6 inches) every two to three years., The corm is the base of the banana tree and contains the tree's roots. If you don't want to plant the corm and wait for the tree to grow, you can buy a young banana tree or a banana tree sucker. This will bypass having to grow new suckers from the corm, and may make it easier to plant your tree.


You may also be able to buy young banana trees or banana corms at a local nursery., Fill your pot with the soil that you purchased from the gardening store. Use a spade to dig a small hole in the center of your pot about three inches (7.62 cm) deep. You may have to dig a deeper hole to accommodate the size of your corm. Make sure to leave enough space around the corm so that you can plant it deep into your pot. To test this, place your corm in the hole and make sure that the top 20% of the corm sticks out of the hole. This portion of your tree should remain exposed until new leaves start sprouting. Once the corm is planted, fill in the gaps on the side with soil., Take your corm and place it in the hole that you just dug, roots side down. When planting your corm, make sure that it's 3 inches (7.5 cm) from the sides of your pot all around it so that the roots have room to grow. The top 20% of your corm should be exposed until the banana tree starts to grow leaves.When shoots or suckers start to grow from your corm, you can cover the rest of the corm with fertilizer.

, Water your plant thoroughly with a hose when you first plant it, saturating all of the soil surrounding the corm. Bring your tree outside and allow the water to drain through the drainage holes. After this initial watering, you can use a watering can to keep the soil moist, but not overly wet.Do not put your pot on a saucer because the pool of water can lead to bacteria and rot., Use a fertilizer that's high in magnesium, potassium, and nitrogen to promote the growth of your tree. Combine a soluble fertilizer to water or sprinkle the top of the soil with a granular fertilizer.Regularly fertilizing the plant will provide the roots with the proper nutrients and minerals and will promote your tree's growth.


If you can't find a soluble fertilizer that is made specifically for tropical plants, consider getting a balanced 20-20-20 fertilizer.Popular fertilizer companies include Agrium, Haifa, PotashCorp, and Yara International., Make sure that the soil under your tree remains moist each day. You can test this by pushing your finger down into the soil to see how dry the underlying soil is. The soil should be moist 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) down from the surface. Water your banana plant every day to keep the soil and your plant's roots hydrated.If the surface of the soil is moist and muddy, you are overwatering your banana tree.

, Banana trees thrive in indirect sunlight and prefer shaded areas. If you live in a seasonal climate, you can put your banana tree outside during the summer months when it's warm. Make sure to position the tree next to surrounding foliage that can block out the direct rays of the sun. Rotate the container regularly to make sure that all sides of the plant are receiving sunlight.If your tree is indoors, put it next to a large window so that it can get adequate sunlight.The ideal temperature for banana growth is 26-30°C (78-86°F).
If the temperature is below 14°C (57°F), most banana trees will stop growing., After 6-8 weeks of sustained, healthy growth, your banana tree will have to be pruned. When banana trees grow, suckers will start to form on your plant. Your goal is to eliminate all but one of the suckers from your banana tree. Choose the healthiest and largest sucker from your plant and use gardening shears to cut off the rest of the suckers from the corm. When your tree starts to grow fruit it will need to be pruned again. After harvesting the fruit, cut down the tree so it's 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) from the ground, without damaging the main sucker. The tree will grow more fruit after you prune it.


Suckers will look like shoots that grow out of the corm and have leaves.Replanting the additional suckers will grow a new banana tree but you must retain some of the roots from the banana corm.

, Cold and heavy winds aren't healthy for your banana plant and can disrupt the growth of fruit. If you know that your yard will have cold winds, consider bringing your banana plant inside, or insulating it with rows of trees.If the seasons are changing, it's best that you bring your tree inside before it starts to get cold out.


Your banana trees will start dying at 50°F (10°C)., Transplant your tree to a larger container before it becomes root-bound. You can tell when your tree is ready for a larger container when it stops growing vertically.Lay the tree on its side and slide it out of the container. Put soil in your new pot, then place the tree in the bigger pot before filling the rest of the pot with soil. Be careful not to damage the roots when transplanting your tree.


If your tree is not coming out, you may need to tap on the sides of the container."

Choose a suitable variety of pomegranate.,
Obtain the pomegranate cutting or seedling.,
Pick a spot that that gets plenty of sunshine.,
Choose a soil that drains well.,
Shelter the pomegranate from wind and intense moisture.,
Plant the pomegranate tree.",How to Grow a Pomegranate Tree1," Punica granatum is a small deciduous tree. It will grow to about 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) tall, with orange flowers during the summer season. The dwarf variety ""Nana"" will grow shorter, to about 1 meter (3.2 feet) and are the best for growing in containers. Or, you might like the frilly flowers that grow on the ""Beautiful"" variety.


Be sure to consider your climate when choosing a pomegranate. Most varieties cannot tolerate temperatures below 15 °F (−9.4 °C).There are several ways you can grow a pomegranate: from a seedling, a cutting, or from seed. Growing pomegranates from seeds does not guarantee you will get a certain variety of pomegranate and you will have to wait three or four years before your plant produces any fruit. If you would like to know how to germinate pomegranate seeds, click here.
;
, You can purchase a pomegranate seedling at your local nursery. Be sure to buy a variety that produces edible fruit if you are hoping to be able to eat homegrown pomegranate. However, if you have a friend who has a pomegranate tree, you can also take a cutting from that tree. Cut a branch that is at least 10 inches (25cm) long. Cover the cut end of the branch with rooting hormone to help it grow.Take the cutting in February or March, when the plant is still dormant.

, Pomegranate trees love sunshine and will only fruit reliably when they get enough sun. If you do not have a spot in your yard that gets constant sun throughout the day, pick the spot that gets the least amount of shade., Pomegranate trees are not able to cope with waterlogged soil (known as “soggy feet”). Instead, they do best in well-draining or even sandy soil. Some pomegranate growers maintain that slightly acidic soil is best for pomegranates, though they also grow very well in moderately alkaline soil. For the most part, pomegranates will adopt to the soil they are planted in, so long as it drains well., Plant the pomegranate in a warm, dry spot that is at least partly protected from heavy winds. Avoid planting it in an area of your garden that is moist, dark, or dank. Keep in mind that pomegranates thrive in hot, dry climates., Plant your pom in early spring after the last frost. Gently remove the seedling from the container. Wash about an inch (2.5cm) of the bottom of the root ball to remove any excess potting medium. Doing this will help the plant establish itself faster than plants transferred straight from the nursery container to the ground. Dig a hole two feet (60 cm) deep and wide and place the pomegranate seedling into the hole.If you are growing the plant from a cutting, loosen the soil and plant the pomegranate branch vertically so that the cut end is about five to six inches (12.5 to 15cm) down in the soil, with the dormant buds pointing up towards the sky.Also, make sure that you dust the plant with a rooting hormone to aid root development.

"
"
Water the pom immediately after planting it.,
Fertilize the pomegranate tree once it has become established.,
Keep the area around your pom weed free.",How to Grow a Pomegranate Tree2," Doing this helps to settle the soil around the newly planted pomegranate. After the initial watering, water the plant daily until it begins to grow new leaves. New leaf growth is the sign that your plant as settled into its new home. Gradually transition to watering your plant every seven to ten days.When the tree is flowering or producing fruit, give the plant a good, deep watering every week. If it rains, you don’t need to water it quite as much., Ammonium sulfate fertilizer works well for pomegranates. Sprinkle about ⅓ of a cup of fertilizer three times throughout the first year of growth (February, May and September are ideal times to do this)., You don’t want any weeds or other plants competing with the pom; it is also difficult to weed around the tree when it is low and shrub-like. Keep the area weeded, or lay down some organic mulch around the plant. Mulch helps to fight weeds and grasses while also retaining moisture for the plant.

"
"
Train the plant into tree form, if desired.,
Remove dead or damaged parts of the plant.,
Keep the pom healthy.",How to Grow a Pomegranate Tree3," While pomegranates are more of a shrub than tree if left to grow untrained, you can trim the plant so that it looks like a tree. This is something that many gardeners do.


Using gardening shears or clippers, cut the suckers (the smaller branches that help the plant take on its shrub form) growing at the base of the plant so that it takes on more of a tree shape. Do this shortly after the plant has become established. If you don’t care whether you plant is tree-like or not, let it grow naturally.

, You don’t really need to prune your pomegranate tree to maintain it, but it is a good idea to cut away dead or dying branches in the spring to help the tree grow well. You can also thin the plant as you see necessary.If you are growing the pom in a container, you will need to prune and train a bit more heavily, in order to keep the pom the size and shape you want it to be.

, Avoid mold growth by making sure you do not over water the pom. The two other problems some pomegranates face are aphids and the pomegranate butterfly. You can kill aphids by using a spray bought at your local nursery or garden store. You can also use an integrated pest management practice for killing aphids, which may include attracting ladybugs, spraying trees with water to knock aphids down, or even purchasing predatory insects to consume the aphids.The pomegranate butterfly is not very common and should not be a problem. If it is, use a butterfly spray to rid your trees of the larvae."

Find your growing zone.,
Research varieties that thrive in your climate.,
Find out which trees will cross pollinate in your area.,
Select a tree variety to grow.,
Buy a grafted nursery tree.",How to Grow an Apple Tree1," There are hundreds of apple tree varieties available, each of which does best in a certain growing zone. Planting a tree that is known to thrive in your growing zone will give you the best chance of growing a successful, fruit-bearing tree. The USDA website provides a map illustrating where different growing zones begin and end.This is especially important for apple trees because apple varieties each need a number of ""chill hours"" in order to begin producing fruit. Chill time is when the temperature is between 32 and 45 degrees F. Some varieties do best in the north, where the winters are long and cold, and others need fewer chill hours and do fine in southern growing zones.
In addition to knowing your growing zone, and how many chill hours it typically provides, you may need account for other climate factors. Humidity levels, annual rainfall, elevation, and other factors such as your local microclimate could influence how well apple trees grow.;
, In order to pick the variety (also called a cultivar) that will grow best on your property, conduct thorough research on those that are available to you.Farm catalogs, websites and local nurseries and farm stores are great resources that can provide you with the information you need to make a selection. For growing zones 3 and 4, try Honeycrisp, Sweet Sixteen or Macoun.
For zones 5 to 9, try Pink Lady, Akane or Ashmead's Kernel.For 10 or hotter, try Granny Smith or Cinnamon Spice., Cross pollination is usually necessary in order for the trees to produce fruit. Many apple trees will not pollinate themselves or other trees of the same variety, so you may need to plant two different apple varieties in the same area to ensure they get pollinated.Consult with a local horticulturist or nursery to find out which varieties will pollinate in your area.
Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Grimes Golden and Winter Banana are often good choices, since they are known to pollinate.

, Once you know which varieties will cross-pollinate in your growing zone, you can narrow down your list according to personal preferences. Consider taste testing a few different varieties so you can make sure the time and effort you'll put into growing an apple tree will result in fruit you enjoy eating.


You may also want to consider getting a disease-resistant variety, even if it doesn't produce your very favorite type of apple. Apple trees are prone to disease, and it would be a shame for yours to die within two or three years of planting.
Disease-resistant trees allow you to grow organic fruit, since you won't have to use as many chemicals to keep them from getting sick. Some treatment will still be necessary, but it will be less than that needed for non-resistant trees.

, Most apple trees are grown from dormant, grafted nursery trees with developed root systems. These trees consist of a rootstock, the foundation of the tree, and a scion, the top part of the tree that bears the fruit. The rootstock and scion are grafted together to create trees that grow reliably and produce a certain type of fruit. Plan to plant your tree as soon as possible after purchasing it. If the roots are dry, soak them for 24 hours before planting.


When ordering a tree, you can choose a seedling rootstock, which will produce a full-sized tree that grows up to thirty feet; or a dwarfing rootstock, which produces a smaller tree more suitable for a backyard harvest. Full-sized trees bear more fruit, but they take several extra years before they start bearing.
Trees can be ordered from a catalog or purchased at a local nursery.
While some people like to try their hand at planting apple trees from seed, buying a bare-root tree produces much more reliable results. If you plant a seed, it won't necessarily produce an apple like the one it came from. Since apple trees are grafted, the seed is basically a wild card that could produce a tree with inedible fruit."
"
Plant your trees in the spring.,
Test the soil.,
Choose a sunny spot that drains well.,
Space the trees according to size.,
Dig a hole.,
Plant the tree.",How to Grow an Apple Tree2," A dormant bare root tree is best planted in the spring, after the soil has thawed enough to dig a deep hole. This is especially important in colder regions. The trees' roots need a chance to take hold before the next winter, or they'll suffer from the frost. If you live in a place with mild winters, you can plant apple trees in the fall without worrying that they'll die from the frost before they get a chance to set., Buy a soil testing kit to find out whether you need to adjust your soil's pH. Different apple trees need different types of soil to do well, so talk with a local horticulturist, an expert at your local nursery or your County Extension Center to find out what pH is correct for the apple variety you're growing. Your County Extension Office may also be able to help you test your soil sample. If necessary, amend the soil to adjust the pH level before planting.


You should also adjust the soil to account for nutrient deficiencies. Again, conduct research to find out how rich or poor the soil should be for the variety you're planting.
Amend the soil to a depth of 18 inches below the planting hole, so that the tree's roots grow into healthy soil.

, Apple trees need full sun, so choose a spot that gets at least six hours a day. They like soil that is moist, but not sopping wet. If your soil is clay-heavy or doesn't drain quickly, amend it by working in straw, compost, or another organic material to create better drainage. Using an organic material will also provide nutrients to the tree as it decomposes over time., If you are planting seedlings, which will grow into full-sized trees about thirty feet tall, they should be planted fifteen to eighteen feet apart. If you're planting dwarfing rootstock, plant them four to eight feet apart.


Dwarfing trees tend to fall over under the weight of a heavy flush of apples, so it's a good idea to plant them near something sturdy, like a fence. If no fence is available, you can set up a trellis to support them.
If your property is hilly or sloped, plant the trees in higher areas. During the winter, cold air settles in the lower areas, and these ""frost pockets"" can be harmful to the trees.

, Use a spade to remove all grass, weeds and stones in a circle about four feet in diameter. Dig a hole twice the diameter of the root system. It should be just deep enough so that the tips of the roots graze the bottom of the hole, and the graft union (where the scion is joined to the rootstock) is two inches above the soil line.


Put some of the loose soil back in the hole so it will surround the roots.
Loosen the soil on the bottom and sides of the hole so it will be easy for the roots to penetrate as they grow.

, Position it in the center of the hole. Spread out the roots so they aren't cramped or curled in the hole. Replace soil around the roots to fill in the hole. After you've replaced a few inches of soil, use your fists to tamp down the soil around the roots, so no air pockets will form around the roots. Keep going until the hole is completely filled in.


As you work, check the tree to make sure the trunk is standing upright at a ninety-degree angle to the ground. If you plant the tree crooked, it will grow crooked.
Don't add fertilizer to the hole. The soil should have already been amended so that it's nutritious enough for the tree to grow well. Fertilizer could burn the roots.
Make sure the graft union is not buried; it must be above the soil.
Water the tree well. This removes air pockets and helps the roots and soil make firm contact.

"
"
Keep the soil evenly moist.,
Mulch around the base of the tree.,
Don't prune too much until the tree is well established.,
Deter pests from damaging the tree.",How to Grow an Apple Tree3," Watering the soil deeply but infrequently is the best way to keep apple trees healthy.During the first two growing seasons, plan to water the tree deeply about twice a week. Don't water the tree after it rains, since this can cause it to become waterlogged and create rot around the roots.


If the leaves look dry and wilted during the growing season, you may need to increase watering. Check for signs of drought during the hottest times of year.
As the tree gets older, water near the edges of the perimeter of the branches, since the roots grow outward and not downward.

, Mulch helps to regulate the temperature around the base of the tree, keeping it from getting too hot or too cold. It also provides nutrients as it decomposes and keeps weeds from growing. Use a few inches of straw, wood chips or compost as mulch.Place the mulch in a wide circle around the base of the tree.
Don't pile the mulch in a ""volcano"" shape around the base of the tree; rather, there should be a ""donut"" shape to keep the mulch from covering the tree's bark. Mulch will rot the bark, which can attract mice and hurt the tree.

, A young tree doesn't need to be heavily pruned. For unbranched trees, also called whips, you can prune back 2-3 feet after planting. For other trees, remove dead branches as necessary. Then, start shaping the trees the year after planting. In order to direct growth into a few healthy branches, you can use a few techniques:


Rub off low-growing buds so that they won't grow into full-sized branches.
If you want to slow growth and promote fruiting, bend a branch down horizontally (without breaking it) and tie it to a stake in the ground for a few weeks.Trees will require regular pruning to remove crossed or dead branches and promote good circulation. Cut away upright stems that grow high in the tree, and remove stems that are weak or droopy.

, Deer, mice, rabbits and insects may be attracted to your apple tree. Keep your tree safe by protecting it in the following ways:


Keep deer out with fencing around your property
Keep mice and rabbits out by installing wire mesh around the base of the tree. You can also avoid putting mulch right at the base of the trunk to discourage rodents.
Keep maggots away from fruit by trapping them with hanging balls coated in a substance called ""tangle trap"" throughout the summer
Keep the leaves and fallen apples cleaned up to avoid attracting pests

"
"
Thin fruit when the crop is heavy.,
Harvest the apples at their peak.,
Store apples in a cool, dark place.",How to Grow an Apple Tree4," Removing some of the fruit will help the fruit that remains be larger and tastier, as well as preventing the branch from falling under the weight. When the fruit begins to emerge, remove the smallest fruits and leave about four inches between the healthy fruits you want to keep.

, Different varieties peak at different times between August and October. Learn what your apple variety should look and taste like at its peak. The apples should be easy to pluck from the tree; it shouldn't be necessary to yank them off when they're ripe.


In general, the apples' background color should no longer be green (unless you're growing a green variety).
Apples that are falling from the tree in the slightest breeze may be overripe, so act quickly!

, They keep best at a temperature between 32 and 45 degrees F. They will stay fresh at this temperature for up to six months. Check the apple bin frequently and throw out any rotten apples. Apples can also be preserved by making apple jam, apple butter, or apple sauce.

Transfer your plant to a pot with soil.",How to Grow an Avocado Tree1," Cut your avocado in half, so it exposes the oval shaped seed in the middle. Use a utensil like a knife or a fork to extract the seed out of the avocado. Once the seed is removed, rinse it under warm water to remove all of the avocado fruit from it.Do not remove the brown skin or ""seed cover"" from the seed.Read Cut-an-Avocado if you're unsure how to cut an avocado.;
, The top of the seed is the pointed end, while the lower part of the seed is rounded. It's important that you're able to identify the top and the bottom of your seed. The roots will grow out of the bottom and your tree will sprout from the top of the seed., Insert three toothpicks on a slight downward angle in the middle of the seed. The toothpicks will enable you to suspend your seed so that the roots can get enough water while the top of the seed stays dry.The toothpicks should be an equal distance apart from one another.
Make sure that each toothpick is inserted firmly.

, Use the toothpicks to balance the seed on the brim of a cup, ensuring that the bottom half of the seed is under water. The the other half of the seed should be above the water's surface. Place the glass in a warm spot where it can get some sun.Remember to replace the water as it evaporates.
Change your water once a week to prevent mold from growing in your glass.Use room temperature water for your avocado tree.

, In two to six weeks, you should see your avocado tree start to sprout.You'll notice that the seed will crack and roots will begin to grow from the bottom of the seed.If your avocado tree does not sprout in eight weeks, consider starting over with a new seed.

, Once your plant grows to 6 - 7 inches (15 - 17.7 centimeters), you should move it to a pot with soil. Remove the toothpicks from your seed and place it in a 8 - 10 inch (20.3 - 25.4 centimeter) deep pot filled with humus soil or a multi-purpose potting soil.The seed should be half exposed on top of the soil.


Humus is loose and crumbly soil. It includes organic material like leaves, grass clippings, and peat moss.Avocado trees thrive in fast draining organic soil."

Bury your avocado seed into the soil.,
Wait for your avocado tree to grow.",How to Grow an Avocado Tree2," You can use a paper towel or run your seed under water. Remove all of the avocado pulp from the seed before you continue. If your seed is giving you issues during cleaning, you can submerge it under water for one to two minutes to loosen some of the stuck on avocado.

, Once you've extracted your avocado seed, you'll need to peel back the brown layer over the seed, sometimes referred to as the ""seed cover."" Use a sharp knife and cut away at the brown cover to reveal the tan seed under it.


Light scratches on the seed will not prevent growth but avoid puncturing or cracking the seed while you remove the cover., Fill a pot with a loose soil that has good drainage. Some options include sandy loam or humus. You can find these specialty potting soils online or at a home and gardening store. Good drainage is essential for growth.A healthy pH level for your soil is between 6.0 and 7.0.If you're using soil from your garden, make sure you sift through it and remove any weeds or roots are in it.

, Bury your avocado seed so that the fat rounded end is under the soil while the pointed end is exposed. An avocado grown this way may take up to two months to sprout.Return to the soil daily to make sure that it's wet enough to promote growth. It's important that your soil doesn't dry out during this period.


The best times to plant your avocado tree are March through June.
Planting your avocado tree during the hottest parts of the summer increases the risk of sun damage for your tree.Burying more than one seed may increase your chances of a tree sprouting.

, Avocado trees can take 2-8 weeks to sprout. Once your taproot begins to grow, you'll know you're on the right track. The taproot will be thicker than your tree's other roots. After your avocado tree sprouts, it can take anywhere from 5-13 years for it to bear fruit."

Trim the tree to promote growth.,
Water your tree every two to three days.,
Bring your avocado tree in for the winter.,
Make sure your tree can be pollinated.",How to Grow an Avocado Tree3," Once your avocado tree grows to be about 6 - 7 inches (15 - 17.7 centimeters), cut it back about 3 inches (7.6 centimeters). Cutting the stem will promote further growth on your plant.Trim the tree when using both the toothpick and potting method. Regular pruning after the first year of growth should be limited but is useful for maintaining a healthy avocado tree in some cases.You can prune smaller branches as your tree matures to limit its growth or to balance the tree.The best times to prune your tree is in the late winter or early spring.
If you don't cut your avocado plant, the stem may grow too long.
Do not cut the roots on the bottom.

, Watering your tree too much can hurt the plant. A good indication of overwatering is if the plant's leaves become a light green or translucent color. Check the soil every couple of days to make sure that it isn't dried out. You can do this by pressing a finger into the soil about an inch (2.5 centimeters) deep.


A fully matured avocado tree will need about 20 gallons (75.7 liters) of water per day during the irrigation period., If you live a place where the temperature doesn't dip below 24 degrees Celsius, (75.2 degrees Fahrenheit) then you can keep your tree outdoors all year round. However, if you live in a place where it gets cold, you'll need to bring it indoors, or it will die., For your avocado to grow fruit, it must be pollinated by insects. If you have had your plant for a long time and it hasn't grown fruit, consider moving it to an outside garden or keeping a window open so that bees and other insects can pollinate it.You will have to maintain your tree for many years before it starts to produce fruit, and in the end, it may never produce fruit.

You can either extract the seeds from an apple you are eating, or buy apple seeds at the store. Keep in mind that growing an apple tree from the seeds you have collected does not necessarily guarantee that the tree produced from these seeds will bear fruit or be the same kind of apple. Try to pick or buy seeds of apple trees that do well in your climate zone or else your tree may die once planted outside.If you want to grow apples for their fruit, it is recommended that you buy a sapling tree from a nursery rather than growing an apple tree from seed. To learn how to transplant a young tree, click here.When attempting to grow an apple tree from seed, you should also keep in mind that the tree produced will not have any dwarfing characteristics (meaning that it will grow to its full height of about 30 feet/9 meters). If you think you have enough room in your yard for this tree, great! You should also keep in mind that trees planted from seeds could take 8 to 10 years to produce fruit, while a transplanted sapling will produce fruit in a much faster time frame.;
, Once you have extracted the seeds from the fruit and have gotten rid of any pieces of the fruit clinging to the seeds, you should lay them out to dry. This means simply air drying them until there is no moisture on the outside shell.








, Place the paper towel and seeds into a sealable plastic bag, jar with a lid, or Tupperware box. Whatever your container is, make sure it can be sealed.








You can also use moist peat moss rather than paper towels if you have any peat moss just hanging around.

, Seeds need a period of exposure to cold temperatures called “after-ripening”. This is essentially simulated winter. During this time, the seeds will begin to grow roots and sprout. They will need to be left in there for 70 to 80 days. Keep the temperature the seeds are stored at around 40 to 50ºF (4.4 to 10ºC), with optimal temperature being 40 to 41ºF (4.4 to 5ºC).








If possible, do this during actual winter so that when you take the seeds out of the fridge, they will be aligned with the actual seasons. Planting your sprouts in the early spring after the last frost will have the best results.

, It is important to keep the towel damp while the seeds are in the fridge, so check them daily. However, keep in mind that the seeds will not sprout while they are in the fridge.








, Your seeds will need to be planted outside in a prepared seedbed or in a pot. Use a good potting mix. Apple seeds grow best in soil with a neutral pH level. Fill the pots with the soil and create a divot in the soil that is one to two times larger than the sprouted seed.








Do not add any fertilizer. It is not necessary, though you can add leaf mulch or compost if you want to give you seedling an extra boost.

, Put the seeds into the soil divots and then cover them, making sure to gently pat the soil down. Water the seed immediately so that the soil settles around the seed and the soil stays moist.







, While growing in the pot, the seed and soil should be kept at, or slightly higher than, room temperature. The seed should have access to sunlight for a good part of the day, so putting it in a windowsill that gets sunlight for some of the day is a good idea.







, Several weeks after planting, your seeds should begin to start throwing up little leaves. From there they will grow taller and stronger. Keep them in pots until they look strong and any risk of frost has passed. If you think your seedling is outgrowing its pot, transplant it to a larger pot and keep watering it daily.







, There are several factors that should determine the spot you plant your tree. These include sunlight, soil, and space.








Sunlight: Apple trees need full sun. This means that they should get six or more hours of direct sunlight every day. Where you plant your tree will depend on your location. An eastern facing slope is usually a good choice, but a north facing slope may also work.Evaluate your options for possible locations before you plant.
Soil: Apple trees don’t like soggy feet. That means they need to be planted in soil that will retain moisture but does drain well. The soil should be moderately rich and have a relatively neutral pH level.
Space: Because you are growing your tree from seed, it will grow to full size (meaning it can reach 20-30 feet/6-9 meters in height). You will need to make sure that it has enough space for its root system to grow. Plan to plant your tree at least 30 feet (9.1 m) from another tree, particularly if you are planting two apple trees in a row., Once your little sapling has gotten big enough that no one will step on it or think it is a weed, carefully transplant it without cutting off any roots. The best time of year to plant depends on your location--in Zone 8 and warmer, fall planting can work well. If you live anywhere other than a Zone 8, plant in spring. once the threat of hard frost has passed.







, Dig a hole that is twice the diameter or your sapling’s root system. Make sure that the hole is roughly two feet (.6 meters) deep. Once you have made the hole, try to loosen the soil of the walls of the hole--this will help your tree’s roots to penetrate the soil.







, Gently spread out your tree’s roots so they are not tangled or get bunched up in the hole you have dug. Start to replace soil all around the roots. Once you have covered the roots, pat the soil down firmly to get rid of any air pockets that might be hanging out around the roots. Fill the rest of the hole with loose soil.








Again do not add any fertilizer or un-aged compost to the soil around your tree. The fertilizer could actually ‘burn’ your young tree’s roots.

, After you have watered your tree, spread mulch to help you sapling retain moisture. Hay, straw, or organic hardwood chips work well as apple tree mulch. The mulch should be spread in a three foot circle around the tree. Doing this will help retain moisture and keep grass from growing and competing with your young tree's roots for water and nutrients.







, While the tree is still short (roughly 6-8 in








During other times of the year, you can let nature do the rest, unless you live in an extremely dry area. If this is the case, keep in mind that the equivalent of an inch or two (2.5-5 cm) of water a week is ideal for the first year. Make sure you give it a good soaking, not just a sprinkle.

, If you live in an area with deer, you'll need to protect your young tree. Deer absolutely love to browse the buds on apple trees, in some cases they'll even damage the trunk itself. To protect your trees as they grow, cut a length of chicken wire that is tall enough to cover your tree, and long enough to form a loop around the tree. Secure the wire to a post and close the loop. Watch the tree as it grows so that limbs do not become entangled in the wire.









In low-pressure areas, spraying the tree with a purchased or home-brew spray may also be effective.If deer are not a problem in your area, keep away rabbits and mice by placing short wire mesh around the base of the tree.
Spray away insects. You might find yourself at battle with insects that are causing your fruit to become diseased. You can buy a spray at your local nursery or garden supply store to ward them off.
Fight the apple maggot. These are one of the most common plagues to the apple tree. Hang a baseball-sized red ball or two in your trees branches in June. Coat the balls with sticky goo like Tangle Trap, which can be purchased at garden supply stores.

, Your apple trees should be fertilized each spring. Fertilize the tree after the last snow has melted away (if you get snow) but before the tree begins to produce buds. You should use a fertilizer with a nitrogen and oxide content (NPK) of 10-10-10. You should lay the fertilizer down under the canopy of the tree and should put down half a pound (.23 kg) of it for every inch (2.5 cm) of the tree's trunk diameter.








Always perform a soil test before adding fertilizer. You may need to use a slow-release organic fertilizer based on your soil test results. Too much nitrogen will cause excess vegetative growth and limit fruit production.
Do not use a weed-and-feed fertilizer--these sort of combination fertilizers can hurt apple trees.

, Prune as little as possible the first few years, so you don't delay fruit bearing. You should prune off any branches that are dead or diseased. An apple tree wants to build a lot of growth before it decides to create fruit--its way of reproducing--so let it grow till it starts to bear.








Rid your young tree of misplaced buds before they have the chance to grow into branches that you’ll just have to prune later.
You will also need to prune the tree to establish a 'central leader'. If there are two limbs growing vertically, prune off the smaller or less-desired one so the tree can direct all of its energy towards the central leader.

, This may sound odd, but your tree’s branches will need to be shaped to maximize the fruit the tree produces. Any branch that has an angle of 35 degrees or less from the trunk will need to be trained into a better angle (any angle larger than 35 degrees from the trunk). Bend a stem down so that it is almost horizontal and tie it to stakes in the ground or lower tree branches with string. Leave it tied down for a few weeks.








, Producing too much fruit can actually be a bad thing for your tree—the excess fruit can weigh the tree’s branches down and reduce the quality of the apples produced. You should thin out the fruit so that there are only one or two apples per cluster, and so that they are roughly six to eight inches (15-20 cm) apart.







, Once your tree has produced fruit and filled in, you will need to provide it with annual pruning. Do this when the tree is dormant. Cut away vigorously growing stems that grow upright (these are normally found in the higher parts of the tree). You should prune off dead, diseased, or broken branches, as well as limbs that are growing in toward the tree or that are crossing each other.








Cut away any very low growing limbs--in general, your tree’s limb should start growing roughly 18 inches (45 cm) or higher from the ground.
You should also remove weak twigs, which generally grow on the undersides of branches.

A large terracotta or ceramic pot
A half barrel
A concrete square pot
Other large containers that you have;
, Tamarillo trees enjoy sun and are not tolerant to frost, so take this into account when positioning the tree. Shelter the plant from wind.

, Use quality potting soil and a little compost or manure.

, Take care not to mulch around the tree stem, however, as this can cause it to rot.

, Keep the pot well watered at all times, especially during the dry season. Fertilize regularly with a liquid feeder, at least monthly.

Watermelon vines can reach 20 feet (6 m) in length.;
, Watermelons are heavy feeders, so it’s important to amend the soil with lots of nutrients a few weeks before planting. They also need well draining soil. Add some aged compost, manure, or seaweed to the garden bed and till it into the soil. Use compost specifically if you want to ensure your soil drains well.


The ideal pH for watermelons is between 6 and 6.8., Watermelons seeds need warm soil to grow, and if you live in cooler or northern climates, you should warm the soil a couple weeks before planting to ensure it heats up enough. Cover the garden bed with black plastic or landscape fabric, and lay some rocks along the perimeter to keep the plastic from blowing away.You can either use large sheets of black plastic or landscaping fabric from a gardening store, or you can cut open black garbage bags and use those.
Landscaping fabric is a great option if you want to reuse the material. It also allows water to trickle down to the soil below, unlike plastic. You can easily cut slits in the fabric to allow your plants to grow up through it.

, The soil temperature must reach at least 70 F (21 C) before you can plant watermelon seeds. You should also wait until at least two weeks after the last frost, otherwise the seeds won’t sprout.If you live in a cooler climate, you can start your seeds indoors and transplant them outside once the soil warms up. Start them about two weeks before the last frost date and plant them two weeks after the last frost date.

, Hills or mounds tend to drain better and warm faster than flat soil, which is ideal for watermelons. Using a rake or shovel, form the soil in the bed into hills that are 1 foot (30 cm) high and 3 feet (91 cm) in diameter. Space the hills 6.5 feet (2 m) apart., Plant nine watermelon seeds in each hill. Plant the seeds in groups of three. Space the seed groups out evenly around the hill so the clusters are about a foot (30 cm) apart. To sow the seeds, simply press each seed ½ inch (1.3 cm) deep into the soil.After you plant them, water them thoroughly.

, Mulch is good for watermelons because it keeps the soil warm, retains moisture, and keeps weeds and pests out. Once the seeds have been planted, cover the hills with leaves, straw, black plastic mulch, or black landscaping fabric.


If you live in a cooler climate, black plastic mulch or landscaping fabric will help keep the soil warmest as the watermelon seeds grow. , While watermelon plants are in the initial growing stages, they need plenty of water. Make sure they get 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) per week as the seeds germinate, and as the plants grow, bloom, and fruit.Once the fruit has formed, you can cut back on watering. Only water the plants during dry spells when there's no rain.
Make sure that the plants do get watered once a week, either through rain or irrigation.

, Growing square watermelons is as easy as placing a young fruit into a square box. As the watermelon grows, it will grow into the box and grow in the shape of a cube. The mold must allow sunlight and air to pass through. To determine the size of the mold, check the seed package to find out the mature size of the fruit you're growing, and then pick a mold that’s a little smaller.Make sure there's an opening in the lid for the stem, and that there's a lid that opens, closes, and latches.
Glass and acrylic boxes are ideal because they allow sunlight to pass through. You can find special molds designed to grow watermelons, which are available from internet-suppliers.
You can also use a wooden or metal box with lots of holes in it.
Alternatively, you can make your own mold from wood, metal, or another material.
If you're stuck for molds, you can also use a concrete or cinder block for the mold, but this will not yield a perfectly square watermelon.

, When the watermelon fruit is still young and about the size of a softball, choose a healthy specimen to grow into a square. Look for fruit with no bruises, blemishes, holes, or insect damage. You should also look for a round fruit, since this will likely grow more evenly.

, Open the box or mold and place the healthy fruit inside. Leave the fruit on the stem so it will continue to grow. Close the lid partway. Slot the stem into the opening in the lid. Close the lid so the fruit is inside the box but still attached to the plant by the stem. Latch the lid so the growing fruit doesn’t burst out of the box.Place the box on the ground with the lid and stem at the top.

, Make sure it gets plenty of sunlight throughout the day, and water the plant if there's a dry spell. Watermelons have a long growing season, and the weather will need to stay between 70 and 80 F (21 and 27 C) consistently for the fruit to grow and ripen properly.As the watermelon grows, the fruit will get bigger and will eventually take on the shape of the mold.
Monitor the growth of the watermelon. If is appears to be too big for the box, take it out and allow it to finish maturing outside the box.

, The watermelons will all mature around the same time, so you can gauge if your square watermelon is ripe by the maturity of the other fruit on the vine. To harvest your square watermelon, unlatch the lid and gently pull the watermelon out of the box.


A watermelon is ready for harvest when the tendrils around the stem dry out, a light patch develops on the bottom of the fruit, and the fruit sounds dull and hollow when you tap on it."

In most regions, the best time to collect scion wood is November.
Do not wait until spring to collect scion wood. The wood should not be collected while it is frozen, either. Buds may grow at the start of spring or become injured during the winter, and if that happens, the graft is less likely to be successful.;
, Cut away shoots that grew during the previous growing season and use those for your scion wood.


The best scions are vigorous shoots at least 1 foot (30.5 cm) in length.
The shoots you collect should also have diameters between 1/4 to 3/8 inch (6.35 to 9.5 mm).

, Tie the scion wood in secure bundles. Label the bundles, then store them in temperatures ranging between 40 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 and 7.2 degrees Celsius).


Gather together one to two dozen shoots and tie the bundle together with cotton twine or a similar substitution.
Place the bundles in moistened sawdust, paper towels, or moss, then wrap them in plastic sheets or place them in plastic containers. Note that the material should only be moist and not soaking wet.
Store the scion wood in a cellar or refrigerator.

, Immediately before you plan to graft the scions onto stock wood, you should cut off the tip and base of each collected shoot.


Note that buds at the tip of the shoot are usually flower buds, but those near the base are usually fairly weak. Each scion should have three to five buds, and most of these buds should lie near the tip of the shoot.

, As a general rule, the stock should be five years old or younger. It must also produce vigorous growth and show no signs of disease.


The ""stock"" is the tree you're grafting onto.
Most apple and pear trees can be grafted at any age, but the process is notably more difficult after the trees reach 10 years of age.
For trees up to the age of five, you can graft all of the branches at once. For older trees, only graft the upper half and center of the tree the first year. The rest of the tree can be grafted the following year.

, Even though the scion and stock will be different trees, they should be as closely related as possible to encourage better success.Typically, varieties and cultivars of a single fruit species can be grafted together.
Plants of the same genus and species are usually able to be grafted together even if the fruit is different, but your odds of success are significantly lower.
Fruit trees that are in completely different families cannot be grafted together.

, The best time to graft is when the buds of the stock tree just begin to open. Do not graft after the stock has blossomed.


In most regions, the ideal time to graft is in April or early May.

, Keep at least 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm) of branch in between the trunk and the graft, especially when working with young trees.


If you do not keep enough space in between the trunk and graft, the trunk can grow past the grafted union, and the connection between the branch and stock will not form correctly.

, Remove a branch from the stock, leaving 1 foot (30.5 cm) behind.


Choose branches that are roughly the same diameter as the scion wood. Each branch you graft onto should be no wider than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter.
The cut should be straight and slanted, measuring roughly 1-1/2 inches (3.8 cm) long. Use a sharp knife and cut the stock branch in one even stroke.
Note that this type of graft is mostly used on young fruit trees, especially young apple and pear trees.

, Use a sharp knife to slice into the cut side of the stock. Start near the top of the cut surface and slice down to the bottom of the cut.


Slice the tongue into the stock branch so that the it is crosswise across the cut surface and not lengthwise. The previously cut surface should not be divided into two mirror halves.

, Cut the base of the scion wood so that it mirrors the cuts made into the stock branch.


Cut the base of the scion at a straight slant. This cut surface should be 1-1/2 inches (3.8 cm) long.
Slice a tongue into the scion, as well. The position and dimensions of this tongue should match those of the stock tongue.

, Fit the cut ends of the stock and scion together, slipping the tongued sections of both pieces into one another.


If any cut end of either the stock or scion branch extends beyond the other cut surface, you will need to use a sharp knife to shave this excess away. The two cut surfaces must line up evenly and completely.

, Wrap grafting tape around the entire graft. Cover the tape with grafting compound to further secure.


You must make sure that all cut portions of wood are completely covered. Exposed wood will be weaker to disease, and the graft is less likely to be successful if the cut portion is exposed to air.
If you do not have grafting tape, rubber electrical tape can also work. Plastic electrical tape and masking tape may work in some situations but are less ideal.
Apply asphalt water emulsion using a paintbrush or small paddle. This substance is a strong grafting compound that should further protect the cut wood.

, Once the scion begins to grow, you should scrape away the grafting compound and remove the grafting tape.


If you do not remove the wrappings on time, they can strip away the bark and weaken the tree as a result.
The graft should be secure by this point, and the tree should be able to grow normally.

, Use a saw to cut off the top of the stock branch, leaving at least 2 feet (61 cm) of branch attached to the tree.


Note that this method is typically used on slightly older trees, the trunks of small trees, or the side branches of larger trees. It works best with branches that are 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) in diameter.

, Place a grafting chisel across the middle of the cut surface. Strike the chisel with a hammer or mallet to create a cleft in the wood.A large knife or hatchet will work if you do not have a grafting chisel.
Split the end of the stock branch vertically. Keep the chisel in the split after forming the cleft.
The depth of the cleft should be 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm).

, Trim the scion down to three buds, then make a straight, slanted cut along the tip of the scion measuring 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in length.


The cut should be tapered so that one side is slightly thicker than the other.
Do not cut the scion to a sharp point, however, since doing so can cause the bark to peel and may make the graft less successful.

, Slip one scion into either side of the stock cleft. The inner bark of the stock must come into direct contact with the inner bark of the scion, and the thick part of the scion should face outward.


The scion bark and stock bark will not be flush with one another since the latter is thicker than the former, but the two inner barks must come into contact at a slight tilt.
If the inner bark layers do not meet, the graft will not take hold.

, Apply grafting compound over all exposed wood.


The most common grafting compound is asphalt water emulsion, which can be applied to the wood with a brush or small paddle.
Make sure that all cut wood is coated with the compound. Exposed wood is prone to disease.
Initial wrapping is usually unnecessary with this type of graft.

, As the scions begin to grow, tie them to supporting braces to prevent them from breaking prematurely.


Using cotton twine, attach a piece of 2-inch (5-cm) thick wood to the stock branch beneath the graft. Make sure that this brace extends up along the length of the scion wood. As the scions grow, tie them to this brace wood, as well.
You can also pinch back the growing tips to prevent the growth from expanding too rapidly or gently encircle all of the shoots growing from one stock base with additional twine.

, Allow the scions and attached shoots to grow during the first season but do not allow the shoots to overshadow the scions.


During the second growing season, select the strongest scion from each grafted stock branch and cut the other scions back to one or two buds. The strongest scion is the permanent one, while the others should be considered support.
Repeat your second year pruning during the third year.
In the fourth growing season, cut away all of the spare scions, leaving only the permanent one in place. Allow the grafted tree to grow normally from that point on.

, Use a fine-toothed saw to cut evenly and straight across the end of the stock branch.


Choose a section of branch or trunk that is 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in diameter.
Use this method when the stock is too large for whip grafting and too horizontal for cleft grafting. Wait until the bark begins to slip from the stock before starting the process.
Note that this technique is usually used on apple, pear, and nut trees.

, Use a sharp wedge to make a diagonal cut into the side of the stock. This cut should slice into the inner layer of bark at a very slight angle that is nearly parallel to the stock branch.


Ideally, you should cut into the bark without cutting into the flesh of the branch. Do not remove the bark completely.

, Trim the top of the scion 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) above the top bud, cutting into the wood at a slant. Make a 2-inch (5-cm) sloping cut into the base of the scion, as well.You will graft the scion at its base cut.
Ideally, the scion should be trimmed to a length of 6 inches (15 cm) before you cut the slants into either end.
Note that you should prepare two scions for each stock branch.

, Insert the scion into the slit made along the bark of the stock.


You may need to hold the slit open with a screwdriver or chisel as you slide the scion inside.
If the angle of the slit and the slanted cut of the scion do not align, you may need to trim away more wood from either piece until they both match.
One scion should lie on one side of the branch, and the second scion should be placed on the opposite side of the branch in a similar bark slit.

, Carefully hammer short wire nails through the scions and stock wood to hold the graft together.


The nails should be 1/2 to 3/4 inch (1.25 to 1.9 cm) long.

, Cover any exposed or cut wood with asphalt water emulsion or a similar grafting compound. Apply the compound with a brush or small paddle.


Note that melted grafting wax can also be used, but hot wax may damage the plant tissue.
Make sure that all exposed wood is covered. Doing so will protect the wood of the fruit tree from disease and further injury.

, Remove shoots and sprouts below the graft during the first season. When grafting two or more scions into the same stock branch, pinch back the weaker shoot during the summer to prevent it from growing too vigorously to remain supported.


Allow all grafted scions to grow during the second summer.
Pinch back the growth of weaker scions during the third summer, then remove weaker support scions completely during the fourth spring.
Once the grafted tree branches have been reduced to one scion per branch, allow the tree to grow normally.

Select what mulch you are going to use.,
The optimal time to start mulching is during spring.,
Prepare the soil.,
Ensure that the soil around your fruit trees is covered with a generous layer of mulch.,
Well done.",How to Get the Best from Your Fruit Plants and Trees Through Feeding and Mulching," As it is our aim is to get the best from our plants (so we can ultimately enjoy the maximum yield in fruit the plant can give) it is recommended that you use an organic mulch. Why? Your soil will benefit more from an organic mulch than an inorganic one. Organic mulch will (apart from providing a secure cover, help with hydration and stop weed growth) also assist in feeding the soil and in keeping away soil-borne diseases. Examples of organic mulch are: manure, leaf mould, mushroom compost, etc.;
, Spring is the start of your gardening year. The decomposition process in your compost heap picks up as a result of the increased temperatures. Starting to mulch at this time is great because if you also are planning to commence planting in spring you need to ensure your bedding soil is well insulated should there be any sudden turns in the weather (as is not uncommon during spring). Mulching will provide this insulation.

, Remove any weeds and ensure you get the roots out as well so they don't grow back into your mulch later on. Make sure that any mulch left over from the previous season is worked into the soil. Also, you need to ensure the soil is properly hydrated before you can commence adding your new spring mulch.

, Cover the soil with approximately 8 centimeter (3.1 in) of organic mulch. Spread evenly and not just at the base of the plants and trees. Add mulch to the soil of all the surrounding plants and shrubs. Be generous. You are looking for the mulch to commence a slow decay process and work its magic thereby enriching the soil around your fruit trees.

, The soil around your Fruit Plants And Trees has now been enriched by mulching.

Select a cultivar.,
Choose the right soil.,
Pick a location for planting.,
Determine the best season for planting.,
Prepare the planting hole and plant your tree.",How to Care for a Mulberry Tree1," Be sure to ask your nursery or catalog to specify the type of cultivar you are purchasing. When acquiring a mulberry tree for fruit, choose a cultivar that is strong, self-pollinating, and has seedless fruits. There are also fruitless and weeping cultivars available for purchase if you are not interested in a fruit-bearing tree. Search for hardy and lush cultivars for planting.The Morus alba (white mulberry) and Morus rubra (red mulberry) hybrids (such as the Downing and Illinois Everbearing) are known for their large, sweet, fruit and hardiness.;
, Mulberry trees will grow on many types of soil as long as a good drainage system is provided. Ensure they are not in an area where flooding is common as they do not tolerate being engulfed in water. When possible, well-drained, deep soils are preferred. Opt for slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Soils of moderate alkalinity are able to be tolerated.If you are unsure of the pH of your soil, take a sample to the Cooperative Extension Agency in your county.

, Mulberry trees are able to survive in drought and salty conditions so they are typically good for urban or coastal planting. They thrive in climates that see seasonal temperature changes including sunny summers and frosty winters.The fruit that falls from trees may cause dark stains so avoid planting near walkways or driveways as the branches can be very weak.Chickens, turkeys and pigs enjoy mulberries so you can always choose to plant a mulberry tree where it will overhang and offer your animals a treat.

, While there is no particular season that is best for planting, the rule of thumb is that planting is fine when conditions are “favorable”. You should not plant when the ground is frozen, when daytime temperatures are below 32ºF or above 90ºF, or when there’s extreme weather such as blizzards or torrential rain., Your planting hole should be about 3 times the width of the pot, as deep as the root ball, and there should be 25-30 feet between each tree. Mix the soil that has been set aside with aged mushroom compost, aged manure, or rotted pine bark (half and half). Remove the plant from the pot, loosen the root, and place it in the hole. Fill the hole with the soil mixture previously set aside, and water it to allow the roots to settle.Avoid burying the root too deeply by making sure the top most roots are positioned at the soil line.
Avoid adding fertilizer to the planting hole unless it is during an appropriate fertilization time. Fertilization is based on the age of the tree and can occur anywhere from February to August.

Fertilize your mulberry tree.,
Water it.,
Prune your mulberry tree.,
Harvest the fruit from your tree.",How to Care for a Mulberry Tree2," Your fertilizer should contain iron, zinc, manganese, magnesium, molybdenum, copper and boron. When applying the fertilizer, spread evenly under the canopy of the tree by watering or raking into the soil. Avoid spreading fertilizer within the 5-inch area around the trunk of the tree.The time and frequency of adding fertilizer depends on the tree’s age.
Most mulberry trees thrive with little to no fertilization. Fertilizing at least once a year should be fine.Avoid fertilizing more than twice a year and begin in March but no later than July. Fertilizing after August will result in freeze damage., Water your mulberry tree twice a week if it is surrounded by light soils, and water once a week if planted on clay soil. It should take you 40-50 minutes to ensure that the root system is completely soaked. Each week, your tree should receive at least 1 inch of water, especially during extremely dry periods.You don’t need to manually water your tree if you receive at least 1 inch of rain in your area.Fruit may fall from the tree prematurely if it doesn’t receive ample water. The best way to avoid dry spells is to let your garden hose slowly trickle to allow the water to penetrate the roots instead of running off.

, Removal of dead, diseased or crossed branches should be done in winter when the tree is dormant. Avoid pruning in mid-summer to allow the tree to set for the upcoming year’s fruit buds.Cuts should follow the shape of the tree and should never be more than 2 inches in diameter.You should need no more than 5 cuts to prune a healthy mulberry tree.
Cuts over 2 inches in diameter can lead to bleeding, from which your tree is not likely to heal. They also leave your tree vulnerable to certain diseases and fungi.

, You can harvest the fruit by handpicking them, or laying a sheet or tarp under the tree and gently shaking the branches. Do not harvest before May or your fruit may not be fully ripened.Your berries are ripe when they are large, sweet and black.When placing your fruit in a container, avoid layering too many or the berries at the bottom of the container will be crushed.
Your unwashed harvest can be stored for several days in a covered container in the refrigerator.
Your harvest can also be kept for several month by washing the berries, patting them dry, and placing them in freezer bags.

Spray to prevent white peach scales.,
Maintain and prune to avoid sooty canker disease.,
Pick and discard infected fruit to avoid popcorn disease.,
Avoid powdery mildew through fungicide treatments.",How to Care for a Mulberry Tree3," White peach scales are pests or small insects which attack the twigs and trunks of trees, and can even kill them. Spray with dormant oil sprays in the winter to control the pests. Avoid using insecticides because the insects protect themselves against it with their armor.Mixture ratios and spraying guidelines vary based on your tree. Be sure to read and follow printed instructions on the manufacturer’s bottle.Most call for a mixture of 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of oil per gallon of water to be used with a pressurized sprayer.Avoid spraying when temperatures are below 40ºF.
When applying, be sure to coat the entire tree including branches, trunk, and the underside of the branches.

, Sooty canker is a wilt disease that affects limbs and branches of mulberry trees. Trees that are affected usually wilt in hot seasons, have cankers on limbs that eventually die back, and have brownish cracks that split open to reveal fungi. Keeping the tree fertilized and well-watered will help to prevent canker disease. If infection appears to be affecting branches, trim limbs at least 1 foot below the site of infection.There’s no chemical control for sooty canker disease, so always make sure to prune dead branches as soon as you recognize them to avoid spreading the disease.Avoid over-watering and over-fertilizing as this stresses the tree and makes it more susceptible to disease.
Always make sure you clean your pruning tools after use., Popcorn disease is caused by fungus and occurs in late spring and early summer.The fruit becomes large and extends more prominently than healthy fruit, until it resembles popcorn. The best prevention method is to pick and discard any fruit that appears to be infected, including any fruit that has fallen.The disease isn’t harmful to the tree itself so if you aren’t interested in the fruit, you don’t have to worry about preventing the infection.
You can also try spraying the tree with a Bordeaux mixture to treat the disease. However, it is often not affective because it is difficult to spray down the entire tree., Powdery mildew is caused by fungi and is evident when the leaf’s surface appears to be covered by a white, powdery substance.You can control the mildew by spraying your tree with an approved fungicide such as Serenade Garden Disease Control.Mixture ratios and spraying guidelines vary based on your tree. Be sure to read and follow printed instructions on the manufacturer’s bottle."

Have the soil tested.,
Select a fertilizer appropriate for blueberries.,
Water in.,
Ensure that the blueberry plant is not deficient in iron or magnesium.If you see red to yellow leaves, this signifies a deficiency in magnesium, while yellow leaves with green veins signifies a possible iron deficiency.The fertilizer should contain either or both of these nutrients, as required.",How to Fertilize Blueberries," Blueberries bring a unique combination of delicious fruit and striking ornamental beauty to the garden and landscape. Blueberries are easy to grow, require little care, and are seldom bothered by pests. If a few basic steps are followed, your blueberry plants can thrive and last a lifetime.

, Blueberry varieties are distinguished by their climate suitability and ripening season. Be sure to choose varieties suited to your area.


You may want to select varieties that ripen at different times or feature large fruit (best for fresh eating and desserts) or small fruit (best for muffins and pancakes). Bushes with brilliant fall color or different growth habits offer the gardener lots of choices to use throughout the landscape.
For blueberry lovers, allow at least two plants per family member.

, The blueberries need plenty of sunlight, whenever it begins to branch or bramble.;
, Adequate soil drainage is important. Find a suitable site, avoiding low lying areas the collect water or are slow to drain in the spring.

, Select a sunny location in well drained soil free of weeds and well worked. Locate in an area where irrigation water is available as best results will be obtained by keeping the root zone moist throughout the growing season. Where the soil is poor or marginally drained, raised beds 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) wide and 8-12"" high work very well for blueberries.A fail safe way to grow blueberries in almost any soil is to incorporate peat moss into the planting medium.


For planting directly in the ground, work up a planting area approximately 2-1/2 feet in diameter and one foot deep. Remove 1/3 to 1/2 of the soil. Add an equal amount of pre-moistened peat moss and mix well.

, Blueberries do best with a 2-4"" mulch over the roots to conserve moisture, prevent weeds and add organic matter. Bark mulch, acid compost, sawdust, grass clippings, etc. all work well. Repeat every other year.

, Blueberries cannot be fertilized by their own pollen. Most fruit trees, including blueberries have both male and female organs on the same flower, but not all are self pollinating.The best bet for blueberries is to have different varieties of blueberries within 100 feet (30.5 m), so bees can travel and cross pollinate.

, Spring is the best time, before the leaves grow.Apply in early spring and again in late spring for best results., You won't know how to correct it for the sake of better blueberry plants. Almost all fruits do best in slightly acidic soil, somewhere between a pH of 5.5 and 6.5. Blueberries prefer a soil of even greater acidity of between 4.09 and 5.0. The soil acidity is an important part of proper fertilization of the blueberries.


Blueberries thrive in acidic soils. One 4-cubic foot compressed bale will usually be sufficient for four to five plants, for raised beds mix equal volumes peat moss with acid compost or planting mix. Your garden center representative can recommend a soil acidifier if necessary for your soil.

, This plant likes acid fertilizers such as rhododendron or azalea formulations. Choose a fertilizer high in nitrogen. However, the fertilizer must not contain calcium nitrate or chloride as these can kill some blueberry plants.The fertilizer should contain ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate or sulfur-coated urea.These ingredients ensure that the pH is lower and the acid level higher.

For newly planted stock, use 2 tablespoons of 10-20-10 (or similar fertilizer) in late spring or once plants are established. Be careful! Blueberries are very sensitive to over fertilization.
For subsequent years, use 1 ounce of fertilizer for each year from planting to a total of 8 ounces per plant.
For organic fertilizers, blood meal and cottonseed meal work well. Or you can use the following:Fish meal or bone and blood meal for nitrogen.
Bone meal and powdered seaweed can add potassium and phosphorous.
Coffee grounds or sphagnum peat can increase acidity.


Avoid using fresh manure.

, Always water well after fertilizing.,"

Purchase June-bearing varieties for the largest strawberries.,
Buy everbearing strawberry varieties for two harvests per year.,
Choose day-neutral strawberry plants for a good first yield.,
Decide on a strawberry plant based on your climate.",How to Buy a Strawberry Plant1," June-bearing strawberry plants are the most common varieties because they bear large, healthy fruit over a period of two to three weeks. Typically, June-bearing strawberries produce one crop per season.June-bearing strawberries are further classified into early, middle, and later-bearing varieties. To extend your harvest, plant one of each plant so they bear fruit at different times.
June-bearing strawberries are best to plant in the late springtime, at least a week after the last frost. They respond well to organic, low-nitrogen fertilizers. June-bearing varieties prefer warm temperatures, so apply a 6-8 inch (15-20 cm) layer of mulch over the plant through the wintertime.Popular June-bearing varieties include: Earliglow, Honeoye, Seneca, Jewel, and Kent.;
, Everbearing strawberry plants usually produce one harvest in the spring and one in the late summer or early fall. In ideal everbearing climates (60°F to 80°F, or 15.56 °C to 26.66°C), everbearing plants can produce three harvests.Everbearing varieties thrive best in warmer climates where temperatures do not drop as frequently.Popular everbearing varieties include: Alexandria, Fraises des Bois, Weisse Solemacher, Rügen, and Muricata., June-bearing and everbearing varieties will take several years to reach their fullest harvest, but day-neutral plants produce good berries from their first year onward. Their berries, however, are usually smaller than other varieties.Day-neutral strawberry plants can be grown as annual or perennial plants.
Day-neutral strawberries grow well when planted in late April, and they enjoy cooler temperatures than other varieties.Popular day-neutral varieties include: Tristar, Albion, Tribute, Evie-2, and Seascape., There are hundreds of strawberry varieties for you to choose from within the June-bearing, everbearing, and day-neutral branches. Pick a variety that will adapt best to your climate. A higher harvest will be achieved if your strawberry plant grows in the right temperature, soil composition, and weather pattern."

If the plant has blossomed, check for flourishing flowers.,
Look for plants with unblemished, light-to-dark green leaves.,
Be on the lookout for spotting.,
Examine the plant for common strawberry pests.,
Avoid purchasing mildewed strawberry plants.",How to Buy a Strawberry Plant2," Blossom blight is one of the more common fungi affecting strawberry plants. You can identify blossom blight as a gray mold covering the blossoms and flower stalks. Blossom blight spreads by touching another plant infected by the fungus, so one sick plant can poison your garden. Inspect the blossoms on your strawberry plant before purchasing, and avoid any sickly gray flowers., Unhealthy strawberry plants will have dull, short leaves because of stunted growth. Avoid buying plants with yellowing leaves or browning around the edges, which indicates that your plant did not receive enough water or nutrients while growing., If a strawberry plant is infected with fungus via spores or other infected plants, it will develop spotting on the leaves and stem. Spotting will look like tan, gray, or white spots. Once a plant is severely infected, very little can be done to reverse damage. Do not buy a plant with mild or moderate spotting.The fungus that causes spotting prefers hot, wet climates, so be on the lookout if you live in a humid environment.

, Beetles, slugs, fruit flies, and weevils are all common strawberry plant pests. If the strawberry plant you choose at the nursery has plant pests, you can still purchase it. Just remember to remove these insects before you plant it in your garden to avoid adding more pests to your garden.Because so many pests have been reported on strawberry plants, purchase garden-safe insect spray at the nursery when you purchase your plants.

, Strawberry plants, especially those raised in dark and moist spaces, are at-risk for mildew development. Mildew spreads quickly and can easily ruin an entire garden. Check potential plants for a powdery growth covering the leaves and pepper-like black spots on the plant's underside."

Buy at a home center nursery for basic varieties.,
Check a locally-owned garden center for more varieties.,
Purchase from an online nursery as an alternative.,
Order one plant for every one or two quarts of berries you want.",How to Buy a Strawberry Plant3," Large-scale retailers will have common strawberry plants like Honeoye, Earliglow, and Allstar.Your choices will be slimmer and the plants may not be as cared for. Most of the strawberry plants large home centers carry will be June-bearing varieties, so if you're interested in everbearing or day-neutral plants, you might check a smaller store.

Large retailers will usually be the cheapest option and ideal if you're buying in bulk., Small-scale nurseries will have a deeper, broader selection. Plants are usually cared for by experts and receive more attention than varieties at retailers. Usually specialty garden centers organize their wares by growing conditions, allowing you to choose a variety ideal for your garden., Online (or mail order) nurseries are usually a good source for fresh, seasonal plants. Make sure you carefully read the online catalog details before you purchase a plant variety. Because you cannot inspect the plant in-person, you'll want to research the online nursery to make sure they're a reputable source.

If you're looking for a rare strawberry plant, an online nursery will likely be the cheapest option.Most online or mail-order plants are dormant when they're shipped, so you won't know if they are healthy until their growing season arrives.

, This estimate assumes that each plant will survive to maturity, so if you have a specific minimum berry yield you want, buy a few extra plants just to make sure. As the plants mature, they will gradually yield more berries each season."

Perform a soil test.,
Consider the age of the trees.,
Select a type of fertilizer.,
Wear protective gloves when handling fertilizer.,
Mix the fertilizer as recommended.,
Drip the fertilizer into the ground a foot away from the trunk.,
Spread the fertilizer just past the drip line.,
Stay within the maximum limits of nitrogen.,
Avoid fertilizing fruit trees too soon after planting.,
Fertilize at the right time of year.,
Monitor tree growth.,
Increase the amount of fertilizer as needed.,
Calculate how much fertilizer to use.",How to Fertilize Fruit Trees," Before you attempt to fertilize a fruit tree, make sure the tree actually needs fertilizer. Fertilizing unnecessarily can cause poor plant growth, so have a soil test performed to see if your trees need fertilizing.


To do a soil test, you would take a small sample of soil from the base of your tree. From there, you can take your soil to the state's agricultural department and get a test done from somewhere between $0 to $30.
The test will show you your soil's pH level, as well as the types of nutrients present in the soil. Ideally, your soil level should be between 6 to 6.5. Soils out of this range need fertilizer.;
, How long a tree has been growing makes a big difference in fertilizer. If a tree is about 1 to 2 years old when planted, you can probably withhold fertilizing for a few years. You can instead focus on weed control and providing adequate moisture.


However, track how much a tree grows each season. If a young tree is not growing fast enough, you may need to add fertilizer despite its age.
In general, branch length of trees should grow about 10 to 12 inches per year – though you’ll need to check the target growth rate of your specific tree. If your branch length is growing less, you may need fertilizer. If branch length exceeds this, however, you may not need to add fertilizer to your tree for several years.

, If you've determined you need fertilizer, select the right type for your needs. In order to fertilize fruit trees safely, you want to get what is called a balanced fertilizer. This is a fertilizer made with equal parts nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. This is known as the N-P-K ratio.The fertilizer should list the N-P-K ratio somewhere on the label. It should say something like 10-10-10 or 12-12-12. This indicates it is balanced and will be safe for use on fruit trees.
You can also consider an organic option, like blood meal, cottonseed meal, composted chicken manure, or feather meal.
To figure out how much fertilizer you'll need, you need to consider the tree's age or the diameter of the trunk. In general, you need one pound of fertilizer per year or one pound of fertilizer per inch of the trunk's diameter.

, Fertilizer can be harmful to the skin. During the process of handling fertilizer, make sure to wear gloves the entire time. You can purchase thick garden gloves at most hardware stores.


You may also want to consider protective covering for your eyes and mouth, especially if it's a windy day.

, Once you've obtained the proper amount of fertilizer, mix as directed. Here, you will have to refer to the directions that came with your fertilizer. Many fertilizers must be diluted with a certain amount of water prior to use. To figure out the right water-to-fertilizer ratio, read your instruction's manual.Unless you're using organic or homemade fertilizer, it's very important to read the instructions. You should also follow safety instructions carefully.If you went for a pellet based fertilizer, it probably does not require mixing. You will simply scoop out the pellets and drop them around your tree.

, Dripping fertilizer too close to the trunk can harm your tree. Drip a circle of fertilizer about a foot away from the trunk. The precise amount you'll use depends on your tree's age and the instructions that came with your fertilizer.If you're using pellets, sprinkle the pellets in a circle a foot away from the tree's trunk.

, The drip line is the perimeter formed by the furthest reaching branches of the tree. Again, you'll want to start the fertilizer about a foot from the trunk and spread it evenly until it’s just past the drip line. The tree’s roots extend at least this far and this will encourage the roots to spread out, strengthening the tree in the long run.You can use a rake or other tool to spread the fertilizer.
It can help to draw a line signifying the drip line in the ground before you start. This can help you see how far to spread the fertilizer.

, The maximum amount of nitrogen fruit trees can handle is one pound. If you're using 10-10-10 ratio fertilizer, 10 pounds would be the maximum you could use. If you were using 12-12-12 ratio fertilizer, do not exceed 8.3 pounds. Overuse of fertilizer can actually lessen fruit growth.

, Most experts recommend not fertilizing a tree in the first year, as it needs to develop its roots. In following years, you should withhold fertilizing a tree unless it is growing. Too much fertilizer early on can affect fruit growth and actually cause the tree to grow slower.

, For best results, you would fertilize your trees in early spring before bud growth. If you fail to fertilize before buds grow, you can still fertilize in late June. However, avoid fertilizing in late summer and early fall. New growth on the trees during these times will be damaged by frost in the winter., In order to assess when to increase the level of fertilizer, you'll need to measure tree growth. Trees have what are called growth rings. These are rings that mark the point where a branch started growing the previous year.To measure tree growth, measure each branch from its growth ring to the end of the branch. Then, take the average of all your measurements. This average is the level which your tree grew that year.

, Based on the amount your trees are growing, you may need to adjust how you use fertilizer. Make sure you know what's normal for your types of fruit trees.Younger apple trees should be growing at a rate of 12 inches per year. If they grow less, increase your fertilizer by 50% between years 2 and 3.
For pear trees, make sure to fertilize if they're growing less than 6 inches per year.
For other types of fruit trees, withhold fertilizer until the tree begins to bear fruit. Once fruit begins to grow, start fertilizing the tree each year with fertilizer with a 10-10-10 ratio.

, The amount of fertilizer you need depends on the age and size of your tree. A simple calculation can be used to determine the precise amount of fertilizer to use. Trees need one tenth of a pound (0.10 pound) of nitrogen per year of growth (0.20 for a 2 year-old tree, 0.30 for a 3 year-old tree, etc.), or per inch of trunk diameter. Divide the amount of actual nitrogen your tree needs by the amount of nitrogen in your chosen fertilizer to determine how much to use.You can use an online calculator to determine how much fertilizer to use if you're not good at math. You shouldn’t apply more than 1 pound of nitrogen in a year to any tree, maximum.

Recognize signs that your tree is getting too much or too little water.",How to Care for a Weeping Cherry Tree1," Keep the soil moist to a depth of 1 to 1 1/2 feet. Check the depth of the moisture about an hour after watering with a soil probe.Soil probes are narrow metal rods that push through the soil easily when it is wet but are met with resistance when the soil is dry. Push the soil probe into the soil about 1 foot away from the tree trunk until it stops sliding easily. Pull the probe back out of the soil and measure how deep it slid. If it is less than 1 foot, give the tree more water.;
, It can tolerate dry soils after it has been planted for a few years but, for the first two to three years, the soil should not be allowed to dry out completely. Letting the soil dry will drought-stress the tree and probably kill it.


If it looks wilted, water it immediately and make sure the soil is kept moist.

, The root structure of weeping cherries extends out into the soil at least a foot or two beyond the branches. The water should be dispersed evenly over the soil all the way around the tree extending out a few feet beyond the edge of the branches. This is where the moisture must be in order to be available to the tree.

, This will help keep the soil moist for longer periods of time. Keep the mulch a few inches away from the trunk, though.


If the mulch is pushed right up against the trunk, it will keep the bark too moist, resulting in damage and disease.

, When mature leaves wilt, curl, turn brown or yellow and fall from the tree during the spring and summer, the weeping cherry is not getting enough water.


When immature leaves turn pale, new branch growth wilts and the leaves stay green but become brittle, the weeping cherry tree is getting too much water.

Give the weeping cherry tree fertilizer in the spring after it begins to get new leaves.,
Pick out a healthy fertilizer.,
Spread the fertilizer around the tree.,
Recognize signs that your tree is being fed too little or too much.,
Prune your tree after it finishes flowering (optional).,
Use sharp bypass-type hand pruners and prune each stem individually.",How to Care for a Weeping Cherry Tree2," Do not give it fertilizer during the first year after it has been planted. Wait until the second year. Giving it fertilizer at this time will cause it to grow too quickly which will stress and damage the roots., Use fertilizer with a 10-10-10 (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potash or N-P-K) ratio and sprinkle it evenly over the soil. Usually, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of fertilizer is plenty but this varies.


Follow the fertilizer manufacturer’s instructions.

, The fertilizer should be spread from a few inches away from the trunk to 3 feet beyond the edge of the branches all the way around the tree. Water the tree generously after spreading the fertilizer to wash it down into the soil.

, A well-fertilized weeping cherry tree will grow vigorously and bloom profusely. If the tree seems to be growing slowly, give it another dose of fertilizer toward the end of spring.


Do not give your tree fertilizer after mid-summer as it will encourage new, lush growth that may not mature before winter. Immature or unhardened branch growth could be damaged by winter weather.

, Weeping cherry trees do not always need to be pruned but, if the branches are looking a bit scraggly and you would like to neaten them up, they can be pruned right after they finish flowering, in the winter or in early spring., Make the pruning cut 1/8- to 1/4-inch above a leaf. New branches will grow from the area right below where the pruning cut was made."
"
Recognize different kinds of pests.,
Spray your tree to fight aphids.,
Combat borers.,
Get rid of scale insects.,
Combat caterpillars.,
Consider the kinds of disease your tree might be attacked by.,
Cut away cankers.,
Combat crown and root rots.,
Watch out for rust.,
Look for leaf spots.",How to Care for a Weeping Cherry Tree3," Unfortunately, weeping cherry trees are susceptible to a variety of pest infestations. Aphids, borers, caterpillars and scale insects may attack the tree., Aphids, tiny soft-bodied insects that are usually green or red, can usually be controlled by spraying the tree with a strong spray of water from the garden hose. This crushes them and knocks them to the ground.


Aphids rarely manage to get back on the tree but, if they return, spray them off again. It may need to be done once or twice each week while the aphids are active.

, Borers leave holes in the bark on the stems and trunk. Usually the holes are not noticed until the borers have left. The top of the tree may wilt and the leaves may become discolored.There isn’t anything that can be sprayed on the tree to kill them.


However, you can use sharp pruners or loppers to remove the entire branch when borers are detected. Burn or dispose of the branch so that any borers left in the wood will not emerge to attack again. If the borers have weakened the trunk, the entire tree should be removed for safety.

, Scale insects are small, flat, immobile insects that are often off-white or brown. Remove severely infested branches with loppers or pruners and put them in the garbage.


Lighter infestations can be controlled with insecticidal soap.Mix 5 tablespoons of insecticidal soap in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Put it into a sprayer and spray the tree until it is dripping, taking care to coat the undersides of the leaves and stems. Wash the soap off after an hour or two as it could damage the leaves if it is left on the tree.

, Caterpillars will make nests or tents in the weeping cherry branches and eat the leaves. Remove the nests by hand or with a long stick and put them in the garbage or step on them to kill the caterpillars.

, Weeping cherry trees can develop canker, crown rot, root rots, leaf spots, rust and verticillium wilt.

, Cankers are bacterial or fungal infections that cause darkened patches of bark that often ooze sap.Remove the entire branch with sharp pruners or loppers when cankers appear. If cankers develop on the trunk, it will be weakened and the tree should be removed for safety.

, These rots are caused by a fungal or bacterial infection. These infections take hold when the crown or roots are kept too wet. The most common symptoms of these diseases are wilting and yellow or brown leaves that may drop from the tree.


When weeping cherries contract these disease they often cannot be saved. Try digging the soil away from the crown and top roots carefully and let them dry for a while before watering again.

, Rust is a fungal infection that causes orange, powdery-looking areas on the leaves. Remove the infected leaves and clean up debris from around the tree.

, Leaf spots are brown or black spots on the leaves which are caused by bacteria or fungi.Remove the infected leaves and clean up debris.


Do not wet the leaves when watering as this is conducive to rust and leaf spot infections.

Place the pot in a warm location.,
Water the soil when you see it become dry.,
Remove the plastic covering once the sprout appears and transfer the pot to a warm, sunny location.",How to Plant a Lemon Seed1," Pour some soil into a large bucket and add water to it until it is damp. Mix the soil with your hand or a trowel until it is evenly damp. Do not allow the soil to become soggy, or the seeds will rot. You will need a well-draining soil. Lemon trees love water, but they hate to sit in it.


Try to get a pasteurized soil mix. Pasteurization gets rid of any bacteria that can kill seeds.Consider getting a soil that is a blend of peat, perlite, vermiculite, and organic fertilizer. This will give your seedling proper drainage and nutrients.;
, The pot should be about 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) wide, and 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters) deep.This pot will be enough for one seed. Some people like to plant several seeds in one pot at a time. If you want to do this too, choose a larger pot.


Your pot must have drainage holes. If your pot does not have any, you will need to drill some.

, Stop when the top of the soil is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the rim., You can do this using your finger or a pencil.

, It may be necessary to use an organic lemon because seeds from a non-organic lemon may not sprout. Also, avoid taking any seeds that look too tiny (like a grain of rice) or that look shriveled (like a raisin). These seeds either won't sprout or won't grow into healthy seedlings.


Consider planting 5 to 10 lemon seeds at one time, in case some of the seeds don't sprout or don't make it past seedling-hood.
Consider taking a Meyer lemon seed. These do well indoors.
Keep in mind that trees that come from seeds are not identical to the parent tree that they came from. Sometimes, the fruit that the new saplings produce is of a lesser quality. Other times, they do not produce fruit at all. This does not prevent the young tree from being visually pleasing. Keep this in mind when growing your tree., You can do this by washing the lemon seed or by sucking on it until the coating is gone. This is important. The gel-like coating contains sugars, which can cause the seed to rot.Consider leaving the lemon seeds in a cup of warm water overnight. This will help them sprout faster., Make sure that the pointy tip is pointing downward into the soil, and the rounded part is pointing upward towards you. The roots will come out of the pointy part., Begin by placing a sheet of clear plastic cling wrap over the pot. Wrap a rubber band around the plastic wrap to secure it to the pot. Poke a few holes into the plastic wrap. You can use a pencil, a toothpick, or even a fork. These holes will allow the plant to breathe.

, You can place the pot in a sunny location too, but sunlight is not vital at this point. In fact, too much sunlight can ""cook"" the young, delicate seedlings. You should see a sprout emerge in a about two weeks.The ideal temperature is between 68°F and 82.4°F (20°C and 28°C)., The plastic wrap should trap the moisture, and the condensation should rain down onto the soil, making it damp again. In very dry environments, this may not happen. If you see the soil start to become dry, remove the plastic wrap and water the plant. Be sure to re-cover the pot with the plastic wrap when you are done watering.

, Remember to keep the soil damp, but do not let it become soggy. Click here to learn how to take care of your seedling.

Consider keeping the seeds in a cup of water overnight.,
Clean the gel-like coating off of each seed.,
Peel the other white layer off to reveal a brown-colored seed.,
Peel the brown seed cover off as well.,
Place the seeds down onto the damp paper towel.,
Repeat the peeling process for the rest of the seeds and place them down onto the towel.,
Slip the paper towel into a plastic zippered or resealable bag, and close the bag tightly.,
Keep the plastic bag in a dark, warm location until the seeds sprout.Keep the temperature between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Transplant the seedlings when the tails are about 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) long.If you don't want to wait that long, transplant them when the tails are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) long.Make a shallow hole in a pot of damp, well-drained soil, and tuck the seedling, tail-side-down into the hole.,
Move the pot to a warm, sunny location.",How to Plant a Lemon Seed2," Start by soaking a paper towel with water, then squeeze out the excess water. Place the damp paper towel on a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles.The paper towel should fit inside your plastic zippered or resealable bag. If the paper towel is too big, then fold it in half or into quarters.

, Seeds from non-organic lemons usually do not sprout.Look for seeds that are large and plump. Skip the ones that look shriveled or like tiny, white specks. These will either not sprout, or they won't grow into a healthy seedling.Even if you only plan on growing one lemon tree, it is a good idea to start with several seeds. Not all seeds will sprout, and not all seedlings will survive.
Consider getting some seeds from a Meyer lemon. Meyer lemon trees do well indoors. They are not only ornamental and lovely to look at, but also produce smaller, sweeter-tasting lemons.If you are working with a small, sandwich-sized bag, then choose about 5 to 7 seeds. If you use too many, your seeds won't have room to grow. If you are working with a larger, freezer-type bag, then you can use up to 10 seeds.

, This will keep the seeds from drying out while you work. The seeds must stay moist. If they dry out, they will not sprout.

, You can do this by rinsing the seeds in cool water, or by licking them. This gel is filled with sugars, which can encourage mold and bacteria growth.

, Start peeling from the pointy end. You can use your finger nail or a craft knife to nick the tip, and then peel the outer shell down. This will make it easier for the seeds to sprout.

, You may notice that your seed is covered with a thin, brown film. Use your fingernail to scratch this coating off.

, Try to spread the seeds out as evenly as you can, so that the roots don't become tangled when they sprout.

, Once the seeds are on the paper towel, they should stay damp. If you notice them starting to get dry out, consider covering the paper towel with another damp paper towel. Be sure to remove the second paper towel before proceeding to the next step.

, Don't use a plastic grocery bag. You want the bag to be zippered or resealable; this will help trap the moisture and retain heat. Your seeds will need both in order to sprout.

, It will take one to two weeks. Some seedlings will need up to three weeks to sprout.

, Gently pat the soil around the seedling.

, Remember to water the plant and to keep the soil damp; do not allow the soil to become soggy or dry. Click here to learn how to take care of your seedling.

Water your plant regularly, about 2 or 3 times per week.,
Make sure that it gets enough sunlight.,
Know when to transplant your seedling.,
Maintain the soil pH level.,
Remember to provide your tree with proper nutrients so that it grows healthy and strong.,
Understand that it will take some time before your tree can bear fruit.",How to Plant a Lemon Seed3," When the seedling has 4 developed leaves, let the surface of the soil become dry before you water again. Don't let the soil dry out completely, however; it should be moist if you stick your finger into it., Lemon trees require at least eight hours of sunlight. Seedlings will require 10 to 14 hours.You may have to place a grow light next to your tree to ensure that it gets enough sunlight. You can purchase grow lights from gardening shops and nurseries.

, Eventually, your seedling will outgrow its pot. When the seedling reaches 1 year old, transfer it to a 6 inch (15.24 centimeter) wide pot. Eventually, you will need to move your plant to a pot that is 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 centimeters) wide and 10 to 16 inches (25.4 to 40.64 centimeters) deep.A good rule of thumb to determine when it's time to transplant is to look under the pot. If you can see roots through the drainage holes, it is time for a new, bigger pot.

, Lemon trees like soil that is slightly acidic. The pH should be between 5.7 and 6.5. You can measure this with a pH testing kit, which you can purchase from a gardening shop or a nursery. A good way to lower the acidity of the soil is by watering the plant once a month with some cold black coffee or tea (with no milk or sugar added).However, make sure that you continue to monitor the pH until it has reached the ideal range.

, You can either dig a trench around the tree and fill it with dry compost, or you can water it with a water soluble fertilizer. Here are some ways in which you can provide your tree with the nutrition it needs:


Fertilize your lemon tree twice a year with an organic fertilizer, such as compost or vermicompost.Water your plant every 2 to 4 weeks with a water soluble fertilizer. It should be high in potassium and magnesium.If your tree is going to stay indoors, purchase a general indoor plant fertilizer. It should contain micronutrients.Water your tree once a month with a solution made from 1 tablespoon of Epsom salts and ½ gallon (1.89 liters) of water.If your tree is still very small, you might not need so much water. Instead, water the plant as much as you need to, then save the leftover water for the next month.

, Some lemon trees will produce fruit in as little as five years. Others will requires as many as 15 years.

To do this, you will need five or more mature, ripe, and healthy strawberries. You will destroy some of the seeds in the process, but strawberries have lots to spare.Place the berries in a blender and blend the fruit on low speed for 10 to 20 seconds. Set the blender aside and allow the mixture to settle.
Skim off the top layer of floating seeds. You can discard these, because they are likely broken or not viable.
Pour the pulp through a fine-mesh strainer with a bowl underneath to catch the pulp. You can eat this, use it for baking, or make jam.
Move to a sink and run water through the strainer to help wash away excess pulp. When you're done, the strainer should have a bunch of unbroken seeds left in the bottom. Spread these out on a piece of paper towel and allow them to air dry. Remove any large bits of pulp that are still mixed in with the seeds.;
, Another way to remove the seeds from a strawberry is to scrape them off with a knife. To start, place about five ripe and healthy strawberries in an airtight container and place them in the freezer overnight.The next day, remove the strawberries from the freezer. With a razor, utility knife, or sharp kitchen knife, gently scrape the sides of the strawberry and pick out the individual seeds. Don’t cut too deeply into the berry. Be very careful not to cut yourself.
Place the harvested seeds on a sheet of clean paper towel and leave them to dry. Use the strawberries for eating or cooking.

, Another way to remove strawberry seeds is to cut off strips of flesh from the berry and allow them to dry. Once dry, you can easily rub the seeds off with your fingers. This method is safer than the scraping method. Use about four ripe strawberries.Place the strawberries on a flat cutting board. With a sharp knife, carefully peel off vertical strips (from the stem to the tip) from the outer layer of the strawberries. Cut just deep enough to get the seeds and a little flesh.
Lay the strips seeds-up on a piece of clean paper towel. Gently press the strips down into the paper towel. Place the paper towel and the strips somewhere warm and dry, but out of direct sunlight. Leave them to fully dry out over the next few days.
When the strips are completely dry, lay the paper towel down on a flat surface. Gently rub your finger over every strip of dried strawberry flesh. As you run your finger over the strawberry, the seeds will come loose.

, Instead of harvesting your own strawberry seeds, you can also purchase seeds from nurseries and online. Or, if you prefer, you can also purchase a seedling plant, which will be much easier to grow.


If you buy seeds, you'll have to germinate them and transplant the seedlings once they sprout.
When you buy strawberry seeds or established seedlings, you're more likely to get a recognized strawberry variety. On the other hand, if you harvest seeds from a store-bought strawberry, the resulting plant may not yield the same type of fruit as the parent, especially if the original strawberry was a hybrid., Strawberry seeds will germinate much faster if you freeze them first, because this tricks the seeds into going through their regular winter cycle. When the seeds thaw and warm up, they get kicked into their spring cycle and begin to germinate right away.


Place the dry seeds in an airtight sealable bag or container. Leave them in the freezer for three to four weeks.Strawberry seeds should be started inside in winter or early spring, about 10 weeks before the last frost. Make sure you give yourself time to freeze the seeds before this date.

, When you're ready to plant, remove the seeds from the freezer and allow them to warm up to room temperature. Leave them in the air-tight container until they’ve warmed up.


It’s important to keep the seeds out of the air as they warm, because you want them to stay dry as they warm up, otherwise they could be damaged by the cold moisture., Fill a seed tray with about an inch (2.5 cm) of starter mix. Strawberries like soil that’s fertile and slightly acidic. The ideal pH is around 6, so add a bit of sulphur powder to the mix if necessary.Add enough water to make the soil damp, and sprinkle the strawberry seeds over the soil. Cover the top of the seeds with a thin layer of soil or peat moss so the seeds will still get sun. Cover the seed tray with a layer of plastic wrap.

, Place the seed tray in direct sunlight. When the soil starts to dry out, add a bit more water to keep the soil damp until the seeds germinate. When you water the soil, fully unwrap the plastic to give the seeds some air.Strawberry seed germination can take as little as one week or as many as six, so be patient with them.
Completely remove the plastic wrap once the seeds start to germinate.
The seedlings are ready to be transplanted once they’ve grown three or four leaves each.

, Strawberries can be planted into pots or raised garden beds as long as three weeks have elapsed since the last frost. They like lots of sun, so choose a location that gets between 6 and 10 hours of sun per day.To make a simple raised garden bed, lay down a piece of plastic on the site where you want the bed to be.
Use pieces of wood, logs, cinder blocks, bricks, or any other material to build up a square or rectangular barrier around the edge of the plastic that will keep the soil in place. Make sure the barrier is at least 10 inches high.
Fill the center with soil that’s at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep.

, Strawberries like soil that’s moist but not wet, so you need a well-draining soil. A good option is a sandy loam mixed with compost or manure.Use about one-third compost or manure and two-thirds loam.

, For each plant, dig a 6-inch (15.2 cm) hole into the soil. Place the plant into the soil, and try to disturb the roots as little as possible.Leave 24 inches (60 cm) of space between each plant.


Fill the hole around the roots with soil and pack it down to remove air pockets.

, After planting the strawberries, water them. Give them more water anytime the soil starts to dry out, especially when the weather becomes hot and dry.Water strawberry plants in the early morning, and add the water directly to the soil. Do not get the fruit or leaves wet.
To help keep the soil moist, add a layer of clean straw to the surface of the soil.
You may have to wait until next year for the plants to bear fruit.
It’s recommended that you remove all the flowers during the first year of growth in order to allow the plant to mature before growing berries. This may be difficult, but it will give you a much better harvest the second year.
Alternatively, start your plants in the fall and harvest the following spring.

There are three general types of grapes: American, European, and Muscadine grapes. American grapes grow best in warm, sunny climates like that of central California. European grapes are common in Europe and Northern parts of the US, and Muscadine grapes are commonly found in the Southern US.


Within each general type of grapevine, there are multiple species to choose from which each offer up their own flavor, color, texture, and size. Visit a local nursery to find one that fits your needs and environment.
Select plants that look healthy and strong, and are 1 year old. When possible, get them certified virus-free to ensure that their healthy growth is continued.Look for plants that have an even root distribution, and whose canes are symmetrical.;
, If you or a friend has another grapevine you’d like to plant from, you can take a cutting and plant it in a new location. To use your own cuttings: Cut the sections directly from the vine or from brush that has recently been pruned off. Make sure the cutting is 3 nodes long (the nodes will look like bumps). At the bottom of the cutting, make the cut at an angle. This cut should be at 45 degrees and 1/4 to 1-inch above the node.


When taking cuttings, plant as many as possible - in as many locations as possible - to have a higher chance of success. Surplus plants can be given away.

, Grapevines are long term plants that can live between 50 to 100 years. Therefore, make sure that the location you select is a permanent one that will offer up plenty of room for future grapevines. Grapevines thrive in sloped and hilly areas that offer up plenty of drainage and sunlight. When possible, plant your grapevines on a downward slope on a south-facing hill, in an area clear of other trees and large plants.


In cold areas be sure to plant the grapevines in a sunny area, preferably facing south. A southern facing location may prevent frost nipping the vines. Also avoid ""frost pockets"" such as low lying areas or the base of a slope, where cold air can pool and ruin a crop.
If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, north-facing slopes are sunnier.

, Grapevines are a bit picky about their soil conditions, so make sure your are just right before planting. Use soil that slightly rocky or sandy with a pH just above 7. Amend the soil to promote good drainage if necessary, as water-logged roots are not conducive to healthy growing grapevines.


For best results, take a soil sample to an agricultural extension office or soil testing laboratory for a complete soil test. This is usually cheap or free. If this is not possible, test the soil pH with an at-home kit and add pH adjusters to your soil if necessary.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, grapevines do not like soil that is too nutrient-rich. Avoid heavily fertilized soil when possible, and follow recommendations from a soil test result or an experienced local grower., Grapevines are, as the name implies, vine plants that grow upwards along a support structure. If you are not planting your grapes along a fence or other structure, construct or buy a trellis for them to grow along. This is typically a wooden structure made of intertwined boards that allow the vines to wrap around them, providing a sturdy support system.


Latticed wood and wire can be purchased and attached to fence posts for an easy homemade trellis, if you don’t have the funds or ability to purchase or make your own.
Don’t use a single stake (as you might for tomato plants) as this won’t provide enough support for your vines once they start growing.

, Wait to plant your grapevines until a frost-free day in late winter or early spring. Pruning should happen around this time in upcoming years as well. Contact your local agricultural service for exact planting dates.

, Depending on the species of grapes you are planting, spacing will be different for each plant. For American and European grapes, plant each vine 6–10 feet (1.8–3.0 m) apart. Muscadines require much more space, and should be planted approximately 16 feet (4.9 m) apart. Plant the cuttings in a trench with the basal and center bud covered. The top bud should be just above the soil surface. Press the soil firmly around the newly planted grapevine cuttings.


How deep you plant the vines will depend on the age and size of each individual plant. Don’t bury the vine cane any higher than the first bud, but make sure the roots are completely covered in soil.

, Grapevines don’t prefer heavy water or rain, so after the first watering keep the amount of water you give them to a minimum. Keep water near the roots so that the majority of it gets absorbed rather than evaporated by the sun. If your area doesn’t get much rain, set up a drip system directly at the roots so that the grapevines get small amounts of water on a regular basis., The first year, the grapevine should not be allowed to produce any fully matured fruits as these can damage the young vine with their weight. Cut back all the fruit, as well as all the vines except for the strongest that branch off the cane. In later years prune as needed following established local practices, and prune back 90% of the new growth on older vines each year.

, Always always prune grapevines when they are dormant. They will otherwise bleed their sap - losing vigour. This is typically in late winter when it is no longer cold enough to frost outside.

, A layer of mulch around your plants will regulate soil temperature, retain water, and reduce weeds.

, Little pest control is needed as grapevines are naturally hardy. Keep weeds at bay by hand-weeding on a regular basis, and cover you grapevines in bird net to keep birds away if necessary. Seek guidance from your local gardening club or agricultural extension on how to combat the Vine Moth. It is one of the few pests that can decimate grapevines.


Be sure to plant the grapevines so they receive enough airflow to prevent powdery mildew.
Aphids can be a problem for grapevines; ladybugs are a natural consumer of aphids and will not damage your vines further.

, Strong, edible fruit likely won’t appear for anywhere from 1-3 years. When it appears, test its ripeness by picking a few grapes from different areas and tasting them. If the grapes are sweet, start picking as they ready for harvesting and eating.


Grapes will not continue to ripen after picking (as is the case with other fruits) so be sure not to pick them prematurely.
Color and size are not necessarily a good indication of ripe fruit. Only pick the fruit after you’ve tasted it and are certain it is ready."

Taste the fruit, if you have the opportunity. Not all oranges are alike. If you can taste fruit grown on a tree in your area, perhaps from a neighbor, even better.













Find out if the fruit produced has many seeds, or not.













Ask for certification of the health of the tree, or ask someone who's experienced with citrus trees to inspect it. See Warnings.














, Ask at the nursery or look up online how large the mature tree will get.









Try dwarf citrus trees if you are short on space. You can even grow them in large pots, and they open up the possibility of covering the entire tree in a shelter during the delicate winter months or even bringing the tree indoors. Even though they are small, dwarf citrus trees can produce a very reasonable harvest.
On the other end of the spectrum, a couple of large lemon trees can form a good-sized hedgerow. It all depends on just how much citrus you want.

, The saying goes that you should dig at least a $60 hole for a $20 tree. As a practical matter, make sure you know where you want to place the tree, then dig a hole that is about three feet (1 meter) in diameter and as deep as the container. Do not bury the root crown, the transition from trunk to roots, as this will cause problems down the road. Plant the tree slightly higher than the surrounding soil to allow for some settling, most container grown nursery stock has high organic matter content that will decompose causing the plant to settle in the planting hole dropping the root crown below grade if not planted slightly high.









If you have any concerns about drainage, such as in heavy clay soil, fill the hole with water and see how long it takes to drain out. If you have drainage problems (that is, if the water is not gone by the next morning), dig the hole even deeper and plant the tree up higher.













For a dwarf citrus tree, select a large pot. Try for two feet in diameter or a half-barrel, at least.

, Depending on the quality of what you took out of the hole, you might try a half-and-half mixture of compost and the now-loosened soil. Create a mound of soil in the middle of the hole that supports the root ball with the crown (the base of the tree trunk where the roots begin) slightly above it.

Mix in some citrus fertilizer with the soil, if you like.













If you are planting a dwarf citrus in a pot, use straight potting soil and fill it in to a similar level. Place the pot up on blocks and be sure there are plenty of drainage holes in the bottom. Don't let the pot sit directly in a saucer or puddle of water.














, Place the tree on the mound of soil. Add or remove soil underneath to adjust the height so that the crown is level with the soil or even slightly above it.








,









If you are using a pot, fill with straight potting soil. Leave at least two inches at the top to allow space to water thoroughly.

,









Stay away from organic mulch, as it increases the likelihood of foot rot disease.
A safe bet is that the roots are at least as wide as the branches, so make the mulch area at least this large. You can even add a rim of mulch around the circumference of the circle to aid in watering.
Do not mulch right up to the base of the trunk. Leave a little margin so that the crown has breathing room and doesn't stay wet when you water.

, Water even mature citrus trees regularly. Citrus trees have relatively shallow, broad root systems. Once established, the trees may tolerate some drought, but they won't produce fruit that's as good.








, Fertilizers are available in citrus or citrus-and-avocado formulations. Apply them according to package instructions, typically three to four times a year for slow-release types.








, They don't require heavy or regular pruning.

Remove any ""suckers"", or shoots growing from the rootstock. Citrus trees are grafted, meaning that a tree with desirable fruit is cut and attached to a sturdier rootstock. You don't want the rootstock taking over.













Remove any ""wild"" shoots growing beyond the general shape of the tree. These will often be long, straight, quick-growing branches that don't follow the overall form or shape of the tree.













Moderately thin the foliage if it grows excessively dense, to promote air circulation and availability of light.
Generally, train citrus trees as shrubs or hedges. If you'd like to remove a few lower branches to give it more of a tree shape, go ahead, but don't overdo it.

, Oranges, lemons, and grapefruit should all be completely free of green coloring. They will not ripen off the tree. Limes are generally picked green, so go by size and season. See the external links for more details on limes.

, Banana plants grow best with 12 hours of direct, bright sunlight each day.They can still grow with less (more slowly), but you should determine where in your yard receives the most sun.

, Bananas require a lot of water, but are prone to rotting if the water does not drain adequately.


To test drainage, dig a hole 0.3m (1 ft.) deep, fill with water, and allow to drain. Refill once empty, then measure how much water is left after 1 hour. Approximately 7-15 cm water drainage per hour is ideal for banana plants.

A raised garden bed or adding 20% perlite to the soil assists drainage.This is especially important if you are using a banana plant that does not yet have leaves, or had the leaves removed for shipping. Leaves help evaporate excess water., While banana plants are technically herbs, they are often mistaken for trees for a reason. Some varieties and individuals can reach 7.6 m (25ft.) in height, although you should check the source of your banana plant or local banana growers for a more accurate estimate for your locale and variety.


Each banana plant requires a hole at least 30cm(1ft.) wide and 30cm (1ft.) deep. Larger holes should be used in areas of high wind (but will require more soil).
Keep banana plants at least 4.5m(15ft) from trees and shrubs (not other banana plants) with large root systems that may compete with the bananas' water.Multiple banana plants help each other maintain beneficial humidity and temperature levels, as long as they are planted at the correct distance. If you can, plant several plants in a clump with 2–3m(6.5–10ft.) between each one, or a large number of banana plants 3–5m(10–16ft.) from each other.Dwarf varieties require less space.

, If your outdoors environment is inadequate, you'll need an indoor location with similar requirements (12 hours bright light and constant warm temperature and humidity).


You'll need a large planting container sufficient for its adult size, or be willing to transplant the banana into a larger pot whenever necessary.
Always use a pot with a drainage hole in a location where water can drain well.
Consider a dwarf variety if you don't have sufficient indoor space.
Use half the amount of fertilizer when growing a plant indoors, or cease entirely if you don't have room for a larger plant. (This may be suitable for a houseplant you don't intend to harvest fruit from.)

, You can acquire a banana sucker (small shoot from the base of a banana plant) from another grower or plant nursery, or buy one online. A banana rhizome or corm is the base from which suckers grow. Tissue cultures are produced in laboratories to create higher fruit yield. If you're transplanting a mature plant, prepare a hole appropriate to its size and have an assistant help you.


The best suckers to use are 1.8-2.1m (6–7ft) in height and have thin, sword-shaped leaves, although smaller suckers should work well if the mother plant is healthy.Big, round leaves are a sign that the sucker is trying to make up for a lack of adequate nutrition from the mother plant.If the sucker is still attached to a mother plant, remove it by cutting forcefully downward with a clean shovel. Include a significant portion of the underground base (corm) and its attached roots.A rhizome (corm) without notable suckers can be chopped into pieces. Each piece with a bud (proto-sucker) will grow into a banana plant, but this will take longer than using a sucker.

, Cut off any dead, insect-eaten, rotting or discolored sections of the plant. If most of the plant is affected, dispose of it away from other plants and find another planting material.


If using a sucker, remove all but a few centimeters (1–2 inches) of the roots. This will limit the chance of disease. You can also remove any leaves in excess of five and/or cut the top of the plant off with a slanting cut to increase the amount of sunlight that warms the soil for root growth and rot prevention., Remove any plants or weeds that are growing on the planting site, then dig a circular hole 30cm wide and 30 cm deep (1ft. x 1 ft.) A larger hole will provide greater support for the plant but require more soil.


If planting indoors, instead use a planting pot this size or larger.

, Leave several centimeters (a few inches) of space at the top to encourage drainage.



Do not use potting soil, nor your regular garden soil unless you are sure it is suitable. Soil mixes intended for cacti can produce good results,or ask other growers of the same banana variety.
The ideal soil acidity for bananas is between pH 5.5 and 7. Acidity pH 7.5 or higher can kill the plant., The leaves should be pointing upward and the soil should cover the roots and 1.5–2.5cm (0.5–1 inches) of the base. Tamp the soil down to keep it in place but don't pack too firmly.

, Use store bought fertilizer, compost, manure, or a mixture of these. Add fertilizer immediately after planting in an even ring around the banana plant and repeat at monthly intervals.


Young plants require 0.1–0.2kg (0.25–0.5lbs) each month, rising to 0.7–0.9kg (1.5–2lbs) for an adult plant. Increase gradually as your plant grows.
If the temperature falls below 14ºC(57ºF) or if the banana plant hasn't grown since last month, skip the fertilization.Fertilizers are usually labeled with three numbers (N-P-K) representing the amount of Nitrogen, Phosphorus (Potash), and Potassium. Bananas require very high amounts of Potassium, but the other nutrients are important as well. You can use a balanced fertilizer (three numbers roughly equal) or a fertilizer that addresses deficiencies in your soil.Do not use manure produced in the last few weeks, as the heat it releases while decomposing can damage the plant., Underwatering is a common cause of banana plant death, but overwatering can cause the roots to rot.In warm growing weather without rain, you may need to water your plant daily, but only if the top 1.5–3 cm (0.5–1in.) of soil is dry. Test with your finger before watering.
Reduce the amount of water per session if the plant is sitting in water for long periods. (That can cause root rot).
In cooler temperatures when the banana is barely growing, you may only need to water once every week or two. Remember to check soil moisture.
Leaves help evaporate excess moisture, so be careful not to soak (just moisten) a young plant that has not yet grown leaves.Water the ring of fertilizer as well to help it soak into the soil.

, Remove dead leaves and banana plants and chop them up to place around the live plants. Other yard waste and wood ash can also be added to return nutrients to the soil.


Check the mulch regularly and remove any weeds that are growing. These can compete with the banana plant.

, If diseased plants are discovered, identify and treat them immediately, or uproot them. Insect pests should also be controlled as soon as they are found. Nitrogen and potassium deficiencies are the two most common nutritional problems for bananas, so learn to recognize the signs.


Signs of nitrogen (N) deficiency: very small or pale green leaves; reddish pink leaf sheathes; poor growth rate; small fruit bunches.Signs of potassium (K) deficiency: rapid appearance of orange/yellow color on leaves followed by leaf death; small or broken leaves; delayed flowering; small fruit bunches.Examples of major plant diseases include: Bacterial Wilt/Moko Disease; Panama Disease/Fusarium Wilt; Banana Bunchy Top; Blackhead/Root Rot/Toppling Disease; and Black Leaf Streak.

Examples of major plant pests include: Corn Weevil; Banana Aphid; Mealy Bugs. Fruit pests include: Flower Thrips; Red Rust Thrips; and Scarring Weevil.


, Once your plant is mature and has several suckers, remove all but one to improve fruit yield and plant health.


Cut all but one sucker off at ground level and cover the exposed plant with soil. Repeat with a deeper cut if they grow back.
The surviving sucker is called the follower and will replace the mother plant after it dies.
Exceptionally healthy plants can support two followers.

, There are 3 easy ways of doing it:



Wire/Rope and Bottle Method: Cut off the bottom of a plastic bottle. Insert a very long wire/very strong twine through the mouth and bottom of the bottle. Crunch the bottle to make it bendable and soft. Prop up the banana stem on the bottle, and use the wire to pull the stem slightly more upright. Tie the write to a strong support.

Single Bamboo Method: Use a 3m (10') long bamboo pole or other strong, durable material. Cut a piece of Y-shaped wood 10cm (4"") thick and 60cm (2') wide. Let the stem rest on the middle of the ""Y"" and push the bamboo upwards a little bit so the stem is wedged into the ""Y"" tightly. Bury the other end of the bamboo (the base) deeply into the ground. Tamp very firmly.

Double Bamboo Method: Use two 3m (10') long bamboo poles. On one end of the poles, tie them together with strong wire 30cm (1') from the end. Open up the poles to form a letter ""X"". Let the stem rest on the short end, push upwards a little bit to create pressure, and bury the other ends of both poles. Tamp very firmly.

, If temperature during winter months falls too low for your plant, there are several ways to care for it:Cover the stem with a blanket or soil. If there is no frost and the plant is still small, this may be adequate protection until the temperature rises high enough for it to grow again.
Store the plant inside. Uprooting the entire plant, removing the leaves, and store in moist sand in a heated indoor area. Do not water or fertilize; the plant will go dormant until you're ready to plant it outside again.
Grow the plant inside. This will require a large pot with drainage hole. If you don't want to grow your banana too big for your pot, you may need to cease or reduce the fertilizer treatments.
Salvage pieces to plant later. If frost or cold has killed most of your plant, chances are the suckers and corm at the base are still usable. Cut these away from the dead portion and store them in their own small pots to plant outside later.

, The typical banana plant flowers in 6-7 months under ideal conditions, but may take up to a year depending on the climate.Never remove the leaves around the flower, as they protect it from the sun.Do not confuse this with the Banana Bunchy Top Virus. See Tips below.

, This may take an additional 2 months or longer.Each connected cluster of bananas is called a ""hand"" and each individual banana, a ""finger"". The entire stem containing several hands is called a bunch.

, The remaining flower bud and/or tiny extra banana hand are the sterile male portions of the plant. The hand should wither off on its own, but removing the flower bud will cause the plant to put more energy into growing fruit.


The male portion of the flower is called the ""banana heart"". Some varieties of banana plants produce edible banana flowers that are popular in Southeast Asian cuisine, but not all are suitable for consumption.
Use a stick to prop up the plant if the bunches are dragging it down.

, This will protect the fruit from insects and other dangers, but they must be open at both ends to allow adequate air and water flow.Tie the nylon or plastic sack with soft twine several inches from the first hand.

, The small flower at the tip of each banana will become dry and easily rub off, or the banana plant will lose most of its leaves. This is a good time to harvest the fruit.


Cut a notch halfway into the tree, opposite the side of the bunch.
Carefully let the tree bend and cut off the bunch.
The fruit will ripen quickly once harvested, so you may want to pick some well in advance of harvesting so you don't end up with excess fruit that will go to waste.

, Remove the top half of the banana stem once you harvest the fruit. Desucker the base using the same process as you have while caring for your plant.


Remember to leave one sucker to replace the now-dying mother plant.

",How to Grow Dwarf Pineapples," Try large bark chips, osmunda fiber, large-size calcine clay, or tree fern fiber. Add small amounts of peat moss or vermiculite to hold water.;
, There are various ways to obtain a young plant.


Cut or break off young side shoots or ""pups"" from an existing plant when they're half the size of the adult.
Cut a dwarf pineapple fruit, leaving a little bit of the fruit attached to the topknot.
Divide the ""ratoons"" (root parts) of mature plants.

, Bromeliads in general prosper in the east, south, or west window where they can get 3 to 4 hours of full sun every day. Overall, dwarf pineapples require bright, warm conditions.

, There's no need to water the growing medium because overflow from the cup is enough to do the trick.

,, If you don't harvest the pineapple, it will likely bloom into a flower.

Transplant to larger pots or an outdoor location as the tree grows.",How to Germinate Orange Seeds," Slice an orange in half to reveal the seeds. Use a spoon or knife to pick out the seeds. The tree that grows will likely produce similar fruit, so make sure you choose the seeds of an orange variety you like.


Some orange varieties, such as navels and clementines, are seedless, and you won’t be able to propagate orange trees this way.;
, Look for plump, whole, healthy seeds that don’t have any spots, marks, dents, breaks, discoloration, or other blemishes or imperfections. Transfer the seeds to a bowl and fill it with clean water. Use a clean tea cloth to wipe the seeds and remove all traces of flesh and juice.


Cleaning the seeds is also important for removing fungus and mold spores, and to prevent fruit flies.You can clean and germinate all the seeds in the orange, and then pick the biggest and healthiest sprouts to plant.

, Fill a small bowl with clean room temperature water. Transfer the seeds to the water and let them soak for 24 hours. Many seeds have a better chance of sprouting if they're soaked first, because soaking softens the seed coating and kickstarts the germination.When the seeds have soaked for 24 hours, drain the water and place the seeds on a clean towel.
Don’t soak the seeds for longer than this, as they may become waterlogged and not sprout.

, Get a 4-inch (10-cm) planting pot with drainage holes in the bottom or find a good spot in your yard to plant the seed. If planting directly into the ground, then dig a small hole and place the seed in the ground. If planting in a pot, fill the bottom with a thin layer of pebbles to increase drainage, and fill the pot the rest of the way with potting soil. Make a half-inch (1.3 cm) hole in the center of the soil with your finger. Place the seed into the hole and cover it with soil.


After transplanting the seed to a pot, continue providing it with lots of direct sunlight every day.

, Newly sprouted seedlings will benefit from a mild fertilizer, such as compost tea. Add enough of the compost tea to moisten the soil. Repeat every two weeks. Water the soil thoroughly once a week, or if the soil starts to become dry.


If the soil dries out too often, the orange tree will not survive.As the seedling develops into a tree, it will start getting bigger and grow leaves.

, After several weeks, when the seedling has developed a few sets of leaves and grown in size, it will need to be transplanted to a larger pot. Use an 8” or 10” pot. Make sure it has drainage holes in the bottom, and add a layer of stones or pebbles first.


Fill the pot most of the way with potting soil. Mix in a handful of peat moss and a handful of sand to provide the tree with well-draining and slightly acidic soil.Orange trees like a pH between 6 and 7.0.
You can also look for citrus-specific potting soils at your garden center.

, Make a hole in the center of the soil in the new pot that’s about 2 inches (5 cm) deep and 2 inches wide. First, put a layer of soil in the bottom of the pot you will be using. Then, squeeze or tap the pot that the seedling is currently in to loosen the soil. As you do so, slide the soil and roots out of the pot in one piece and transfer them into the new pot. After transferring, fill in the area around the root ball with new soil.


Water the soil right away so that it’s moist.

, Move the tree to a sunny location that gets plenty of direct light. Near a southern or south-eastern window is great, but a solarium or greenhouse is even better.


In warm climates, you can move the potted tree outside in spring and summer, but place it somewhere that’s protected from strong winds., Orange trees love regular watering. During the warm spring and summer months, water the plant deeply once a week. In areas where there's regular rainfall, water when necessary to make sure the soil stays moist.


During the winter months, allow the top layer of soil to dry out partially before watering., Orange trees are heavy feeders and need lots of nutrients. Feed the tree with a balanced fertilizer, such as 6-6-6, twice a year. Feed the tree once in early spring and once in early fall. This is especially important during the first few years, before the tree starts bearing fruit.There are also citrus specific fertilizers that you may be able to find at a garden center.

, When the tree is about a year old, transplant it to a 10- or 12-inch (25- or 30-cm) pot. After that, transplant the tree to a larger pot every March. Alternatively, if you live in an area that stays relatively warm all year round, you can transplant the tree to a sunny location outside.Orange trees will typically not survive if they're exposed to temperatures below 25 F (-4 C), so they can't be permanently transplanted outside in cooler areas.
Fully grown orange trees are large, so if you live in a cooler climate, keep the tree in a solarium or greenhouse if possible.

Look for flowers.",How to Grow a Pineapple," Look for one with firm, green leaves that have not turned yellow or brown. The skin on the fruit should be golden brown and firm to the touch. Smell the pineapple to see if it's ripe: it should emit sweet, heady smell indicating that you've chosen it at just the right time to start a new pineapple plant.


Make sure the pineapple isn't underripe. It needs to be ripe in order to produce another pineapple.
Check to make sure the pineapple isn't too ripe by tugging a little at the leaves. If they come right off, the pineapple is too ripe to plant. Be gentle.
Make sure the pineapple doesn't have scale insects around the base of the leaves. They look like small grayish black spots.;
, Grasp the body of the pineapple with one hand and use the other to grab the leaves at the base and twist them off. This method ensures that the base of the leaves will stay intact. It will be attached to a minimum amount of fruit, which you don't need in order for the plant to grow.









If you're having trouble twisting off the top, you can slice off the top of the pineapple. Slice off the excess fruit around the root.
Make sure the base, the very tip of the area where the leaves join together, stays intact. New roots will be sprouting from this, and without it the plant won't grow.

, This helps the stem sprout roots once it is planted. Strip until a few inches of the stem are exposed. Cut away any remaining fruit without damaging the stem.








, The scars where you made a cut and removed the leaves will harden, which is necessary before you take the next step.









At this point, you can plant the crown into the soil, if you would like. While some people prefer to soak the pineapple crown first, it is not necessary., The mouth of the glass should be large enough to fit the pineapple crown inside, but small enough so that you can prop it up to keep it from getting completely submerged.








, Place them across from each other near the top of the stem. Push them in just far enough so that they'll stay in place. These toothpicks are used to suspend the pineapple crown in the glass of water.








, The toothpicks should rest on the rim of the glass. The stem should be submerged in the water, and the leaves should stick out the top.








, It should take several days or up to a few weeks for white roots to poke out and begin to grow.









Keep the plant away from extreme temperatures. Don't let it get too hot or too cold.
Change out the water every few days to prevent the growth of mold.

, Fill a 6-inch pot with light garden soil that has a 30% blend of organic matter. This has the right blend of nutrients for the pineapple plant.








, Plant the crown when the roots are a few inches long. Wait until they've gotten long enough to take root in soil. If you plant the crown too early it won't do well. As you plant it, make sure that the base of any remaining leaves are just above soil level. Press the soil firmly around the base of the crown without getting any soil on the leaves.








, It needs a sunny, warm and humid environment where the night temperatures won't drop below 65ºF (18ºC). If conditions are dry, mist the plant regularly.









You can keep the pot outside if you live in a warm climate. If you have cool winters take it indoors during the winter season and keep it in a sunny window. It's important for the plant to get a lot of sun all year round.
To help the rooting process, you can slip a plastic bag over the top of the pot. This will create a mini-greenhouse effect.

, Water the soil lightly once a week. Fertilize the plant with half-strength fertilizer twice a month during the summer.








, It can take several years, but eventually a red cone should appear from the center of the leaves, followed by blue flowers and eventually a fruit. It takes about six months for the fruit to fully develop. The pineapple will grow from the flower, above ground, in the center of the plant.

Learn why vines sometimes won't set fruit.",How to Grow Cantaloupe," Cantaloupes, also known as muskmelons, are available in dozens of cultivated and heirloom varieties, and grow best in hot weather, at least 2-3 months of consistent warmth. Cantaloupes love very sandy and loamy soil with good drainage, and a pH of around 6.


Varieties good for cooler climates include Hale's Best, Sarah's Choice, and Eden's Gem. Varieties noted for their flavor include Hearts of Gold, Ambrosia, Athena, and Honey Bun.
Pay particular attention to the time to maturity listed on the seed package. Most of the time, you won't buy cantaloupe starts, you'll purchase seeds and start them yourself. On the seed package, pay particular attention to planting advice and information about keeping them safe, and pay particularly close attention to the length of time to maturation.
If you want to save cantaloupe seeds from a particularly-delicious melon for planting, scoop them from the flesh and soak them for two days in cool water, then dry them thoroughly on a paper towel. Store them in a clean, dry jar in a cool, dark environment until you're ready to start your melons. While viable for around two years, it's usually best to plant seeds within the year.;
, The most important part of planting and growing cantaloupe is warm soil and enough space. The vines need some room to spread out, regardless of whether you plan on trellising or letting the melons mature on the ground, so you'll need a fairly wide bed, depending on how large a crop you're going to plant.


It's a common misconception and fear that cantaloupes will cross with other members of the same family, including cucumbers, other melons, squash, and pumpkins. They won't. Don't worry about planting your vining fruits in the same area of your garden plot. Most strange or bland-flavored cantaloupe is not the result of accidental cross-breeding, but the result of environmental factors or other problems., Lay compost or well-rotted manure evenly on your planting bed to create a rich feeding area for the cantaloupe. 6-8 inches of well-tilled soil is appropriate, plus your fertilization matter.


Start cultivating soil by tilling the ground at least a foot deep, aerating and thoroughly mixing the rough soil, removing any rocks, twigs, or other hard bits. Mix in a thick layer of manure and a smaller layer of compost on top, replacing the earth you excavated. Cantaloupes grow best on mounds, slightly raised above the surrounding ground, so don't worry if you've created a big bulge in the ground.
If you want, it's common to cover the ground of your plot with plastic film or weed matting prior to planting, to speed the warming process of the soil. It's important to plant cantaloupe starts in warm soil to promote healthy growth., If you knew the exact date of the last frost of the season, planting cantaloupe would be a snap. Ideally, cantaloupes will be direct-sowed approximately 10 days before the last frost, earlier in warmer climates. Because that date is ever more difficult to determine, it makes starting your cantaloupe indoors a somewhat more grower-friendly method.If you live in a cooler climate, start seeds indoors by sowing them in biodegradable seedling pots filled with rich planting soil. Moisten the soil generously, but without standing water. After a month or so, once the plants have a few mature leaves, you can transplant the entire biodegradable pot into your garden without disturbing the fragile root system.If you live in warmer climates, you can direct sow seeds when the soil temperature warms to at least 65 degrees to avoid poor germination.

, Cantaloupe should be planted in rows of raised mounts, with each row at least 4 feet (1.2 m) apart. The spacing within a row depends on how you plan to grow your melons:


If you want to grow cantaloupe on trellis poles or wires, space hills in the same row about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart. Trellising typically only works for smaller melon varieties.
If you plan to grow the cantaloupe on the ground, space the hills 36 to 42 inches (91 to 107 cm) apart.

, Wait for the ground to warm to at least 70 °F (21 °C), sometime after the final frost of the season. Depending on where you live, this may be earlier or later in the planting season.


If you started your cantaloupe indoors, plant your biodegradable pot in the middle of each mound, as close to the center as possible. Wet the soil generously during planting.
If you're direct-sowing seeds, drop 5 cantaloupe seeds about one inch deep, 18 inches apart, in hills about 3 feet (0.9 m) apart.

, Keep the soil around the young cantaloupe plants moist, but not standing in water. They should get around 1 or 2 inches a week. Cantaloupe will be very sensitive during periods of drought and may need additional watering, so use your judgment and keep a close eye on the plants to make sure they're growing and looking healthy.


Melons will take a while to set on the vine, but most of the sugary flavor in a melon can be determined from the leaves. Just because you don't see melons yet doesn't mean that you don't know anything about how they will taste. Pay attention to the quality and vigor of the leaves: they should be dark green, with stiff structure and and healthy color. Yellowish or spotted leaves may be a sign of dryness or disease.
It's typical for melon leaves to wilt significantly in the midday and stay wilted looking until the evening in extremely hot weather. This isn't necessarily a sign that you need to water the cantaloupe more, however, so look at the quality of the leaves, not the limpness.Drip-tape can be quite effective in watering your melons, but you can also hand-water or do whatever is appropriate for the size of your plot and other planting projects. Water around the base of the vines and try not to get the fruit wet, when it sets.

, Whether you're growing new plants or have transplanted your starts, it's a good idea to cover your rows with floating row cover in order to keep them warm and protect them from insects. You can use small loops of chicken wire to create a tunnel, then drape your netting over the row.


It's important to remove the matting after the threat of frost has dissipated and blooms have started to form, so that pollinating insects can reach the blossoms. You can cover the plants again once the fruits have set.
Use weed killers and chemical pest controls only as a last resort. Read all label instructions to make sure the treatment is safe for use on edible harvests and will not kill pollinating insects.

, It's challenging to walk around the thick network of vines, much less to weed it. To give your vines the best chance at growth, try to weed aggressively in the first couple of weeks of growth, and let them grow big enough to get a head start and beat out the weeds as the plant matures.


One of the difficult things about growing cantaloupe directly from seed is that the budding cantaloupe plant looks an awful lot like clover, a weed that you'll want to pick. Because it would be a tragedy to pull your budding plant, try to mark your start with a plant card, or wait until it distinguishes itself from the clover to start pulling weeds.
After removing weeds, add a thick layer of mulch around vines to suppress weed growth and help the soil retain moisture.

, Depending on how you've set up your growing patch, it may be appropriate to trellis your melons so they can grow off the ground. A fence-style trellis set low to the ground is the most effective for growing cantaloupe.



To train the vines, start by planting poles at least 6 feet (1.8 m) tall at each mound in your melon row, or up to 8 feet (2.4 m) tall for large varieties in warm climates.You can use metal wire, planks of wood, thick twine, or any other available supplies to connect the poles and provide something for the vines to cling to. Train the vines up along the poles to get them started.

To support the fruit, give them something to rest on or in to lessen the load on the vines. Place the fruit on raised mulch beds or pedestals like upside down cans or pots. You can cover the fruits with milk crates or similar protection if they are under attack by ground hogs or other animals.

When your vines start fruiting, melons seated directly on the ground are more prone to rot and being picked off by critters. If you expect damp weather near the end of the growing season, trellising is a good way to protect your melons. If the melons started on the ground, however, don't try to trellis them mid-growth.

, During the growth process, it is somewhat common to use a nitrogen fertilizer on plants that have not bloomed, or seem to be moving slower than other plants. Lining some coffee grounds around the root system can be an effective way of waking up the plant.


It's also common to fertilize cantaloupe with a higher potassium and phosphorus fertilizer after the blossoms have opened, though long time deposits of phosphorus fertilization can be environmentally hazardous. Line organic matter like compost or manure around the root system if they're lagging.

, Too much watering can dilute the sugar content in the melon as it ripens and affect the flavor of the fruit. It's common to hold back on your watering in the last week before you harvest the melons.


When a cantaloupe is ready to pick, the stem will start cracking slightly where it meets the stem. It's overripe when it falls off completely.It's also common that you'll start smelling the distinctive musky smell of a ripe melon when you're near the patch. If you can smell cantaloupe, they're ready to pick.
Most varieties of cantaloupe will ripen within 4 weeks of appearing on the vine, though pay attention to the guidelines of the particular variety you're cultivating for more specific instructions.

, Because they lay around the ground, melon vines are particularly susceptible to pests like insects, mites, and leaf miners. To keep from worrying, you can learn to recognize common problems and figure out whether or not you've got a serious problem.



Root knots and swelling mean nematodes, a significant problem that you won't be able to take care of this season. Pull up your plants and sew some cereal rye into the soil to cleanse it.

Stickiness and wilting mean aphids, which can be treated with Theodan or other organic insecticides such as diatomaceous earth or essential oil & olive oil mixtures.

Leaf tunnels and trails mean leaf miners, which isn't something to worry about. They shouldn't affect the fruit significantly.

Yellow webbed leaves mean spider mites, meaning that plants will need to be removed, if the small red mites are significant enough., Grown and watered properly, your cantaloupe should be fine most of the time. Occasionally, though, ground-vining fruit are susceptible to blights and diseases that can ruin crops if not treated immediately. You can learn to recognize the most-common varieties of blight, so you can pull up the plants and save your other crops, or start a fungicidal regimen, depending on the severity.



Yellow spots with downy undergrowth signify downy mildew. This is sometimes treated with chlorothalonil, or other organic-based wide-spectrum fungicide, though it shouldn't be necessary for most gardens. Proper trellising of vines should help circulate air and eliminate the possibility of mildew.Broken stems emitting amber-colored liquid means gummy sap blight. This is a soil-based blight, which means the crop will likely die this season, but you can treat sap blight by rotating varietals around your plot, and possibly using a selective fungicide.

Fruit rot after rain means southern blight. In regions with heavier soil, this is a common problem. Avoid over-watering and mulch between the plant and the soil to prevent rot.

, After going to all the trouble to prep your ground and start your cantaloupe, there's nothing more frustrating than a mess of vines that never sets any melons. Learning from this experience, though, can help ensure that you'll have fruiting vines in the future. Most fruiting problems are the result of one of three things:


A lack of pollinating insects can result in healthy-looking vines that never set. Cantaloupe vines produce male and female flowers, and pollination between them is necessary for fruiting. If you're growing cantaloupe in a greenhouse, or live somewhere that bees are scarce, you might need to pollenate by hand.
Improper ground temperature will force the plant to only produce male flowers, which makes it difficult to fruit, even if pollinating insects are very present. Make sure you wait to put your plants in when the soil is around 65 °F (18 °C).
If your melon plants struggle to produce, but you're doing everything by the book, try tilling some cereal rye in plots you plan on growing in for next season about a month before putting your plants in the ground.

Till the soil.",How to Grow Watermelons1," These fruits come in sizes ranging from 3 pounds to over 70 pounds (1.3kg to 32kg), and with either red, orange, or yellow flesh.Jubilee, Charleston Grey, and Congo are large, cylindrical varieties, while Sugar Baby and Ice Box are two smaller, globe shaped types.


Decide whether to plant watermelon seeds or transplants.Watermelon seeds need to germinate at a temperature over 70 degrees. If you live in a cool climate, it might make sense to start them indoors a few weeks before the last frost, so you'll be able get the seedlings underway at the beginning of the growing season. Otherwise, plan to plant the seeds directly in the ground well after the last frost, when the temperature is holding steady at above 70 degrees.
Watermelon seeds and transplants are available at nurseries in early spring.;
, Watermelon plants need a minimum of 6 hours of sun every day. They produce large vines that spread and take up a lot of space; plan on allotting a 4 by 6 foot plot for each plant, unless you're planting a mini-watermelon variety.

, Use a tiller to work the soil for the beds thoroughly, breaking up large clumps of packed earth. Remove any vegetative matter or deeply incorporate it into the soil.


Watermelons like loamy, fertile, well-drained soil. To determine whether your soil gets good enough drainage, take a look at it after a heavy rain. If you see puddles in the dirt, the soil isn't draining well enough.
To further enrich the soil, till compost into the top of layers.Watermelons grow best in soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8. Test the pH of your soil and determine whether the levels are appropriate for watermelon plants. If not, you can change the balance by adding compounds available for purchase at a plant nursery.

Know how to beat common avocado pests and ailments.",How to Grow Avocados," As subtropical plants, avocados love sun. Native to Central America, Mexico, and the West Indies, avocados evolved to thrive in warm, humid environments.Though avocados have been bred to grow in locales as far away as California, they always require good sunlight to grow well. However, paradoxically, young avocado plants can be damaged by excessive direct sunlight (especially before they've had time to develop extensive leaves). Because of this, if you are growing an avocado plant from a single pit, you will want to pick a growing spot that has access to good sun during some parts of the day but is not constantly in direct sunlight.


Sunny windowsills are great growing sites for avocados. In addition to ensuring that the avocados only receive sunlight during part of the day, indoor windowsills allow you to carefully control the temperature and humidity that the plant is exposed to.;
, For the most part, avocado plants do not do well in inclement weather. Snow, cold winds, and rapid temperature drops, which can be harmful even to hardier plants,can outright kill avocado plants. If you live in a tropic or subtropic climate with fairly mild winters, you may be able to get away with keeping your avocado plant outside year-round. However, if you live in an area where the winter temperature is likely to drop below freezing, you will want to prepare to move your maturing plant indoors for the winter to protect it from the elements.


Different avocado varieties have different tolerances for cold temperatures. In general, the common avocado varieties listed below will receive significant freezing damage at the temperatures indicated:West Indian — 28-29o F (-2.2-1.7o C)
Guatemalan — 27-29o F (-2.8-1.7o C)
Hass — 25-29o F (-3.9-1.7o C)
Mexican — 21-27o F (-6.1-2.8o C)



, Like a variety of other common garden plants, avocados do best in a loose, rich soil. These types of soils provide great nutrient content to help the plant grow strong while also reducing the danger of over-watering and allowing for great aeration. For the best growing results, try having a supply of this type of soil (like, for instance, one rich in humus and organic matter) ready to use as a potting medium by the time your avocado's roots and stem are well-established.


To be clear, you do not necessarily need your potting soil ready at the very beginning of the growing process, as avocado pits are started in water before being transferred to soil.

, Like many other common garden plants, avocados grow best in soils that have a low pH (in other words, soils that are acidic, rather than alkaline or basic). For the best results, try to plant your avocado in soil with a pH of 5-7. At higher pH levels, the avocado plant's ability to absorb vital nutrients like iron and zinc can significantly decrease, hindering its growth.If your soil pH is too high, consider using a pH-lowering technique like adding organic matter or introducing alkaline-tolerant plants to your garden. You can also achieve good results with a soil additive like aluminum sulfate or sulfur. For more tricks, see How to Lower Soil pH.

, Getting the pit from a ripe avocado is easy. Use a knife to slice the avocado down the middle lengthwise across both sides, then grab and twist to separate the halves. Dig the pit out of the half of the fruit that it is stuck to. Finally, wash any excess avocado matter that is stuck to the pit until it is perfectly clean and smooth.


Do not throw the avocado fruit away — try making guacamole, spreading it on a piece of toast, or eating it raw as a delicious, nutritious snack.

, Avocado pits shouldn't be planted directly into the ground — instead, they need to be started in water until their roots and stem are developed enough to support the plant. An easy way to suspend your pit in water is to stick three toothpicks into the sides of the pit and place the pit so that it sits in the rim of a cup or large bowl. Do not worry — this does not hurt the plant. Fill the cup or bowl with water until the bottom of the pit is just submerged.


Make sure that your pit is sitting in the water right side up. The top of the pit should be ever-so-slightly rounded or pointed (like the top of an egg), while the bottom, which is in the water, should be slightly flatter and may have a patchy discoloration compared to the rest of the pit.

, Next, place your pit and its water-filled container in a spot where it will receive occasional (but rarely direct) sunlight, like a windowsill that only receives a few hours of sun per day. Once a week, empty the container and refill with fresh water to keep it clean. Top up with more water mid-week if the level drops below the bottom of the pit. Within a few weeks to about a month and a half, you should notice roots begin to emerge from the bottom of the pit an a small stem begin to emerge from the top.


The initial stage of inactivity can take from about two to six weeks.Your pit may not appear to be doing anything, but be patient — eventually, you will see the beginnings of the plant's roots and stem begin to emerge.

, As the avocado's roots and stem begin to grow, continue monitoring its progress and replacing its water as needed. When the stem reaches a height of about six inches, prune it back to about three inches. Within a few weeks, this should lead to the development of new roots and cause the stem to eventually grow into a wider, fuller tree., A few weeks after its first pruning, when the avocado plant's roots are thick and developed and its stem has grown new leaves, you should finally transfer it to a pot. Remove the toothpicks and place the pit roots-down in in an organic matter-rich soil with good drainage. For best results, use a pot about 10-12 inches (25.4-30.5 centimeters) in diameter. Smaller pots can eventually cause the plant to become root-bound, inhibiting its growth if you do not transfer it to a new pot.


Do not bury the pit completely in the soil — bury the roots, but leave the top half exposed.

, As soon as you pot your avocado plant, give it a good watering, soaking its soil gently but thoroughly. Going forward, you'll want to water just enough to keep the soil slightly damp without ever causing the soil to look saturated or muddy.

, Whenever you move a plant outdoors, it helps to expose it to outdoor conditions gradually, or ""harden it off"". Start the pot in a location that gets indirect sun for most of the day. Gradually move it to brighter and brighter areas. Eventually it will be ready for constant, direct sunlight., Once your plant has been plotted, continue with your regimen of frequent watering and strong sunlight as it begins to grow. Periodically, monitor its progress with a ruler or tape measure. When the plant's stem reaches a height of about one foot, pinch off any new leaves growing from the tip of the stem, leaving the others intact. As the plant continues to grow, pinch off the newest, highest sets of leaves every time it grows another six inches.


This encourages the plant to grow new shoots, leading to a fuller, healthier looking avocado tree in the long run. Do not worry about hurting your plant — avocados are hardy enough to recover from this routine pruning without a problem.

, As noted above, growing an avocado tree from a pit doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be able to grow your own avocados within a practical time frame. Some avocado trees can take a few years to start producing fruit,, while others may struggle to produce fruit for much longer or may even never bear good fruit. To speed this process up and ensure your tree produces great fruit, use the technique that professional growers use — budding. To bud, you'll need access to an avocado tree that is already producing good fruit and an avocado seedling that is at least 24 to 30 inches (60 to 75 centimeters) tall.


If you can, try to find a ""producer"" tree that is hardy and disease-free in addition to producing good fruit. A successful budding physically joins your two plants together, so you'll want to use the healthiest plants possible to avoid issues with their health down the road.

, It's easiest to join the two plants together while they are actively growing, and before the weather gets too dry. Get started in spring and expect the process to take about four weeks., Using a sharp knife, make a T-shaped cut on the plant's stem about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters) from the ground. Cut horizontally through about one third of the stem's thickness, then turn the knife and cut about an inch down the stem towards the ground. Use the knife to peel the bark away from the stem.


Obviously, you'll want to avoid cutting too far into the stem. Your goal is to ""open up"" the bark along the side of the stem so that you can join a new limb to it, not to damage the seedling.

, Next, find a healthy-looking bud on the fruit-producing tree you've selected. Remove it from the tree by making a diagonal cut that starts about 1/2 inch (1.2 centimeters) below the bud and ends about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) below it. If the bud is in the middle of a section of branch or twig, rather than at its tip, make a cut an inch above the bud as well to remove it,

, Next, slide the bud clipping you removed from the ""producer"" tree into the T-shaped cut on the seedling. You want the green material under the bark of each plant to touch — if this does not happen, the budding may fail. Once the bud clipping is seated in the slit of the seedling's cut, secure it in its place with rubber bands or budding rubber (a specialty substance available at most gardening stores).

, If your budding effort succeeds, the bud clipping and the seedling should eventually heal together, forming one seamless plant. Following a spring joining, this process usually happens within a month. Once the plant is fully healed, you may remove your rubber bands or budding rubber. If desired, you can also carefully cut the stem of the original plant an inch or two above the new offshoot to make it the new ""main"" branch.


Keep in mind that avocados planted from seed can take 5-13 years or more before they flower and produce fruit., Compared to other plants in your garden, avocado plants may require lots of water. However, it's important to remember that over-watering is a potential problem for nearly all plants, including avocados. Try to avoid watering so frequently or thoroughly that the avocado tree's soil looks liquid or muddy. Use a soil with good drainage (one rich in organic matter is usually a good bet). If your tree is in a pot, be sure that the pot contains drainage holes in the bottom to allow the water to escape. Follow these simple tips, and your plant should be free from the danger of over-watering.


If your plant's leaves begin to turn yellow and you have been watering frequently, this may be a sign of over-watering. Immediately stop watering and begin again only once the soil is dry.

, You may not need fertilizer at all to grow a strong, healthy avocado tree. However, if they're used sensibly, fertilizers can noticeably boost a young plant's growth. Once the tree is well established, add balanced citrus fertilizer to the soil during the growing season according to the directions included with the fertilizer. Do not overdo it — when it comes to commercial fertilizer, it is usually best to be somewhat conservative. Always water after fertilizing to ensure the fertilizer is absorbed into the soil and delivered directly to the plant's roots.


Like many plants, avocados generally should not be fertilized when they are very young, as they can be very susceptible to the ""burn"" that can result from overusing fertilizer. Try waiting at least a year before fertilizing.

, Compared to other plants, avocados can be especially vulnerable to the buildup of salt in the soil. Avocado plants suffering from high salt levels may have slightly wilted leaves with ""burnt"", brown tips where excess salt is accumulating. To lower the salinity (saltiness) of your soil, change your watering practices. At least once a month, try to water heavily, soaking the soil. The heavy water flow carries built-up salts deep into the soil, below the roots where they'll be less harmful to the plant.Potted plants are especially susceptible to salt buildup. Once a month, place the pot in a sink or outside, then let water flow completely through the pot and drain out the bottom.

, Like any agricultural crop, avocado plants can suffer from a variety of pests and diseases that may threaten the quality of the plant's fruit or even endanger the entire plant. Knowing how to recognize and solve these issues is crucial to maintaining a healthy, productive avocado tree. Below are just a few of the most common avocado pests and illnesses — for more information, consult a botanical resource:Cankers — ""Rusty"", sunken sores on the plant that may ooze gum. Cut cankers from affected branches. Cankers on the trunk of the tree may kill the plant.
Root rot — Usually caused by over-watering. Causes yellowing leaves, wilting, and eventual decay even when all other conditions for growth are being met. Immediately stop over-watering and, if severe, dig up the roots to expose them to air. Sometimes fatal to plant.
Wilts and Blights — ""Dead"" patches on the tree. Fruits and leaves within these patches wither and die. Remove the affected areas from the tree immediately and wash the tools you use to do so before using them again.
Lace bugs — Cause yellow spots on leaves that quickly dry out. Damaged leaves my die and drop from the branch. Use a commercial pesticide or a natural insect-killing substance like pyrethrin.
Borers — Bore into tree, creating small holes that may ooze sap. Preventative cure is best — keeping trees healthy and well-nourished makes it harder for trees to be affected. If borers are present, remove and discard any affected branches to decrease their spread.

Create mounds.,
Plant the seeds.,
Watch for sprouts to appear.,
Mulch each hill with a suitable material after the plants have reached a height of about 4 inches (10cm).,
Water less when the flowers bloom.,
Weed regularly.",How to Grow Watermelons2," Using a tractor or hoe, form mounds of earth (hills) to plant seeds in. Space these 2-6 feet (60cm-1.8m) apart, depending on the amount of space you have. Building the soil up at individual planting locations helps assure that the soil is loose enough for the roots to grow, allows oxygen to each them with ease, and lets excess moisture drain away from direct contact with the roots of your plants. It also helps to conserve available moisture in dry weather.

, Form a flat, slightly concave surface on the top of the hill, then poke three or four holes in the soil with a tool or your finger, about 1 inch (2.5cm) deep. Place one to four seeds in each hole, then rake the dirt flat over the top of the seeds, and lightly press the soil to pack it sufficiently to keep the moisture from quickly evaporating around the seed.

, The seeds should germinate and plants will emerge in about 7-10 days, depending on the soil temperature and the depth they are covered when planted. Keep the soil moist around the seeds during the germination period; water close enough so that the water reaches the small roots forming.


When the seedlings grow, thin to the two strongest, to give the strong one room to grow.
Don't let the soil dry out; you should water at least once daily.

, You can choose pine straw, lawn fabric, or compost. Try to apply the mulch as close to the plants as possible to help prevent weeds, to retain moisture, and to keep the soil from being overheated from direct sunlight around the shallow, new roots.


Another option is to lay black landscaping fabric or plastic cloth down after you have made the hills, and then cut holes on top of each hill where you will plant seeds. You can also lay mulch on top of the cloth. This method helps to retain soil moisture and keep weed pressure down.

, After the flowers bloom, water approximately every 3 days if dry. However, don't over-water, as watermelons have a low water requirement.


Keep the foliage and fruit dry. You can place fruit onto a clean piece of wood, large smooth pebble, brick, etc.
On very hot days, the leaves will probably wilt even in moist soil. If this limpness can still be seen in the evening after a hot day, water deeply.
Sweetness in watermelons can be increased by holding off watering for a week prior to harvesting. However, don't do this if it causes the vines to wilt. Once that crop is harvested, restore the usual watering to enable the second crop to come through well.

, Be sure to weed around the base, along and ahead of the vines. Maintaining a thick layer of mulch around the plants can also help to keep weeds down.

To test the ripeness of a watermelon, thump it. A dull noise sounding back means that it has ripened. Also, check the underside––it is ready when it has turned from white to pale yellow.
The curly tendril near the watermelon's stem should also be dried out when it's ready to harvest., Use a sharp knife or garden shears to cut the watermelons cleanly from the vine near the fruit. Freshly harvested watermelons will keep for about 10 days."

, Keep the center hole running through the interior of the cane clear to help keep the bamboo from drying out while the roots are developing.

, Shake the bamboo cutting gently to remove any excess rooting hormone powder.

, Press the soil firmly into place, eliminating any air pockets that may have formed around the bamboo cuttings.

,, Cover the bamboo cuttings with clear plastic and place the growing tray in a sunny location away from direct sunlight, because the heat from the sun will kill the bamboo cuttings.

",How to Water Bamboo," Many believe that since bamboo is drought-tolerant, little water is necessary for the plant. A bamboo plant is unsuccessful if it is not watered enough at first.


The unfortunate experience of killing a bamboo plant occurs within the first year. The lack of water is too much for a plant attempting to establish in a new location. Many bamboo plants are tended in the highest of quality of facilities before they are purchased, and they need time to adjust to a location that is different from their original place of origin.;
, This frequent watering should occur for the first 3 to 6 months when bamboo is being established at a new location.


Drier locations will need much more frequent watering.
Climates with more moisture are going to require less water.
Variations in watering may transpire with different soil types.

, Weather conditions may alter the amount of watering necessary from day to day and week to week.

, It is recommended to layer 2 inch (5.08 cm) to 3 inch (7.62 cm) of mulch to keep moisture contained so that the bamboo plant can be established. Mulch is an ideal climate control for anyone uncomfortable or uncertain when to water the plant.

,


If the soil is dry just below the surface in the spring or summer, the plant needs watering immediately. The soil should be moist at all times at this time because days are longer and temperatures are warmer.
In the winter, the soil can be drier. Temperatures are cooler and days are longer so the plant does not need as much water as compared to the spring and summer time.

,


The plant should be watered thoroughly. The spill of excess water will drain through the drain holes and collect in a saucer or tray below the pot.

, Because it is drought-tolerate, it can be harmed just as easily from over watering bamboo. The removal of excess water ensures the plant is receiving the necessary amount of water but is also not being drowned.

, As a plant becomes deprived of water, the leaves begin to roll up.

Prune or mow the edges of the bamboo.",How to Plant a Running Bamboo," Most types of running bamboo are the hardiest varieties of bamboo that exist, and they need lots of sun to grow well. The area where you’re planting your bamboo should get at least 6 hours and up to 10 hours of sun a day., The area where you plant your bamboo should measure at least 3 ft (1 meter) by 10 ft (3 meters) to accommodate the rhizomes of the plant and allow for their growth. Runner bamboo will grow to fill whatever space it has, so you can also make your planting area larger.Your planting area doesn’t have to be in the shape of a rectangle. An oval or circle also work well for bamboo.
If you’re planting in a container, choose it based on how wide you want the bamboo to grow. You can set several containers next to one another to extend the length of the planting area.

, Bamboo prefers loose soil, so the more you till your soil, the better. Make sure you break up any clumps in the soil. You can also till in a standard potting soil if your soil is a bit dry., You should mix a good top soil with the existing soil down to a depth of about 12 inches. Make sure that the raised bed of soil is raised 6 to 12 inches above the existing soil around the planting area. The natural border this creates, where the raised bed tapers off, prevents the running bamboo from spreading., If you prefer not to create a raised bed, you can plant a bamboo barrier. You should use a barrier that is 22 to 30 inches tall and about 35 mm thick. After you’ve buried the barrier around you’re the perimeter of your planting area, compact the soil next to the barrier. The density of that soil will make it harder for the rhizomes to grow through., The trench should be 8 to 10 inches deep and a few inches wide and should extend all the way around the planting area. This creates a natural barrier and will allow you to see if rhizomes grow out of that area. If they do, trim them with shears., An easy way to contain running bamboo is to plant it in a planter. The planter should be at least 3 feet (1 meter) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) long, but it can be wider and longer if you’d like a thicker wall of bamboo. Bamboo planted in a planter will likely not reach its full height. If you plant in a planter, you’ll also need to divide or transplant the bamboo every 3 to 5 years to ensure it continues to stay healthy.If you decide to plant in a planter, you can follow the same directions as planting in soil – just make sure you place each plant in the center of the planter.

, Anything less than 3 feet will reduce the eventual height of the bamboo plant. Bamboo plants planted 6 to 8 feet apart will take a few years longer to fully grow in., Running bamboo does the best when it’s planted no more than a few inches from the top of the soil. Dig a hole just slightly wider than the plant and a few inches deep., You can use top soil, wood chips, or compost, because bamboo will grow well in most types of organic material. Tilling those materials into the bottom of the hole ensures that the plant can drain and root well., Bamboo requires a bit of water to grow well, so wetting the hole first ensures it grows more quickly. Don’t put so much water in the hole that it starts to create a puddle, but the soil should be pretty soaked.

, The rhizome should be placed horizontally in the center of the hole, a few inches below the hole's surface. Then loosely cover the rhizome with top soil until the hole is full. Make sure you get soil on top of and next to the rhizome to cover it completely.Bamboo grows best in loose soil, so don’t pack the soil in as you would with other plants.

, You should spread the mulch to a depth of 2 or more inches (5 or more centimeters), since this will encourage decomposition under the mulch. The nutrients released by the decomposition process will help the bamboo grow quickly., While bamboo is still growing, it needs a lot of water. If the weather is mild, water your bamboo twice a week or so. If it’s very hot or windy, you might want to water every day. Soak the soil around your bamboo each time you water it., Bamboo plants will lose their leaves during the fall, when they’ll yellow and fall to the ground. Don’t rake these leaves. They’ll eventually decompose into the soil, creating a source of nutrients for the bamboo., If you’ve planted your bamboo near your lawn, make sure you mow the edges near the bamboo planting area frequently. Frequent moving prevents the rhizomes from getting into your grass. If you have a trench dug around your bamboo, check it regularly during the spring to make sure no rhizomes are growing out. If they are, you can trim them with pruning shears."

Water the monkey grass infrequently.",How to Plant Monkey Grass," Monkey grass does not need full sunlight to grow. Too much sun actually harms it. Plant it near or under a tree or bush, or against your house or deck. Pick a spot that is in the shade more than it’s in the sun., If there are lots of weeds in the area you want to plant, pull them out, down to the root. This gives the monkey grass room to expand. As long as you pull most of the weed out, the root system will break up more when you turn the soil over.It’s okay to leave actual plants in the area, because monkey grass grows well alongside other plants.

, Monkey grass needs soil that drains well, so packed down soil needs to be turned over. Use a shovel, hoe, or tiller to mix the soil up and loosen it. If the soil is obviously dry, water it before and during the process of turning it over.If you’ve tilled the area in the recent past, don’t worry about doing it again.

, As you chop the soil up to create better drainage, mix some rotten brown matter compost or manure into the soil. There’s no perfect ratio, but the compost or manure should be less than half of the mixture., Monkey grass goes dormant during the winter months, if you live somewhere with cold winters. After the final thaw before spring, the plant comes out of dormancy. Right around this time is best for transplanting.If you don’t have any monkey grass growing yet, plant seeds to start your monkey grass growth.

, Monkey grass is a multiplying plant, so new grass grows when you replant sprigs of the plant. The clump only needs to be a few inches (about 8 cm) wide to create new growth.You may buy monkey grass in a container at the garden center. In this case, all you’ll need to do is carefully pull the plant out of the container.

, In the prepared soil, use your hands to dig out a divot that’s large enough to hold the root system of the monkey grass. Set the plant into the hole and pack the extra dirt tightly around it., Each clump of monkey grass that you plant will spread and become more grass. When you’re planting multiple sprigs of monkey grass in a row or edge around other landscaping, leave room for the grass to spread out.

Since monkey grass spreads so much, it’s often good to plant it somewhere with defined boundaries so it doesn’t grow out of control.

, Since you planted in a shady area, the soil retains more moisture than it would in full sun. Still, the transplanted grass needs a little extra water to spur it to take root in its new soil. Don’t soak the ground, but make sure it stays moist., Monkey grass goes into dormancy during the winter, but it tends to stay at the length it finished the growing season at. You’ll want to trim the grass down sometime around February, before new shoots come up. Remember, trimming a little earlier is better than waiting too long., For small patches of grass, hand snips are the best option. If the grass is extra long, perhaps a foot (30.5 cm) or more, use a weed eater or even a mower to knock the grass down. Make sure you don’t cut it all the way down to ground level.Adjust the height you trim it to fit your preference. Between one and six inches is the sweet spot. (2.5 cm to 15 cm).

, Monkey grass is hardy, so it doesn’t need much in the way of fertilizer. If you want to spur its healthy growth at the start of the year, apply a long term fertilizer that’s formulated to release slowly. The fertilizer you’ll want is labelled as “slow-release.”, Another benefit of this type of grass is that it doesn’t need consistent watering. Check the grass once a week or every few days, and only water if it seems to be starting to wilt or turn brown. Give it lots of water without soaking the soil when you do choose to water it."

Identify the bamboo you wish to plant.,
Consider the water requirements of the bamboo.,
Consider the sunlight needs of your bamboo.,
Consider the space requirements of your bamboo.,
Prepare the soil.,
Dig the hole for the bamboo to go in.,
Wet the hole thoroughly.,
Being very careful to avoid damaging any soft new shoots or culms the plant might have, take the plant out of its pot and put it in the hole.

,
If the plant had any culms pointing out in an undesirable direction, it is fine to straighten it up to vertical at this point.,
Again, being careful not to break any new shoots, press down firmly on the plant to insure good contact in the bottom of the hole.,
Make a berm to help direct water to stay around the plant.,
Fill the berm with mulch.,
Water the bamboo again to help the different soil layers merge together and connect with the roots.",How to Plant a Clumping Bamboo," If you haven't chosen one yet, consider reading the wikiHow on ""How to Choose Bamboo for Garden or Landscape"" (Coming soon!). If you received an unidentified bamboo from a friend, ask bamboo-friendly nurseries or online newsgroups for help in identifying it. Bamboos have a wide variety of temperature and sun requirements. Some are more or less tolerant of drought or water saturated conditions. Knowing the needs of your plant is critical to your success in growing it.;
, Bamboos typically like as much water as a healthy lawn. Some of the larger species need a bit more. It will make maintenance a lot easier if you put your bamboo near the edge of a stream, or in a location where water is already being handled. However, note that bamboos can not endure being kept soggy. They will not grow in swamp or other saturated areas. The ideal is to have high drainage soil with frequent watering.

, Almost all clumping bamboos will grow well in partial shade. Many of them can be severely harmed by too much direct sun. However, the largest clumping bamboos require full sun to attain their full size. The sun preference of bamboos is typically rated on a 1 to 5 scale where 1 is full shade and 5 is full sun.

, Clumping (pachymorph or sympodial) bamboos are fairly compact. Most varieties will not fill a square meter of ground for 20 or more years. However, the largest of tropical species can put up culms 15cm or more in diameter, and will need an area 2 or more meters around at maturity.

, It is much more difficult to improve soil once the bamboo is planted. Till the ground and mix in as much organic matter as you can afford. Up to half of the soil can be replaced with peat moss or well composted steer manure. Loosen the soil and add organic material to a depth of 30 to 45cm (12 to 18 inches) if you are able.

, Make it about an inch deeper than the soil in the pot it is coming out of.

, It is okay to make a bit of a soupy mess.

,, Then fill in around the plant, making sure to get firm soil contact with the soil and roots from the pot.

, It is okay if the plant ends up a few inches below ground level, as it will self-adjust its depth, and being deep at first will give it some additional shelter in its first summer or winter.

, This should be about twice the diameter of the pot the plant came out of, and 2 to 3 inches high.

, Small bark chips, straw, or grass cuttings make good mulch. However, bark chips usually have a lot less weed seed mixed in with them.

, But let it get to where it is only damp before watering again. Keeping a bamboo too wet is not good for it, and encourages rot.

Amend the soil.",How to Plant Bermuda Grass1," Bermuda grass excels in sub-tropical climates such as the Southern US, South America, Australia, Africa, and India. If you live in a northern region or an area that's prone to high cold or reduced rainfall, consider using a different grass type.There are also more expensive Bermuda grass hybrids that are more resilient to cold.;
, Rent or purchase a tilling machine online or at a hardware store. Roll the tiller over your lawn and lift up existing grass and weeds. This will allow you to plant your Bermuda grass without it having to compete with other grass or weeds in your yard.If you can't get a mechanical tiller machine, you can use a manual tiller to till the soil.
If you have ryegrass in your lawn, you'll have to kill it off because it contains toxins that stop Bermuda grass from growing.You may have to till the soil more than once to remove any baby grass that starts to sprout after you till the yard initially.

, Before you plant your Bermuda grass, you'll want to start with a fresh piece of land. After you've tilled the soil, you'll want to rake away dead grass and leaves so that you have a plot of land that doesn't have any new plant life growing out of the surface., Bermuda grass grows best in soil with a pH of 5.6-7. To evaluate the pH level in your soil, you can get a sample of it tested at your local university's cooperative extension. If your soil is too acidic, you must add lime to amend the soil. If the soil is too alkaline, then you can amend the soil with sulfur to increase the acidity in the soil., Bermuda grass does best in well-drained soil that's high in organic material. Clay soils are not good for the grass. Humus is the generic term used for soil that's high in organic material. You can purchase humus at a home and gardening store or online. You'll want to lay down at least 6 inches of humus before you plant your seeds or lay your sod."

Early fall is perfect because there's enough sunlight and the ground is still warm enough to start germination, but it’s not so hot that the seeds will dry out. Fall typically gets more rain, which is important for freshly sown grass.


Spring is also a good time to sow grass, but it’s important to sow in early spring, before the weather becomes too hot and before people and pets start walking on the lawn.;
, There are thousands of types of grass available that you could grow in your yard. To decide which is best, you'll have to consider the time of year you're planting, your climate, how much daylight your yard gets, and how much precipitation falls where you live.


If you're planting in the spring, opt for a warm-season grass, such as Bermuda, centipede, or carpetgrass.If you're planting in the fall, choose a cool-season grass, such as bentgrass, bluegrass, or ryegrass.
You need to visit a local garden store and talk to a specialist about the best grasses for your region. It is very important to make sure the grass you pick will do well in your climate. You can also check the seed packages for information.

, Before you sow the grass seeds, it is important to make sure that the area is weed-free. Take some time to inspect the area for weeds and pull up any that you find., In the area where you want to grow the grass, use a shovel or tiller to turn over and loosen the soil to a depth of three inches (7.6 cm).Remove any rocks, roots, sticks, or other debris that you come across.


The purpose of tilling or digging is to loosen the soil, aerate the land, and break up clumps. Make sure there are no clumps of soil larger than a quarter.

, Go over the freshly tilled area with a rake to spread out the soil, level off the area, and smooth the surface of the plot. As you rake, amend the soil with two inches (five cm) of aged compost to add nutrients to the area. Use the rake to work the compost into the soil and distribute it evenly throughout the plot.


Amending the soil with organic matter will also provide the ideal soil structure. It doesn’t matter if your soil is too sandy or too clay-like to start, because the matter will make sandy soil more moisture-retentive, and will loosen clay-like soils.
The ideal soil pH for grass is between 6.0 and 7.5. You can purchase pH testing kits for soil at most garden and home stores.
To lower the pH, add some sulfur to the soil as you rake. Granular sulfur is easy to find and used regularly for soil amendment. Depending on the original pH of your soil, you may need anywhere from one to seven pounds (two to seven kg) of sulfur per 100 square feet. Check the directions for specific quantities.
To increase the pH, amend the soil with lime.Granular limestone is widely accessible and easy to use. Depending on the original pH reading, you could need anywhere between 20 and 100 pounds (9 to 45 kg) of limestone per 1,000 square feet. Check the instructions for specific amounts.

, Before you can sow the grass seeds, you need to pack down the soil a little so the seeds and soil won’t just blow away in the wind. Go over the entire area with a weighted lawn roller. This will firm down the soil, break up any remaining clumps, and provide you with a flat and even surface for planting.


Lawn rollers can be rented or purchased from most garden and home stores.
You can also use your own body weight to firm the soil. Simply walk over the entire surface of the garden where you'll be planting. Walk with one foot directly in front of the other to make sure you pack down every inch of soil., It’s important to feed and seed grass on the same day, so amend the soil with additional nutrients before you sow. There are plenty of starter fertilizers available specifically for grass and turf, and these have high phosphorous quantities to help seedlings grow.You can either spread the fertilizer by hand for small areas, or with a spreader for larger areas.
Check the manufacturer’s instructions regarding how much fertilizer to use based on the amount of land you're sowing.

, The soil needs to be just right before you sow the seeds. It should be moist, but not muddy. If the soil is muddy, then wait for it to dry out a little before planting the seeds. If the soil is dry and crusty, then water it a bit to moisten it., For smaller areas, you can spread the seed by hand, but use a spreader for larger areas. The amount of seed you'll need will depend on the size of the area, the type of grass, and your climate, but the average is between 12 and 16 seeds per square inch (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm).To sew by hand, spread half the seed in one direction (horizontally) and the other half of the seed in the opposite direction (vertically) to ensure full coverage.
If you're using a spreader, set the equipment to the proper rate for sowing seeds.

, When you’ve spread the seeds, use a rake to gently go over the surface of the plot to spread the seeds around and cover them with a thin layer of soil.


Don’t bury the seeds more than one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) deep, or they won’t germinate., When the seeds have been buried, go over the area with the lawn roller again to gently pack down the soil. This will ensure the seeds are firmly planted in the soil, and prevent them from blowing away.


The roller only needs to be one-fourth full to provide enough weight to pack the seeds., Mulch will protect the grass seeds, prevent them from blowing away, stop weeds from growing in the area, and help keep the soil moist. Spread about one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) of mulch over the entire area.


Good options include peat moss, straw, compost, or steer manure. Make sure the mulch is a weed-free variety., When you first plant the grass and the seedlings are starting to grow, provide them with enough water to keep them moist but not wet. Then, as the seedlings establish themselves, back off on how much water you provide.


When you first plant, water the seeds three times daily with a light misting of water. Don’t allow the soil to become so wet that puddles form.
After the seeds germinate, water only twice a day.
When the grass reaches the height of one inch (2.5 cm), reduce watering to once a day.
When the grass is fully established and you’ve started mowing regularly, reduce the watering schedule to one inch (2.5 cm) per week., Six weeks after sowing, fertilize the grass again to help it develop strong roots. Look for a turf building fertilizer that’s designed specifically for grass. You can either fertilize by hand or with a spreader.


Don’t fertilize the grass after November, as it should be entering a dormant state during late fall and winter. If you planted too late in the season, wait until next spring to fertilize.
After the first year, fertilize the grass once every spring and again in the fall., When the grass reaches a height of three inches (7.6 cm), mow the grass. Set the blades so they take off no more than an inch from the top. Any more and you may encourage weed growth.Depending on when you planted your grass, you may not have to mow until the following growing season.
For the first few times that you mow, don’t cut the grass down by more than one-third of its height.
Mow the lawn when the grass and soil are dry to avoid tearing up the turf.

, Grass doesn’t like to compete with weeds, especially newly established grass. You can weed by hand to control most weeds. If you're going to use a chemical weed control, wait until you’ve mowed at least four times before treating the lawn.Using a chemical weed control on grass that’s too young can kill the grass as well as the weeds.

, Although the grass will be established about 10 weeks after planting, it will take an entire season before it’s hearty enough to withstand heavy foot traffic.Don’t let animals, kids, or adults play in the area with the newly planted grass until the following spring and summer season.

You'll want to get rid of depressions and hills in your lawn so that the seeds have a nice flat surface to grow on. Fill in any depressions with soil. Remove any large rocks or leftover organic material before laying down your seeds., You can plant the seeds by hand, or you can purchase a broadcast seeder to help you evenly disperse the seeds on your lawn. You'll want to use 1 - 2 pounds (453.59 - 907.18 g) per 1000 square feet (304.8 square meters) to promote a lush yard. Go over the entirety of the soil and try to evenly distribute the seeds., Use a rake to go over the seeds and cover them with soil. Bermuda grass needs to be covered in soil to grow, but too much soil over your seeds will inhibit growth. All of the seeds should be lightly covered with a 1/8 to 1/4 inch (0.31 - 0.63 cm) layer over them., Immediately after planting the grass, you should thoroughly water your yard so that the soil remains moist. Afterward, continue watering the yard daily. After watering the lawn, stick your finger in the soil to see if the top half inch (1.27 cm) of the soil is moist.While Bermuda grass is a drought-tolerant grass, it requires a lot of water at first for the seeds to germinate.

, If you haven't done a soil test to evaluate the surrounding soil, you can lay down a complete (N-P-K) turf-grade fertilizer with a 3-1-2 or 4-1-2 ratio. Purchase the fertilizer online or at a hardware store, then sprinkle it over your lawn. Bermuda grass will take 10-30 days to germinate under ideal conditions."

Before laying your sod, you'll need to know how much square footage of sod you'll need. Use a tape measure to measure your lawn and deduct areas where grass won't grow, like driveways or blacktops., Irrigating your lawn with 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.63 - 1.27 cm) of water the night before you plant your sod will prepare the area and will promote the healthy growth of your Bermuda grass. Water should not pool on top of the dirt, but it should penetrate into it.If water pools on the surface of the dirt, it means you've watered it too much.

, Find the longest straight edge of your lawn and begin to lay down the sod. Roll out the sod, dirt side down and continue to push it until it's flattened out. Continue to lay down the sod, edge to edge, until the lawn is completely covered., If you come across an area where the sod doesn't fit, like a driveway or fountain, you can use a shovel to trim around the sides., Continue to lay out the sod in rows so that each row of sod touches the next. If you lay your sod rows too far apart, there will be holes in your lawn., Immediately after laying out all the sod, you'll want to water it thoroughly. Then, to maintain it, you should continue to water it every day in the morning. Keep foot traffic off the sod for at least a week after laying it to promote the health of your grass.

If you water sod evening, it will be more prone to fungal infections during the night.

Choose the right time of year.,
Choose the type of rye seed.,
Fill in your soil as needed.,
Add fertilizer to the soil.",How to Plant Rye Grass1," It’s crucial that you plant your rye grass during the correct season so that it germinates properly. The air temperature should reach between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 24 degrees Celsius) during the day. It’s best to plant rye seed when the temperatures reach that point but may begin to fall in a few weeks (planting rye seed before it starts getting hotter can cause the rye to die)., Rye seed comes in two versions – annual and perennial. The annual seed does not germinate as well as the perennial, which means you’ll need to use more of the annual variety to get the same lush look you could achieve with the perennial. You also have the option of using sod, which is pre-grown patches of rye that you purchase from a nursery and then lay over your prepared planting area., Whether you are seeding or sodding rye grass, you’ll need to fill in the existing soil so that it reaches the correct depth for your rye grass - about 4 to 6 inches (9 to 12 cm). You can use topsoil to fill in low areas, but the composition should have less than 20% clay, and it should not contain any herbicides., This will give the soil the nutrients necessary for your rye grass to grow well. Phosphorous and potassium fertilizer are your best options for use with rye grass."
"
Till the soil for new growth.,
Mow the existing lawn if necessary.,
Use more annual seed.,
Divide the seed in half.,
Rake the seed into the soil.,
Water the seeded area immediately.",How to Plant Rye Grass2," If you’re planting rye seed on new soil, it needs to be tilled. This allows oxygen to get into the soil. It also breaks up clumps of soil, allowing the rye seed to germinate. Evenly till the soil to ensure even growth of your rye seed., This is crucial if you’re growing rye grass in an area that is a permanent lawn - that has other grasses or plant growth during other times of the year. Mowing the existing lawn as short as possible will give the rye seed more room to take to the ground., If you’re using the annual variety of rye grass seed, you’ll need to spread more than you would with the perennial variety. You generally need 15 to 20 lbs (7 to 9 kgs) per 1000 square feet (9.5 square km) when you’re using annual seed.Perennial seed should be spread at 10 lbs (5 kgs) per 1000 square feet.
These amounts apply equally to overseeding an existing lawn and seeding new soil.

, You should divide the amount of seed that you need to use in half. Spread one half of it in one direction, and then spread the second half of the seed perpendicular to your first planting direction. This will help ensure an even spread of your seed.Depending on the size of your lawn, you may want to use either a push spreader or a hand spreader to spread the rye seed. Hand spreaders are typically used for small lawns that have large amounts of detail, while push spreaders may be best for larger lawns or new soil with larger open areas., Using a metal rake, rake the seed into the soil to ensure most of it gets into the soil (rather than lying on top). Rake gently - you don't want to move the seed around too much, and you don't want to damage the soil.If you're overseeding an existing lawn, it might be hard to rake the seed into the soil. If you can't rake an existing lawn, that's fine. The existing growth - even if it's short - should ensure the rye seed isn't disturbed.

, Once you've spread the seed, water the seeded area until it's moist. This will soften up the soil and make it easier for the rye seed to take root. It will also help the rye seed sink into the soil."
"
Purchase fresh sod.,
Moisten the soil.,
Stagger the sod pieces.,
Stake sod on a slope.,
Fill in cracks between sod with fresh soil.,
Use a roller to water the sod.",How to Plant Rye Grass3," The sod you use for planting rye grass should be cut no more than 24 hours before you plan to plant it. If you can’t plant the sod right away, store in a cool, dark place so that it doesn’t dry out., The soil you lay the rye grass sod on top of should be slightly moist. This will help the sod begin to take root. It also ensures that your rye grass sod doesn’t dry out., The sod will root best if it’s laid in a staggered placement. This means that the seams of the sod pieces should not line up exactly. Lay one row, then stagger the second row so that the seams from the first row touch the middle of each piece in the second row.You may have to cut down the sod to ensure it fits into smaller spaces or staggers properly. Use garden shears to gently cut the sod pieces down to size. The sizing doesn't need to be exact since you can fill the spaces in with soil, but it should be pretty close.

, If you’re sodding a new rye grass lawn on a slope, lay the soil out as you would on a flat surface. Then stake it with garden stakes so that the sod stays in place until it takes root., This prevents the edges of the sod from drying out. It also helps the sod take root in a uniform manner, without space in between, giving your lawn a smooth look., Once you’ve laid the sod and filled in any cracks, water it with a garden roller that is about one third full. This also helps smooth out the sod and soil and will contribute to a smooth lawn."
"
Water your lawn frequently.,
Apply a high nitrogen fertilizer.,
Mow your grass frequently.",How to Plant Rye Grass4," Until the rye grass takes root – about three days for sodded rye grass and two weeks for seeded rye grass – water your lawn two to three times a week. Your grass should be moist but not saturated. When puddles begin to appear after you water, you can cease watering regularly and proceed only as needed., Applying a fertilizer high in nitrogen helps the rye grass grow. It’s also great if you’ve overseeded an existing lawn and will be using it later to grow vegetables., Rye grass grows very quickly, which means you’ll need to mow your lawn a few times a week. You should set your mower blade to a high setting."

Water deeply and immediately.,
Water sparingly.,
Fertilize the grass.,
Prune established pampas grass.,
Drain the leaves.,
Cover the roots.",How to Grow Pampas Grass," Your grass will need lots of sun, and only a small amount of water, so planting in fall or winter months could hinder your grass’s growth.Because pampas grass grows so large, it grows better outside in the lawn or garden, rather than in containers. Due to its size and also the sharpness of its leaves, it does not make a good indoor plant.;
, You’ll want a spot with plenty of room as pampas grass grows tall as well as spreads wide. Choose an area with full sun to partial shade. Locations receiving at least 6 hours of sunlight daily are best for maximum growth.This grass can grow to be over 10 ft (3 m) tall. It makes for an excellent natural fence.
Do not place pampas grass near roadways or driveways; the tall and bushy grass can interfere with lines of sight.
The plant should also not be placed too close to central air conditioning units as the long leaves can become caught in the fans.
Pampas grass leaves have sharp edges, so avoid planting in an area where young children play.

, Pampas grass grows best in areas with well-drained, fertile soil. Till the soil to aerate it then add an organic compost, peat moss, or manure to help fertilize the grass. Choose a loamy variety to ensure the soil will drain well., If you’d like to plant seeds rather than young plants, sow them directly onto the prepared soil. They need light to germinate, so don’t cover them with soil. You can, however, rake the area lightly to prevent the seeds from blowing away or being eaten by birds. Water very lightly to ensure the seeds don’t wash away.Seeds take between 20 and 25 days to germinate.

, Alternatively, you can plant young pampas grass instead of starting with seeds. Starting with young plants helps your pampas grass establish itself as well as grow quickly. You can find young pampas grass plants at many nurseries, garden shops, and even hardware stores. If you can’t find it locally, order it online.

, Using a shovel, dig holes that are three times as wide and three times as deep as the root system on your young pampas grass plant. This will give the roots room to spread and establish themselves. This species grows rapidly, so you’ll need to place holes at least 6 ft (1.8 m) apart if planting multiple clumps of pampas grass., Use your hands to gently separate the root ball. This will help your roots take hold in the soil as well as absorb moisture more easily., Gently position the plant so that it is upright in the middle of the hole. Backfill the dirt around the plant. You can add sand to the soil if your chosen area does not drain well. Gently pat down the dirt or sand to ensure the plant is placed sturdily.

, Give your newly-planted pampas grass lots of water to ensure the soil is seated and that the plant will take root. You should keep the soil evenly moist until your pampas grass has established itself., Pampas grass can thrive in many conditions, and will adapt to its location. You need only water the ornamental grass once every couple of weeks for the first year of growth. Water more frequently during periods of extreme drought. No watering is needed after the plant is well established., During the first year, fertilize up to three times. After the first year, fertilize only once per year. Use a high-quality garden fertilizer to enhance the beauty of the flowers.It may take up to three years for your pampas grass to flower., Use trimmers to prune your grass in the late winter or early spring months. You can also tie a piece of rope around the plant, about 4 ft (1.2 m) from the ground and use a power weed trimmer to cut the grass. Remove all the foliage and flower stalks above 12 in (30 cm) in height.Be careful and wear long sleeves and gloves when pruning and handling your pampas grass plants as the edges are sharp.
Cut through the clumps after pruning to divide them. The sliced clump can then be planted elsewhere.

, Tie the leaves of the grass together with string in November to allow water to drain from the plant. This will prevent shock during the cold months., If you live in an area where temperatures dip below freezing, you’ll want to put straw or mulch over the roots of your pampas grass before frost season. Alternatively, you can cover the roots with a fleece wrap."

Research the type of grass that grows best in your region.,
Decide what type of grass will grow best in your yard conditions.,
You can buy grass seed at garden stores or online.",How to Grow Grass from Seeds1," Most grasses are either cool season grasses or warm season grasses. It's important to find out which kind of grass grows best where you live to ensure a healthy lawn all year round.


Cool season grasses prefer areas with cool summers, and grow best in spring and fall when temperatures are between 60 and 75ºF (16–24ºC). They often turn brown and dormant in summer, but if properly watered will return again and may retain some color even in winter.Cool season grasses include the following:

Kentucky bluegrass, is a fine, dark green grass that grows well in shade.
Tall fescue, a low maintenance grass,is coarse.
Perennial ryegrass grows well in full sun. It is medium-textured.


Warm season grasses thrive in warm climates, from the southern U.S. down to tropical zones. Planted in spring, they will wait until summer temperatures of 80 to 90ºF (27–32ºC) to really take off, then go dormant as the weather cools.Warm season grasses include the following:

Bermuda grass likes full sun, not shade. It is fine-textured.
Zoysia grass is a medium-textured grass that is hardier than most warm-season grasses during winter.
St. Augustine grass is a coarse grass that cannot survive cold winters.

;
, The conditions in your yard will affect the health of your grass as much as the climate in your region. Hundreds of seed varieties have been developed to grow in specific environments. Consider the following variables when choosing a type of grass:


Does your yard have good drainage? Or does it dry too quickly? Some seeds are engineered to survive waterlogged soil. Others are drought-resistant.
Does your yard have abundant shade or full sun?
How much foot traffic does your lawn get? Some grasses hold up well to high foot traffic, while others have trouble recovering if trampled.
Is your grass for decorative purposes, or do you want to walk on it with bare feet? Some grasses are beautiful but coarse. Others are soft, perfect for lounging outside.
How often do you want to mow your lawn? Some grasses grow quickly, and need to be mowed every week while others can be left alone longer.

, Buy from a reputable source.


Calculate how much grass seed you will need. Each kind of seed provides a different amount of coverage. After you calculate the square footage of the area where you're planting grass, talk to the salesperson at the home / garden lawn care store. Ask how much seed you will need to buy.
Some seed sellers provide online grass seed calculators.

"
Till the top layer of soil.,
Level the ground.,
Fertilize the soil.",How to Grow Grass from Seeds2," For best results, break compacted soil up into a loose, even texture that holds moisture well but drains easily.If you have a large area to cover, buy or rent a soil tiller to break up the soil. If you have a small area to cover, use a garden rake or hoe instead.


As you till, break up large clumps of dirt so that the soil is fine and even.
Remove rocks, sticks, and other debris from the lawn.
If you're adding seeds to a lawn with bare patches, use a tiller or garden rake to break up the soil. Mow the rest of the lawn as short as possible.
Don't wait too long between raking and planting. If the churned up soil hardens into a crusty or lumpy texture, you may need to rake it again., If there are spots in your yard where water pools when it rains, they need to be leveled out. Seed planted there won't survive long. Level the ground by adding topsoil to low areas. Run the tiller over the area to even it out and blend it with the surrounding soil.

, Grass grows significantly better in fertilized soil. Buy a fertilizer specifically made for newly planted grass.

"
"
Scatter the seed.,
Protect seeds with topsoil or mulch.,
Water the seeds.,
Keep people and pets off the new lawn.",How to Grow Grass from Seeds3," For large areas, rent or buy a lawn spreader or a mechanical seeder, which shoots grass seed evenly across the lawn. For small areas, spread grass seeds by hand.


Use the amount of seed recommended by the lawn care expert at your home and garden store. It is important to use the correct amount of grass seeds to ensure your lawn grows evenly.
Do not overseed your lawn. Do not use up extra seed by spreading it over the lawn. Overseeded areas will grow thin, unhealthy grass, because seedlings will compete for limited nutrients.

, Newly planted seeds need to be protected from the elements until they take root. A thin layer of topsoil will help, but it's best to use a loose layer of mulch to help retain moisture.You can distribute this by hand or with a cage roller.


Yellow grain straw is a popular choice, since it's cheap and easily broken up by the mower once your lawn is established. Avoid hay, which has too many seeds, and fresh pine straw, which slows grass growth. (Aged pine straw is fine.)Other forms of mulch will also work, but apply dense materials such as compost or sawdust in layers no thicker than ¼"" (6 mm)., Set your garden hose head to the ""mist"" setting and lightly water the seeds until it is thoroughly damp. For a larger lawn, run a sprinkler in the center of the area for a few minutes.


Don't use a powerful stream of water, or you will wash away the grass seeds.
Newly planted seeds should be watered lightly every other day until the grass sprouts., Protect the newly planted seeds from trampling for the first few weeks. Consider putting up a sign or using a string or flags to cordon the area. If pets and other animals run loose, consider putting a temporary fence to protect the lawn from harm.

"
"
Gradually reduce watering.,
Mow the grass.,
Fertilize the lawn.",How to Grow Grass from Seeds4," As your grass becomes established, it will need less and less water (allowing for weather). It's typically best to continue watering lightly every other day for a week or two after the grass blades appear. You can then gradually reduce the watering schedule until you are watering only once a week.You can also increase the amount of water per session at the same time, until you are providing enough water to make the soil soaked, but not soggy.


If the grass starts turning brown or looking dry, quickly water to revive it.
Don't water your lawn after heavy rain or it could become waterlogged.

, Mowing grass encourages it to grow thick and healthy. If it grows too tall, it will get reedy and tough. Mow when the grass is 4 inches (10.2 cm) tall.Grass clippings in the yard act as a natural mulch to aid stronger grass.
Consider a push reel mower instead of a power mower. Push reel mowers are better for the health of your grass because they snip it neatly unlike power mowers which tear and shred it, making it more susceptible to disease. Plus, push reel mowers do not emit pollution.

, After six weeks, when the grass is healthy and tall, give it another application of fertilizer specifically made for grass. This ensures healthy growth for the rest of the season. Fertilize your lawn at the beginning of each growing season.

Rinse the wheatgrass.,
Place the wheatgrass in a juicer.,
Enjoy a shot of wheatgrass.",How to Grow Wheatgrass at Home," Wheatgrass seeds are also called hard winter wheat seed or wheat berries. Buy a bag of seeds online or at a health supply store. Look for organic seeds from a reputable source to make sure the seeds haven't been treated with pesticides and will grow into healthy, vibrant grass., Before the seeds can be soaked and germinated, they need to be measured and rinsed.


Measure out enough seeds to create a light layer on the seed tray you use to grow the grass. For a 16"" x 16"" tray, use about two cups of seeds.
Rinse the seeds in cool, clean water using a colander with very small holes or a strainer. Drain them well and put them in a bowl.

, Soaking the seeds initiates germination. By the end of the process, the seeds will have sprouted small roots.


Pour cold water, preferably filtered, into the bowl of seeds. Add about three times as much water as you have seeds. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and place it on the counter to soak for about 10 hours, or overnight.Drain the water from the seeds and replace it with more cold, filtered water - again, about three times as much water as you have seeds. Let it soak for another 10 hours.
Repeat the process one more time, for a total of three long soaks.
By the end of the last soak, the seeds should have sprouted roots. This means they are ready to plant. Drain them and set them aside until you're ready to plant them.

, Line the seed tray with paper towels, to prevent the wheatgrass roots from growing through the holes in the bottom of the tray. Spread an even one-inch layer of organic compost or potting soil in the seed tray.


If possible, use paper towels that have not been treated with chemicals or dyes. Recycled, chemical-free paper towels are available at health food stores.
Use pre-moistened compost or potting soil free of pesticides or other chemicals. It's important to use organic soil to get the most benefit from your wheatgrass.

, Spread the seeds in an even layer across the top of the compost or potting soil. Lightly press the seeds into the soil, but don't completely bury them.


It's fine if the seeds are touching each other, but make sure there's not a pile of seeds in one area. Each seed needs a little room to grow.
Water the tray lightly, making sure each seed gets a sprinkle.
Cover the tray with a few moistened sheets of newspaper to protect the seedlings.

, It's important to make sure the seeds don't dry out in the first few days after you plant them. Keep them damp as they root themselves in the seed tray.Lift the newspaper and water the tray thoroughly in the morning so that the soil is wet, but not completely waterlogged.
Use a spray bottle filled with water to lightly mist the soil in the evening before you go to bed, so the seedlings don't dry out overnight. Spray the newspaper, too, so it keeps them wet.
On the fourth day after planting, remove the newspaper to prevent the seeds from sprouting under it. Continue watering the sprouted grass once a day.

, Direct sun will damage the grass, so make sure it is always in a shady place in your home.

, Once the shoots are mature, a second blade of grass will begin growing out of the first shoot. This is called ""splitting"" and means that the grass is ready for harvesting.At this point the grass should be about six inches tall.
Grass is usually ready to harvest after 9 or 10 days of growth.

, Use a scissors to harvest the grass by clipping it just above the root and collecting it in a bowl. The harvested grass is ready to be juiced.


Harvested wheatgrass keeps in the refrigerator for about a week, but it tastes best and provides the most health benefits when it's harvested right before you plan to juice it.
Keep watering the wheatgrass to produce a second crop. Harvest that crop once it's mature.
Sometimes a third crop comes up, but it's usually not as tender and sweet as the first one. Empty the seed tray and prepare it for another batch of seedlings.

, It takes a lot of wheatgrass to make just a few shots of wheatgrass juice. If you plan to make wheatgrass a part of your daily diet, you'll need more than one tray of seedlings growing at a time.


Time the growing and harvesting cycle so that you have a new batch of seeds soaking while the previous batch is in the process of taking root. If you have two or three seeds at various stages in rotation, you should be able to produce enough wheatgrass to have a shot of juice every day.
Wheatgrass is a beautiful bright green color, and adds a natural touch to your kitchen or sunroom, wherever you choose to grow it. Consider growing wheatgrass in a decorative container and surrounding your wheatgrass with other plants, so that you can enjoy the beauty of wheatgrass as well as its health benefits.

, Since the wheatgrass was grown from organic seeds in organic soil or compost, it doesn't need a heavy washing. Give it a light rinse to wash away any debris or dust it may have collected from the air.

, Special wheatgrass juicers are designed to make the most of this fibrous plant.


Avoid using regular juicers, since wheatgrass can clog them and cause them to break.
You can use a blender if you don't have a juicer. Once the wheatgrass is completely blended, use a strainer to take out the solids.

, You only need a few ounces of wheatgrass juice to feel the effects of its powerful mix of vitamins and minerals.

Treat the lawn as normal.",How to Plant Fescue," Fescue grows when the soil temperature is above 60° F (15° C). The air temperature will be between 70-80° F (21-27° C). The ideal climate occurs in spring before the temperature starts to climb for summer. It also occurs again in autumn as temperatures fall.Planting fescue in fall is the best bet for a healthy lawn.;
, Fescue does best in slightly acidic soil. Get a testing kit from a garden center before planting time. Perform the test before planting so you don’t waste time and money on a disappointing growth. The proper soil for fescue has a pH between six and seven.Treat acidic soil with garden lime. Treat alkaline soil with compost or other soil conditioners.

, Unless you are reseeding a fescue lawn, get a weed killer that lists glyphosate on the label. Glyphosate will kill all plants, including grass. Spray the weed killer over the area once or twice to remove all vegetation.When reseeding, you may try a gentler herbicide safe for grasses. To protect the fescue, it is better to mow or pull out the weeds by hand.

, Get a garden tiller or tractor tiller. Move back and forth from one side of the planting area to the other. The tiller should reach six inches (15 cm) deep, and you may wish to go back over the area a second time to make sure the soil is turned enough. Finish by leveling the soil with a rake.Rent a tiller from a home improvement store if you don’t have one.

, Fertilizer can be added before or after you lay the seeds. Choose a starter fertilizer, which provides a balance of nutrients for a new lawn. Fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and include phosphorous and potassium are best for the fescue., You’ll need about five pounds (2 kg) of fescue seed for every 1,000 square feet (93 square meters). Use a seeding device or spread the seeds evenly over the area by hand. Don’t be afraid to spread plenty of seed over the area. This will ensure the lawn looks full once the fescue has grown., Go back over the area with a rake. Drag the rake over the entirety of the soil’s surface to mix in the seeds. A hand roller may also help you smooth out the area., Use an irrigation system or a hose to cover large areas of fescue seed. Apply about an inch of water (2 cm) so that the top inch or two of soil stays moist. This should be done once a week to keep the soil moist until the seeds sprout., Get mulch such as wheat straw or paper straw. You’ll need about 60 to 80 pounds (27-36 kg) per 1,000 square feet (93 square meters). Spread the mulch so it forms a light covering over the soil. Mulch helps the soil retain moisture, causing the fescue to grow faster., Cut the existing fescue down to size so that new seed reaches the soil. Set the lawnmower to cut the grass one to two inches (2-5 cm) high. Remove any lawn clippings with a rake., Rent a core aerator from a garden center. Move up and down the area, applying the aerator every step or two. Pass over the area from side to side, repeating the process. Pull up soil with the aerator until you have about ten holes for every square foot (1/10th a square meter)., You’ll need about three to five pounds (1.3-2.2 kg) of fescue seed per 1,000 square feet (93 meters). Spread the seed over the lawn, making sure to cover the areas that look thin. Overseeding the lawn is a plus and will lead to a thicker lawn., Raking the area will help get the seeds safely into the soil. A hand roller is also useful and will even out the soil without damaging the grass. In a pinch, an object such as a piece of carpeting or chain-link fence will also work. Drag it along the area to smooth the soil., As time passes, continue mowing the lawn as necessary to about three inches (8 cm) tall. Add nitrogen-rich fertilizer as needed to encourage growth. Also, keep the soil moist. Give the fescue up to an inch (2 cm) of water a week."

Divide well-established clumps if you wish to move it to other parts of the garden.",How to Grow Japanese Blood Grass," Moisten it - the plant loves moist, wet soil provided it is always well-drained. This grass is happy in full sun or part shade.;
, Be sure not to crowd it out with other plants, to allow it to spread well. Plant about 30 centimeter (11.8 in) - 45 centimeter (17.7 in) / 12"" - 18"" apart.

, Japanese blood grass looks excellent edging garden beds or paths. It also works well next to ponds, water features and streams. If you want it to be a feature, tone down the plants around it; if it is to serve as a backdrop, plant a lot of blood grass together.

, It looks it most brilliant when the sun is able to back light it. Watch places in your garden for a week to work out where this will happen regularly.

, Don't over-water. Apart from that, it does not need much maintenance attention.

, Healthy, vibrantly growing clumps can be divided and planted elsewhere in the garden during spring, as needed.

Use a skewer or chopstick to open and rough up the top part of the peat pellets.

,
Put only one seed in the middle of each pellet.,
Add a small amount of “seedling mix"" type potting soil over the top of your seeds.,
Put the mini greenhouse in a location where it will get medium shade.,
Check on the greenhouse daily, as the peat pellets can dry out quickly once the water from main soak evaporates.,
You may see a sprout within 10 days from planting, though the bulk of germination will occur after at least 15 or 20 days.,
If any of the sprouts get tall enough to touch the plastic dome lid while others are still getting started, prop the lid up as necessary to prevent the leaves from touching it… Any leaves resting against the lid will quickly rot and risk killing the seedling.

,
After about 30 days, most of the seeds that are going to sprout with this method will have done so.,
Mix a good potting soil with about 50% small bark-chip mulch.,
Put a little (1/2 inch or 1 cm minimum) of this potting mix into the pots.

,
Move each pellet that has a sprout into a pot and fill around it so that the pellet is buried at least ¼ inch below the potting soil.

Put all of the pellets back in without the liner.,
Fill in around the pellets with seedling mix type potting soil, and mound it up to cover the top of the pellets by about ¼ inch (5mm).

,
Place this tray outside in the medium to full sun, checking it daily to keep it damp but not too wet.,
Hopefully, you will see a whole new set of seedlings start to come up over the next few weeks.",How to Grow Bamboo from Seed," ""Jiffy"" makes one that holds 72 pellets and costs about $5 US. Nurseries or garden supply stores may have other options too.;
, Bring a pot of water to a boil and pour the water slowly over them to expand them. Boiling water not only works better to expanding them, but will have some sterilization value to lessen the rate of seedling failure. Repeat this step until you have all the pellets you need ready.

, Depending on how wet they got, you may need to leave the top off for a couple of days to let them dry out a little. Sogginess is not good, and the pellets hold water really well. The ideal is for the pellets to be damp, but not wet.

, Make sure it doesn’t get too hot, as temperatures over 105° F (40° C) can kill your seeds. Cooler temperatures however, will not hurt the seeds, but may delay germination by a few days.

,, Because bamboo seeds are rare and expensive, you don't want to risk having two sprout in the same pellet and have to lose one of them.

, 1/8 to ¼ inch (2 to 5 mm) is enough.

, An east-facing window is good if the weather outside is cold, or a moderately shady area outside if the weather is good. NOTE: Wherever you put it, it should not get too much direct sun. Even a mini greenhouse can quickly get up to seed killing temperatures in hot direct sun.

, Before the seeds sprout, they can survive getting too dry once or so. But as soon as they sprout, they can die in a matter of hours if they dry out. If the peat pellets start getting too dry, use a spray bottle to dampen them again. You may need as much as a whole squirt per pellet to dampen to the interior of the pellet.

, Different species have different germination rates, so don’t get disappointed too soon.

,, Transplant all of the healthy sprouts into 4 US-quart (4,000 ml). (or half-liter) pots using the next few steps. But don’t discard the rest of the seeds yet, as we will jar a few more into action by changing the conditions for them.

, This makes a potting mix with very high drainage that is good for bamboo.

,,, Because of the really good drainage, don’t worry too much about over watering.

, These seedlings are now well on their way. You will likely lose another 10% of them for no apparent reason at all, but the rest will have a good chance at making it to maturity.

, Store it for future use if you want, but these seeds and seedlings have no more use for it.

,, Space them roughly evenly, and keep them the same side up as before… Seeds to the top.

,, Because of removing the dome and the increased sun, expect to need to water nearly every day. It is probably helpful to switch to a regular watering can at this point, as you can give it a more normal dose of water.

, As these start to look ready, take them back to step 12 and get them transplanted.

Choose your stalks.,
Find the nodes.,
Lubricate the bamboo before cutting it, this will make it easier to cut through.",How to Cut Bamboo1," If you are using bamboo for a project, you should generally choose green wood because it’s easier to use. If it’s cold outside, you will want to heat the bamboo stalks so they won’t split.


Put masking tape where you are going to cut. It can stop the wood from splintering. Use a sharp pruner to cut bamboo that is less than 1-inch in diameter. If it’s more than that, you should use a sharp handsaw. Pick one with straight teeth or it will tear the plant’s fibers.
Use your measuring tape, or formal project plans, to determine how wide a piece of bamboo you need. Find bamboo of approximately that thickness, understanding that bamboo does not come in uniform diameters.;
, Most people use or cut the stem of the bamboo plant because this is the part that grows above ground. It usually grows straight.The stems contain nodes that strengthen it. That’s the purpose they serve to the plant. The number of nodes may differ, depending on the type of bamboo. You can find nodes by looking for areas that have two rings positioned closely together. The lower ring of the node is called the sheath ring, and the upper one is called the stem ring.
Most bamboo is hollow inside. The thickness of the wall differs depending on the species of bamboo. One bamboo species is almost solid., It must be cut an angle of 45 degrees between the nodes.


Make sure to work in a room temperature environment with room temperature tools to again prevent splitting.
Mineral oil is often used to lubricate bamboo.

"
"
Pick the right cutting instrument.,
Cut the bamboo stalks.,
Groom bamboo branches.,
Top the bamboo.",How to Cut Bamboo2," If you’re using small amounts of bamboo for something like a small home decorative project, simply roll a sharp knife through the bamboo stalk.


Bamboo can be cut precisely using a fine wood saw or a metal saw. As it is a fibrous material, you should be careful at the end of the cut to avoid splits. Go slow at the end. Take out a relatively sharp knife. Always chop the bamboo diagonally. You can make your cut with shears for bamboo stalks 1 inch (2.54 cm) or less in diameter. For thicker pieces, use a saw.
If the project is larger, you’ll need a table and a very sharp handsaw. Position the part you want to cut over the edge and grasp the stalk on the table. Now, simply saw the end of the bamboo off. It’s also possible to drill through bamboo.
For pieces thicker than one inch, use a fine toothed saw and a stable work area as well as a way to secure both ends of the bamboo (masking tape works great). Then you secure the two ends to the work space and mark where you want to cut and then... cut it. Consider using a clamp on the workbench to hold the stalk. If you wrap the section of bamboo that goes in the clamp with a towel, this will prevent the clamp from marring the surface of your wood.

, Perhaps you want to cut bamboo stalks to put in a decorative vase. This is not very difficult to do.


Take a bamboo stalk, and make sure that it is not diseased or damaged. Find the nodes on the stalk. These look like rings. You want to make sure there are 4-6 nodes.Use a sharp knife to cut the lowest node. Cut at a 45-degree angle, and make sure your knife is sharp enough so the cut is clean and not jagged. Select a joint on the stalk and slice just above it. Everything above it will die.
Take off any leafy shoots from the bottom of the stalks. Don’t forget to water your bamboo stalks, even if you then put them in a decorative vase. Make sure you change the water once a week and don’t put the bamboo in direct sunlight. Do keep it in a bright room, though.

, Let’s say you have a bamboo grove in your yard. It’s important to groom the bamboo so it remains healthy.Bamboo canes usually survive about 10 years. Once they’ve reached the end of that life cycle, it’s a good idea to remove them so new bamboo can grow. You will want to prune the bamboo after the 3rd to 5th growing season.
Pruning works best when it’s not the shooting season. To cut down a bamboo stalk completely, most hacksaws should do the trick. Wear safety gear and take great caution when dealing with sharp instruments. Always cut above a node.Start cutting at ground level. Don’t forget to cut the stump down so no one will trip over it. Generally, don’t remove more than one-third of the canes in the grove. Use a horizontal cut at ground level to remove the dead, damaged stalks., It’s also possible to cut away the upper portion of bamboo. This will create a lusher appearance as the bamboo won’t grow upward anymore.


With the hacksaw, cut about 1.4 of an inch above the node. When you cut the top of bamboo canes, new leaves will grow on the top.
Some people tie the bamboo stalks together with garden twine, and them lop all of the tops off at once so leaves will grow and make the clump look bushy.

"
"
Transplant bamboo stalks to clone them.,
Plant the cane.",How to Cut Bamboo3," Pick bamboo that is younger than 3-years-old to transplant.If you already have a bamboo plant in a pot or in the landscape, it's simple to propagate by cutting sections of the stem and replanting them, a method called culm-segment cutting. The sections of bamboo develop new roots creating a clone of the parent plant. Try to cut from the stalk’s middle. You need at least two full internodes in the middle and two half internodes on either end. Internodes are the section between two nodes.
Cut a bamboo cane into sections containing two to three nodes, the places along a bamboo cane where the leaves grow from. Use a sharp knife to do this. Look for the bamboo to flair out and have a slight division in it to find a node. Cut as many culm sections for replanting as bamboo plants you want to grow. Each section will grow into a new plant.
Add a couple extra to make up for potential loss, rot or failure to set root. Cut the foliage off the culm cutting with a pair of clippers.

, Dig a hole in the ground or fill a 6-inch nursery pot with potting soil. Plant the culm section in the soil with one or two nodes covered. Position the culm cutting so that it is vertical or at a 45-degree angle in the pot or planting bed.


Keep the soil damp by watering when the top of the dirt feels dry to the touch. The best time to transplant bamboo cuttings is in the fall at the beginning of the rainy season. Take advantage of the wet months to get your bamboo cuttings started.
If you plant in spring or summer, keep the culm sections well-watered. Don't let them dry out or the roots are likely to die or simply fail to form. True bamboo is part of a grass family. Keep the bamboo moist, and only transplant bamboo in warm weather.
There is another plant frequently grown as a house plant called lucky bamboo. It's not bamboo at all. Don't get this confused with regular bamboo or your cutting and planting efforts will not work.

Harvest your shoots when they’re 2-4in (5-10cm) tall.",How to Grow Popcorn Shoots," Seriously, you can plant them! While the increased interest in popcorn shoots have lead to more specialized popcorn seeds that are meant for shoot production, you standard popcorn seeds will grow shoots too! In fact, the ones meant for movie night will end up tasting much like the popcorn snack you’re used to, with an added dose of sweetness., More and more interest in popcorn shoots (as opposed to traditional popcorn) has led some seed purveyors to package and sell popcorn seeds specifically for growing shoots. Admittedly, these are preferable to the seeds sold for use as actual popcorn, as they will be free of things like salt, preservatives, and flavoring.These seeds even come in separate colors, though you’re more likely to find the white and yellow varieties, as opposed to the oft-sought red variety.
Do a quick online search for popcorn shoot seeds or visit your local health food store to see if they carry them.
Note that many seed website sell sprouting kits. These will come with everything you need, including a tray and a container to sprout the seeds prior to planting.

, If you get a package of seeds meant to be grown, the package will likely contain information about how much to use, such as one bag for a specifically sized tray. To help establish the correct amount, spread dry seed into the bottom of the empty tray you’ll use to grow the shoots. They should be evenly but densely spread, just barely covering the bottom surface of the tray.As a general guideline, use 1/4-1/3 cup for a 5x5in (13x13cm) tray. Use 1-1 1/2 cup for an 10x10in (25x25cm) tray, and 2-3 cups for a tray that’s 10x20in (25x50cm).
If you’re growing your seeds in a hot, humid climate, you may need to use a bit less seed. While plenty of seeds usually works wonderfully, mold may be more likely to grow between closely-spaced shoots in more tropical climates.

, Place the seeds you’ll be planting in a bowl or jar. Add twice or three times the volume of seeds in water. The water should be neither cold nor hot. Sixty to seventy degrees Fahrenheit is ideal (16-21 degrees Celsius). After mixing the seeds gently to ensure water has made contact with each seed, allow them to sit for eight to twelve hours.As they soak, keep the seeds out of direct sunlight. They don’t need to be in complete darkness, but put them somewhere indoors where they won’t be disturbed and where the temperature is constant.

, After carefully draining the water from the soaked seeds, rinse them in cool (60-70°F/16-21°C) water and drain thoroughly. Then simply place the seeds in your sprouter and set the sprouter somewhere indoors and out of direct sunlight.Light doesn’t matter much to a plant before it has leaves. Temperature does though; keep your sprouter somewhere close to 70°F (21°C).
There are all sorts of manual sprouters, including both jars and bags. Visit a local gardening store or check out your options online., Your seeds are about ready to burst and begin to sprout. You can help them do so by rinsing several times over the next few days. In fact, rinse and drain your seeds every eight to twelve hours with cool water. You’ll likely do about three total rinses and drains before the seeds sprout.Once most of the seeds start showing their roots, they’re ready to plant. Try to catch them before roots are more than a ¼ of an inch (~½ a cm) long.

, In growing vernacular, “medium” refers to the material in which you’ll grow your shoots. Soil is a classic example, and may the easiest to work with for most first time growers. The amount of medium you’ll need depends on the type you choose. Keep in mind that the medium’s job is to hold your sprouts in place and provide them with water.Other medium options for plants like popcorn shoots include ""baby blankets"" and Vermiculite. Baby blankets are actually a pad-like material that can be cut to the shape of the wells in your planting tray. While Vermiculite in particular is great at retaining moisture, both of these options are more expensive than soil, require more particular watering methods, and require the use of fertilizer.

, If you use soil, the amount you use isn’t as important as keeping it wet. The more you use, the more water the soil will hold, and the less often you need to water the plants. However, more soil also means you have to do more careful mixing when you do add water. Essentially, you want all of the soil to be wet, but without water puddling on the surface of the soil.Use your fingers to disperse water throughout the soil when you water the plants.
Mix earthworm castings, which can be found online or at gardening stores, into your soil for added nutrients. Wet the castings before mixing them into your soil, and keep your medium beneath 20% earthworms castings.

, Try to spread the seeds as evenly as possible. Some shoot-growers contend that you don’t want seeds to be touching, but it’s probably okay if they touch and overlap a little bit.If, during your first grow, you have issues with mold or fungus growing between your shoots, use less seeds the next time around. This is more likely in hot, humid climates, where you’ll want to disperse seeds more thinly.

, Use a cover tray, which will be lightweight but impermeable to light, to cover the seeded tray and protect your growing plants from light and moisture. It’s worth using a cover tray that is designed to be compatible with your planting tray; you can purchase them together from gardening stores or online.Note that cover trays have small holes or slits to allow minimal air circulation. This can help prevent mold or fungus.
Keep the tray somewhere indoors with little light and a constant temperature. While 70°F (21°C) is ideal, a slightly warmer or cooler temperature is fine. Consistency is more important.

, Essentially, keep the medium moist, as this will facilitate your plants’ ability to set their roots and grow. This will likely require small amounts of watering once or twice per day. Use a gentle sprayer, such as a spray bottle or a hose handle set very low, and make sure to spray each sprouting plant each time you water.Once you’re sure the roots have set, focus on keeping the medium moist. This no longer requires spraying every plant. In fact, spray water in from the sides to avoid damaging the tender shoots as they grow taller.

, If you want your popcorn shoots to be green, they will need to spend a while in the sun. After three or four days (or when the plants are pushing the covering tray up), move the planting try to a location that receives direct sunlight. Keep in mind that shoots that are grown fully in the dark may be more tender and have a more delicate flavor.Note that you will likely need to water more frequently when the plants are in the sun. Keep the medium moist to help them grow.
If you do not green your shoots, they will stay a pale yellow color once harvested.

, Once you’re ready to harvest, take care not to get the shoots themselves wet for a few hours, as they will store better if the shoots are dry. If you need to water, do so by pouring water directly into the tray. Once shoots are dry to the touch, simply cut the plants at just about the medium’s surface.Store shoots in a sealed container in your fridge. Ideally, use a produce storage bag, as they can extend the shoot’s shelf life. These bags can be purchased online, as well as at some specialty gardening stores.

Decide on a type of bamboo.,
Consult local garden centers for information about the different varieties of bamboo available.,
Prepare the site and soil for bamboo plantings.,
Dig a hole twice as deep and as wide as the container the bamboo currently lives in, and backfill the hole with the prepared soil.

,
Remove the bamboo from the container.,
Keep the bamboo well watered.",How to Cultivate Bamboo,"


While it isn’t necessary to research each of the 1200-plus varieties of bamboo, deciding on clumping or running bamboo should be the first step in cultivating bamboo.


Clumping bamboo will work best for container gardens or small areas.

Running bamboo works best when it’s intended to fill in a large area of a landscape or needed to create a natural fence between properties.

;
,


Local garden centers or specialty bamboo stores will be able to give gardeners specific advice about varieties of bamboo that will do well in their landscape.
These garden centers can also advise gardeners about the level of care and maintenance specific types of bamboo require.

,


In a sunny area that receives shade for no more than a few hours during midday, prepare a loamy soil that has a slightly acidic pH.
A local cooperative extension service can test soil for pH, as can many garden centers.

,, Plant it and all accompanying soil in the prepared hole, filling in the hole with the prepared soil. Keep the soil mixture loose; do not “pack” the soil.

,


While every type of bamboo differs, and a local garden center can give gardeners more specific guidance, most bamboo like lots of water and well-drained soil. Pay attention to the plant. If the leaves start to curl, the bamboo needs more water. Pot or root bound bamboo can develop such a dense root system within a container that the root system can actually be hydrophobic or water resistant. If these root balls are watered with a traditional garden hose the water simply bounces off. The solution to this problem is to water your new bamboo SLOWLY with a trickle for several minutes each. Micro irrigation also works particularly well for all species of bamboo, and can speed up the bamboo growth cycle by as much as 1/3.

Consider harvesting your bamboo.",How to Grow Bamboo," Bamboo plants are typically classified as clumping bamboo, running bamboo, or reeds.


Reeds are rarely planted in yards, if ever, so you can expect to deal with either clumping or running bamboo.
Running bamboo sends out rhizomes, which spread into other areas, causing the plant to become invasive.
Clumping bamboo grows in tight clusters and rarely spreads out over larger areas.;
, Most bamboo varieties do best in tropical climates, but if you live in a somewhat cooler area, there are a few hardier varieties you can attempt to grow with some success.


If you living in warmer hardiness zones, like zones 7 through 10, a few good choices might be Bambusa multiplex ‘Alphonse Karr’, Borinda boliana, and Phyllostachys nigra. The first two are clump bamboo types, while the last is running bamboo.
For slightly cooler climates, like those found in hardiness zones 5 and 6, try the clumping type Fargesia dracocephala ‘Rufa’ or the running type Pleioblastus viridistriatus.

, Bamboo needs a great deal of sun, so you should usually pick a spot in your yard that receives 8 or more hours of sun daily. Note that some tropical species do require shade during the hottest parts of the day, however.


Shade can be especially important during winter. The combination of frost and direct sunlight can dehydrate the plant quickly. As such, if you live in an area that receives frost during winter, you should opt for a spot that receives partial shade instead of one with direct sun., While bamboo can do well in many types of soil, it does best in loam or marly soils. Improve your odds of success by digging and mixing in amendments to the soil before planting.


Work garden compost or manure into the soil to provide it with additional nutrients. Ideally, the compost should be worked into the bottom of the transplant hole so that the bamboo roots sit on top of it.
Loam soil is a mixture of five parts topsoil composted with two parts sand, two parts silt, and one part clay.
Avoid rocky or soggy soils, as well as soils that are relatively impermeable.

, Bamboo has a shallow root system, yet it also grows tall and fast. As a result, it can easily get damaged by strong winds. You will need a barrier to prevent this from happening.


The easiest way to protect your bamboo is to position them behind garden hedges or trees. Otherwise, you might need to build a fence around the area.

, If you are planting running bamboo, you will need to construct a barrier to prevent the bamboo from invading other parts of your yard.


After determining the area in which you want to confine the bamboo, install barriers of sheet metal or concrete around the perimeter. These barriers should be 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) deep., Bamboo grows quickly and needs quick access to warm, frost-free temperatures. Sow the seeds after the final frost of the season for best results.


If you are starting your bamboo plants from seeds, you should start in the very early sprint so that the plants have enough time to establish themselves by summer. If you are transplanting established seedlings, any part of spring is suitable for planting.
You should avoid planting bamboo in the fall, especially if you live in cooler climates, since the plant needs time to harden before cold, drying winds of winter begin.
Conversely, if you live in severely hot climates that regularly reach temperatures hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), you need to plant the bamboo early enough in the spring or in the early fall to avoid the intense heat of summer.

, Bamboo seeds need to be cleaned and dried in the sun for 1 to 2 hours. Afterward, you should soak the seeds in clean water to break them out of dormancy. Soak the seeds for 6 to 12 hours.


Drain the water 10 to 20 minutes before you sow the seeds.

, If growing bamboo from seed, you will likely have better results if you plant the seeds in soil-filled plastic pallets meant for seedling growth.


Fill the seedling containers with a mixture made from 8 parts topsoil, 1 part ashes, and 1 part fine wood chips or rice husks. Filter this mixture through a wire mesh to remove stones and debris before filling the containers.
When filling the containers, leave the soil fairly loose.
Make small holes 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) deep in the center of each seedling compartment. Drop one seed in each hole and cover the seeds gently with additional soil.
Moisten the soil immediately and water daily. Let the seeds grow in an area of partial shade.

, Even though adult bamboo grows quickly, in the early stages, most species of bamboo will not be strong enough to transplant any earlier than this. Transplant the seedlings into small, separate pots or into poly bags filled with a mixture made of two parts manure, three parts soil, and one part sand.


Bamboo seeds usually germinate after 10 to 25 days, and initially, the leaves are very fragile.
It takes 3 to 4 months before the seedlings produce a rhizome, or stem, capable of producing new sprouts. This is the point in time at which bamboo can be transplanted.
Note that if you are transplanting bamboo seedlings instead of growing the plant from seeds, these are the instructions you need to pay attention to.

, This is especially true of running bamboo.


The plants should be transplanted to your yard once they reach 16 to 20 inches (40 to 50 cm) tall. Remove them from their pots or poly fill bags and place them directly into the ground.
The hole you transplant the bamboo into should be roughly twice as wide as the bamboo root mass.
If working with clumping bamboo, you can place them within 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm) since these varieties will not spread out much.
Note that clumping bamboo gains 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm) of height yearly, while running bamboo gains 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) of height yearly and spreads out at about the same rate.

, Most species of bamboo require consistent watering, but you should not let the bamboo roots sit for an extended period of time in excess water.


Bamboo seeds and young shoots should be watered daily during mild and dry weather.
After bamboo plants have been established in your yard, you should water them twice a week during mild weather and three to four times a week during hot or windy weather.

, Organic mulches help keep bamboo growth in check and can protect the bamboo from potential threats.


Grass clippings make one of the best mulches for bamboo since they are rich in nitrogen and silica. Compost and hay can work well, too, as do many other types of organic and untreated mulch.

, Bamboo is a warm weather plant, so you should take extra precautions during winter to prevent the plant's roots from completely freezing.


Apply an extra thick layer of mulch to protect the root systems of the mulch during freezing temperatures.
If cold, harsh winds are a problem, you might need to construct a temporary barrier to shield your bamboo.
If your bamboo takes on a dry look or silver color, this could be an indication of cold injury.

, Organic fertilizers are often recommended, and nitrogen promotes stronger, greener plant growth, so a fertilizer fairly high in nitrogen is usually best.


Apply fertilizer once in the early spring and once in the summer. This schedule corresponds to the main growth seasons of bamboo.
If using an organic and mild bamboo, you can apply fertilizer monthly throughout the spring, summer, and early fall.

, As bamboo spreads, you might need to thin it out to prevent the stalks from crowding into one another and cutting off nutrient supplies.


If you want to prevent running bamboo from spreading and do not have a barrier installed that can do so, you will need to cut new shoots off at ground level as soon as they appear in areas you do not want the bamboo in.
Remove old, unattractive bamboo branches once a year. Trim them back until they look neat.
If you cut bamboo just above a node, it can grow back.

, Bamboo is resistant to most pests and diseases, so you only need to apply pesticide and fungicide after a problem develops.


Some species of bamboo can fall victim to scale insects, red spider mites, and rust.Since adult bamboo is fairly hardy, however, mites are usually only a problem for new shoots.
If you suspect that pests or fungi are a threat to your bamboo, quarantine new plants and spray them with a miticide or fungicide before transplanting them.

, Fresh shoots of bamboo can be used for food, so if you want to add it into your diet, harvest young shoots within the first couple of months.


Bamboo is best when fresh, but you can also can it or freeze it for long-term food storage.
Fresh bamboo has a crisp texture and sweet flavor.
Bamboo is a good source of fiber and is roughly equal to the onion in terms of nutritional benefits.

Cut with a sharp hoe.,
Remove weeds by hand or small tool.,
Learn about post-emergent herbicides.",How to Keep Weeds Out of Your Vegetable Garden1," A sharpened hoe blade allows you to sever the weeds without having to bend over or crouch. Swing the blade against the weed near the base, then leave the weed to decompose.If vegetables are already growing, a thin-bladed ""onion hoe"" may be easiest to maneuver without damaging the useful plants.If the weed already has visible seed pods or seed heads, pull these off before you cut, and discard them in a trash can covered or far away from your garden.
A stirrup hoe helps take weeds out easily. It has blades that run parallel to the ground, making it easy to go along and cut weeds down.;
, Hand-pulling weeds can be a slow process, but is often necessary when weeds sprout too close to vegetables to risk swinging a hoe. This also allows you to remove the roots of large weeds as well as the surface plant, preventing the same weed from growing again.


Using a tool such as a gardening trowel or Hori-Hori knife may make this task easier and reduce strain on your hands. Pruning shears are notoriously un-ergonomic, which can causes problems such as arthritis. When choosing pruners, make sure that they fit your hand well and don't require excessive push to move the blades.
For weeds growing next to small crops, press your fingers down on either side of the weed to keep soil in place while pulling.Removing weeds is easier while the soil is beginning to dry out from a watering. However, avoid walking on or pressing wet soil, which can reduce aeration., Post-emergent herbicides are designed to kill weeds that have already grown. Any type of herbicide should be used cautiously, as they have the potential to kill desirable plants as well, potentially even ones planted in neighboring gardens. Match your herbicide to your type of weed, and check that it does not have any harmful effects on your specific vegetable crops.Use these guidelines to begin your research:


Herbicides containing trifluralin can be used to control grass weeds, but these are banned in the European Union.
Herbicides with sethoxidym, including Poast, can also be used to control grass weeds.Herbicides containing glyphosate, including Roundup, kill many plants, weeds and otherwise, and should only be used in a vegetable garden if the label specifically provides instructions for it."
"
Cultivate the soil shallowly and regularly.,
Apply an organic mulch to reduce weed growth.,
Consider using newspaper as a mulch.,
Research pre-emergent herbicide options.,
Use cover crops outside the growing season.",How to Keep Weeds Out of Your Vegetable Garden2," Whenever you notice weeds start to emerge, use a stirrup hoe, garden tiller, or rake to disturb the soil around their roots. Exposing their roots, especially on a dry, hot day, can cause the weeds to dry up and die. Cultivating further than a couple inches (3-5 centimeters) is not recommended, as it can damage vegetable roots and bring buried weed seeds to the surface.This method will be less effective if the weeds are allowed to grow larger.

, Mulch refers to any material covering the soil surface, which helps block new plants from emerging. Add a 2–4 inch (5–10 cm) layer of dead leaves, seed-free straw, or grass clippings to serve as mulch, but leave bare areas 1 inch (2.5 cm) around each desirable plant to allow air circulation.


Mulch also helps retain soil moisture and heat. As an insulator, it can help keep plants cool in hot temperatures, and warm in cooler temperatures.
Avoid wood chips, bark chips, or sawdust, as they may have lingering effects that prohibit seed growth. These types of mulch may be appropriate for use in area of your gardens without vegetables or other annual plants. If you are using wood then make sure to inspect it for parasites and diseases. You don't want to introduce these to your garden.

, Black-and-white newspaper can be used as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly mulch to prevent weed growth, but it is only effective in certain conditions. This relatively recent practice requires more study, but appears to require well-draining soil, and frequent cultivation as described above. Apply it as you would organic mulch, described above.


Do not use colored ink pages, which may contain toxic materials that can harm the soil and vegetable plants.
In windy conditions, weigh the newspaper down with grass clippings or other material.

, Always research a herbicide's effect on your specific vegetables and nearby plants before using, and select one that targets your type of weed (such as grass or broad-leaf weeds). Here is some information to start with, concerning pre-emergent herbicides to use before the weeds have sprouted:


Products containing DCPA, such as Dacthal, rarely harm most vegetables.Corn gluten meal is sometimes used as organic weed control, applied in a garden with vegetables 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) tall and no weeds present.It is unclear how effective this is compared to other options, but can double as a fertilizer as well.

, Rather than leave your garden bare after harvesting, plant a cover crop to prevent undesirable plants from going wild. Grow a hardy winter/autumn crop such as annual rye grass, buckwheat, or winter rye for this purpose.Be prepared to fertilize and harvest this crop if you go with this plan.A dense crop cover will keep weeds from getting started in your garden. When you cut the cover crop, you can even leave the trimmings in your garden as a green manure.
Look up crop rotation or crop combination recommendations for your specific vegetables, so your soil next year will have the correct nutrients to encourage vegetable growth.

"
"
Build a raised garden bed.,
Reduce plant spacing.,
Use plastic mulch for certain crops.",How to Keep Weeds Out of Your Vegetable Garden3," If you are prepared to use high-quality soil, and water frequently, a raised bed will allow you to keep your vegetables spaced closer together.This makes it harder for weeds to compete, and the raised level may make weeds easier to spot as well.


Plants warm up more quickly in a raised bed. This is an advantage in many climates, but if the climate is on the hot side for your vegetables, consider digging a lowered bed instead., Sometimes referred to as intensive planting, keeping vegetables closer together gives weeds less room to grow. However, spacing is limited by your soil quality, watering frequency, and vegetable variety. You can often plant vegetables a couple inches (a few centimeters) closer than recommended on the seed packet, but it's best to attempt this by planting slightly closer each year, reversing the practice if the vegetables fail to grow quickly and healthily.


Try looking up your vegetable's recommended spacing if using a raised bed.

, Due to the trapped heat in the soil, this method is only recommended for certain vegetables, such as tomato, pepper, eggplant, cucumber, melon, or squash. Lay a covering of black plastic over the soil in your vegetable garden prior to planting. Cut out holes where the vegetable plants will grow through the plastic.


Keep an eye out for aggressive weeds that may continue to grow under the plastic or through the holes for the vegetable plants.
Plastic will not decompose, and must be thrown away after the growing season. Alternatively, you can use black landscaping fabric. This allows water to penetrate down into the soil and is reusable.

There are planting maps available online that show color-coded regions for cool, warm, and transition zone grass.Some grasses, such as fescue, will turn brown and go dormant in order to survive more extreme temperatures. It isn’t dead and will usually come back when the temperature is more moderate.;
, Warm-season grasses, like Bermuda, do best in the summer and spring, but need mild winters to thrive. Consider where you live when deciding which grass to plant or you could end up with a bald yard in certain seasons., Glance over your yard and see how many structures or trees you have that will block out the light. Observe it throughout the day and determine whether your yard is mostly sunny, shady, or a mix of both. Some grasses, like St. Augustine, need full sun, whereas others are more tolerant of shade.Be aware that most grasses will require at least six hours of full sun each day in order to thrive.

, If your soil is prone to becoming waterlogged, look for a grass that grows well in wet conditions. Other seeds, such as Zoysia, have been developed to be more drought resistant and hardy. You can change some of the drainage conditions of your lawn by leveling, but it is still a good idea to start with a seed that is rainfall appropriate., This is really a question of lifestyle. Think about whether or not the grass will be played on by children, used for sports, have contact with pets, or other high use activities. Fescue and KY Bluegrass both do well with heavy foot traffic. If the grass will have little to no foot traffic, then that opens up your options., Measure the length and width of where you plan to plant the grass seed. Then, multiply these two numbers to get your total square footage. This will help you to determine how much seed to buy. Every type of seed provides a different amount of coverage; in some cases one pound of seed will cover 200 square feet, and in other cases it will cover 1,000., Go to your local home improvement store or order grass seed from a reputable source. Getting a blend of at least two different grass strains of the same type, such as Windward fescue and Spartan fescue, will help with disease resistance and hardiness. Check the packaging date on the seed as well., Buy a soil test kit from your local hardware store, county extension office, or online. Collect the required soil samples, mix them with water as directed, and send them off to the address listed. You’ll generally need to wait about two weeks for results, so it is important to do this step well before planting. The test will tell you if your soil has the right pH (acidity and alkalinity) balance to grow grass.Grass will do the best in dirt with a pH that falls between 6.0 and 7.5. If you fall below 6.0, then add some lime to boost your numbers. If you are above 7.5, then some peat moss should lower it.If you are short on time, there are also DIY testing kits available. These kits let you mix water with your soil and a testing capsule to determine the levels of nitrogen, phosphorous, or pH. However, be aware that the reliability of these home tests is often debatable., Make it possible for your yard to get a bit more sun by cutting back or thinning out any large trees. Or, if you decide to plant trees prior to putting down your grass seeds, choose ones that have upright, controlled canopies., You can pull up sod with a shovel, but it will take a great deal of time and may result in a very uneven final surface. Instead, rent a sod cutter from your local hardware store. Run the cutter over your lawn and it will cut away and roll up the existing sod.Some people prefer to kill off their existing sod by applying a non-selective herbicide. The downside to this method is that is can impact the quality of the soil and you’ll have to wait longer before planting for the chemicals to die off.

, Compacted soil can suffocate grass seedlings and prevent them from growing. Use a rotary tiller or pointed shovel to dig up and remove any rocks or debris. Keep going until all of the soil on the surface, and a few inches deep, is marble-sized or smaller.If you are using hand tools, get ones with fiberglass handles as they are less likely to break than wood.

, Add about one inch (2.54 cm) of sand across the entire planting area. Then, do the same thing with an inch of compost. Use the tiller or a shovel to mix everything together. Run a rake across the surface of the ground, filling in any holes that you see until it is level. This will keep water from pooling in any one spot.This is also the time to add in any soil amendments, such as peat moss, lime, sulfur, or a starter fertilizer to the area., Planting in the late summer and early fall generally gives your grass the best chance at survival. Avoid planting when you know a heat wave or frost is about to hit. Temperatures in the mid-70s Fahrenheit (21-25 degrees Celsius) are generally good for both cool weather grass seedlings, whereas warm grasses prefer the mid-80s Fahrenheit (26-32 degrees Celsius)., Add the seeds to a spreader and walk your lawn for application. Use a drop spreader for smaller lawns and a broadcast or rotary spreader for larger areas. The goal is to place between 15 to 25 seeds in each square inch, depending on the grass type. When you are finished take a rake and try to push the seeds about ¼ inch (.6 cm) deep into the soil.Use only as much seed as you need. Over-seeding an area will result in thinner grass, since seedlings will have to fight for nutrients if an area is overcrowded.

, Use a fan or oscillating-style sprinkler to apply a gentle coating of water to the entire planted area. Water for about 10 minutes or so. The goal is to dampen, not saturate, the soil. Repeat this level of watering two to three times per day for the first 8 to 10 days, until the seedlings are initially established., The seeds and sprouts are fragile during the first few weeks of growth, and they won't grow properly if they are trampled by people or pets. Put up a sign or yard flags, rope off the yard with string, or erect a temporary fence to protect it from harm.

, When the grass is over an inch tall, you can water just a few times a week. Aim to water in the evening or morning to avoid evaporation. Adjust your watering schedule depending on the weather. Don’t water right after a storm.Once the grass has sprouted above the soil, reduce your watering to once daily for 15 to 30 minutes.

, When your grass reaches 3.5 inches (9 cm) high, it is time for the first mowing. Adjust your blade so that you only cut off about 1 inch (2.54 cm) of grass. Check that your blade is sharp or you may be tearing the grass out by the roots, instead of trimming it.Consider leaving the grass clippings where they lie, rather than bagging them and throwing them away. The clippings act as a natural mulch and encourage better grass growth.
Never cut more than one-third of the grass height. The blade is needed for photosynthesis and removing more of it can weaken or kill off your grass.

, You can spray a weed killer directly onto the problem areas, but it is even better to simply dig them out yourself. Get a spade and dig to a depth of around 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) around the weed. Remove the soil and weed in one large clump. Wait for the grass to fill in the area., This is the general rule unless you run into extremely high or low temperatures. In that case, wait until the next season to start fertilizing. Use a starter fertilizer with a high ratio of nitrogen. Expect to fertilize between one to four times a year, as directed on the package., Keep a close eye on your grass and note any insects that are present. Some pesticides, such as grub killer, can help stop these infestations if applied carefully and at the right times. Notice if your grass changes color or texture as well. Random brown or white patches can be a sign of fungus, whereas browning often indicates a lack of water."

Cleanse mites from your plants.,
Remedy brown tipped leaves.,Carefully dust the leaves of your bamboo plant to help keep them alive and thriving.",How to Take Care of Bamboo," These are the two main varieties of bamboo. Many of the procedures you'll use to care for your running or clumping plants will be interchangeable among these two plants, but there are some differences you may want to take into account for aesthetic purposes.


Running bamboo has thick canes spaced at regular intervals, much like the stereotypical image of bamboo. Clumping bamboo has thinner canes, a bush-like appearance, and its canes appear to sprout from the same, or nearly the same, location in the ground.
Running bamboo makes for a better screen when planted. Unlike clumping bamboo, which has drooping top segments and a narrow base, runners naturally form a screen with straight, vertical stalks.;
, If you have already planted your bamboo in an area that receives a lot of direct sunlight, you may want to string up a cloth between bean poles or stakes to offer some shade to the plants. Bamboo naturally grows in areas with partial shade, and giving this to your plants will encourage healthy growth., Mulch will help protect the roots of your bamboo from sudden changes in weather, like cold snaps.It will also soak up water for the plant during dry periods. Additionally, it will deter weeds from encroaching on your bamboo plants.


Spread your mulch carefully around young stalks and newly emerging bamboo. Too much mulch can damage the plant or make it difficult to grow.
You can spread mulch freely around the stalks of heartier, more established plants. Leave about an inch (2.5 cm) of free space around your stalks so the roots receive enough airflow., You won't likely need to trim your bamboo until it has grown for a few years and filled in with leaves. Trimming will help your other plants receive more adequate sunlight. This will also remove growths that are unsightly or less healthy, encouraging the overall health and appearance of your plant.


When trimming, you should prioritize branches that look dead, sick, or weak. Most bamboo can be pruned without fear of harming the plant, so you should trim freely to achieve the look you desire in your bamboo., The roots of your running bamboo can easily grow out of control if you're not careful. If your bamboo is growing in an open area, this might not be a problem, however you can easily prevent the roots of your running bamboo from becoming invasive by trimming the roots.


Set a boundary for the roots of your bamboo plant and then dig a narrow trench on that boundary about 1 foot (.3 m) deep. Trim or sever any roots that you find in this trench, and check it regularly for new root growths.
Trimming the roots of your running bamboo will not harm the plant. These roots can usually be found roughly 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep in the soil., The most active season for bamboo growth is spring, so you should begin watering in late winter or early spring. Watering should be done on a weekly basis, and you should continue this watering schedule throughout the summer months., If you are growing your bamboo in loamy soil that drains well, you won't likely have issues with watering. Even so, the best environment for your bamboo to grow in will be moist, without being saturated or dry.You'll be able to tell if your bamboo is not receiving enough water by the curl of its leaves. If you notice leaf curl, continue your watering schedule, adding water in small increments until the leaves relax.
Some types of bamboo will also suffer from leaf curl in overly sunny environments. If you add water to your routine and notice no difference in the leaf curl, this could be an indication your plants are getting too much sun., For plants that are grown in water, you'll want to make sure that the water level completely covers the roots of your plants and maintains a depth of a few inches (5 - 7 cm). To prevent disease, algae growth, and other issues that arise from stagnant water, you should drain and refill the water of your bamboo every few weeks., Fertilizing your bamboo will guarantee it has the nutrients it needs to grow healthy and strong. Fertilizing is especially important if your soil is low in phosphorous, nitrogen, or potassium. These three substances are vital for healthy, strong bamboo.You should add fertilizer to the soil surrounding your bamboo in early spring or late winter. This will ensure your plants have the nutrients needed for spring, which is the most active time for bamboo growth.
If your soil is poor in phosphorous, nitrogen, or potassium, you may need to add small amount of fertilizer periodically throughout the year. You should avoid fertilizing the area around your plants in winter.
Bamboo grown in water will need to be fertilized every few months with a water soluble plant fertilizer. You may want to coordinate your water changing cycles with your fertilizing.You might want to consider using grass/lawn fertilizer for your bamboo plants. This will be widely available at home and gardening stores, and will provide your bamboo with the food it needs., Root rot can happen if you use too much fertilizer or water your plants excessively. You can tell when a plant has root rot by the brown, soft quality at the base of the stalks. When you see this in your plants, cut off the healthy tips and replant these elsewhere.When cutting the healthy parts of your bamboo, try to include two or three leaf-nodes per section. These nodes can be found by looking for a thickening of the stalk. In some cases, these will have offshoots.
Be sure to moderate your watering and fertilizing after this! Root rotted plants can be salvaged, but by moderating your plant care, you can avoid this entirely., These kinds of bugs won't be a problem for your bamboo plants too often, but if you notice a white substance on the stalks of your plants that is sticky, cottony, web-like material, or irregular growths that are shaped like a snail, you may have scale or spider mites!If your bamboo is in a container, you'll need to clean it out with a mild soap. If your potted bamboo is growing in pebbles, wash these in the same fashion. If you're using soil, this should be replaced.
Wipe down each of your plants using a rag dampened with soapy water. A few drops of dish detergent should do the trick. Be gentle while wiping to prevent damage to the stalk, and rinse the plant completely when you are finished., One of the most common causes of this is fluoride burn, which can especially be a problem if you live in an urban environment. The fluoride added to your water supply can cause the tips of your bamboo leaves to turn brown, though this can also be an indication that the air is too dry for your plants.Use distilled water or collected rainwater for your plants for cases of fluoride burn. You might leave a bucket or kiddie pool outside to catch rainwater, or you could build a rainwater collection system.
Dry air can be an issue for your bamboo if you live in an arid or semi-arid region. However, you can restore your bamboo leaves in the dryness by misting your plants daily or every few days in semi-arid climates.You can also wipe down the bamboo leaves with mayonnaise and then wipe the mayonnaise off to give your leaves a fresh shine.

Purchase or make a small cupboard with a door that shuts properly.,
Make a special indoor place to keep boots.",How to Keep Spiders Out of Your Gardening Boots2," Even an old wooden box that is large enough to fit the boots can be turned into a boot storage box by the addition of a door on hinges. Tuck the boots inside this cupboard each time after use and the spiders won't be able to crawl inside.

, The mudroom, laundry or a spare cupboard near the back door can all work as suitable places for storing boots when not in use and thereby reducing the chances of spiders living inside.

Fill a large container with water.,
Add a little dish soap.,
Shake in a spoonful of hot sauce.,
Transfer to a spray bottle.,
Spray in the early evening.,
Reapply regularly.",How to Keep Rabbits out of Your Garden Organically1," A 1 gallon (4 liter) milk jug works well. Warm water will help your repellent mix faster, but cold water works fine too.;
, Squeeze in a little dish soap, about 1 tbsp (15 mL). This will help your mixture stick to your plants. This also causes the repellent to mix through the water, instead of floating on top.

, If you are using a gallon (4 L) jug, mix in 1 tbsp (15 mL) hot sauce. If you have a smaller, 1 quart (1 L) jug, add 1 tsp (5 mL) instead. Close the lid and shake to combine.


Leave the bottle in the sun to speed up mixing., If you have a large garden, you may wish to purchase a large garden sprayer from a home improvement store or gardening store. Otherwise, any spray bottle will do.


Be cautious when using spray bottles that once contained commercial cleaning products. If the label warns against reusing the bottle, it may cause harm to the rabbit, plants, or people who eat the plants.

, Most rabbits feed at night, so spray your plants shortly before the sun goes down. Spray any plants the rabbits have been feeding on. When the rabbits taste the unpleasant substance, they should stop feeding.


If you know where the rabbits enter the garden, you can spray the plants at that border. They may give up and turn around.
Some plants may get ""scars"" on their leaves from this spray. If this happens, spray on the ground around the plant instead.

, Spray the plants again every two or three days. Spray again any time rainfall or heavy dew washes off the mixture. Once there are no bite marks on your plants, the rabbits have learned their lesson and you can stop spraying those plants. This may take a few weeks, but in the meantime the rabbits shouldn't be eating enough to cause damage.

Pick a switchgrass variety.,
Choose a spot that will accommodate its height.,
Look for a sunny spot.,
Don’t worry about the soil condition.,
Consider planting in a container.",How to Plant Switchgrass1," If you look for switchgrass at your local nursery you may just find a plant that's labeled ""switchgrass,"" but there are actually several varieties that differ in color and size. Switchgrass blooms for almost half the year, and during the winter and spring it's usually brown. These are factors to keep in mind when you're choosing a variety for your garden. Here are a few types commonly grown in home gardens:


Northwind: Grows four to six feet tall and produces yellow blooms.Cloud Nine: Grows five to nine feet tall and blooms bright yellow.Heavy Metal: Grows four to five feet tall and blooms light pink.Shenandoah: Grows just three to four feet tall and blooms rusty pink.Rotstrahlbusch: Grows four to five feet tall and produces pink-tinged flowers.Warrior: Grows four to six feet tall and blooms green.;
, Depending on the variety you have, switchgrass can grow anywhere from three to nine feet tall. This is something to take into account when you choosing the right place to plant it. Planting it in the background of the garden, behind smaller plants, will ensure it doesn't obscure the smaller elements in your garden.Make sure it has room to grow without blocking windows. Place it strategically so that it falls in between them instead of planting right in front of something you don't want to block.
While switchgrass gets tall, it won't grow very wide. Don’t worry about spreading; it’s never more than half as wide as it is tall.

, Switchgrass is native to prairies and savannas, wide-open spaces with bright, sunny skies. Find a spot in your yard that emulates this natural habitat, a place with plenty of sun and not too many shady trees or buildings that shadow the area for most of the day.


Too much shade will cause the roots to crawl from side to side, which weakens the switchgrass. In the right conditions, switchgrass roots grow very deep.
Partial shade is fine if you don't have a completely sunny spot, but full sun is best for thriving switchgrass.

, Switchgrass is a hardy plant that can survive in soil that isn't very rich. Since it’s a native species, it’s quite low maintenance, and there's no need to pre-treat the soil before planting. If you're concerned about your soil quality, check the type of switchgrass you have and look it up to make sure it likes the ground where you live.


Sandy or loamy soil are both fine for most varieties of switchgrass, so there's no need to treat your soil to change the texture.
Dry or moist soil are both fine as well, although you wouldn't want the roots to be completely waterlogged.

, If you live in one of the few places where switchgrass won’t grow naturally, like the west coast of the US, you can grow it in a pot instead. Choose your switchgrass variety and plant it in standard, untreated potting soil. Make sure the pot you use is sturdy and deep enough to hold the roots without cramping them."

Use other spicy materials.,
Consider raw eggs.,
Try blood meal or bonemeal.,
Purchase predator urine.,
Try commercial organic products.,
Plant rabbit-resistant plants.",How to Keep Rabbits out of Your Garden Organically2," Just about any spicy materials will keep rabbits away. Always dilute them in soapy water to minimize harm, and so they will stick to the plant. Here are appropriate amounts to add to 1 gallon (4 liters) water:Five to eight cloves crushed garlic
1–2 tsp (5–10 mL) crushed red pepper
A few grinds of black pepper
A mixture of the above may work best of all.

, Rabbits dislike the smell of raw eggs, although they may get used to it over time. Shake the egg in a spray bottle and spray it onto the plants or around the border to your garden.


This may attract other pests, such as ants., These are available from gardening supply stores, for sprinkling on the soil around plants. Made from ground animal parts, they may keep rabbits away. These break down quickly when wet, so they are more effective in dry conditions.Blood meal adds nitrogen to the soil, promoting green, leafy growth. Apply only during the growing season, and never to legumes.Bone meal adds phosphorus to the soil, promoting root health. This is usually not necessary in home garden soil, and may even be detrimental if phosphorus is already high. Do not apply to Protea plants.

, Spraying predator urine around a garden can keep rabbits and other prey animals away. How effective this is varies greatly depending on predator species, rabbit species, diet of the predator, and other difficult-to-find variables. Unfortunately, research on this topic is limited, but coyote and fox urine are the most commonly used options.


You may wish to research the company before buying the product, to find out whether the urinating animals were humanely treated.

, Most of these products use similar ingredients to those described above. Check the label for information on weather resistance, since this is the main advantage over home solutions.

, This is usually an unreliable solution, and requires either replacing all tasty plants or planting a barrier around the entire garden. Some plants will still be eaten by young rabbits, or certain rabbit species.


Ideally, get specific advice from a local university extension, to find plants that grow in your climate and deter rabbit species in your area.
Yarrow, foxglove, digitalis, lilac, elderberry, and yucca have all been described as rabbit-proof plants — but again, this is no guarantee."

Create a chicken wire fence.,
Care for the fence during winter.,
Check local law before using traps.,
Choose a trap based on species.",How to Keep Rabbits out of Your Garden Organically3," Any mesh fencing with 1"" (2.5 cm) holes or smaller should keep rabbits out of the garden. Place this around tree trunks or flowerbeds, or around the entire garden. Follow these guidelines to make sure the rabbits can't jump over or dig under:Bury the fence 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) deep. Not all rabbit species burrow, but better safe than sorry.
Bend the base of the fence. Bending the buried end of the fence 90º outward makes burrowing much more difficult.
Leave 2 feet (0.6 m) above the surface, or 3 ft (0.9 m) if you live near jackrabbits.

, Chicken wire will last longer if you bring it inside before the first frost. If you have winter plants that need to be protected, keep an eye on snowfall. Rabbits may be able to jump over the fence when snow is high. Clear the snow away from the fence, or invest in more chicken wire.

, Even live traps can often cause injury to rabbits, and may cause health and legal problems as well.Due to rabbit-borne diseases, it may be illegal to handle or release wild rabbits in your area. Talk to your local extension office, agriculture office, or center of local government before using traps.

, Traps are usually ineffective for jackrabbits. For cottontails (the most common small rabbit species), you'll need a trap with a 7 inch (18 cm) door. Bait the trap with cabbage, dried fruit, or flowers.


Traps work best in winter or early spring, when food is scarce.
If you're using lethal traps to reduce rabbit population, hunting is usually a more effective solution. Check local laws to find out if rabbits are a game species in your area.

"
"
Plant in early spring.,
Buy seedlings to plant.,
Consider broadcasting switchgrass seeds over lightly worked soil.,
Let the sun and rain take care of the switchgrass.,
Shear it back in late winter.",How to Plant Switchgrass2," It's the best time to plant switchgrass, since it gives the roots time to get established before the temperature gets too hot. Plant as soon as the soil is workable but before the last frost. The soil temperature should be over 60 degrees when you plant.You may need to adjust the planting time to your growing region. If you live in a place where the soil is never far below 60 degrees, planting in fall or winter is fine.
If you live in a place with harsh, cold winters you may need to wait until late spring to plant your switchgrass.
Soil is workable with temperature over 60 degrees.

, Planting seedlings instead of seeds is the easiest way to include ornamental switchgrass in your garden, since seeds are slow to germinate. To plant seedlings,


Work the soil to a depth of several feet, to accommodate the length of the taproot. Remove obstructions like rocks and other roots.
Plant the seedlings 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart. Lightly water the area to help the soil settle.

, This is the best method for planting if you want a field of grass, rather than just a plant or two for ornamental purposes. Lightly till the soil to a depth of half an inch using a garden spade or till, then scatter the seeds over the soil. The seeds are slow to germinate.


If you’d like to try no-till planting, this seed usually does well with that method.
Water the planting bed immediately after broadcasting the seeds, to help them settle.
In a garden setting, thin out once the seedlings grow 2 inches (5.1 cm) tall. Leave 12 inches (30.5 cm) of space between them.

, After the seedlings are established, there's no need to water them. The switchgrass should get everything it needs from spring and summer rains. Once the root systems are established it will begin gaining height.


Do not fertilize switchgrass. As a native species, it doesn’t need extra fertilizer to grow healthy. Extra fertilizer can actually damage the plants.
However, in very poor soil you can fertilize lightly in spring, and in very dry conditions you can water it once in awhile.
Avoid treating switchgrass with pesticides or herbicides. In the case of ornamental switchgrass, no pests or weeds pose a real threat to this native species.

, Over the summer it will grow quite tall, then dry out and die over the winter. In late winter, shear the switchgrass back to a few inches. The new green grass will begin sprouting as the weather warms and soon reach its adult height again.

"
"
Watch out for grasshoppers.,
Harvest after flowering.,
Graze after the switchgrass has reached a height of 12 to 16 inches (30.5 to 40.6 cm).,
Burn switchgrass fields every three to five years.",How to Plant Switchgrass3," If you're growing an entire field of switchgrass, the main pest you'll need to worry about is grasshoppers, which are a threat to seedlings when switchgrass is planted at an agricultural scale. If grasshoppers become a concern, there are two main ways you can deal with the problem:Dust the switchgrass with flour. Use use all-purpose flour and dust the grass and the insects. After two days, rinse it off.Treat with chemical pesticides. While strong pesticides are best avoided, especially if you're using switchgrass to feed livestock or house native species, you may have to turn to this option as a last resort.

, If you're growing grass to harvest for hay or biofuel, just after flowering is the best time to do it, although you can wait to harvest just after the first frost of the year if you'd like. If you harvest early in the year, you may be able to do a second harvest before winter., Cattle love to eat switchgrass, so it's a great sustainable food source. Make sure the switchgrass has grow at least a foot high before you graze it, so the plant's roots don't get damaged.


Stop grazing the area when the grass is six inches off the ground.
Let it rest for 30 to 60 days before grazing again.

, Burning is a common technique used for different types of native grasses, since it stimulates new healthy growth. It also reduces mulch, which is necessary if you planted the grass to provide shelter for birds and animals that need space among the stalks to thrive.There may be restrictions as to when and how you can burn in your area, so be sure to follow local regulations."

Understand the concept of plant division.,
Determine when to divide your perennials.,
Dig up the perennials root system.,
Evaluate which division method to use.,
Divide the perennial.,
Plant the divided perennial.,
Dispose of the remaining divisions.",How to Keep Perennial Plants From Taking over Your Garden1," Dividing perennials means splitting 1 large plant into several smaller plants. Plant division helps keep perennials healthy, promotes blooming and may extend the life of some plants. In the case of plants that are overtaking a garden, dividing a perennial will reduce the plant's size and keep it from crowding out other plants.;
, Most perennials should be divided in the spring when new growth is less than 4 inches (10.16 cm) high. During the spring, the cool weather and moist soil keep root systems from drying out after being separated and replanted. Perennials divided during the spring have a growing season to recover from the stress caused by division, and have time to develop a strong root system to survive the winter.


Divide oriental poppies, Siberian iris and peonies in the fall.
Avoid dividing perennials during the summer, with the exception of the bearded iris, which can withstand the summer heat during plant division. Tough perennials like daylilies and hostas may be divided any time.

, Using a shovel, dig a hole around the root system of the plant. Gently pull on the plant to remove the root system from the soil, and lay the plant on a tarp.

, There are 2 ways of dividing perennials: cut them apart or pull them apart. To determine which method to use, examine the root system of the perennial. Dense, tough roots will need to be cut apart with a sharp tool, while fibrous, tangled roots can be pulled apart by hand.

, If you need to cut the perennial apart, use a sharp knife or spade to slice the plant's roots. If you need to pull the perennial apart, gently untangle the roots and pull them apart using your hands.


Ensure each new division has 3 to 5 new growth shoots and healthy roots.

, To keep the perennial from overtaking your garden, replant 1 small division. Plant the division at the same depth as the old plant and water after planting. Keep the soil moist for a few weeks while new roots become established.

, Share the other perennial divisions that you did not plant with friends, or simply dispose of them. Do not plant them, or you will have issues with overcrowding in your garden again.

Understand that identifying the caterpillar will determine how you handle them.,
Deal with cutworms.,
Handle tomato hornworms.,
Do not kill swallowtail butterfly caterpillars.,
Protect your plants from cabbage moth caterpillars.,
Check your plants for eggs frequently.",How to Keep Caterpillars Out of the Garden1," Identifying the caterpillar type is crucial for treating these pests because some methods will get rid of certain types of caterpillars, but will be ineffective against others. The following steps cover some of the most common caterpillars and what you should do to remove them from your garden.;
, Cutworms live below the soil surface and eat through seedlings’ stems during the night. Plastic cups or toilet paper rolls can be cut into 2 inch (5.1 cm) strips and placed around tender young plants to protect them from these pests.Another way to avoid cutworms is to use sterile soil to start your seedlings. This helps prevent any pests that overwintered in your garden from eating your baby plants.

, Tomato hornworms chiefly target tomato plants and will strip them leafless in less than a day. These pests are easily recognized by the large spike on their posterior end.Handpicking is a good way to get rid of these caterpillars. Drop the hornworms into a cup or jar that contains soapy water, which will kill them.


Those that don’t run around their garden barefoot may prefer to squash these pests underfoot.
Gardeners that have an aversion to either method can instead dump any caterpillars they find into the garbage bin.

, Dill, parsley, fennel, cilantro, carrot, and parsnip foliage are a favorite food source of swallowtail butterfly caterpillars. Gardeners will recognize these creatures by their white and yellow stripes as well as their fat, bright green exteriors. Gardeners are advised to handpick these caterpillars and move them to a patch of Queen Anne’s lace or to another location away from their garden.Planting extra dill, parsley, and fennel for the butterflies to eat is another way to be sure that there is enough to go around.

, Covering plants with translucent fabric or by using polypropylene row covers are both good ways to protect brassicas from coming to grief at the hands of cabbage moths and other pests that take on a caterpillar form at one stage of their lives.Premade row covers can be bought at garden centers, but gardeners can make their own. All you have to do is stick hoops into the ground and cover them with either perforated plastic or fabric sheeting. These materials should let in both sun and air but also serve as a barrier for most bugs.
It’s a good idea to weigh down row covers on one end using bricks, wood planks, or other sufficiently heavy materials.

, Rake up and remove all of the fallen leaves and debris around your plants each fall. This will help to keep the caterpillar population under control. Check the leaves on the plants for caterpillar eggs—regardless of what kind of caterpillar you are dealing with—throughout the growing season. Be sure to check both the tops and bottoms of the leaves carefully.


When eggs are found, simply pinch or snip off the leaf and throw it in the garbage.

Understand the concept of deadheading.,
Evaluate whether your perennial self-seeds.,
Deadhead perennials.,Avoid Invasive Perennials

,
Research which perennials are invasive in your area.,
Remove invasive perennials in your garden.",How to Keep Perennial Plants From Taking over Your Garden2," Deadheading perennials is removing spent or faded blooms from the plant. Deadheading allows plants to focus their energy on blooming, rather than going to seed. Without deadheading, some self-seeding perennials will drop seeds in the soil, which may emerge the following growing season as new plants. To keep perennials from overtaking your garden, deadhead blooms to keep the plants from producing seeds.

, Not all perennials self-seed. Consult a garden catalog or online perennial resource to determine whether your plants will go to seed if not deadheaded. A few common perennials that self-seed include: yarrow, bugleweed, purple coneflower, orange coneflower, sweet violet, bishop's goutweed, lady's mantle, aster, columbine and maiden pink.

, Remove spent blooms by pinching them off with your thumb and forefinger, or clipping them with shears.

,, Invasive perennials spread rapidly and are difficult to control. They may spread by seeds or by roots. Because the growth patterns of perennials depend on factors like temperature, soil and sunlight, perennials may be considered invasive in some geographic areas, but not in others. Check with your local garden center, extension office or the United States National Arboretum website for a list of invasive perennials in your area.


Put together a list of local invasive perennials so you avoid planting them in the future. A few perennials that are considered invasive in some geographic regions include: purple loosestrife, English ivy, Japanese honeysuckle, butterfly bush and water hyacinth.

, If you have invasive perennials in your garden, remove them immediately. Dig out the entire root system and dispose of the plant. If a plant spreads by seeds, an invasive plant in your garden could affect neighboring gardens and habitats.

Encourage birds to spend time in your yard.,
Hide plants by using strongly scented herbs.,
Use organic controllers to rid your yard of caterpillars.",How to Keep Caterpillars Out of the Garden2," An effective way to avoid caterpillars is to encourage birds to make their home in your yard. While this may not be an ideal solution for gardeners that want to keep the local avians away from their berry patch, it will certainly work for gardeners with plants that don’t appeal to the bird’s taste buds. To get birds to come to your yard:


Set out a bird feeder with a cone around it to keep out hungry squirrels and a birdbath to encourage the local avian populace to visit.
Ducks and chickens also enjoy caterpillars and if one has the space they might add either for both bug control and the tasty eggs.

, Placing mugwort, sage, thyme, rosemary, and/or peppermint* around affected plants may remedy some caterpillar problems. These strongly scented herbs will help disguise the creature’s favorite foods so that they head elsewhere for dinner.Intercropping, or placing different plants together in one area, is another way to confuse insect predators.

, There are several organic controls that can be used to get rid of caterpillars. BT, or Bacillus thuringiensis, is an excellent option for keeping pests out of the yard. However, this substance is not always easy to find.To use BT:


“Kurstaki” BT kills most species of caterpillars. Mix it up according to the manufacturer’s instructions and spray the plants thoroughly, covering the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems. It can be sprayed on flowers and landscape plants every three to five days until the caterpillars are under control.
Gardeners who cannot find BT should try Neem based sprays instead. These sprays should only be used as a last resort because a number of beneficial insects may perish along with the caterpillars.

Scare the rabbits away.,
Get rid of slugs.,
Remember that little bugs are the worst when its comes to plants.,
Beware of dogs and cats.",How to Keep Bugs and Animals Off Your Plants," Rabbits cause a problem when it comes to plants such as lettuce, carrots, or potatoes. It's a good thing that rabbits hate garlic. Before dusk, lay a few garlic cloves around your plants and they will not go near them.
, Slugs are another thing gardeners hate. Slugs love to eat leafs and stems off plants.Though, there are two things slugs really love: beer and salt.

Fill a little bowl up with beer.
Place this bowl next to any plant. All the slug will want to do is go to the beer, not your plants.
Place a ring of salt around the plant. Slugs die almost suddenly when they come to contact with salt.

, To keep them away:

Make a small spray to warn them off. All you need is a spray bottle, dish soap, and water.
Mix the soap and water together. Pour it into the bottle.
Spray it on the parts of the plants you don't want to get eaten. These parts can be leafs and stems.

, Though they seem nice, they still like to dig up plants and use it as a litter box. To keep them from doing this, spread some black pepper or cayenne pepper by your plants. Cats and dogs hate the smell of the pepper so they won't go anywhere near the plants."

Add a fence around your plants.,
Build raised beds in your garden.,
Create covers for your plants.",How to Keep Animals Out of Your Vegetable Garden1," A good way to keep animals out of your vegetable garden is to build a fence. You can choose from a variety of fence types to place around your garden, acting as a wall between animals and your vegetables. Fences can work great, but they may be expensive and require some effort to install. Keep some of these basic facts about garden fences in mind when considering one for your garden:Many fences will require you to install fence posts before wrapping the fence itself around them.
Most fences are built to surround an entire garden.
The exact material and style of your fence is up to you. You could use wood, metal or plastics such as polypropylene to create your fence.
Some fences are electric and will shock any intruding animal that touches it.
It can be a good idea to bury about 1' of your fence underground to block burrowing animals.;
, Planting your garden in raised beds can be a great way to keep out weeds, make tending to the garden a bit easier and keep out some common garden pests. Most raised garden designs are simple to follow and build, allowing you to create a pest resistant home for your plants.Most raised beds can be made out of wooden planks, stones, bricks or concrete blocks.
Building a raised bed that is at least 2' off the ground will keep most rabbits out.
Adding a bottom layer of mesh fencing to your raised bed will keep burrowing animals out.
You can still add fences and covers to a raised bed for extra protection.

, If you are concerned about specific plants in your garden, you can try adding small fences or covers over them. These covers will help keep most invading garden pests away from your plant. You can create your own plant covers or buy plant covers at most home and garden shops.Adding a simple chicken wire fence around a plant can be enough to keep most pests away.
You can buy garden fabric to cover your plants and protect them from being eaten.
Young plants can be covered in deer or bird netting.

Include sacrificial plants near your garden.,
Use landscaping to make animals feel unwelcome.",How to Keep Animals Out of Your Vegetable Garden2," Most animals that are sneaking into your garden are doing so because they can smell the vegetables and are attracted by the free meal. Scents can also be used to keep animals out, sending a message that your garden is either not a safe place to eat or by making it smell unappealing. Take a look at the two main types of scent deterrents to help you pick one for your garden:You can buy animal repellents that smell like the urine of a predator. These repellents will make your garden seem dangerous to animals. You'll likely need to know which type of animal is invading your garden before buying a predator scent that scares that specific animal.
You might try using spicy or unappealing sprays around your garden. These sprays can make animals uncomfortable or make your garden taste and smell bad enough that they will look for food elsewhere.
Animal repelling sprays can be bought at most home or garden stores.
You can try looking up homemade animal repellent recipes and make your own.
Many sprays will need to be applied often, as rain or moisture will wash them away.

, If you know the type of animal that is regularly invading your garden, you can try growing some plants that they would find repulsive. Adding plants that common garden pests dislike can help keep them out and protect your vegetables. Take a look at some of the following plants that are thought to keep away garden pests:Azalea, boxwood, lamb's ear, peony and marigolds are all unappealing to rabbits.
Bleeding hearts, daffodils, hyssop, and mullein are plants that can repel deer.
You can try mixing some of these plants in with your garden to make the whole thing look unappealing.
Planting these barrier plants along the parameter of your garden can help repel pests.

, Even though your garden is a peaceful place, the animals that are sneaking in will still be on the look out for threats. Because of this, you can add devices to your garden that are designed to startle and scare off whatever animal might be nibbling your vegetables. Take a look at some of these ideas to give you an idea of how you can make your garden a scary place to unwanted animals:Modern scarecrows come equipped with motion sensors and will spray water at any invading wildlife.
Having an outdoor dog can help keep many animals out of your garden.
Some repellents make use of shiny or reflective material to frighten off birds.
You can buy electronic repellents that sound an alarm or play a frightening sound when they detect motion.

, Cats are naturally inclined to hunt and can do a great job of keeping small animals out of your garden. Besides actually hunting the animals that make it into your garden, your cat's scent and presence may scare off future pests. So if you have an outdoor cat, consider introducing them to your garden to help cut down on the amount animals snack on your vegetables.Make sure your cat has all of its vaccines as many wild animals can carry diseases.
Always monitor your cat to make sure they are in good health and are capable of safely going outdoors.

, It might seem counterintuitive, but adding plants near your garden that animals love can be a good way to keep them out of your actual garden. Once you know which animals are causing you trouble, you can try planting their favorite foods away from your garden, keeping them out and sparing your vegetables.


Make sure any attractive plants are placed away from your garden.
Making an animal's favorite foods easy to get to will prevent them from trying to gain access to your garden.
Try planting some extra vegetables in an area that is easy for pests to get at, keeping them away from the ones you plan on eating.

, Certain environments and landscapes will make animals feel more or less comfortable. Depending on how you've landscaped your garden or yard, you may actually be making animals feel right at home. Rearranging your landscaping can be a simple way to help make animals uncomfortable and keep them out of your garden. Try keeping some of these tips in mind when landscaping your garden to help scare off would be invaders: Avoid having lots of weeds or heavy plant cover, as most animals enjoy feeling hidden in the foliage.
Get rid of woodpiles that may be near the garden.
Cut down or move bushes or shrubs that surround the garden.

, Rabbits will love to find a way into your garden and will eat nearly anything you have planted there. Because rabbits can be such a pest, you'll want to have your garden set up in a way that keeps them out and makes your garden seem unappealing. Keep some of these tips in mind to stop rabbits from eating your garden:Garden fences should be at least 3' tall.
Burying a fence 1' underground can help prevent rabbits from burrowing under.
Raised beds can make it difficult for rabbits to enter your garden.
Try adding barrier plants like azalea or boxwood to repel rabbits.

You can try building a barrier out of chicken wire around your plants.
Casting a net over your garden is a sure-fire way to keep birds out. You may create a framework out of bamboo poles, fence posts or tall stakes. Then, drape the netting over the framework so it reaches the ground and anchor the net using bent wire so it cannot get blown over by the wind.
You can also try putting fishing line or black thread throughout your garden, as birds do not like wires and may stay away.
Try a high-tech option by using a computer system in the shape of an owl that makes a screeching owl noise, which will frighten away the birds.

Spot the aphids.,
Make Organic Aphid Sprays.,
Squash them.,
Companion plant.,
Release ladybirds.,
Blast them with the hose.,
Try flour.,
Dig banana peel into the ground.",How to Keep Aphids Away Using Eco Friendly Methods," Aphid damage is recognisable by telltale signs of cottony-looking threads around new buds and leaves. Some aphids prefer older growth. Aphids are also known as ""plant lice"" and they hang around in bunches, making them easy to spot.;
, Create an aphid spray using a mild detergent and water, or make a soapy garden spray. You could also try the more garlic and onion version here. Spray every two to three days over a period of a week - you must spray the aphids directly for this to be effective. You can also use garlic spray as an effective aphid controller.


Consider using neem oil mixed with water. Or, add neem oil with OHN (garlic + ginger + molasses). Dilute the ingredients in water and spray directly below the leaves (where aphids hide). Spray repeatedly 3 times per week for a plant with serious aphid damage.

, Provided you don't mind quite a bit of patrolling and squishing, you can be very effective at reducing the aphid population by manually squashing them. This is labour intensive and likely you will miss some, but combined with organic sprays, this can be very effective. Wash your hands well with soap after each session, or wear garden gloves.

, Plant your favourite roses or other aphid-attracting plants alongside aphid-discouraging plants. Aphids dislike garlic, chives, onions, mint, petunias. Aphids love nasturtiums. Roses grown with garlic plants or chives are much less prone to aphid attacks and both have a beautiful flower of their own during flowering season.

, Ladybirds (ladybugs) feast on aphids. You can purchase the larvae in packs online or from specialist nurseries. Follow the release instructions carefully - they should be released right near the food (the aphids) and must never be released in an area that has been sprayed with pesticides.

, Depending on how sensitive your plant is and your water usage restrictions, you can blast aphids off the plant with the jet stream of a hose.

, Sprinkle flour over the aphids using a sieve or flour sifter. The flour will coat the aphids and they will drop off.

, Cut-up banana peels or use dried banana pieces for this. Dig the cut-up peel or dried pieces 2.5–5 centimeter (2.0 in) / 1–2"" into the ground around the base of every plant that aphids are attracted to. The aphids will soon be gone.

Construct a tunnel made of bird netting.,
Protect your seedlings with soda bottles.,
Use fishing line to create a barrier.",How to Keep Birds off Your Seedlings1," Netting is the preferred way to keep birds away from seedlings and is very easy to implement. Use bamboo poles, tall stakes or fence posts to create a framework around your plants. Drape your netting over the stakes and anchor it to the ground using bent wire.Try to drape your netting so it forms a V-shaped tent. This will prevent birds from accessing and pulling on the plants.;
, Cut the bottom off a clean, clear soda bottle. Position the bottle so it rests over the seedling, then remove the soda cap. This method allows sunlight to reach your seedling, while still keeping the plant out of reach of roaming birds.This method can also be done using upside-down berry baskets.
As your seedlings grow, you may have to prop up your bottles or baskets using bricks or rocks.

, Birds are easily confused by wire, so fishing line is a cheap and easy way to keep them away from your seedlings. Plant stakes, fence posts or bamboo poles around your garden and weave fishing line between the posts, above the plants.If you don’t have fishing line, thread or wire will also work.

Build a scarecrow.,
Hang CDs from a clothesline.,
Make scary balloons.",How to Keep Birds off Your Seedlings2," Birds are scared of humans, but since you can’t stand in your garden full time, construct a scarecrow to guard your garden on your behalf. To create your scarecrow, tie two sticks together with string to create a cross. Dress your scarecrow in old clothes and stuff him with hay or straw to give him a shape. You can create a face for your scarecrow by drawing on an old burlap bag and attaching the bag to the stick using your string. Mount your scarecrow in your garden to keep the birds away.If you don’t want to build a scarecrow, scary masks or owl silhouettes also work. The goal is to frighten the birds, so be creative.Move your scarecrow around your garden occasionally, so the birds don’t get suspicious.

, Birds are scared of their own reflections, so hanging reflective surfaces around your garden can be a great way of keeping them away. Hang CDs or DVDs at intervals around your seedlings; you can attach them to a clothesline or to stakes planted throughout your garden.Mirrors or any other reflective material can also work for this method.

, Garden centers and online retailers sell balloons with scary faces on them to terrify birds. You can easily make your own version of these using Mylar balloons. Use permanent, non-washable markers to draw scary faces on your balloons. Secure them to posts around your garden using ribbon or tape.Make sure to move your balloons around every couple of days to keep the birds on their toes.

Hang pie tins around your garden.,
Play scary bird sounds.,
Hang wind chimes.",How to Keep Birds off Your Seedlings3," As mentioned previously, birds are scared of their own reflections, but they also don’t like loud noises. Hang your pie tins on a clothesline or mount them on stakes. The loud noises they make when the wind blows them into one another is sure to keep the birds away.When hanging or mounting your pie tins, make sure to place them closely together so they can touch and rub against each other.
If you don’t have pie tins, you can substitute other kitchen utensils, provided they are metallic.

, Birds use their sense of hearing to help them avoid predators, but you can also use this to your advantage. Place a CD player in your garden and play recorded sounds of predators on loop.When creating your bird mix, include lots of eagle, owl and vulture noises. These are all predatory birds and their calls are sure to terrify smaller birds., Wind chimes are the most innocuous way to keep birds away from your seedlings; they look pretty, sound pretty and are very cost effective. Birds, however, don’t like the chiming and tend to steer clear of them. Hang your wind chimes above your seedlings and enjoy the pretty music (and your bird-free plants.)You can also try substituting bells for wind chimes.

Determine the area to contain the bamboo in.,
Remove or plan on killing any rhizomes outside of the contained area.,
Choose and purchase the rhizome barrier.,
Dig a trench all the way around the area to be contained, about 2 inches (5.1 cm) shallower than the width of your rhizome barrier.

,
Compact the bottom of the trench as well as possible.,
Place the barrier into the trench.,
Close the ends of the barrier.,
Begin filling in around the barrier.,
The installation is complete.",How to Install a Bamboo Rhizome Barrier," The larger the area, the larger your bamboo will be able to grow. Those focused exclusively on the vigor of bamboo recommend as much as a 30 feet (9.1 m). diameter for large species. However, it is possible to have a reasonably large healthy plant with as little as one square yard of ground for it to grow in.;
, Killing well established bamboo is very difficult, so removing the rhizomes upfront is probably the better option.

, Bamboo can be very strong, and rhizomes have a sharp tip when growing. Concrete will crack over time and allow the bamboo to escape. Metal will eventually rust through, and poses a hazard where it must stick up above ground. For best results, use a true HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) barrier of at least 60 mil thickness. The American Bamboo Socia In hard clay soil, some say it is okay to use only a 24 inch (61.0 cm) wide barrier. However, a 30 wide barrier is safer. For areas where the soil is sandy and loose, a 36 inch (91.4 cm) wide barrier may be required.

,, Keep the topsoil that you dug out from falling back in. You want this to be hard uninviting clay in case a rhizome ever makes it down that far.

, Get it where you want it to be, and do your best to angle it away from the enclosed area. You want any rhizome that hits the barrier in the future to be directed up by the barrier. You do not want the rhizome to go down, as this can lead to a rhizome escaping under the barrier even if it is good and deep.

, Either use steel closure strips with a less than 3 inch (7.6 cm) overlap, or overlap the ends by at least four feet and seal the overlap at both ends with double sided tape. Bamboo can escape through very small openings, so make sure the seal is really good.

, Keep the barrier angled outward. Pack the bottom half of the fill as tightly as possible. Let the top half remain loose.

, Your bamboo should not be able to escape underground. It will eventually send rhizomes over the 2 inch (5.1 cm) high above-ground part of the barrier. However, these are easily spotted and clipped with a quick inspection once or twice per year.

Cut down on the number of tasty plants in your garden.,
Plant close to your home.,
Mask the smell of a deer’s favorite foods with pungent plants.,
Protect your crops with tomato cages.,
Raise a hedge or fence.",How to Keep Deer Out of a Garden1," Deer favor rich, high-nutrient foods like lettuce, beans, peas and strawberries, as well as mild flowers like tulips and pansies. The fewer of these you keep in your garden at a given time, the less likely they are to provide a mouth-watering feast for a grazing deer herd. This will be more difficult if you maintain a farm or large vegetable garden, but you can still lower your chances of having your crops ravaged by keeping them in rotation and harvesting them as soon as they’re ripe.Keep your garden well manicured and maintained. Harvest fruits and vegetables as soon as they are ripe to cut down on the chances that they'll be devoured.
Do some research on the types of crops that deer prefer and only plant one or two of these at a time.;
, Deer are cautious creatures and won’t venture any closer to your domicile than they have to. Take advantage of this and grow bright, attractive plants and plump fruits and vegetables close to your home, far away from the outer perimeter of your garden where deer are most likely to infiltrate. In order to get to them, the deer will have to risk getting close to the hub of all the noise and activity they fear.Lush rose and tulip bushes make excellent ornamentation for the outside of your home where they will conveniently be the safest.

, Smell is a deer’s strongest sense, and the one they use to track down food sources. Confuse deer on the lookout for a free meal by covering up the scents of the plants they gravitate to with the more conspicuous odors of potent perennials and herbs. Garlic, onions, lavender and mint all make great choices for disguising the smell of vulnerable plants and driving away hungry deer.Deer are naturally repulsed by things with acrid odors and flavors.

, Place wire tomato cages over larger crops like tomatoes and beans to make it more difficult for deer to get to them. Ready-made tomato cages can be found at most lawn and garden stores, or you can put them together yourself at home using basic, inexpensive materials. The openings in the cage are too small for deer to reach the plants within, but are big enough to allow you to water, prune and pick fruits and vegetables by hand.


Cages are recommended for edible plants that grow tall on stalks or vines.Build simple tomato cages to your own specifications using concrete reinforcing wire. Make a Tomato Cage


, Though many people find them unsightly and difficult to maintain, a tall, sheer barrier such as a picket fence or dense hedge can make an effective deer defense. Just make sure the fence or hedge is tall enough to keep the deer from seeing what’s on the menu in your yard. Deer are prodigious jumpers, and a barrier shorter than about six feet won’t stand a chance.Growing a hedge to serve as a screen requires patience and upkeep, but is arguably the more aesthetic option than walling off your beautiful landscaping with a solid structure.
If space allows, consider erecting a double fence or hedge with an inner and outer barrier. This will make it harder for the deer to clear with a bound.

"
"
Use a spray repellent.,
Install motion-activated sprinklers.,
Create noise to scare the deer off.,
Put in some automatic lights.",How to Keep Deer Out of a Garden2," Spray your garden’s vulnerable plants regularly with a commercial or homemade deer repellent. These repellents typically contain components like sulfur, ammonia salts and capsaicin which deer find unpleasant. Even the store-bought varieties are concocted with natural ingredients and don’t make use of harsh chemicals that might damage your plants’ growth. Simply mist your garden every couple of days.If you’re not inclined to shell out the money for a commercial repellent, try mixing up your own with eggs, garlic, ammonia, and/or hot sauce blended with water.Be careful about using repellents on crops you plan to harvest and eat yourself. Compounds like capsaicin aren’t dangerous, but may influence the taste of edible plants.

, Deer are notoriously skittish creatures and are quite easy to scare off with the right stimulus. One particularly effective strategy is to put in a couple motion-activated sprinkler posts at the far ends of your garden or wherever deer tend to sneak in. When they get close, they’ll suddenly be doused with a unexpected jet of water from the sprinkler, which will send them running.Installing a motion-activated sprinkler system is a pricier option, but one that is guaranteed to have repeated success.
Along with its deterrent benefits, a sprinkler is also a convenient way of making sure your garden or yard is getting enough water.

, Loud, spontaneous noises are a surefire way to get rid of inquisitive deer. Whether it’s an electronic noisemaker on a timer, a set of jarring wind chimes or a simple well-timed clap of your hands, a deer won’t take any chances with what’s generating the noise. Even leaving the back door open to let the sounds of household activity escape can be enough to dissuade a deer from coming any closer.Electronic noisemakers can be programmed to emit regular tones that will scare away deer but won’t disturb the neighbors.
Try fashioning a set of non-harmonic wind chimes from aluminum cans or hollow wood cuttings., Deer often travel in herds at night to forage, mate and play. That means that they might stumble upon the scrumptious treats in your garden in the small hours when no one is around to ward them off. Fortunately, mounting an automatic flood light on the outside of your house or some other structure near your garden can do the job for you while you sleep. When the deer begin to creep up to that squash vine or begonia bush, the flood light will activate and the intruders will run for cover.Most flood lights work at a particular range and angle. When installing a flood light, make sure it’s properly calibrated to come on when movement is detected in the area of your at-risk plants.

Line your plants and crops with wire.,
Get a dog.,
Put up a statue as a scare tactic.,
Spent time in your garden.",How to Keep Deer Out of a Garden3," If you’re really worried about deer getting into plants you’ve spent many long weeks cultivating, consider fencing the plot in with fishing line or plastic wire. Stick 3-4 posts in the ground around the crop and wrap the wire around the outside of the posts from top to bottom, leaving only a couple inches between each strand. It isn’t very attractive, but it will do what it’s supposed to do and is inexpensive. The idea is similar to keeping single plants off-limits with tomato cages, but will allow you to close off a larger area.Fishing line is thin enough not to be an eyesore or block your plants from view, but will be enough to dissuade deer from trying to push their way through.Despite being talented at runners and jumpers, deer are not very good at getting themselves in and out of tight spaces.

, Deer are constantly wary of predators, and while the average house canine isn’t likely to make a meal of a passing doe, the sight and sound of one may be enough to keep troublesome deer at bay. Dog urine also doubles as a natural repellent, as deer can distinguish its odor from that of other harmless herbivores, and it signals that competition or predators may be nearby. Take your dog out to do its business in the general vicinity of your garden and let it run around, and watch incidents of mysterious vegetation disappearances decrease.Walk your dog around the perimeter of your yard or garden to mark the area with its scent.

, Put up a scarecrow, statue or other large form as a new fixture in your garden. They may not move or make any noise, but the fear of the unknown will keep deer from making a move. The more lifelike the statue looks, the better chance it has of being convincing. Position the statue on the outer edge of your property to discourage deer from pushing in any further.Draping the statue in old clothes that billow in the breeze can mimic movement.
While deer are not especially clever, they learn from observing behavior. There’s no guarantee that a motionless garden fixture will frighten deer off for good.

, One of the best deterrents for deer ransacking is human presence. Simply spend some time out in your garden every day, and step out for a few minutes at night. Make yourself visible and audible. Deer are adaptable, reactive animals. When performing an instinctive risk-assessment of a place where food is available, your continued appearances can be enough to keep them away.Loud human voices are often enough to frighten away deer on their own.
Make sure to do a circuit of your garden nearest to where deer are getting in to maximize your chances of being detected.

Find a suitable container for your beer trap.,
Bury your beer trap container in your garden's soil.,
Fill the container with beer.,
Pick the snails out of the beer trap daily.,
Adjust the snail trap setup to protect pets.",How to Use Beer to Get Rid of Snails in Your Garden," Killing snails with beer is a simple process - you simply attract the slugs to an open container of beer, into which they fall in and drown. Suitable containers for making these beer traps include plastic drinking cups, leftover yogurt containers, and the bottoms of plastic soda bottles.


The container should be deep enough to allow slugs and snails to fall in and be unable to crawl back out. Deep containers also prevent the beer from evaporating in the sun too quickly.
The container must be watertight so that the beer does not simply leech out into the surrounding soil. Paper-based ice cream pint containers are not a good option, for example, as they tend to degrade too quickly.;
, Take your cup and a hand trowel out into your garden. Begin digging a hole for the container until it fits snugly into the hole with the mouth of the cup precisely at ground level (the slugs should be able to fall into the cup easily from ground level). Backfill the hole with soil if necessary to achieve a sturdy fit.


The location of your beer trap is important. It should be placed near enough to your garden so that snails are attracted to the beer instead of your plants.
If you have a small garden, a single beer trap is often sufficient. However, you could consider placing several beer traps around the perimeter of a larger garden.

, When the container is buried, fill it about 80 percent full with any type of beer. Snails and slugs are attracted to both the yeast and the carbohydrates in the beer; they will fall into the cup and drown.

, Check the beer trap each day for snails and slugs. You can either remove the cup from the soil and pour the whole mixture out, or you can pick the dead snails out with tweezers to preserve the beer for continued use. Refill the beer when it evaporates to a low level.

, Of course, the open-top design of this type of snail trap can lead curious dogs and cats to consume the beer; it can also attract wasps and other unwanted pests. If this is the case, you can adjust the design using a plastic soda bottle.


Cut a door into the soda bottle using sharp scissors. The door should be a rectangular opening placed about halfway up the bottle's height. The opening should be wide enough for snails to enter.
Bury the plastic bottle until the bottom of the door is lined up with the surrounding ground. Pour beer in through the opening until the beer level is just below the door.
Place the cap onto the bottle. With this design, snails can still fall into the beer through the small door, but the beer is less accessible to pets and unwanted pests.

Protect yourself.,
Avoid inhaling organic sprays.,
Spray only what you need to spray.,
Wear gloves and wash your hands.",How to Use Homemade Garden Sprays Safely," Always use containers that are clean and intact. Do not use containers with cracks, split parts or loose parts.;
, Given that the contents of some organic sprays are more toxic when concentrated than the plant in its original state, do not use your cooking pots and pans to make organic garden sprays. Visit the thrift store and buy a pot for this purpose and write clearly with a permanent marker ""Spray-Making Pot - Do Not Cook With"" on the side.

, This is probably the most important aspect of storing any garden spray. If everyone knows what the container contains, they are immediately aware of how to deal with it. It also helps you to remember long after you have a made it. Your labelling should include:

Date of manufacture






Ingredients






Use instructions (can be as simple as ""spray on roses""






Any relevant warnings and medical advice







, As with any gardening product, keep well out of the reach of children and pets. A lockable cupboard is the best option.

, Always cover up when using an organic garden spray. This will protect your skin from contact with what may be an allergen for you. While the plant may not affect you in its normal state, when concentrated, you might suffer a reaction if it gets on your skin.

, It is important to never inhale anything sprayed in the garden, organic sprays included. Spray away from your face area and stand to one side of the spraying. Do not spray on days of high wind or heat. If you are concerned and suffer from allergies, rashes etc., it may pay to don mask and safety glasses when spraying.

, Do not overdo spraying - even organic, low-toxicity sprays can be overkill for a plant if you use too much. It can also harm surrounding plants and beneficial insect life, and possibly harm pets, so stick to the usage guidelines.

, Wear gloves when handling and using organic sprays. And it still pays to always wash your hands at the end of every gardening session.

Wash your eyes immediately if you get any mixture on you.Pepper spray is an intense irritant on the eyes.",How to Make Pepper Spray1," Here are the main ingredients you'll require for your mixture:


Cayenne pepper. Cayenne pepper is recommended for its spiciness and ability to irritate the eyes. You won't need a lot of it to get it to work; two tablespoons of it will give you enough for several sprays' worth of mixture.
92% alcohol and vegetable oil. These will be used to mix with the cayenne pepper into a sprayable substance.;
, Add two tablespoons of cayenne paper to a small cup.A small, clear glass is best in this case because it will allow you to mixture proportions more easily.









Alternatively, instead of using powder, you can grind peppers up yourself and add them to the mix.Even if you want to make more than two tablespoons' worth, it's a good idea to begin with this set proportion. That way, you'll get a hands-on idea of a good pepper spray's texture and consistency.

, Pour rubbing alcohol over the cayenne pepper until the pepper has been completely submerged. Stir constantly to get a better idea of the mixture's progress.








, Add one tablespoon of vegetable oil for every two tablespoons of cayenne pepper you've dished out. Stir the mixture well.









Baby oil is a viable alternative to vegetable oil., True to its name, pepper spray's active ingredient is pepper. If you want a more intense mixture, you should replace the cayenne pepper with a pepper that scores higher on the Scoville Hotness meter.In addition, because you're making this pepper spray from home, there's not necessarily any rule to state what you can and can't add. Citrus is a natural irritant on the eyes, so squeezing in a lemon will add to the sting your spray causes.









Soap is a known irritant that many add to their homemade pepper sprays.If you're considering adding anything else into your pepper spray mix, you should make sure that it won't cause permanent damage if it comes in contact with someone's eyes. Pepper spray is intended solely as a non-lethal method of self-defence.

, Let it sit at least overnight for the mixture to properly settle. After enough time has passed, take off the wrapping.








, When a filter is in place, gently pour the spray mixture through the filter. This will pick up the solid matter, leaving the spray a liquid.









Filtering the mixture as such will help prevent clogging the nozzle with sediment after use., Keep an eyewash station nearby if you have the option. Most importantly, be very careful while you prepare the mixture.

An empty deodorant can. Make sure it has its safety cap on, and that the can is free of any puncture marks. It's a good idea to clear out the deodorant can as much as you can before adding in pepper spray.
A tire valve. A tire valve will add pressurization to your can after the spray's been added. These can be bought at department stores and auto repair shops.
A drill. An electric drill will allow you to open a hole in the bottom of the spray can. Aim for a 9mm drill bit.Epoxy. You will only need a few grams of the putty to
A syringe or funnel.
An air compressor. Because you'll be using a tire valve to pressurize your can, a car tire air pump should work for this purpose.

, This will be used to fill the can with mixture and compressed air. Hold your drill steady and try to make as even a hole as possible. This will make it easier to patch up with epoxy once you've filled the can.









Alternatively, you can avoid the can process altogether by using capped spray bottle. You should take lengths to make sure that the spray has no chance of getting out however. Tape the head and nozzle shut when it's not in use., Taking a cooking syringe, suck up the mixture and inject it in the hole you drilled. Repeat this until all of your mixture is in the can.









A funnel is a solid alternative in lieu of a syringe., Epoxy will be used to patch up the hole you drilled in the can. Take a bit of it and dab over the hole. Wipe off the excess material you don't need, and allow it a few minutes to settle before you continue.









It's a good idea to wear a set of gloves while handling epoxy.

, While the epoxy is still solidifying, push your tire valve through the hole. This will give you a quick way to pressurize the can. The hole you covered with epoxy won't let the air escape once it's inside. If you give it a few minutes to sit, the epoxy should hold the tire valve in place.








Make sure you push the tire valve most of the way in. It needs to be able to poke past the epoxy through to the other side.

, Painting over the old can will distinguish it from all other cans. This is especially important if there's a risk that someone might mistake the pepper spray for the can's written contents.









Spray painting a can black will make it more concealable.
Adding a decal can make your homemade can look more professional. It helps to state clearly on the can what it is.

, Fill it up with air, and keep your eye on the pressure gauge. As the pressure increase, you should be able to tell a difference in the feel of the can.








, Practice your aim on a hard surface once you get the hang of spraying before you need to use it in real-life. Make sure the can nozzle is facing away from you, and squeeze the trigger lightly. Shoot the pepper spray in short, controlled bursts. If you need to use it against an assailant, you'll only need a little bit to incapacitate him.









Most pepper spray cans have an effective range of about 10 feet.The effects of pepper spray last from 45 minutes to an hour.However, lingering effects will last up to three hours.

, Pepper spray is a volatile substance. Like any pressurized contents, you need to make sure it's store in a temperate area where it won't be affected by extremes in heat. Keep it locked away in a cupboard or climate-controlled storage room when you're not using it.


Just as importantly, keep the spray out of reach from others.

Pick the right time of year for repotting your plant.,
Remove the old soil from the tree's roots.,
Remove some of the bonsai tree's roots.,
Reposition the tree in its pot.,
Water the bonsai tree.",How to Repot Bonsai Trees," The primary reason for re-potting a bonsai tree is when its root system begins to choke itself off. To determine whether or not this is happening, gently lift the entire tree from its pot. If the roots have begun circling around themselves, you need to re-pot. Eventually the roots will grow thick enough to displace all of the soil within the root system, and the tree will starve.;
, Repotting should ideally be performed in early spring. At this time, the tree is not under the pressure of maintaining full foliage, and thus will be subject to less of a shock by repotting. The vigorous growth that begins in spring will also help the plant to heal any damage caused through repotting.

, Once you have lifted the tree from its pot and decided to repot it, you'll need to remove as much of the old soil as possible. Knock the soil out of the root system either using your fingers or a specialized tool called a root hook. Gently disentangle the roots if they have grown thickly together.

, After untangling the roots, prune back some of the longer ones to keep the tree from outgrowing its pot. At this point, you should also remove any roots that appear to be rotting. As a general rule, avoid removing more than 25 percent of the tree's total mass of roots.

, When the roots are trimmed, gently lower the tree back into the pot. Fill the pot to the brim with your desired potting mix. Work the soil into the root structure so that there are no air pockets remaining between the roots.


A typical bonsai potting mix will consist of akadama, gravel, and compost in about a 2-1-1 ratio. Akadama is a special kind of granular clay produced especially for potting bonsai trees. You may need to adjust this ratio depending on your climate and tree species.

, Watering the tree after repotting will help the soil to settle. Keep the tree protected from strong winds for a month or so after repotting.

Know the basics of tree growth.,
Remove weeds.,
Decide your intended canopy size (how large you want your tree’s canopy to be).,
Prune the crown.,
Defoliate.,
Use Aesthetic enhancement.,
Redesign the tree when you buy it.",How to Prune a Bonsai Tree," A tree tends to concentrate growth related activities near the tip so that the tree grows higher, as trees compete for sunlight in a forest. This is called Apical Dominance and helps the tree survive.  However, this results in disproportionate growth and lower branches being neglected, an undesirable side effect. To counter this regular pruning needs to be done.;
, You may occasionally have weed grow around your bonsai especially when you have just bought it from a nursery or is planted outdoors. Gently uproot the weed making sure that you do not accidentally damage the bonsai's root. Young plants are especially susceptible to root damage as their roots are tender.

, Then start pruning by cutting outgrown branches and/or shoots using twig shears or a normal cutter. Don’t be afraid to prune areas at the top, as this will force the tree to distribute growth evenly.


Shoots need to be pruned throughout the year to maintain shape. Cut old leaves and branches to force the tree to grow new ones.
Cover the bruises you make with cut paste to prevent excessive loss of sap.
Water the tree thoroughly after it has been pruned.

, Occasionally the tree’s top branch will need to cut the crown of the tree which has overgrown and is preventing light from reaching the bottom branches. Gently thin out the crown by carefully cutting, removing small branches along with the shoots.


Mark out the pieces of branches you want to remove with a marker or a wire.
With a strong bonsai scissor or branch cutter, remove the identified branches and shoots.
Dead stubs from the last season can be removed by a pair of Knob cutters.
Make sure your cuts are along the flow of sap as this helps the tree recover quicker with fewer scars.

, The Bonsai plant needs to be defoliated so as to get rid of old long leaves and encourage the growth of smaller more aesthetically pleasing leaves. This is primarily done to deciduous trees just after a new flush has settled in. All the leaves are cut away at the base of each leaf. Make sure you leave the stalk alone. New smaller leaves will now grow in their place. This is a risky technique, as if defoliating is not done during the right time period the plant may never recover.

, To give the plant a certain look, you must first have a firm idea of what you want. Bend thick branches or cut them out if they are too thick and don't affect the new look. If there are two similar branches together cut one of them and keep the other.


Remove branches which have unnatural twists and turns and look displeasing to the eye.

, When you buy a tree from a nursery it has probably been allowed to grow naturally and only pruned to shape it for sale. In such a case you can cut back as far as the base of the tree (called creation pruning). Sometime later new buds will form on the stub, from which you can choose a new 'leader' stem and cut away the rest.


All cuts should be made horizontal.
When cutting branches make sure to leave a small stub, which can be removed after the tree stops bleeding. Unless it is a deciduous tree, whose stub can be immediately reduced with a knob cutter.

Select a tree species.,
Decide whether to plant the tree from seed.,
Consider foraging for a bonsai tree.,
Choose from among trees that have already been partially trained.",How to Grow and Care for a Bonsai Tree1," The type of tree you grow should be reliant on the environment where you'll be keeping it. Your region's climate and your home environment should both be taken into account when you're deciding which species of tree to grow. To be on the safe side, select a species that is indigenous to your part of the world.


Deciduous species such as Chinese or Japanese elms, magnolias, oaks, and crabapple trees are good selections if you'd like to grow your bonsai outside. Just be sure to pick out a species that can grow to full size in your region.If you prefer coniferous trees, junipers, pines, spruces, or cedars all make excellent choices.
If you want to grow a tree indoors (or if you live in a hot climate), consider a tropical species. Jade, snowrose, and olive trees may be grown as bonsais.;
, Planting a bonsai tree from seed is a slow but rewarding process. If you plant a tree, you'll have to allow it time to take root and grow strong before you can begin trimming and training. Depending on the species of tree you grow, this could take up to five years.Many find the extra wait and effort to be worth it, since seeds are so inexpensive and the grower is able to control the tree at every stage of growth. To grow a bonsai from seed, take the following steps:


Buy a package of bonsai tree seeds. Soak them overnight before planting them in soil with good drainage and the right nutrient composition for your tree species. Plant the tree in a training container (as opposed to a ceramic display container, which is only used once the tree has been trained and reached maturity).
Give the planted tree the correct amount of sun, water, and a consistent temperature, again dictated by the specific species of tree.
Allow the tree to become sturdy and strong before you begin to train it.

, This method of acquiring a bonsai tree is highly valued, since caring for a bonsai tree you find in the wild requires a lot of skill and knowledge. If collecting a tree that has had its start in nature appeals to you, consider the following factors:


Select a tree with a sturdy trunk, but one that is still quite young. Older trees won't adapt well to being placed in a container.
Choose a tree with roots that spread evenly in every direction, rather than growing laterally or entangled with the roots of other trees.
Dig around the tree and extract a large amount of soil along with the roots. This will prevent the tree from dying of shock when it is moved to a container.Plant the tree in a large training container. Care for it according to the needs of the particular species. Wait about a year for the roots to get used to the container before you begin training it.

, This is the easiest way to begin the art of bonsai, but it is also the most expensive. Bonsai trees that have been grown from seed and partially trained have already received a lot of time and care, so they are usually quite pricey. Look online and in local nurseries and plant shops for a bonsai tree to bring home with you.


If you buy a partially-trained bonsai from a shop, talk with the person who trained it about its specific needs.
When you bring the bonsai home, give it a few weeks to adjust to the new setting before you begin working with it.

Know how often to transplant.,
If transplanting to a new pot, then choose one that will allow the roots to grow well.

,
Remove from the pot.,
Use a pair of clean scissors or garden snips to cut away two-thirds of the roots.,
Place wire drainage mesh at the base of the pot.,
Pass some wire up through the base.,
Fill the base with coarse soil to one quarter full.,
Put the tree back into the pot.,
Run coarse soil through a sieve.,
Water thoroughly.

,
Plant moss with tweezers into the soil but not around the base of the tree trunk.,
Repeat every few years as needed.",How to Transplant a Bonsai," On average, about every two years is a good space of time before transplanting but it will depend on the bonsai you're growing. If in doubt, ask at your local nursery.;
,, You can use a bamboo skewer or similar item to help you untangle the roots and remove loose soil.

, You may even want to cut more. Cut off roots that grow upward and any thick roots that are growing down. This will give the impression from the top that the tree is anchored firmly. Leave any thin roots of around the same size. Repeated transplanting will help the sense of stability over the years.

, Pass a thin wire through and secure underneath to keep the drainage mesh in place. Cut off any excess wire.

, This is for securing the bonsai.

, The soil should be porous to allow the passage of air and able to retain moisture.

, Check how it is sitting and reorient it as required. The trunk base should be placed a little higher than the rim of the pot. Fasten the wire that you place facing upwards, to secure the tree in place. Cut off any excess wire and bend the wire down into the soil to prevent injury.

, Mix this with finer soil and river sand. Fill the pot to about four-fifths full; use tweezers to push the soil in, and to create airspace between the roots.


The soil should finish just below the rim of the pot.

,, Gently pat down using your fingertips.

, Always refresh the soil completely and discard of the old soil.

"
Pay attention to the seasons.,
Give the tree morning sun and afternoon shade.,
Protect the tree from extreme temperatures.,
Provide food and water.",How to Grow and Care for a Bonsai Tree2," Bonsai trees, like all trees and plants, react to the change in seasons. If you're keeping a bonsai tree outside, it will have an even stronger reaction to the change in temperature, sunlight, and the amount of rainfall in the region. In some regions there are four distinct seasons, and in others the seasonal changes are more subtle. In any case, understand the way your tree species reacts to the seasons in your region, and let that information guide the way you care for it.


Trees lay dormant during the winter; they aren't producing leaves or growing, so they don't use as much nutrition. During this season, watering the tree is about the only care it needs. Avoid trimming it too much, since it won't be able to replace the depleted nutrients until spring.
In spring, trees begin using the nutrients they stored during the winter to sprout new leaves and grow. Since your tree is in transition during this time of year, it's a good time to repot the plant (adding extra nutrients to the soil) and begin trimming.
Trees continue to grow during the summer, using up the rest of their stored nutrients. Be sure to water yours well during this period of time.
In the fall, tree growth slows, and the nutrients begin accumulating again. This is a good time for both trimming and repotting.

, Your bonsai tree's light needs depends on the species and your climate, but most will thrive in a location that receives morning sun. Turn the tree 90 degrees every few days so all of the tree foliage can receive an equal amount of light.Indoor trees may need a light shade cloth over the window during hot, bright summer months.

, During the summer, it's fine for the tree to spend the majority of time outside. Bring it inside overnight when temperatures dip below about 40 degrees. In preparation for the winter, get your tree acclimated to spending more time indoors by moving it inside for a few hours at a time, and increasing the time it spends indoors every day until you bring it inside entirely.

, Fertilize the tree with a special fertilizer meant to keep bonsai trees healthy. When the soil begins to look dusty or dry, water the bonsai. The exact watering frequency depends on the tree species and the season. You may need to provide a little water every day during the summer, but only water once every few days during cold winter months.

"
"
Choose a training style.,
Train the trunk and branches.,
Prune and trim the tree.",How to Grow and Care for a Bonsai Tree3," There are several traditional training styles that you can choose for your tree. Some are meant to resemble a tree in nature, while others are more stylistic. There are dozens of bonsai styles to choose from, although the training container you use may limit your options.Here are some of the most popular:



Chokkan. This is the formal upright form; think of a tree growing strong and straight with branches that stretch evenly around it.

Moyohgi. This is the informal upright form; the tree has a more natural slant, rather than growing straight upward.

Shakan. This is the slanting form - the tree looks windblown and striking.

Bunjingi. This is the literati form. The trunk is often long and twisted, with minimal branches., ""Training"" the young bonsai tree involves gentle bending of the trunk and branches to guide their growth. Wrap the tree in wire to hold it in this position, as described here:


Use annealed copper wire for coniferous trees, and aluminum wire for deciduous trees.You'll need heavier gauge wire toward the bottom of the trunk, and finer wire for the branches.
Firmly anchor the wire by wrapping it around a limb once or twice. Do not wrap too tightly, which can damage the tree.
Wrap the wire at a 45 degree angle, using one hand to steady the tree while you work.
Trees have different wiring needs depending on the time of year and whether they have just been repotted.As time goes on and the tree grows and begins to take on the shape you have designed, you'll have to rewire the tree and continue to train it until it holds the shape you want without the help of wire.

, Use a small pruning tool to strategically clip off leaves, buds, and parts of branches to help the tree grow a certain way. Each time you prune, growth is stimulated on another part of the tree. Knowing where to prune and how often is part of the art of bonsai, and learning how to do it takes a lot of practice.When you transfer from a larger container to a smaller one, trim the roots to the shape of the pot. Don't prune the roots until the trunk has reached the desired size.
Prune in the summer to direct new growth. If you need to remove an entire limb, wait until autumn when the tree is less active. Do maintenance pruning to remove dead branches in late winter or early spring.
Over-pruning a tree can cause damage, so be careful not to clip away too much.

"
"
Move the tree to a display container.,
Consider adding other features to the container.,
Place the bonsai on a display stand.",How to Grow and Care for a Bonsai Tree4," When you deem the tree's shape to be finished, it's time to move it away from the training container. Beautiful ceramic and wooden containers are available for you to display your bonsai to best effect. Choose one that complements the bonsai style you have created. Be sure to repot it carefully so that the roots are not damaged, and use a container big enough to hold the amount of soil (and nutrients) that are necessary for the tree to stay healthy.


Choose a container that is as long as your tree is tall. The thicker the trunk of your tree, the deeper the container should be., While the bonsai should be the star of the show, adding a few additional elements can add to the beauty of your bonsai display. Stones and rocks, shells, and tiny plants can be used to make the tree look as though it is part of a forest or beach scene.


Be sure not to crowd the roots with stones or other objects.
Adding some moss is a great way to create an intriguing display.

, A beautiful bonsai deserves to be displayed like any other work of art. Choose a wooden or metal display stand and place it against a blank wall, so that the bonsai will stand out. Placing it near a window is a good idea, since the bonsai will continue to need sunlight while it's on display. Continue watering, fertilizing, and caring for the bonsai, and your work of art will stay alive for many years.

Propagate new bonsai trees from cuttings.",How to Care for a Chinese Elm Bonsai Tree," Ideally, the tree should be kept in temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (15 and 20 degrees Celsius).During the summer, you can usually keep the bonsai outdoors. You'll need to bring it indoors once temperatures start dropping below 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) during the day and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) during the night.
During the winter months, it might actually help the tree if it is consistently kept between temperatures of 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 15 degrees Celsius). These temperatures are low enough to send the tree into dormancy but high enough to prevent the tree from dying.;
, Place the bonsai in a spot that receives direct sunlight in the morning and indirect sunlight or shade in the afternoon.


Morning sunlight isn't too intense, but direct sunlight in the afternoon can be too strong and may burn the leaves of the bonsai, especially during the summer months.
If you decide to move an indoor bonsai outdoors, let it acclimate to direct sunlight slowly to prevent the leaves from burning. Keep it in the sun for longer periods of time day after day until it seems strong enough to spend an entire day in the sun.
Sunlight also encourages the leaves of the Chinese elm to stay smaller.

, Keep the Chinese elm in an indoor or outdoor area that receives plenty of air flow.


When keeping the bonsai inside, place it in front of an open window or place a small fan nearby to increase the amount of air movement.
While air circulation is good for the bonsai, you should also note that cold drafts and winds can cause damage. When you keep it outside, position it behind a taller plant or structure to help protect it against nasty gusts., Stick your finger ½ inch (1.25 cm) deep into the soil. If the soil is dry this deep down, you should give it a little water.


You will probably need to water the bonsai every day or two during the spring and summer, but this frequency will probably decrease during the late autumn and winter months.
When you water the bonsai, take it to the sink and let it shower it with water from above. Let the water drain out through the bottom drainage holes several times.
Bonsai, in general, have a habit of drying out quickly due to the coarse soil and shallow container they grow in.
Note that specific watering schedules will vary on a case-by-case basis, so you should test the soil for dryness rather than relying on a single schedule.
You should also consider misting the tree gently once or twice a week. Doing so will keep the soil moist. This routine should not replace regular waterings, though.

, During the growing season, apply a fertilizer formulated for bonsai trees.


Note that the growing season is spring through fall.
Wait until after the bonsai begins to produce new light green growth before you start feeding it with fertilizer.
Apply a fertilizer that contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as indicated by its formula number (example: 10-10-10).
If using liquid fertilizer, apply it every two weeks. If using pellet fertilizer, apply it every month.
Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package to determine the proper amount to use. Most fertilizers should be applied when the plant is being watered.
Reduce the frequency of feedings once the growth slows down in the mid-to-late summer.

, Chinese elm bonsai trees fall victim to the same pests that any house plant can face. Treat the tree with a gentle, organic pesticide as soon as you see signs of a pest problem.


Your bonsai might have a problem if you notice abnormal leaf dropping or stickiness on the foliage. Visible insects are, of course, another telling sign.
Mix a solution of 1 tsp (5 ml) liquid dish soap and 1 quart (1 L) tepid water. Spray this mixture on the leaves of the bonsai, then rinse it off with clean water. Repeat this procedure every few days until the problem goes away.
Neem oil spray can be used instead of a soap solution, if desired.

, Chinese elms are especially prone to a fungal disease known as black spot. Treat this or any other disease with an appropriate fungicide as soon as possible.


Block spot appears as dark spots on the leaves of the bonsai tree. Spray with a fungicide according to label instructions, then remove any leaves that are more than half damaged. Do not mist the tree during this time.
Depending on the severity of the infection, you may need to treat the bonsai multiple times.

, Remove dead leaves from the soil as the bonsai naturally sheds them.


You should also keep dust off the leaves to promote good air circulation.
Keeping the tree clean is a good way to keep it healthy and protect it against both disease and pests.

, If you want the bonsai tree to grow in a specific form, you will need to train the branches by wrapping wire around them and the trunk of the Chinese elm.


Wait until new shoots become slightly woody. Do not wire them when they are still fresh and green.
You can wire the Chinese elm into most bonsai styles, but the classical umbrella shape is recommended, especially if this is your first bonsai.
To train a bonsai:

Wrap heavy gauge wire around the trunk of the tree. Wrap thin, light wire around the stems or branches. The branches should still be pliable during this time.
Wind the wire around at a 45 degree angle and do not wrap it too tightly.
Bend the wire and its corresponding branches into the shape you desire.
Readjust the wire every six months. Once the branches are no longer pliable, the wire can be removed.



, Wait until new shoots extend out by three or four nodes, then trim the shoots back to one or two nodes.Do not let the branches grow too much longer than four nodes unless you are trying to thicken or strengthen it.
The frequency with which you need to prune the bonsai will vary on a case by case basis. For best results, do not rely on a strict schedule and simply prune the tree once it starts looking out of shape.
Pruning new shoots will allow them to divide, ultimately creating a fuller, bushier bonsai rather than a thin, lanky one.

, Suckers appear at the base of the trunk and should be cut away at soil level as they appear.


Suckers grow out from the root and deprive the main plant of nutrients.
If you want to grow a secondary branch or trunk in the area of the sucker, however, you can let it grow instead of removing it.

, Doing so will give the bonsai enough time to recover from the shock of pruning before undergoing the shock of repotting.


Note that major pruning is also usually done when the bonsai tree is at its strongest. This means early spring or early summer.

, Younger trees may need to be repotted every year, while older trees generally need to be repotted every two to four years.


Repot the plant during the late winter or early spring. Place it into a slightly larger planter with the same quality soil used in its current container.
Consider spreading a layer of pebbles in the bottom of the container before repotting the tree. These pebbles can prevent the roots from sitting in soil, thereby preventing root rot, as well.
You can prune the roots as you repot the tree, but avoid any heavy root pruning. The Chinese elm may go into shock if the roots are pruned back too far.
After placing the bonsai in its new pot, water the soil thoroughly. Keep the bonsai in a shady spot for two to four weeks.

, You can grow new Chinese elm bonsai trees from 6-inch (15-cm) cuttings taken from established trees in the summer.


Take the cuttings using sharp, clean scissors.
Place a fresh cutting in a glass of water. Roots should develop within a few days.
Repot this cutting in a planter containing two parts loam, one part peat moss, and one part sand. Water regularly until the plant establishes itself.

Determine which season your tree should be trimmed during.,
Ensure that the tree has enough time to recover from the pruning.,
Determine which branches should be pruned.,
Trim the bonsai tree's roots accordingly.",How to Trim a Bonsai," Bonsai trees should only be pruned during a certain time of year. This is so that the tree can adequately heal the wound created during pruning. The ideal pruning season will vary between tree species, but will usually be during the spring and summer when the plant is growing most vigorously. Check online or with a nursery to determine the pruning season for your species.;
, Remember: pruning any plant creates a wound that leaves the plant open to the risk of infection and requires extra energy to heal. Because bonsai trees must be pruned so often to maintain their shape, it is important that you schedule major trimmings as far away from each other as possible.

, Trimming a bonsai tree's branches is a matter of controlling the direction of growth. This is done for 2 reasons: for aesthetic interest and for structural stability.


For aesthetic reasons, you will want to remove any branches that will clutter and cloud the tree's artistic line. These would include branches that cross each other, those that grow at very sharp angles, and those that grow across the trunk and interrupt its continuous line.
For structural reasons, you want to leave branches intact that will increase growth in weak areas. For example, leave branches in place on thinner areas of the trunk to help thicken it. If the trunk leans heavily in one direction, remove branches in that direction while preserving those in the opposite direction.

, The above ground and underground portions of your bonsai tree will need to be kept in relative proportion. Make sure that you occasionally trim back the root system of the tree to prevent it from growing too vigorously. This quick growth can force you to prune more often than you'd like, which can expose the plant to infection and rot.

Airlayering will work best in spring (April – May).;
, Growing ficus plants from seed in spring also works easily in most cases.

, Ficus plants are available as cheap bonsai or pot plants in nearly every home-store, building supplies store or nursery.


Be aware that mass-produced cheap bonsai in most cases bring a lot of problems with them, like ugly scars from rusty wire that bit into the bark, unattractive shapes, often poorly grafted branches in odd positions, bad soil and sometimes inappropriate pots without drainage holes. On the other hand, specialised bonsai traders offer everything from young plants, pre-bonsai and pre-styled ficus trees up to high-value bonsai, in most cases well-tended and of good quality.

, The ficus bonsai tree is an indoor bonsai which cannot endure frost. It can be kept outside in summer, if temperatures are above 15 degrees C (59ºF).

, This plant needs lots of light. Full sun is ideal, in the house as well as outside. A very shady position is unfavourable.


If the tree is outside, expose it to the ultraviolet radiation gradually or make sure it is defoliated before placing the tree outside.

, Figs can endure low humidity due to their thick, waxy leaves, but they prefer a higher humidity and need extremely high humidity to develop aerial roots.

, This means it should be given water generously whenever the soil gets slightly dry. The Bonsai Ficus can tolerate occasional over- or underwatering.


Soft water with room temperature is perfect.
Daily misting to maintain humidity is advised, but don't overdo this, otherwise fungal problems can appear.
The warmer the position of the fig during winter, the more water it needs. If it overwinters at a cooler place it only needs to be kept slightly moist.

, Fertilize every two to four weeks during winter (if the growth doesn't stop). Liquid fertilizer can be used as well as organic fertilizer pellets.

, Regular pruning is necessary to retain the tree’s shape.

,


Leaf pruning can be used to reduce leaf size, as some ficus bonsai species normally grow large leaves.
If a considerable thickening of the trunk is desired, the ficus can be left to grow freely for one or two years. The strong cuts that are necessary afterwards don't affect the ficus' health and new shoots will grow from old wood.
Larger wounds should be covered with cut paste.

, Wiring of thin to medium-strong ficus branches is easy as they are very flexible. The wires should be checked regularly though, as they cut into the bark very quickly. Strong branches should be shaped with guy-wires because those can be left on the tree for a much longer period.

, So branches, roots or trunks can fuse together and form appealing structures. You can use this feature for example to tie a lot of young plants together and let them fuse to build one strong single trunk. 
Fig trees also react very well to approach-grafting of branches and roots and to other grafting techniques. If the growing conditions are ideal, even aerial roots taken from one part of the tree can be grafted in a different position.

, The grower can work on fig trees with nearly unlimited creativity, which increases the appeal of ficus as a bonsai plant considerably. 

, Most ficus bonsai trees can produce aerial roots in their natural habitat, which are often presented in appealing bonsai creations with many aerial root pillars or root over rock styles. To enable aerial root growth in your home, a humidity of nearly 100% must be achieved artificially. You can use a glass cover, fish tank or a construction with transparent sheets for this purpose.


Aerial roots grow down vertically from the branches and when they reach the soil they develop into strong pillar-like trunks.

, Use a basic soil mixture. Ficus tolerates root-pruning very well.

Follow a calendar of care.",How to Make a Western Hemlock Bonsai Tree," Find one that is less than 1 foot (0.3 m) tall, at a garden store or find one in the wild.;
, Is the tree damaged (many wounds, missing needles, exposed roots, and/or only a few branches)? Is it healthy (has lots of needles, lots of new growth, and intact bark)? It's always good to know how your tree is doing.

, Major pruning should be done in late winter. Be sure to cover wounds with sealant.


You should also prune the tree in mid to late spring. When growth is too prolific, prune back some of the new growth. New growth is easy to spot, as it is bright green.

, Once every two years, before major growth for the year starts, hemlocks should be repotted.

, Once most growth has ceased, small gauge wire (1/3 of the width of each branch to be wired) should be carefully wrapped around each branch that you want to move into a different position. Don't worry about knocking off a few needles in the process.

, Depending on the climate where you keep the bonsai, you may need to put it in a greenhouse to prevent hard freezing, but make sure that the tree stays cold enough that it reaches dormancy for the winter.

, Remove all of the wires from summer and rewire the tree.

, Keep a calendar with all the important dates to remember from this page.

Many woody perennials and even some tropical plants can be made into bonsai trees, but not every species will be appropriate for your unique location. When selecting a species, it's important to consider the climate that the tree will be grown in. For instance, some trees die in freezing weather, while others actually require the temperature to drop below freezing so that they can enter a dormant state and prepare for the spring. Before starting a bonsai tree, make sure the species you've chosen can live in your area - especially if you plan on having an outdoor tree. The staff at your local garden supply store will be able to help you if you're unsure.


One particularly beginner-friendly variety of bonsai tree is the juniper. These evergreens are hardy, surviving all across the northern hemisphere and even in the more temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. In addition, juniper trees are easy to raise - they respond well to pruning and other ""training"" efforts and, because they are evergreens, never lose their leaves. They are rather slow growing, however.
Other conifers commonly cultivated as bonsai trees include pines, spruces, and cedars of many varieties. Deciduous (leafy) trees are another possibility - Japanese maples are especially beautiful, as are magnolias, elms, and oaks. Finally, some non-woody tropical plants, like jade and snowrose, are good choices for indoor environments in cool or temperate climates.;
, The needs of indoor and outdoor bonsai trees can vary drastically. Generally, indoor environments are drier and receive less light than outdoor environments, so you'll want to choose trees with lower light and moisture requirements. Below are listed some of the most common varieties of bonsai tree, grouped by their appropriateness for either indoor or outdoor environments:Indoor: Ficus, Hawaiian Umbrella, Serissa, Gardenia, Camellia, Kingsville Boxwood.

Outdoor: Juniper, Cypress, Cedar, Maple, Birch, Beech, Ginkgo, Larch, Elm.
Note that temperate species require winter dormancy or the tree will eventually die. They cannot be grown indoors for long periods of time.

, Bonsai trees come in a wide variety of sizes. Full-grown trees can be as small as 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall to as large 3 feet (0.9 m) tall, depending on their species. If you're choosing to grow your bonsai tree from a seedling or a cutting from another tree, they can start off even smaller. Larger plants require more water, soil, and sunlight, so make sure that you have all the necessary amenities before making your purchase.


Just a few things you'll want to consider when deciding on the size of your bonsai tree:

The size of the container you'll be using
The space you have available at your home or office
The availability of sunlight at your home or office
The amount of care you'll be able to invest in your tree (larger trees take longer to prune)



, Once you have decided which kind and what size of bonsai you would like, you can go to a nursery or a bonsai shop and select the plant that will become your bonsai tree. When choosing a plant, look for a vibrant, healthy green leaf or needle color to make sure that the plant is healthy (however, keep in mind that deciduous trees can have different-colored leaves in the fall). Finally, when you've narrowed your search to the healthiest, prettiest plants, imagine what each plant will look like after it is pruned. Part of the fun of growing a bonsai tree is gently pruning and shaping it until it's exactly how you want it - this can take years. Pick a tree whose natural shape lends itself to the pruning and/or shaping plan you have in mind.


Note that if you choose to grow your bonsai tree from a seed, you'll have the ability to control your tree's growth in nearly every stage of its development. However, it can take up to 5 years (depending on the species of tree) for a bonsai tree to grow from a seed into a full-grown tree.Because of this, if you're interested in pruning or shaping your tree (relatively) immediately, you'll be better off buying a grown plant.
Another option you have is to grow your bonsai tree from a cutting. Cuttings are branches cut from growing trees and transplanted to new soil to start a separate (but genetically identical)plant. Cuttings are a good compromise choice - they don't take as long to grow as seeds, but they still offer a good deal of control over the tree's growth.

, The hallmark feature of bonsai trees is that they are planted in pots that restrict their growth. The most important factor in deciding which pot to use is to make sure the pot is large enough to allow enough soil to cover the roots of the plant. When you water your tree, it absorbs moisture from the soil through its roots. You do not want to have such a small amount of soil in the pot that the tree roots can not retain moisture. To prevent root rot, you'll also want to ensure your pot has one or more drainage holes on the bottom. If not, you can also drill these yourself.


While your pot must be large enough to support your tree, you'll also want to maintain a neat, tidy aesthetic for your bonsai tree. Overly-large pots can dwarf the tree itself, giving a bizarre or mismatched appearance. Buy a pot big enough for the tree's roots, but not much bigger - the idea is for the pot to complement the tree aesthetically, but to be relatively unobtrusive visually.
Some prefer to grow their bonsai trees in plain, practical containers, then transfer them to prettier containers when they're full-grown. This is an especially useful process if your species of bonsai tree is a fragile one, as it allows you to put off the purchase of the ""nice"" pot until your tree is healthy and beautiful.

, If you've just bought a bonsai from the store and it came in an unappealing plastic container or you've been growing your own bonsai tree and finally want to put it in the perfect pot, you'll need to prepare it before transplanting it. First, ensure the tree has been pruned to the shape you desire. If you'd like the tree to grow a certain way after you re-pot it, wrap a sturdy wire around the tree or branch to gently direct its growth. You want your tree in tip-top shape before you transplant it to a new pot, which can be taxing for the plant.


Know that trees with seasonal life cycles (for instance, many deciduous trees) are best transplanted in the spring. Rising temperatures in the spring cause many plants to enter a state of increased growth, which means they'll recover from pruning and root trimming faster.
You may want to reduce watering before re-potting. Dry, loose soil can be much easier to work with than damp soil., Carefully remove the plant from its current pot, making sure not to break or tear its main stem. You may want to use a potting shovel to help pry the plant out. Most of the roots will be cut before the plant is re-potted into the bonsai pot. However, to have a clear view of the roots, it's usually necessary to brush away any of the dirt stuck to them. Clean the roots, brushing away any clumps of dirt obscuring your vision. Root rakes, chopsticks, tweezers, and similar tools are helpful for this process.


The roots don't have to be spotless - just clean enough that you're able to see what you're doing while you prune them.

, If their growth is not adequately controlled, bonsai trees can easily outgrow their containers. To ensure your bonsai tree remains manageable and tidy, prune its roots when you pot it. Cut any large, thick roots and any upward-facing roots, leaving a network of long, slender roots that will sit near the surface of the soil. Water is absorbed from the root tips, so, in a small container, many thin root strands are generally better than a single large, deep one.

, Before placing the tree in the pot, ensure it has a base of fresh, new soil to sit on that gives it the desired height. At the bottom of your empty pot, add a layer of coarse-grain soil as a base. Then, add a finer, looser growing medium or soil above this. Use a soil or medium that drains well - regular garden soil can hold too much water and may drown the roots. Leave a small amount of space at the top of your pot so that you can cover your tree's roots.

, Position the tree in your new pot in the desired orientation. Finish adding your fine, well-draining soil or growing medium to the pot, making sure to cover the tree's root system. If desired, you may add a final layer of moss or gravel. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, this can help hold the tree in place.


If your tree isn't staying upright in your new pot, run a heavy gauge wire from the bottom of the pot through the drainage holes on the bottom of the pot. Tie the wire around the root system in order to hold the plant in place.
You may want to install mesh screens over the pot's drainage holes to prevent soil erosion, which occurs when water carries soil out of the pot via the drainage holes.

, Your new tree has just undergone a radical, somewhat traumatic process. For 2-3 weeks after re-potting your tree, leave it in a semi-shaded area, protected from the wind or harsh, direct sunlight.Water the plant, but don't use fertilizer until the roots have re-established themselves. By giving your tree a ""breather"" after re-potting, you allow it to adapt to its new home, and, in time, thrive.


As noted above, deciduous trees with yearly life cycles experience a period of intensified growth in the spring. Because of this, it's best to re-pot deciduous trees in the spring after their winter dormancy has ended. If your deciduous tree is an indoor plant, after allowing it to take root following a re-potting, you may want to move it outside where the rising temperature and increased sunlight can trigger its natural ""growth spurt.""
When your bonsai tree is established, you may want to experiment with adding other small plants to its pot. If carefully arranged and maintained (like your tree), these additions can allow you to craft a perfectly pleasing tableau. Try using plants that are native to the same area as your bonsai tree so that one water and light regimen will support all the plants in the pot equally well.

, Growing a bonsai tree from a single seed is an extremely long and slow process. Depending on the type of tree you grow, it can take up to 4-5 years for the tree's trunk to become just 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.Some seeds also require precisely controlled conditions for germination. However, this method is also perhaps the ultimate bonsai tree experience insofar as it allows you to have total control over the plant's growth from the moment it breaks through the soil. To start, buy seeds of your desired species of tree from a gardening store or gather them in nature.


Many deciduous trees, like oaks, beeches, and maples, have instantly-recognizable seed pods (acorns, etc.) that release from the tree on a yearly basis. Because of the ease of obtaining their seeds, these types of trees make great choices if you're aiming to grow a bonsai tree from the seed.
Try to get fresh seeds. The time window in which tree seeds can germinate is often smaller than that of flower or vegetable seeds. For instance, oak seeds (acorns) are ""freshest"" when they're harvested in early autumn and they retain some of their green color., Once you have gathered suitable seeds for your bonsai tree, you must care for them to ensure they germinate (sprout). In non-tropical areas with defined seasons, seeds usually fall from trees in autumn, then lie dormant through the winter before sprouting in spring. Seeds from trees that are native to these areas are usually biologically coded to germinate only after they experience the cold temperatures of winter and the gradually increasing warmth of spring. In these cases, it's necessary to either expose your seed to these conditions or to simulate them in your refrigerator.


If you live in a temperate environment with defined seasons, you can simply bury your tree's seed in a small pot full of soil and keep it outside throughout the winter and into the spring. If you don't, you can keep your seeds in a refrigerator for the winter. Put your seeds in a plastic zip-lock bag with a loose, dampened growth medium (for example, vermiculite) and take them out in the spring when you see sprouts emerging.

To simulate the natural cycle of gradually decreasing, then increasing temperature that takes place from the late autumn to early spring, place your bag of seeds at the bottom of the refrigerator initially. Over the next two weeks, gradually move it up, shelf by shelf, until it's at the top, right next to the cooling unit. Then, at the end of winter, reverse the process, moving the bag down shelf-by-shelf., When your seedlings have begun to sprout, you're ready to begin nurturing them in a small soil-filled container of your choosing. If you allowed your seeds to naturally germinate outdoors, they can generally remain in the pot that you germinated them in. If not, transfer your healthy seeds from the refrigerator to a pre-filled pot or seed tray. Dig a small hole for your seed and bury it so that its main sprout points up and its taproot points down. Immediately water your seed. Over time, try to keep the soil around the seed damp, but not sopping wet or mud-like, as this can cause the plant to rot.


Don't use fertilizer until about 5 or 6 weeks after the plants have established themselves in their new containers. Start small, using only very minor amounts of fertilizer, or you may ""burn"" the plant's young roots, damaging them with overexposure to the chemicals in the fertilizer.

, As your seeds continue to grow, it's important not to expose them directly to cold temperatures or you'll risk losing your young plants. If you live in an area with a warm spring, you may cautiously introduce your new seedlings to a warm but sheltered spot outdoors, ensuring your trees aren't exposed to harsh wind or constant sunlight, provided your species of tree is one that can naturally survive in your geographical area. If you're growing tropical plants or germinating your seeds out of season, however, you may find that it's better to keep your plants indoors or in a greenhouse where it's warmer.


Regardless of where you keep your young seedlings, it's important to ensure they receive frequent, but not excessive watering. Keep the soil damp, but not soggy.

, Carry on with your regimen of watering and cautious sun exposure as your seedling grows. Deciduous trees will sprout two small leaves called cotyledonsdirectly from the seed before developing true leaves and continuing to grow. As your tree grows (again, usually this process takes years) you may gradually introduce it to larger and larger containers to accommodate its growth until it reaches the size that you'd like for your bonsai tree.


Once your tree is fairly established, you can leave it outdoors in a spot where it receives morning sun and afternoon shade, provided that your species of tree is one that can naturally survive in your geographical location. Tropical plants and other fragile bonsai varieties may need to be kept indoors perpetually if your local climate isn't suitable.

There are many possible cultivars of Japanese maple. Select according to what you're wanting––some will grow larger than others, some have rough bark and some require grafting.
It's a good idea to take several cuttings; that way, you will be assured that one will take well (sometimes the roots are weak, rot or simply don't form).
Note that red-leafed cultivars of the Japanese maple tend to have weak root systems and are usually grafted onto other rootstock. Unless you know how to graft, or have someone knowledgeable to help you, it might be a good idea to avoid the red-leafed cultivars until you are more experienced.;

Grow perennial painted daisies in your garden so you have the main insecticide ingredient -- pyrethrins, which degrade quickly.,
Apply on your plants using an insecticide duster.,
Spray the upper and lower parts of the leaves on your plants because the pyrethrins must come in contact with the insects.",How to Make a Natural Insecticide3," Pyrethrins have been used in commercial insecticides for years. Painted daisies are also known as pyrethrum daisies.


Pick the daisies when they are in full bloom.
Hang the daisies to dry in a dark, dry place.
Pulverize the flowers in a blender or using a mortar and pestle. The insecticide will be more effective the finer it is crushed.

,


Or, make a solution of .35 oz. (10 grams) of crushed pyrethrins in 3 quarts (2.84 liters) of warm water. Allow the solution to sit for 3 hours.
To increase the power, add 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of sesame seed oil or liquid dish detergent.

, Spraying may excite the pests, so spray the bugs again if you see them moving around.


Spray when it is cooler outside because pyrethrins are most effective at lower temperatures.

, Partially fill the container with good quality topsoil (a good mix consists of about 80 percent bark and 20 percent peat, as this tends to promote fine fibrous feeder roots and gives good drainage. Unwrap the plastic and without disturbing the roots, plant your new tree, adding additional soil as needed to firmly set the tree in place.


The addition of sphagnum moss is helpful in hard water areas., A stake will help to keep the tree from moving; while it is establishing itself, any movement can damage its delicate roots.

, Find a suitable outdoor area to keep your bonsai, such as a porch, garden bed area or patio. Bonsai are not meant to be indoor plants;if brought indoors, only keep them inside for a one to two days before returning them outdoors again; only bring them in when in leaf, or only for an hour during winter.Keep the bonsai maple tree sheltered for the first few years. Don't leave it outside where frost can get to it for the first 2 to 3 years, as this can kill it. Avoid placing the plant anywhere windy and do not let it sit in direct sunlight for the whole day.
Feed a balanced feed after the buds form until late summer. During winter, feed with a low- or zero-nitrogen feed.Never let a bonsai tree dry out. It needs to be kept slightly moist at all times.Wherever possible, use rainwater rather than tap water; it's healthier for the tree. Regular spraying with water is helpful for healthy growth.
Learn to ""style"" the tree as it gets established. This is where you learn to reproduce what nature normally does, to give the tree the look of a real tree.It consists of careful pruning and wiring.

, Be gentle. And be careful - the blades are very sharp.

, If the blade on your bonsai shears has sap on it, use a little soapy water to remove it. Neglecting to remove the sap will likely cause your bonsai tools to rust.

, Specially made cleaning oils such as Tri-Flow will also help loosen stains and add lubrication to help the blades resist rust between gardening jobs.

, Wipe your bonsai tools dry with a clean rag, and then spray a lubricant on them to protect the metal from corrosion, especially if you store your bonsai tools in a damp garage or basement. Tools subjected to constant humidity fluctuations will corrode at an accelerated rate due to moisture condensation.

, Be sure any residue is carefully washed and rinsed away.

, Once the rust is removed, apply a coat of oil to the newly exposed steel to stop the oxidation process in its tracks.

Buy white vinegar.,
Pour the vinegar into a garden sprayer.,
Choose a sunny day to spray weeds.,
Spray directly onto the weeds.,
Avoid spraying vinegar on desirable plants.,
Clean the sprayer out after you finish.",How to Kill Weeds With Vinegar1," Go to your local grocery store and buy a bottle of basic vinegar, typically a 5% concentration of acetic acid. The best bargain is probably to buy a one gallon jug unless you only have a few weeds. If you are killing a lot of weeds, you may need to buy more than one gallon, but one gallon will cover a large area.The acid in vinegar is what kills the weeds. White vinegar is most recommended, and probably the cheapest, but you can use apple cider vinegar as well.;
, Choosing a pump sprayer with a hose and long nozzle will make spraying large areas of weeds easier. Fill the sprayer up with vinegar, or put as much vinegar in the sprayer as you’ll need.Another option is to pour the vinegar into an empty spray bottle. You can buy an empty bottle or you can use a bottle that used to contain window cleaner or another gentle household cleaner. Make sure to rinse it out well if you use a bottle that had other liquid in it.
If you are only killing a few weeds, or covering a small area, you can poke four or five holes in the cap of the vinegar bottle and use the bottle to douse the weeds.
You have the option of diluting the vinegar with water, which is sometimes recommended, but diluting only makes the vinegar weaker. Some weeds are easy to kill with diluted vinegar and others are more stubborn.

, The acetic acid in vinegar dries weeds out, so applying vinegar on a day when the weeds will get at least a few hours of direct sunlight increases the drying power of the vinegar. Spray in the morning so the weeds can get lots of sun.If it rains unexpectedly shortly after you spray the weeds, you’ll most likely have to apply a second round of vinegar.
In this case, sunny means hot as well, ideally in the range of 70+ degrees.

, Using the pump sprayer, spray bottle, or vinegar bottle with holes, thoroughly douse the weeds you want to kill. Cover the leaves with vinegar, but also spray down around the roots.


You don’t need to soak them so they are dripping wet but spray an even coat.
Wait around 24 hours and check the weeds. If you aren’t satisfied, you can spray the weeds a second time.

, Vinegar kills crops and flowers as well as weeds, so take care any time you are spraying weeds around good plants. Vinegar is not always a good option if you are spraying weeds in a garden, flower bed, or in your yard.Vinegar shouldn’t soak into the soil and kill other plants unless it makes direct contact with them.

, Vinegar can corrode your sprayer if you let it sit for a long time. Carefully rinse your sprayer out after every use. Dump the excess vinegar out and then fill the sprayer with water. Be sure to pump and spray the water to clean out the hose and nozzle.

Make sure your plant is already potted in a pot with a drainage hole.,
Take your plant outside to a workbench or garden shed.,
Gather extra soil, an extra pot, water and a wick.,
Soak your wick or shoelace and water your house plant.,
Stick the sharp end of a pencil through the shoelace or the candle wick.,
Lift the plant from its pot.,
Stick the pencil with the top of the wick into the root ball of your plant.,
Place the plant back into its pot with the wick now connected.,
Place the plant above a vessel of water.,
Fill the vessel with 16 to 32 oz.",How to Use Wicks to Water Plants," If it is not, you should use this opportunity of creating a wick watering system to replant it in a self-draining pot.;
, You will need to make a small mess in order to set up a plant with wick. If you do not have a workbench, lay down newspapers.

, If you do not have a candle wick, you can use an old shoelace. Your wick can be any small, long piece of cloth that soaks up water.


Long candle wicks are available in most craft stores for people who make their own candles.

, Make a knot with the end of the wick or shoelace.

, You can also wrap the wick around the pencil. Make sure it is secured and then set it aside for later use.

, If it is a large plant, you may want to ask a friend to help you, so that you will not destroy the roots.

, Thread the bottom of the shoelace or wick through the draining hole in the pot.


If you do not have a self-draining pot, use this opportunity to plant the plant you have just uprooted into a self-draining pot. Place some soil near the bottom to replace any soil lost from the original pot.

, Take care when you move the plant from now on. You do not want to tug hard and remove the wick.

, For example, you can place it on a slatted board and let the wick fall into a pitcher of water. The water will climb up the wick to feed the plant.


This step will be slightly different for everyone, depending upon where you plan to place your plant while you are gone. You may use a drainage basket or a shelf inside, where the wick can fall unencumbered into the vessel.

, (0.47 to 0.9 l) of water before you plan to leave and the water should be wicked up into the roots of the plant while you are away. Since each plant requires a different amount of water, the root ball will soak up the water when it is in need.

Buy 20% concentrated horticultural vinegar.,
Add dish soap.,
Add 2 cups (473 ml) of table salt to a gallon (3.8 L) of vinegar.",How to Kill Weeds With Vinegar2," Go to a garden store or home improvement store and ask if they have concentrated vinegar products designed for garden use. When using stronger vinegar, it is advised to take extra caution such as wearing gloves and goggles.Most weeds will die with regular vinegar, so use that first and only use horticultural vinegar if regular doesn’t work.
Be careful not to get any on your skin as it can cause burns because of the higher concentration of acetic acid.

, Mix some dish soap into your sprayer or spray bottle. Using around a teaspoon (5 ml) per quart (liter) of vinegar is a good amount. The dish soap will help the vinegar stick to the weeds and not run off.Gently stir the soap into the vinegar, but don’t shake the bottle too much or the soap will get sudsy rather than mixing into the vinegar.
It is not necessary to carefully measure out the dish soap. Squirt an amount that seems close to a teaspoon per quart.

, Salt may not affect all weeds, but it can dry out some weeds faster than plain vinegar. You can add salt to the mixture that already has dish soap in it. Use cheap table salt rather than rock salt, Epsom salt, or sea salt.Salt tends to stay in the soil for a while and can have long-term effects on healthy plant life. If you are killing weeds in an area where you’ll plant again, it is probably best to avoid the salt.
On the other hand, if you are killing weeds in an area that you want to prevent future growth, salt can help achieve this.
It is especially important to clean a sprayer in which you added salt because it will clog up the parts and can even corrode the sprayer.

Stop the hen pecking.",How to Garden With Vinegar," First of all, for those of you who are plagued by pests and little critters in the garden, fret no more. It will keep cats at bay if you spray in areas you want to deter them, particularly that sand-pit you may have in the garden for the children but those cats will insist on using as their own private toilet! Heavily spray full-strength vinegar around the edges of the sandpit and remember to re-apply after it rains.;
, Are those rabbits eating your vegetables, particularly your beans and peas? Soak corncobs in full strength vinegar for a couple of hours until they are thoroughly soaked. You may even soak them over-night if you wish. Then place the cobs strategically around your veggie patch. They will keep rabbits away for as long as you re-soak your corncobs every two weeks.

, Do you have an ant problem? Again you can apply this full-strength to the ants and they will not come anywhere near the stuff. This is very useful if you find a trail of them making a way into your house. Just spray the thresholds and reapply every couple of days to ensure that they stay away.

, Slugs are real pests, because they eat both vegetables, especially lettuces and plants, especially hostas. In this case, vinegar acts as a poison to the slugs because, if you spray slugs with it directly, they will die. You can treat snails in exactly the same way. However, because vinegar is also a herbicide, be careful where you spray your vinegar. Salvia, for example, will die if accidentally sprayed.

, Are your fruit trees being invaded by fruit flies? Try this fruit fly bait, which is deadly and effective. Take 1 cup of water, a half a cup of cider vinegar, a quarter of a cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of molasses. Mix it all together. Take old tin cans without their lids and make two holes in opposite ends for wire handles. Attach the handles and add an inch of the mixture to each can. Hang 2 - 3 tins in each tree. Check on the traps on a regular basis to refill and clean when necessary.

, After you have been digging in the garden with your gardening tools, soak them in a bucket of half-strength vinegar. This will act as a fungicide and kill off anything that may be lurking unsuspectingly so that there is no possibility of cross-contamination when you use them next.

, Are your garden plants struggling and your roses suffering from black spot or other fungal diseases? Take 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and mix it with 4 liters (1.1 US gal) of compost tea. Now spray your garden plants with this mixture and see the difference. For roses, the method is slightly different. Take 3 tablespoons of cider vinegar, and mix it with 4 liters (1.1 US gal) of water to control those fungal diseases. Of course, don't forget the compost tea either on your roses to get the best results. For powdery mildew take 2-3 tablespoons of cider vinegar and mix with 4 liters (1.1 US gal) of water and spray your plants. This will help control the problem.

, What about your acid-living plants like azaleas, gardenias and rhododendrons? Are they flowering as well as they could be? If not increase the soil's acidity. In hard water areas, add 1 cup of vinegar to 4 liters (1.1 US gal) of tap water. It will also release iron into the soil for the plants to use. And if you have too much lime in your garden, add vinegar to neutralize it.

, Do you have weeds coming up in between your paving slabs on our driveway or pathway that you cannot remove by hand? Don't use a herbicide that is known to damage the environment. Use an eco-friendly alternative instead. Take 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of boiled water, 2 tablespoons of salt and 5 tablespoons of vinegar. Mix it all together, and while it's still hot, pour onto the offending plants.

, Did you know that you can improve your germination success rate of seeds by using vinegar? This is especially useful for those seeds that are more difficult to germinate such as asparagus and okra, morning glories and moonflowers. Rub the seeds gently first between two pieces of coarse sandpaper. Then soak the seeds overnight in 500 ml of warm water, 125 ml of vinegar and a squirt of washing-up liquid. Plant the next day as normal. You can use the same method, but without the sandpaper for nasturtiums, parsley, beetroot, and parsnips.

, And finally, are your chickens pecking each other? Add a tablespoon of cider vinegar to their drinking water, and they will stop!

Any essential oil or herb will help to reduce bites, but citronella oil is the key to creating a really effective repellent: Add a few drops of citronella oil to your spray and only the most daring kamikazes of the insect world will dare to attack.;
, The drying portion of the mixture will be what actually repels the bugs and stops them from wanting to bite you. Good astringent-type agents include witch hazel and apple cider vinegar.

Create bug spray using witch hazel.,
Create bug spray with apple cider vinegar.",How to Create Homemade Bug Spray2," If mixing your spray with witch hazel, you’ll only need three ingredients--witch hazel, water and essential oils. Preferred oils include citronella, clove, lemongrass, rosemary, tea tree, eucalyptus, cedar, catnip, lavender and mint.


Fill spray bottle halfway with water. If you are really going for the natural, non-toxic mixture, use distilled or pre-boiled water. This is especially helpful when trying to protect small children or infants.
Add witch hazel by filling almost to the top. You will essentially be using half water and almost half witch hazel.
Add 30 to 50 drops of favorite essential oil. The more oil you use, the more potent the spray. Don’t forget to include citronella!
Add spray nozzle and shake to blend and mix.

, With this spray, you’ll want to combine your ingredients in a glass jar or bottle, as you will be fermenting the herbs in a cool dark area before you transfer to a spray bottle. The jar should have a lid or other way to be sealed.


Combine 16 ounces of apple cider vinegar with 1 tbsp. (one tablespoon) each of dried rosemary, lavender, sage, thyme and mint. Be sure to include a tablespoon of each herb in your mixture.
Mix ingredients in an airtight jar and place in a cool, dark area of the home. The jar will need to ferment and sit for up to three weeks.
Shake jar daily to infuse and mix ingredients. A simple tip once over will do the trick: There is no need for vigorous shaking.
Strain herbs from jar after three weeks and transfer liquid mixture to a spray bottle.

Sterilize kitchen knives before using them on your plant. You can do this by rubbing alcohol on the blade, and letting it dry.;
, Tackle the bad leaves first. Carefully move the branches and leaves if you have to in order to find any leaves that are dried, brown, or dead. Unhealthy leaves that are highly discolored can also be removed. Use your knife or scissors to cut them at the stem./images/thumb/7/76/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-2-Version-4.jpg

Be gentle as you do this so that you do not accidentally break healthy leaves.
Pests or disease on these leaves can infect the plant, so these leaves must be removed.
Poor lighting, too little water, or too much water are causes for dying leaves.

, Use your knife or shears to remove enough healthy leaves to make the plant fit in the pot. Bring the cutting tool to the base of the stem and slice through cleanly. These leaves are the oldest and contain the most aloe vera gel./images/thumb/2/21/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-3-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/2/21/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-3-Version-4.jpg









The gel has many medicinal purposes. If you want to use these leaves, cut the thorny edges on the leaves and store the leaves in the refrigerator until you want to extract the gel.
Avoid cutting leaves closest to the plant's main stem. These leaves are young and are needed to replace the old leaves.

, Cut these at the stem the same way you cut leaves. Once the flowers on the plant blossom, they soon drop seeds. While they die, they use nutrients that the plant could be putting towards new, healthy leaves. Since flowers rarely occur on aloe grown as a houseplant, if you grow your aloe vera indoors, you will likely not have to deal with blossoms./images/thumb/1/1d/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-4-Version-4.jpg

Dead flowers attract bugs and can drop into the plant’s pot, absorbing water and creating a mess.

, Also called pups, suckers are offshoot plants. These new growths take energy away from your plant and crowd the pot. Most of the time, you can pull the shoots up out of the dirt with no harm to the plants. Use your cutting tool to cut the shoot off of your plant./images/thumb/5/5f/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-5-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-5-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/5/5f/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-5-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-5-Version-4.jpg









Some suckers may get buried and tangled under the soil, so you’ll have to take the plant out of the pot, carefully remove the dirt from the root ball, and untangle the roots.
Suckers are new aloe vera plants, so you can plant each one in fresh soil in a separate pot to grow another plant. Let them dry out for a few days before replanting them, and make sure to use a special potting mix designed for cacti and succulents.

, Make sure the soil is slightly damp before you remove the plant; this will help prevent damage to the roots. Gently hold the stem of the plant as you tilt the pot to the side. The plant should come out if you pull on it. If it doesn’t, try squeezing the pot or tapping it against a solid surface. Deal with any suckers you couldn’t get before./images/thumb/2/26/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-6-Version-3.jpg

, If you need to repot the plant, you may need to do this. First, shake the dirt off the plant. Trim the long root and remove some side roots. The amount that you leave should be enough to take up about 2/3 of its new pot. This makes the aloe vera easier to transport but also allows it to regrow a stronger root system in new soil. Water lightly until the plant has adjusted./images/thumb/d/de/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-7-Version-3.jpg

Let the plant air out for a day after pruning the roots. This will let any cuts on the roots heal into callouses and prevent long-term damage to the plant.
Look out for root rot. Find any damaged areas and slice them off, being careful not to damage the healthy root. Sprinkle powdered sulfur or charcoal on the pruned areas if you can."

I like to put the plants in a room such as a living room. The only problem with this is that it takes up space. The reason I like to do this is because the plants have sun but when it's raining you can turn on the lights and they will still get the things they need.;
, If you only have a couple plants, then you could use a plastic box which can be bought at Walmart. You want the box to be plenty big and deep enough for the roots to grow.

, After you've found your spot and planted your plants, you need to set up the lights. Fluorescent light bulbs have both of the rays that are needed to make plants grow. Fluorescent light fixtures can be bought at your local home department store such as Home Depot or Lowe's. The only thing is that when you hang them they are on pulleys so you can adjust them as the plants grow. If they are not on pulleys, you can stack books under the box when you hang the lights and remove them as the plants grow taller. Plants should have 12 to 16 hours of steady light daily.

, You will also want to keep the soil damp just as you would with any other garden. Just make sure no water leaks out onto your floor if you're not using a plastic box. You can buy a plastic water pan to go under the box to collect the water.

Determine if the leaf should be removed entirely.,
Obtain a sharp pair of scissors.,
Cut the brown tips of the leaves off.,
Compost the brown leaf tips.,
Address the problem causing the brown leaf tips.,
Many plants, such as most palm varieties, shed their lower leaves regularly as part of their natural growth.,
Small brown spots or holes in your houseplants' leaves can be a sign of an insect infestation.",How to Remove Brown Tips From the Leaves of Houseplants," Leaves with small brown areas along their edges or tips are fairly common even on healthy houseplants. Because a large portion of the leaf is still green, it is still producing energy for the plant through photosynthesis. However, if a leaf is almost entirely brown and dry, then it is better to remove the leaf entirely by plucking it or cutting it away.;
, Brown tips can be trimmed easily using a regular pair of scissors. For the best results, you should use as sharp a pair of scissors as possible. Very sharp blades minimize damage to the plant's cells, which reduce the amount of energy it must spend healing the wound.

, Use the scissors to clip the brown leaf tips away. It is best to leave a very small sliver of the brown area remaining on the leaf. In doing this, you will avoid opening a fresh wound in the plant's leaf, which will stress the plant and may eventually turn brown itself anyway.

, If you have a compost pile or municipal composting program, you can add the leaf tips to your compost. If you suspect that the houseplant is diseased, however, avoid potential contamination of your compost and discard the leaf tips in the trash.

, Of course, if you take steps to improve the plant's health, you may be able to prevent it from developing discolored leaves in the first place. Brown leaves can be a sign of both over- and under-watering, inadequate light, or excessive salt in the plant's soil. Take steps to address these potential problems and note any changes in the leaves' coloration.

, There is no way to keep these shedding leaves from gradually turning brown, and they can be clipped away once they are thoroughly discolored and dry.

, Check the soil and the undersides of the leaves for insects to help diagnose the problem before it gets worse.

Identify the disease infecting your plants.,
Visit your local gardening center.,
Learn the difference between “natural” and “organic.” Fungicides marketed as “all natural” may contain natural active ingredients (such as copper or sulfur).,
Decide whether you need a powdered or liquid product.,
Treat common diseases with copper.,
Use sulfur to deal with serious infections.,
Make your own Bordeaux mixture.,
Try a homemade remedy.,
Use a fungicide that's formulated for the disease you're treating.,
Follow the included instructions.,
Sprinkle or spray on the fungicide.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Buy Organic Fungicides," In order to be sure that a given fungicide will actually work, you’ll first need to verify that you’re using the right product. Inspect your plants closely to look for symptoms like rotting, discoloration or a strange powdery residue. You can then conduct a quick search to find out the specific infection and how best to treat it.Rotten or blackened areas are typically a symptom of blights and leaf spots.
Cankers most often appear as cracked, dried patches on the trunk or stem. Tiny spore-producing structures may sometimes spring up around the affected area.
A mildew is likely to blame when fungal growth or discoloration begins to form on the leaves of the plant.
Wilting occurs when an infection begins to kill a plant. Most of the time, wilted plants will need to be carefully pruned to remove the diseased sections.;
, There, you’ll be able to find an extensive selection of fungicides, including organic formulas. You’ll also have a chance to describe your problem in greater detail to knowledgeable garden experts who can help you find a solution.Organic fungicides are also typically sold in the gardening departments of superstores like Walmart.
If you’re unable to find the product you need in stores, try an online retailer that specializes in organic gardening supplies., However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re organic. Products that are truly organic must be made up of at least 70% organic compounds.It will be in the best interest of your garden to only use products that are certified organic.
While shopping, check each product’s packaging to see if it’s been certified by the USDA. This means that the product was made using only organic active ingredients., Fungicides that come in powdered form can be sprinkled over the foliage, which will fight the infection without harming the plant. Liquid products, on the other hand, tend to work faster because the antifungal compounds have already been dissolved in water. There’s also less chance that they’ll be carried off due to wind or rainfall.While all fungicides are designed to do the same basic job, the method of application can make a big difference depending on the type of plant you’re treating, current weather conditions and other factors.
Powdered fungicides tend to contain more concentrated amounts of chemicals, and aren't recommended for treating young or delicate plants., Copper has mildly acidic properties which make it useful for killing invasive bacteria and fungi. It can be used to clear up almost every type of infection, including blights, powdery mildew and anthracnose. For this reason, copper is a go-to solution for many organic gardening enthusiasts.Most commercial organic fungicides contain some amount of copper.In high concentrations, copper can be toxic to humans and animals. It should therefore be used sparingly to avoid creating deposits in the soil or runoff water.

, Like copper, elemental sulfur is naturally antifungal. Plants displaying symptoms of leaf spots, rust or botrytis can benefit from regular application of the diluted chemical. Sulfur is more potent than other organic compounds, however, so it should be handled with caution.Never apply sulfur-based fungicides to young growth, or in extremely hot temperatures. If you’re not careful, it can burn right through the foliage.
Avoid using sulfur on “sulfur shy” fruiting plants like grapes, gooseberries, currants and apricots., Bordeaux mixture is a special fungicide solution made from a combination of copper sulfate, lime and water. Gardeners have been using Bordeaux mixture for centuries to fight a multitude of botanical diseases while preserving the health of their plants.When putting together your own Bordeaux mixture, it’s best to follow the 4-4-50 rule—4 pounds (1.8kg) of copper sulfate and 4 pounds (1.8kg) of lime diluted in 50 gallons (189L) of water. This will produce a solution that’s strong yet safe.You can also purchase premade Bordeaux mixture. Commercial varieties are available in either dry or wet form to give you more control over their application.

, Items like grain alcohol, apple cider vinegar, oil soaps and baking soda are readily available and helpful for eliminating infectious growth. Most of these substances can simply be diluted with a few ounces of water and applied using a spray bottle.Try whipping up a basic DIY fungicide solution by infusing alliums (pungent plants like crushed cloves, garlic and onions) in a small amount of water or citric acid.
Homemade organic solutions will be most effective for dealing with slow-moving diseases such as blights and leaf spots. More serious infections like wilts should be pruned to keep them from spreading.Natural ingredients are generally mild enough to be used on plants of all species and ages, including seedlings and offshoots., The most important thing to remember when purchasing a fungicide is to select one that’s capable of killing the specific disease affecting your plants. The best way to do this is to compare a product’s active ingredients to the compounds recommended for treating a particular disease. Think of it as prescribing medicine to cure an illness.You can usually find a list of plants and diseases that a product can be safely used on somewhere on the packaging.In general, it’s a good idea to start with a gentle fungicide, such as apple cider vinegar or a bicarbonate spray (a mixture of water and baking soda). If that doesn't work, you can move on to more a intensive method like elemental sulfur.

, Fungicide manufacturers provide specific directions for how to apply their products. Always go by these directions rather than attempting to figure it out yourself. If you use too much or too little fungicide, or apply a product under the wrong conditions, you could end up doing more harm than good.Different products will come with different instructions. Some organic fungicides like Soil Guardian are meant to be applied directly to the soil or to new seedlings. Others, like sulfur and lime, can cause damage to plants if applied in hot temperatures.If you're using a homemade remedy, it's best to apply the solution once or twice a day, then observe the plant's health after a couple days. If it doesn't appear to be working, you may need to increase the frequency or try a more potent fungicide.

, Once you’ve determined the correct amount of product to use (diluting it as needed), load the sprayer and spray it lightly and evenly over the plant. Try to cover all affected parts of the foliage. For your own safety, be sure to wear gloves, goggles, a breather or ventilator and protective long-sleeved clothing.Wait for clear, dry, windless weather to prevent runoff and keep the fungicide from blowing back on you or other unaffected parts of your garden.When applying a powdered fungicide, spray the plant lightly with water beforehand to help it stick.

, Diseases won't typically clear up over night. It may be necessary to regularly reapply the fungicide to keep an infection under control. Only use as much fungicide as directed for each application and make sure the plant receives plenty of water and sunlight in the meantime. With proper care, you should notice an improvement within a few short weeks.Most experts recommend applying fungicides every five days for roughly three weeks. Be sure to follow the specific instructions included with the fungicide you select.
It will help to keep the plant pruned, dry and separated from other plants while you attempt to combat the disease."

Know that houseplants sometimes need to be repotted.,
Recognize when your houseplant is in need of a pruning.,
Be aware that houseplants with dull-looking leaves may just need a good dusting.,
Learn to deal with overcrowding.,
Recognize when your houseplant need to be repotted.,
Find a pot that is slightly wider and deeper than the plant’s current pot.,
Remove the plant from its pot and gently tease out the coiled roots.,
Put a shallow layer of potting compost in the new pot.,
Don’t fertilize for a few weeks.,
Tidy the plant up by removing any unhealthy growth.,
Try to preserve the shape of the plant as you prune.,
Prune by cutting just above a leaf node.,
Encourage bushy rather than leggy growth.,
Be wary of extreme pruning.,
Feed the plant with a water-soluable fertilizer.Give the plant a feed using a water-soluble fertilizer after pruning (unless you are repotting at the same time).,
Keep an eye out for new growth.,
Propagate your houseplant using prunings.",How to Rejuvenate an Overgrown Houseplant," Don’t neglect to repot your tired-looking or overgrown houseplant as it may just have overgrown its container.


Generally you should repot houseplants annually, unless they are large or slow-growing in which case every other year should suffice. Tropical plants like bromeliads should usually not be repotted.
The method for repotting a houseplant is described in Part Two below.;
, Plants that have grown sparse and leggy, have leaf loss or are overgrown, may benefit from a pruning. The method for this is described in Part Three below.

, In the still air of a house, plants can become covered in dust. This can block photosynthesis, affecting plant health.


Either wipe the dust off with a damp cloth or rinse it off under a lukewarm tap. You can also buy special leaf-shine cloths, but that usually isn’t necessary.
If you have a ‘fuzzy’ plant like a cactus or African Violet, try brushing off the dust with a soft brush or run a hairdryer over the plant on a cool setting.

, Plants such as ‘Hen and chicks’ sedums, bromeliads or spider-plants can become too crowded in their pots because they have made too many new plants or just become overgrown.


A slightly crowded plant looks better than a thin one as a general rule, so don’t rush to separate crowded houseplants, just know that it may become necessary.
Bromeliads may become very top-heavy, for example, making it necessary to pinch off the ‘pups’ that grow as side shoots.
Spider plants can be cut into sections and you can remove the ‘chicks’ from your sedums for replanting in new pots.

, If your houseplant needs repotting, the growth may slow down and you may see roots emerging from the bottom of the pot through the drainage holes.


If you can remove the plant ball from the pot you may see the roots all coiled at the bottom of the pot. When this happens the plant is described as ‘root bound’ and needs repotting.
Repotting also replaces tired compost with depleted nutrients, giving the plant a fresh source of nutrients. Don’t move the plant to a much bigger pot (eg twice as big) otherwise the roots will grow at the expense of the visible plant and you won’t get a good display.

, Give the new pot a good scrub and/or wash in a weak solution of bleach, then rinse thoroughly. This prevents infection spreading from the last plant it contained to the newly repotted one.

, You may like to give the plant a light prune, removing any dead, damaged or diseased growth.

, Put the plant in and fill round the edges with compost, pressing down gently to remove air holes. The soil line of the plant should be the same as it was in the previous pot. Water well.

, Fertilizing too soon after repotting can harm the roots if they were damaged during the move. You should also avoid putting the plant into bright sunlight for a few weeks whilst it recovers from the repotting.

, Your plants may not require a serious prune, possibly just a tidy up will suffice.


Remove any dead, withered, brown or yellowing leaves. These should pull away easily. Don’t forcibly remove a leaf as only the loose ones need removing.
You can use scissors to trim any damaged or diseased growth and cut off any brown leaf tips, following the natural shape of the leaf where possible to make it look natural.

, First have a good look at the plant and consider whether it has one central stalk, or several. Consider whether the new growth comes from the base of the plant or only grows from the tips.


You’ll want to try to preserve the shape as much as possible, whilst reducing the size.
Leave any new areas of growth where possible whilst pruning dead or woody parts of the plant that aren’t spouting new growth.

, The leaf node is usually a small bump or opening where a leaf or branch comes out of the stem. Try to leave at least some greenery on the plant so it can draw its energy from the sun after pruning.

, A good approach is to prune half the plant’s longest branches back so they are a third of their original length. Alternately, if you see side shoots along the long stems you can prune back to just above these side stems. This encourages bushy rather than leggy growth.

, Some plants will recover from a very severe pruning right back to the base but this should only be done in extreme circumstances. Check the pruning advice for your variety before you do this.

, Avoid putting the plant into bright sunlight for a few weeks whilst it recovers from the pruning.

, After repotting your houseplant you may soon see new growth. To encourage bushy growth, you might like to pinch out the growing tips of new shoots once they have two or more leaves.

, If you want, you can use the healthy-looking prunings to try to propagate your houseplants to make more of them.


Generally the way to do this is to take a healthy 4 inch (10.2 cm) piece of growth, remove the lower half of the leaves and insert into moist, well-drained compost.
Keep watering and some of your cuttings should root in a few weeks.

Use sharp scissors or garden shears.,
Prune the plants at the beginning of their growing season.,
Remove dead leaves and limbs at a 45 degree angle.,
Trim off any dead flowers.,
Prune back half of the longest branches on the plant.,
Remove leggy stems.,
Pinch off the stems.,
Remove 10-20% of the plant’s foliage at a time.,
Fertilize the plants after pruning.,
Wipe dust or dirt off the leaves.,
Do not overwater the plants.",How to Prune Houseplants," Make sure the scissors or garden shears are very sharp, as dull shears can damage the plants. If you notice any dirt on the shears, soak them in water with a teaspoon of bleach and then wipe them dry. A clean tool will ensure your plants are not exposed to bacteria or pests when you prune them.You can find garden shears for pruning online or at your local hardware store.
If you are worried about scratching your hands while you prune, wear gardening gloves.;
, If you have houseplants that do not flower, prune them in late winter. For houseplants with flowers or blooms, wait until they have bloomed before you prune them.Do not prune houseplants when unopened buds are present on the stems.

, Look for any leaves or limbs on the plant that are brown or discolored. They may also appear limp or dry. Use the shears to cut them off just below the brown or dead area at a 45 degree angle. This will ensure you leave as much of the healthy foliage on the plant as possible.








Do not cut off any leaves or limbs that still appear green and vibrant.
If a large section of the leafy area appears dead, you can cut off the entire branch. Leave the main stem intact and remove branches shooting off of the stem at a 45 degree angle.

, If you have houseplants that are flowering, make sure you check them over for any dead flowers and remove them. The flowers may appear brown, discolored, and limp. They may also feel dry to the touch. Cut the dead flowers off with the shears at the base of the flower’s head.








Removing dead and dying flowers on the plant will encourage the growth of newer, more vibrant blooms.

, Use the shears to cut them back about a third of their length. Trim the branches off at a 45 degree angle.








If there are any side shoots on the branches further down the base of the plant, you can prune a few of these shoots.
Do not cut off any nodules on the plants as you prune, which are new buds that have not bloomed or opened yet.

, Check the plant for any stems that are unusually long. They may appear loose or straggling, falling off different areas of the plant. Pruning leggy stems will help the plant to grow in a fuller, more even pattern. Use the shears to cut the leggy stems back to one third their length, cutting at a 45 degree angle.







, If you have soft-stemmed houseplants like coleus, heartleaf philodendron, and English ivy, make sure you pinch them regularly. Use your thumb and forefinger to remove the tip of a stem. Pinch above the node, which is the growing point where the leaf is attached to the plant.








Pinching off the stems can help maintain the bushy shape of the plant and encourage even growth. It also helps to prevent the growth of leggy stems.

, Do not overprune the plant, as this can make it difficult for it to grow properly. Make selective cuts to the plant, removing only 10-20% of the foliage at a time. Wait a few weeks to one month to prune the plants again.Always leave some foliage on the plant when you prune. If you are in doubt, under prune the plant and then reevaluate it a few weeks later.

, Use soluble, all-purpose fertilizer on the plant after you prune it. Dilute the fertilizer in water so it does not burn the plant. Apply the fertilizer according to the instructions on the label.







, Houseplants with wide, large leaves can accumulate dust and dirt. Maintain the houseplants by using a damp sponge or rag to wipe off the dust and dirt. Do this on a regular basis so the plants stay vibrant.








Always use a new sponge or rag on each plant so pests are not transferred from one plant to another.

, A big part of caring for houseplants is watering them when needed. Thin, delicate houseplants will need more water than succulents. Check if the plants need water by sticking your finger one inch into the soil. If the soil does not feel damp, the plants need water.Watch for signs of overwatering, such as young and old leaves that fall, mushy, brown roots at the bottom of the pot, moldy flowers, and leaves with brown, soft patches that do not grow.

Go for African violets for areas with bright light.,
Try hydrangeas for low light areas.,
Choose chrysanthemums for areas with bright light.,
Go for azaleas if your home has bright light.,
Try a peace lily for low lit areas.",How to Select Blooming Houseplants1," African violets are easy to grow and bloom year-round. They come in many different varieties, blooming in different shades, often with white-edges on each bloom. They do well in filtered sunlight, such as by a window that gets direct sunlight. Put a curtain up so the houseplant gets just enough light.If you have a bright window spot available, this is the plant for you. It will bloom constantly and produce colorful blooms to brighten up any room.
You should water African violets when the soil feels less moist with tepid water. Water these houseplants at the base and do not get any water on their leaves.;
, Hydrangeas do well in cooler conditions, such as a room with no direct sunlight but some bright light. They enjoy sitting in soil that is not too dry and require watering on a regular basis. They produce beautiful purple and blue blooms.They can also be put outside in the summer to bloom and kept indoors during winter to keep them away from frost.

, Chrysanthemums thrive in brightly lit areas, such as a room that gets direct sunlight. They come in a variety of colors and produce large blooms as long as they get enough direct sunlight on a constant basis.You will need to water chrysanthemums on a regular basis to ensure the soil is moist. You will also need to mist the leaves from time to time.

, Azaleas do well in bright light, but not direct sunlight. Go for these plants if your home has a brightly lit room that is not too warm, as they do better in cooler conditions. A window that gets bright light would be ideal for azaleas. These plants can bloom for three to four weeks at a time.Azaleas require constant water checks to make sure the potting soil does not become too dry. Water the plant until water flows out of the bottom of the pot and get rid of the excess water.

, The peace lily is easy to care for and does well in low light. A spot in a room with less light and low humidity is ideal for this plant. The blooms are cream white and spoon-shaped. This bloom will appear heaviest in the summer months.This plant is easy to grow indoors and only needs moist soil to thrive. Keep in mind peace lilies can be toxic to children or pets if chewed or ingested.

Try poinsettias for short term houseplants.,
Get hibiscus for a long lasting houseplant.,
Choose a flowering maple for consistent blooms.,
Go for an anthurium for long lasting blooms.",How to Select Blooming Houseplants2," Poinsettias are ideal for short term houseplants that will bloom for two to six months. After the blooms fall off, they are often thrown away or used as foliage plants in an outdoor garden. They are popular during Christmas time but also make a lovely indoor houseplant for a sunny spot in your home.Poinsettias do well in warm conditions and need thorough watering on a regular basis.

, Hibiscus are tropical plants that make great additions to a warm, bright room. They produce large blooms, up to 8 inches in diameter and require lots of indoor light to bloom well. Hibiscus come in annual and perennial types.You will need to keep the soil moist with regular watering for the hibiscus to thrive.

, Flowering maples have red, pink, yellow, or orange blooms that dangle from the branch. They can be grown as a tree, upright, with minimal pruning, or in a hanging basket. They do well in brightly lit areas and bloom on a constant basis. Flowering maples are perennials.If you notice the blooms starting to drop on the flowering maple, it may not be getting enough water.

, Anthuriums can bloom for two months or more and are known to be hardy perennial plants. They produce blooms in pink, red, lavender, and white. You can also cut off the blooms and use them as indoor decoration.These plants need medium to bright light to thrive. They will survive in areas with less light but produce less blooms.
Keep in mind anthuriums are poisonous if chewed or eaten by children or pets. Do not keep them indoors if you have pets or children in your home.

Check the leaves and foliage for any spots or yellow coloring.,
Go for plants with new flowers or leaf buds.,
Look for any signs of pests or disease.,
Discuss the maintenance of the houseplant with the grower.,
Opt for low maintenance plants.",How to Select Blooming Houseplants3," Start by examining underneath the foliage, the leaves, and the stems of any brown or yellow spots. Note if the leaves look healthy, with green bright coloring. If the plants have yellow or brown leaves, wilted leaves, or spots on them, they are likely not very healthy.Avoid plants with leaves that look overly shiny or polished, as they may have been treated with chemicals or fertilizer.

, Examine the selection at the grower and opt for plants that have buds or new young flowers. They are often healthier and better quality. They will also often bloom better and have more vibrant blooms., You should also examine the plants for any signs of pest, such as pests crawling all over the plants or leaves that have bite marks or holes in them. You do not want to bring a plant with pests or disease into your home, as it may infect your other plants and kill them off.Make sure the plants look clean and well potted. They should look healthy in their pot when you buy them.

, If you are buying the houseplants from a grower at a nursery, talk to them about maintaining the plants indoors. Ask them for advice on watering the plants, giving the plants fertilizer, and making sure the plants bloom well. You should also talk to them about warning signs of declining health in the plants so you can nurse the plants back to health if needed.For example, you may ask the grower, “How often should I water the plants?” “What would be the best spot in my home for these plants?” and “What are the signs of disease or decline in these plants?”

, If you do not have a lot of time to care for the houseplant, you may go for plants that will require only minimal care. Ask the grower about houseplants that will be easy to care for and require very little watering or attention. For example, an anthurium or a peace lily may be a good option for a low maintenance blooming houseplant.

You should also avoid houseplants that are poisonous when chewed or swallowed if you have children and pets at home. You can ask the grower for recommendations on this as well.

If you choose a pot that has dimensions larger than this, the roots will need to grow into the pot before the plant itself can begin to grow. In other words, the plant has to grow all the way down before it can grow upward.;
, When you’re selecting a new pot, make sure it has drainage holes to allow excess water to drain. Even if you select a pot that is the correct size, you still don’t want water sitting in the bottom of it and causing root rot.







, If you decide to use a terra cotta pot for repotting, make sure you soak the pot in water for a few hours before you begin the repotting process. Terra cotta is pretty porous, which means it soaks up water easily. You don’t want your pot stealing your plant’s water.







, It’s important to have a pot with drainage holes, but you also want to make sure soil can’t escape through them. Cover the drainage holes with something that will allow water to pass through, like paper towel or a coffee filter.









Using a porous material like paper towel or a coffee filter over the drainage holes will allow water to pass through so your plant doesn't drown, but it slows down the process so the water can actually soak into the soil and help your plant., You’ll need a base of soil under the plant so the roots have something to grow into.









Don’t overfill the pot before you put the new plant in – the roots need something to grow into, but you also want them to be down far enough into the pot that they don’t stick out of the top., Your plant will come out of its old pot more easily if the rootball is moist. You’ll want to water the plant a few hours before you want to repot it. This will help it maintain its health even if it loses a root or two during the repotting.The rootball is the part of the plant that extends into the actual pot. It’s made up of roots and soil and often keeps the shape of the pot after it’s removed, Place your hand over the top of the pot, and place your thumb and index finger around the plant’s stem. Then turn the pot on its side and gently work the plant back and forth until it comes out.








If the plant won’t come out after several tries, you can use a knife to cut around the edge of the soil and try again.If you happen to break some of the roots, don't worry, you’ll need to prune the rootball anyway.

, To make sure your plant takes to its new pot, you’ll want to remove some of the old rootball to expose fresher roots to the new soil in the new pot. Clip off roots that hang below the rootball and make three or four slits in the bottom of the rootball about a third of the way up.








If the rootball is black or smells, your plant might have some kind of fungal disease. You might not be able to save this plant or repot it.
You can also shave away roots that seem particularly thick on the sides of the rootball., Once you prune the rootball and have exposed the healthy roots, untangle some of the roots that are left over. This gives the roots more contact with the new soil in the new pot. It encourages the roots to grow outward, instead of around the rootball.







, As you place the plant into its new pot, center it by looking down on it from above and making sure it’s not closer to any one side of the pot than the others. You also want to make sure it’s sitting upright. While looking at the plant from the side, spin the pot and make sure the plant isn’t tilted in any one direction.







, Once you’ve placed the plant in the new pot, you’ll want to put soil into the pot around the rootball. Don’t overfill the pot - the soil line should be about 1” below the top of the pot.








You can “stuff” or “fill” when you’re adding new soil. “Filling” just means pouring soil in, around, and on top of the rootball. “Stuffing” means pouring the soil in and then pressing it down. You might want to “stuff” the pot for a top-heavy plant, because it will help you keep the plant steady and even.

, Once your plant is in its new pot and you’ve filled the pot with soil, water the plant. It will help the plant’s roots soak up the nutrients from the soil and ensure that the plant takes to the new pot.









You might need to add more soil to fill in empty spots once you water the new plant and the soil settles."

,
Store them in a cool, dry place that is well-ventilated.",How to Grow Sweet Onions," You can often find this online and it will determine whether you need to choose a short-day or long-day sweet onion variety. This is important, since the season in a warmer climate is very different from the season in a northern area.


If you live in the United States, you can consult the United States Department of Agriculture website. It features a hardiness zone chart that will advise you on what you can plant in your garden.;
, An onion set is a small onion bulb that has already begun to grow.


If you have a shorter growing season, order sets of onions and place them in moist potting soil 2 to 3 weeks before you plant them outdoors. They will begin to sprout and grow roots.
To get a good selection of sweet onions, you may have to order them from a catalog, rather than a gardening center. They will also be more expensive.

, Planting happens in the fall in hotter climates, and in the spring in cooler climates.


Plant onions in the fall, if you live in milder plains climates. Plant onions in the spring if you live in mountain climates that see a lot of snow.

, This ensures that the onion does not sit in still water and rot or develop mold.

, Work it down into the soil using garden tools or a tiller. Onions like a good amount of organic matter in the soil.

,


If you are growing sweet onions from seeds, plant each seed 3/8 of an inch (1 cm) deep and 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) apart. When you plant rows, make sure they are 15 inches (38 cm) apart. Once they become seedlings, you will want to thin your onions until they are 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart. Thinning means to pull up seedlings that are too close together to make sure they are not competing for the same growing space and nutrients.
If you are growing sweet onions from seedlings, then plant them 1 inch (2.54 cm) into the soil, about 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart. Rows should remain separated by 15 inches (38 cm).
If you are planting sweet onions from sets, plant them 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart, and rows at 15 inches (38 cm) apart. Plant them shallowly, with the roots into the ground, and the bulb only about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) into the ground. Pinch dirt around the onion so it stays supported. Place compost, mulch or finely cut hay around each onion to give it further support.

, They will need more water in the beginning and less at the end of the growing season. Depending upon the amount of rain you get, you may not need to hand water them very often.

, Weeds compete with the onion for nutrients, so you want to keep them weed free.

, If you planted seeds or seedlings, they will take a few weeks to a month longer, depending upon the warmth of your growing season.

,


Many commercial farmers break the tops of the plants when they start to yellow, to stop them from ripening and start them curing. Many small-scale gardeners believe that this causes smaller bulbs that do not store for very long.
Harvest before the plant begins to flower. If you have flowering onion plants, remove the onion from the ground immediately and use it. It will not store like your other plants.

,, If the sun is especially hot, they should be taken out of the sun and dried outside in the shade.

,,,, Store sweet onions for up to 2 months. Because of their higher water content, they do not last as long as other dry bulbs.

Choose a type of onion to grow.,
Prepare a planting bed.,
Plant the seeds or sets.,
Thin the plants if necessary.,
Mulch between the seedlings.,
Keep them well watered.,
Harvest the green onions when they have matured.",How to Grow Green Onions1," Green onions, or scallions, are the green shoots that come up before an onion bulb begins to form. They are essentially immature onions. Look for a hearty scallion seed, such as the species A. Welsh onions, or simply choose your favorite white, red or yellow onion to grow.If you'd prefer not to start the green onions from seed, choose red, white or onion ""sets"" to plant. These look like bare-root mini bulbs that come bound with twine or rubber bands. You can pick up a few sets to use as scallions, and let the others mature into onion bulbs.;
, Choose a spot in your yard or garden that gets full sun and has soil that drains well. Till the dirt to a depth of 12 inches and work in compost, blood meal or another organic material to enrich the soil with nutrients. This will ensure that the green onions grow strong and healthy, and continue to produce shoots throughout the growing season.


Be sure rocks, sticks and weeds are cleared away before you till and work the soil.
You can till the soil using a garden rake if you're working with a small patch. For a bigger area, buy or rent a soil tiller to make the job easier.
If you just want a few green onions, you can prepare a pot with a compost-rich potting soil instead of planting them in the ground.

, As soon as the soil is workable, about four weeks before the last frost, it's time to plant the seeds or sets you have ready. If you have seeds, sow them thickly about 1/2 inch deep in rows spaced 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. If you have sets, plant them root-side down 2 inches apart and 1 inch deep, in rows 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. Water the garden bed thoroughly.


The onion seeds will germinate when the soil is anywhere between 65 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 to 30 degrees Celsius). It may take up to a month for onion seeds to germinate.
If you live in a cold climate with a late spring, you can start the seeds indoors about eight weeks before the last frost. Plant the seeds in peat seed starter pots and keep them well-watered. Put them in a warm, sunny room to during the germination period. When the ground outside is warm enough to work with, transplant the seedlings to the garden or a larger pot.

, When the first green shoots begin poking up, determine whether to thin them to give them each a bit more room. Green onions grow well in bunches, but for best results the mature plants should be spaced 2 to 3 inches apart. Take a look at your garden bed and remove weaker seedlings if necessary.

, Cover the soil around the seedlings with grass clippings, pine straw or fine pieces of bark. This will prevent weeds from growing and keep the soil evenly moist.


If you're growing your green onions in a pot, you can skip this step, since weeds won't be an issue and you can more easily control the moisture level.

, Green onions need evenly moist soil throughout the growing season. Provide the onion plants with about 1 inch of water per week. For optimal plant growth, the soil does not need to be soggy, but it should be moist. Water the garden bed every few days, or when it begins to look dry and dusty.


Another way to determine whether the onions need watering is to test the soil conditions. Insert your finger, up to the second knuckle, in the soil close to where the plant is. If you feel that the soil is dry, water it. If you think the soil is wet enough, don't worry about watering, and repeat the test again in a few days. If your area has received rain recently, you may not need to water.

, After three to four weeks, the green shoots will be 6 to 8 inches long and ready to eat. Harvest them by pulling the entire plant from the ground. The plant will not yet have formed a bulb. Both the white and green parts of the onion are flavorful.


If you want to let some of the plants mature into storage onions, simply leave them in the ground. The bottom of the plants will begin to form a bulb, which will be ready for harvest in the fall.
If you only want to use the green part of the onions, and not the white part close to the roots, you can use a pair of scissors to simply cut off the green tops. Leave an inch or two of growth. The onions will continue to grow, and you can harvest the greens again once they're 6 to 8 inches long. Note that they will become stronger-tasting as the plant matures.

"
Pick out onion sets to grow.,
Prepare a pot with rich potting soil.,
Plant the sets.,
Harvest the greens when they're 6 to 8 inches tall.",How to Grow Green Onions2," Choose red, white or onion ""sets"" to plant. Available at your local nursery, these look like bare-root mini bulbs that come bound with twine or rubber bands.Any type of onion sets will make excellent green onions, and they all grow well in pots indoors.

, Green onions grow best in very rich soil, so choose a potting soil that has been enriched with compost - or mix in your own compost with standard potting soil. Fill the pot to within a few inches of the top. Water the soil to prepare it for planting. Be sure the pot you use drains well, so that the soil never gets waterlogged.

, Plant each onion 1 inch deep, pointing the root side down. Gently pat soil over the top. Space them 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart to allow them a little room to form roots without crowding each other. Water the onions and place the pot in your sunniest window.


You can grow green onions indoors any time of year, as long as you maintain the correct conditions. The onions need full sun, so they should be placed in a window that receives light for most of the day. Be sure the temperature never drops below freezing.
Keep the soil evenly moist. Water every few days, or when the soil seems to be getting dry. Don't overwater the onions, though - the soil should be moist, but never soggy.

, After a few weeks, the green tops will emerge and grow. Either pull the plants from the pots to use the whites and greens, or use a scissors to trim off the green tops and leave the bulb to continue growing. If you leave the bulb in the pot, you should get at least one more harvest before it stops producing."
"
Save your green onion bulbs.,
Put them root-down in a glass jar.,
Add water and sun.,
Harvest the greens.",How to Grow Green Onions3," Next time you buy green onions to use in a recipe, save the white part with roots and eat only the greens. You can grow more green onions using only the leftover roots - and next time you want to add flavor to a dish, you'll have your own home-grown green onions on hand.


Any green onions bulbs will work, but you might have the best luck if you use green onions that were grown nearby. That way you know they'll grow well in your climate. Try starting with green onions you bought at the farmer's market, since they were probably grown in your region.

, Any type of clean glass jar will do. Just make sure the glass is clear, and not tinted, so that the sun's rays can easily reach the onions inside. Put in as many green onion rots as you'd like - just make sure the roots are facing down, so that the greens grow up and out of the jar.

, Pour in enough water to cover the bulbs entirely. Set the jar in a sunny window and wait for the magic to happen. Within a few days, you should see the roots starting to get longer. Tiny green shoots will emerge from the bulbs and begin growing upward. Keep the jar filled with enough water to cover the white part of the onions.

, Once they're 4 to 6 inches long, they're ready to harvest. Remove a green onion from the jar and chop off as much as you want - or use the whole thing. If you just need a handful of chopped scallion, you can return the bulb and roots to the jar to continue growing. You should be able to harvest the same onions two to three times before they stop growing.If you want to continue growing onions year round, then put some rocks and pebbles in the bottom of the jar. Then, place soil over the rocks and pebbles and plant the bulbs in the soil.

Plant the seeds between March and July.,
Dig shallow holes.,
Space the seeds apart.,
Loosely cover the seeds with soil.,
Scatter the seeds.",How to Grow Spring Onions1," Spring onions do not have strict requirements for sunlight, but they do need at least partial sun in order to grow.Alternatively, you can grow spring onions in a small pot or windowsill garden that is close to the house.;
, Spring onions thrive in loose soil that drains well. Clay-based soil or other heavy, dense soils may not work well. You can use a trowel to break up the soil on the day you sow your onions, or you can accomplish this gradually by raking over the plot every day for several weeks in advance., A week before planting the seeds, add a general fertilizer to the soil. If you are concerned about the potential effects of consuming garden chemicals, you may prefer to use an organic fertilizer. Mix the fertilizer into the soil as you break it up., Use litmus paper or another testing kit to determine how acidic or neutral your soil is. Spring onions need a pH level ranging from 6.3 to 6.8 in order to grow.You can drop the pH by adding manure or compost to the soil and you can raise the pH by adding lime to the soil., Spring onion seeds germinate best when the weather is moderate. Wait until after the last frost of the season, but do not procrastinate until the hottest days of summer.Alternatively, you could plant a winter-hardy variety of spring onion in the late summer or early autumn months. These onions will take longer to grow and will be harvested in the early spring, sometime between March and May., The holes should be no more than ½ an inch (1.5 cm) deep. Use your finger or a small drill to dig the hole. Place the seeds into the holes., Space the seeds approximately 2 inches (5 cm) apart in order to allow the onions enough room to grow and mature. If you are planting multiple rows of spring onions, there should be no less than 6 inches (15 cm) between the rows., Once you have planted the seeds, they should be covered with about ½ an inch (1.5 cm) of soil. This layer of soil will protect the seeds from the elements and natural predators, like birds., Rather than digging a small hole and planting each seed, you can scatter the seeds across the garden plot. Keep them scattered thinly, and rake them into the soil upon finishing. Cover these seeds with 1/2 an inch (1.5 cm) of soil.This method works because spring onions are typically harvested while they are still relatively small. This means they do not need too much room to grow.

Save bulbs for replanting.",How to Plant Shallots," To plant shallots, you'll need at least one set of shallots for planting, a space to plant them, and some gardening tools and equipment, such as:


Soil
Well-decomposed compost
Spade or shovel;
, You can plant shallots in either fall or spring, but you'll get an earlier crop if you plant in fall. Also, some say that you'll get larger and better tasting shallots if you put them through vernalization.


Vernalization is the process of exposing a seed or whole plant to cold temperatures in order to promote growth.To plant in fall, pick a date that’s after the first frost and before the cold weather. In spring, aim for early in the season, in March or April.

, Shallots need full sun, well-draining soil, and an area that’s as free of weeds as possible. Raised beds are ideal for shallots, especially if your ground is particularly wet. Soils that drain well include:Sand
Silt
Loam

, You can help your shallots by mixing the soil in the seedbed with compost that’s very highly decomposed. Add one bucketful of compost per square meter (1.1 by 1.1 yards).


Avoid adding manure to the soil, as it’s too high in nitrogen.
The ideal pH for shallot soil is between 6.2 and 6.8., Like garlic, shallots grow in heads that contain multiple bulbs. If your shallots aren't in separate bulbs, peel each one away from the main head.


Each bulb will grow a new shallot head that contains several bulbs, or cloves., To plant shallots, space the bulbs out so there's about two to six inches (five to 15 cm) between each bulb. Push each bulb into the soil with the roots facing down. Keep pushing until the shallot is about three-quarters buried in the soil.


Alternatively, you can also plant shallot seeds instead of bulbs. Plant the seeds at the same distance, and bury each seed about 0.5 inches (1 cm) deep. Plants seeds in spring rather than fall., For fall plantings, cover the top of the shallots with straw, hay, leaves, or wood chips to help protect them from the cold and frost over the winter. For the best results, use a good six inches (15 cm) of mulch., Shallots don’t need a lot of extra attention and watering, but you should water them once you’ve put them in the soil. One good watering now should last them through the winter.


The mulch layer on top will also help to keep moisture in the soil.

, When shallots are growing, they send up scapes the same way garlic and other onions do. Small mammals love chewing on these. You can protect the shallots by covering the garden with fleece or a net, which will keep predators out.The netting isn't necessary until spring, when the shallots will start to actively grow.
You can also protect the shallots from worms by sprinkling the area with wood ashes every couple months.

, Shallots don’t like competing with weeds, so it’s important to stay on top of removing them from the soil where shallots are growing.


Just be careful that you don’t accidentally pull out the shallot scapes when you're weeding or removing grass.Weed the area by hand, rather than with a spade or other tool, to prevent damaging the roots.

, You won’t have to water your shallots much, even during the active growth phase, because shallots don’t require a lot of extra water. However, if the weather turns dry and you don’t get much rain, make sure the soil stays somewhat moist., If your shallots begin to flower, this will take energy away from the bulbs, meaning your onions won’t be as large or tasty. To prevent this from happening, cut off any flowers that start to grow.


Cut flowers at the stem to prevent the shallots from going into reproduction mode., Shallots will be ready to harvest at the end of June or the beginning of July (for fall plantings), or late July into August (for spring plantings. You'll know they're ready when the foliage turns yellow.


Pick a dry day and use a spade or fork to gently loosen the soil around the shallots and lift them to the surface. Be careful not to uproot them or damage the roots.
Leave the shallots to sit exposed on top of the soil for one to two sunny days. When they're ready for harvest, they’ll be dried out and the dirt will come off easily.
Uncovering the shallots will help them mature because exposing them to the sun will help them ripen., To remove the shallots from the soil, take a fork or spade and place it to the side of the shallot. Stick the spade into the soil under the shallot on a 45-degree angle. This will break the roots, and you'll be able to lift the shallot free.Shake each shallot to remove excess dirt from the bulbs.

, Freshly harvested shallots can be eaten immediately or stored for later use. Shallots can also be stored for several months, so you'll still have shallots over the winter. To store shallots:Spread them out in a single layer and let them cure for one or two weeks in a warm and dry location.
Cut off any remaining leaves from the tops of the bulbs, and transfer the shallots to a mesh bag and store them somewhere cool and dry.
When stored like this, shallots may last up to six months.

, The shallot bulbs you grow can also be set aside and replanted, and from each bulb you'll get a brand new head all over again. From the shallots that you've set aside for storage, choose the healthiest, driest, and largest bulbs to replant in the fall or spring.Do not use wet or damaged bulbs for replanting.

Cut the spring onions and keep the roots.,
Place the roots in water.,
Dig a row of small holes.,
Place one bulb into each hole.",How to Grow Spring Onions2," If you have purchased spring onions from the store, you can save the roots and replant them. After you have used the spring onions in your cooking, cut off the root approximately ½ an inch (1.5 cm) from the end., After you have cut off the roots of the spring onions, place them in water with the shoots sticking up. Within a few days you will begin to see a bit of new growth. They are then ready to be planted in your garden or small planter., The holes should be deep enough to completely cover the roots. Space the onions at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.

If you are planting more than one row of onions, the rows should be no less than 6 inches (15 cm) apart.

, The roots should be completely covered and the sprouts should be sticking out of the soil.

"
Water the onions when the soil is dry.,
Keep the area free from weeds.,
Lay mulch down.,
Apply a water soluble, liquid fertilizer as needed.,
Monitor your plants for pest problems.,
Watch for signs of disease.,
Harvest spring onions after 8 weeks.,
Pull out the entire onion.",How to Grow Spring Onions3," If you notice that the soil around the onions is dry, then you should water the area. Sprinkle your spring onions with water from a watering can or with a hose set to a light shower setting. Be careful not to overwater or water log the seeds. This can result in larger onions with a weak flavour., The more weeds your garden has, the more your onions will have to compete with them for nutrients and moisture. The strongest spring onions will grow in a weed-free space.To remove weeds, pull out the roots or snip the weeds by hand instead of applying a broad chemical weed-killer.
Alternatively, you can gently rake the soil periodically to prevent weeds from taking root.

, Mulch will retain moisture and prevent the soil from drying out too quickly. It also chokes many weeds, preventing them from competing for resources. Apply the mulch around your bulbs, but do not cover them completely.

, Ordinarily, spring onions mature quickly enough and heartily enough to avoid fertilizer use. If the weather is particularly dry and uncooperative; however, you may need to apply a fertilizer to provide them with a boost of nutrients.

, Spring onions mature quickly, so they do not suffer from pests as frequently as other onion varieties do. If you do notice pests, apply an organic pesticide to the infested crop to kill or ward them off., Spring onions do not fall victim to disease very often, but neck rot and white rot can occasionally grow on the bulbs. If these molds develop, remove the infected onions to prevent the disease from spreading to healthy ones.

, Spring onions are usually ready to eat once they reach 6 inches (15 cm) in height with a thickness of about 1/2 an inch (1.5 cm). This usually takes approximately 8 weeks, but some may take a few weeks longer.You can allow your spring onions to continue growing past this point, but you should pull them once they reach a diameter of 1 inch (2.5 cm). Otherwise, the flavour will be weaker.

, Grab the onion at the base, close to the top of the soil and gently pull the onion out of the ground. Alternatively, you can use a small shovel to dig out the entire onion.Alternatively, you can cut the tops off of the onion and leave the root planted. This way you will not actually remove the plant and the onions will continue to grow.

Prepare your plot in the late summer or autumn.,
Select a sunny spot in your garden.,
Break up the soil.,
Mix organic matter into the soil.,
Plant each set 1 to 2 inches (2 1/2 to 5 centimeters) deep.,
Space sets 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) apart within each row.,
Cover your planted sets with a heavy layer of mulch.",How to Grow Winter Onions1," You can plant your sets as early as August, but many gardeners prefer to wait until October, when the weather has significantly cooled. You can even plant your sets in the early winter, as long as the ground has not become solid yet.;
, Winter onions are hardy enough to grow in a variety of conditions, but they prefer to soak in full sun.

, Use a rake or trowel to loosen the soil in your plot. Winter onions do best in loose, well-drained soil. Avoid using sandy soils, however, since sand causes soil to lose moisture a little too quickly, preventing your onions from soaking in all the nutrients they need to thrive.

, Sterilized compost is a popular choice. Organic matter provides additional nutrients and may improve the soil's ability to retain proper moisture levels.

, Gently push the set into the ground until it is just below soil level. Cover it with additional soil if necessary, gently packing the soil over the bulb.

, Each row should also be spaced about 1 foot (30 centimeters) apart.

, The mulch allows the soil to retain moisture longer and also keeps the onions a little warmer than they would be if the soil remained exposed.

"
"
Water the onions twice a week for the first two weeks.,
Give your onions two doses of fertilizer.,
Weed the area.,
Watch out for pests.,
Harvest onion greens at any time during the spring.,
Harvest onion bulbs once the tops go brown.,
Allow a few of the bulbs to ""walk.""",How to Grow Winter Onions2," After that, avoid watering the onions at all, especially once the ground has frozen. Once the weather warms up again, water the onions only if you experience a drought and the soil looks hard, cracked, and dry.

, The first dose should come shortly before the first heavy freeze. If you live in an area where it does not freeze, apply the first dose of fertilizer any time from late October through November. The second dose should be in the early summer, before harvest.

, Throughout the majority of the growing season, weeds do not pose much problem. When you do see weeds, however, you should yank them up immediately, either by hand or by using a sharp hoe. Weeds will compete with your onions for nutrients in the soil, causing a small, dehydrated crop.

, You will not have much of a pest problem throughout the majority of the growing period, but if you notice any pests once the weather warms up, use a non-hazardous pesticide to kill or ward them off.

, Once the greens reach several inches (10 centimeters or so) in height, you can snip them off with shears. They have a mild flavor but work well in many recipes that call for onions.

, This usually occurs anytime from the late spring to the early autumn, depending on when you planted your sets. Due to the lengthy growing period, winter onions have notably large root bulbs. Tug on the tops until the bulb comes out or pry them out with a garden fork. Dust off as much soil as possible before setting them out to dry.

, The most common winter onion is the ""walking onion,"" which produces a top bulblet. Once the bulblet grows large enough, the weight of it causes it to sink to the ground and plant itself. Oftentimes, you can still snip off the stem and the ground bulb after this occurs. Allowing the bulblets to replant themselves ensures a crop for next year.

Since one yellow squash plant produces enough squash to last a small family all summer, there's no need to buy more than one packet of seeds.Yellow squash comes in two varieties: bush and vining. The bush varieties take up less space, while vining varieties spread out over the garden bed. Choose the one that best suits your needs.If you don't want to buy seeds, you can wait until the weather has warmed and your local garden store has yellow squash seedlings available. These have already germinated and sprouted, and are ready to be planted directly in the garden.;
, Yellow squash, like most vegetables, needs a spot with full, direct sunlight. Pick a place in your yard with good drainage, too. When squash plants become waterlogged, they tend to rot and die before the season is over.


You can plant squash in rows or on hills, with three to five seeds per hill.
If you're planting a vining variety, make sure the planting spot is large enough to accommodate a plant that will spread out over six feet or so in all directions.
To check whether a planting site has good drainage, dig a hole and fill it with water. If it drains quickly, the spot will work well. If the water stands in a puddle, look for a place with better drainage or mix in extra compost to amend the soil.
Make sure you have good soil for growing squash. If you have grown vegetables in that location in the past, all you need to do is add a little compost. Otherwise, conduct a soil test.

, This will ensure the squash grows up healthy and strong. Use a tiller or a garden rake to break up the soil to a depth of about 12 inches. Loosening the soil will help the roots take hold. Add four inches of compost and mix it in with the tilled soil.

, Plant the seeds 1 inch deep, spacing them out 12 inches apart. Squash need a lot of room to grow, so be sure not to space them too close together.


If you are planting seedlings, plant them 18 inches apart to give them plenty of room to grow.
Make sure you wait until after all chance of the last frost has passed, or your squash seeds may have trouble germinating.

, Squash needs about one inch of water per week, spread out among the days. Every morning, water the squash plant thoroughly before the sun gets too strong. Water near the roots for a minute or so to give the plant a good soaking.On days when it rains or when the soil feels moist in the morning, skip your daily watering. You don't want the plants to become waterlogged.
Avoid watering later in the day or at night, since the water won't get the chance to evaporate in the sun. Water left on the plant can lead to mold growth.

, When the seeds sprout, thin them out so that the squash plants are at least 18 inches apart. For the rest of the growing season, they will get larger and larger, so it's wise to spread them out.


If you plant on a hill, thin to the strongest two or three plants per hill.

, This helps to retain moisture and keeps weeds from growing up around the plants. Use a thin layer of any type of organic mulch around the base of the plants.


Before mulching, use a hoe to break up any newly sprouted weeds.

, When the vines have grown to be about five feet long, pinch off the tips to encourage the plants to begin producing squash instead of putting their energy into growing longer vines. Check the ends of the vines and pinch off the section that juts out from the last pair of leaves.

, These common pests can wreak havoc on your squash plants if you don't stop them before they get out of control. Pick off insects and drop them into a pail of soapy water to prevent them from taking over your plants.


Squash vine borers are 1/2-inch long gray insects. Cucumber beetles are 1 inch long with black heads and yellow or green wings. They feed on the plant and cause the leaves to wilt and turn black.
If you have a large bed of squash, you might want to consider installing row protectors to keep damaging insects away from your plants. Install when the plants are young and remove them once they begin to bloom to allow for pollination.

, Yellow squash can grow larger, but it has the best flavor while it's still relatively small. Harvest the squash by using a paring knife to cut it off against the stem, leaving a small bit of the stem intact., Once your plant becomes active, you may have a few new squash ready to harvest every single day. Harvest the squash right away so the plant can divert energy into growing new squash.

, Yellow squash doesn't keep very long, so it's best to use them within a few days of harvesting them. They're delicious sauteed plain or used in lasagna or soup. If you want to store your squash, place them in an open plastic bag and store in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Harvest your zucchini.",How to Grow Zucchini," There are two general methods of propagating zucchini - either by planting seeds, or by purchasing a small pre-existing zucchini plant and transplanting it to your garden. If you choose to grow your zucchini from seeds, you’ll have to start your seeds 4-6 weeks prior to the planting time outdoors for your environment/location. Grabbing a pre-potted plant is always easier and less time-consuming, but may not be as fulfilling as starting your zucchini from seeds.


There are a few kinds of zucchini, but the squash are all generally the same. You might see zucchini as classified as ‘open habit’ or ‘dense habit’, which refers to the way the leaves grow on the bush (sprawling/vine-y or bush-like).
Most bush varieties of zucchini are considered summer squash, while vine varieties are considered winter squash.
Zucchini will vary naturally between a yellow-ish hue and a green so dark it is nearly black. Some have very mild stripes/spots, this is normal and should not be concerning.;
, Zucchini is typically considered a summer squash, because it thrives and produces the best fruit in summer. Some varieties are considered winter squashes, but this has to do with the time of fruiting, rather than the time of planting. Zucchini are sun loving and won’t do well in cold soil. Therefore, plant your zucchini when the temperature of the soil outdoors is at least 55 °F (13 °C). This is normally after the first or second week of spring, after all chance of frost have passed.If you’re not sure when to plant, call your local agricultural extension for detailed information on planting times for zucchini in your area.

, Zucchini will thrive in an area that gets full sunlight with plenty of room to spread out. Find a location in your garden that will supply the zucchini with at least 6-10 hours of sunlight per day, and that lacks too much shade. Be sure to select a plot that has well draining soil; zucchini like moist soil, but not soggy soil.


If necessary, improve drainage by planting the zucchini on soil mounds, or through larger changes such as soil amendment and drainage systems.
Plant in an area with southern exposure for maximum sun (or northern exposure in the Southern Hemisphere).

, Although not everyone has the time to, preparing soil several months in advance will allow for the best growing conditions for your zucchini. Start by mixing in a gardening mulch and fertilizer, to supply the soil with the necessary nutrients. Test the soil pH, and amend it if necessary; zucchini prefer a soil environment with a pH between 6 and 7.5. To make the soil more acidic (lower pH), mix in peat moss or pine needles. To make the soil more alkaline (higher pH), mix in lime.To add nutrients and organic material, till compost into the soil a month before planting, then cover with mulch until time to plant.
If your soil does not drain well, mix in some sand to help encourage water drainage.

, If you’d rather not take chances of sowing your seeds directly into the soil, you can start your zucchini seeds indoors 4-6 weeks prior to transplanting them outdoors. Grab seed trays, soil-less potting mixture, and your seeds. Place a single seed in each tray, cover with ⅛ inch of potting mixture, and water well! These should be placed in an area that gets sunlight and is at least 60 °F (16 °C). When the second set of leaves have sprouted, the zucchini starts are ready to be transplanted outdoors.

, Use a gardening trowel to dig a small hole for your zucchini plant. If you’re planting seeds, you’ll need to stick each seed less than ½-inch under the soil. For zucchini starts, dig each hole to be slightly larger than the root ball on your plant. Keep 75–100 centimeter (39.4 in) space between each plant (same distance for row space). You can thin out seedlings if needed.

, Place each zucchini seed or start into its own individual hole. Cover seeds with ¼ or ½ inch of soil, so that they are able to get the necessary sunlight and water for germinating. Cover up a zucchini transplant with enough soil to cover the root ball without reaching up the stem. Finish up planting with a heavy watering, and you’re done!

, Keep an eye on your zucchini as they begin to grow. They’re relatively low-maintenance plants, but they do require a bit of upkeep in order to stay in tip-top producing condition. Pull out any weeds on site, and apply a layer of mulch if weeds continue to be a problem. Add a liquid growth fertilizer every 3-4 weeks to help promote growth in your zucchini. Cut off any diseased or dying fruit or branches to prevent disease from spreading to other parts of the plant, and to promote continuous growth., In order for your plant to start producing zucchini fruit, it has to become pollinated. If you lack bees or other pollinating insects in your area, or if your zucchini plant doesn’t seem to be producing any squash, you can pollinate your plant on your own. Pick a male zucchini flower, identifiable by its long stem, slender stem, and a visible stamen in the center. Carefully pull back the blossoms on the stem, and rub the stamen inside a female zucchini flower. Female zucchini flowers have short stems, a bulbous growth where the flower meets the stem, and lack stamens.You can do this to several flowers or just a few, depending on the amount of time you have and the growth you’re trying to promote.

, When zucchini have grown to at least 4-inches in length, they are ready to be picked. Picking zucchini regularly promotes more squash production. Therefore, if you want lots of the squash, then pick all the zucchinis as they reach maturity. If you don’t have a need for too many squash, leave one or two zucchinis on the vine for the whole growing season to slow down the production. To harvest your zucchini, use a sharp knife to sever the squash from the rough stem that attaches it to the bush.


Enjoy the flowers in salads. These are edible and if you pick them, there won't be so many zucchini fruits growing.
Crops will continue to grow until the first frosts if they established well during spring.
You can simply cut the stem of a zucchini to promote growth, if you don’t want to harvest all of your squash yet."

Tie up individual branches.",How to Tie up Tomatoes," Tie up tomatoes when these parts of the plant are making contact with the soil. This will help prevent problems with your plants.Foliage or fruit touching the ground exposes plants to diseases.
Tomatoes will be cleaner and easier to collect.;
, Examine your plants as often as daily. Look for the first appearance of blossoms. Check for branches that are sagging. Also look for branches that are straying too far away from the trellis, stake or cage., You’ll need to tie both determinate and indeterminate varieties frequently. However, indeterminate tomato plants will need more attention.Indeterminate tomato plants make branches and foliage until the first killing frost.
Determinate tomato plants have a shorter period of production and won’t require tying after their primary harvest time.

, Cut or rip old t-shirts or pantyhose. Alternately, use bedsheets or socks. Tear strips of varying lengths.Fabric is soft and stretchable, which allows for expansion as your plants grow.
Fabric needs to be collected and properly disposed of after the growing season. Depending on the material, fabric can take anywhere from a year to decades before it fully decomposes., Choose between nylon string, garden twine, or fishing line. All three options are weatherproof, but only certain types of twine are biodegradable.


Sisal, hemp and cotton twine are compostable as long as they’re untreated.Fishing line needs to be collected and discarded at the end of the season, as it takes hundreds of years to decompose and can pose a threat to wildlife.You’ll also need to collect nylon at the end of the season. It takes decades to decompose on its own.

, You can purchase Velcro or otherwise self-gripping garden tape. The advantage of garden tape is that you can tie up your whole tomato plant all at once. Unless “compostable” is stated on the package, assume that the tape is not biodegradable.

, Purchase foam or plastic garden ties or zip ties. Zip ties are inexpensive. However, none of these options are compostable and will need to be collected at the end of the growing season. Another disadvantage to ties is that they don’t have any expansion capability, so they can cut into the plants if they’re applied too tightly, or the plants grow significantly.


Foam ties provide cushion so that the ties are less likely to cut into the plant.

, Drive a stake about a foot into the ground near each plant. Use wood, bamboo or plastic stakes, or make your own stakes with scrap materials. Tie a loose loop around the plant stem, and a knot around the stake.Stake and tie plants as soon as you transplant seedlings, or shortly thereafter.

, Use gardening tape, fishing line or twine. Secure the end of the roll to one of the lower branches. Starting at the bottom, circle the entire plant with the tape or string. Finish by tying a knot at the top of the support structure.This method is useful for plants bigger than three feet.
As you wrap, place the tape or string at the strongest part of each branch, and wrap it around the cage wire or stake before moving upwards.

, Tie a string in a double knot around the stake. Find a part of the stalk that is just beneath a branch. Tie a loose double knot around the stalk of the plant.Tying a knot beneath a branch prevents downward slippage.
Do this for every ten to twelve inches of growth.

, Find the lower, beefy part of the branch which is below the fork. Wrap your tie around that part of the branch. Tie a double knot. Reach your tie around the tomato’s support system, and tie another double knot there.Do this gently and carefully. Don’t pull the knots or the line very tight.

Harvest your onions.",How to Grow Onions," As with most fruits and vegetables, there are many variations of the onion that are appealing for different reasons. Onions come in three general colors - white, yellow, and red/purple - each with their own distinct taste. Additionally, onions are categorized into two growing types: long-day and short-day. Long-day onions are named such because they begin sprouting when the days between 14 to 16 hours in length (late spring/summer), while short-day onions begin sprouting when days are between 10 to 12 hours in length (winter/early spring).


Long-day onions grow the best in northern states, while short-day onions grow the best in southern states.Yellow onions are golden in color and have a slightly sweet flavor, white onions are sharp and a bit tangier than their yellow counterparts, and red onions are violet in color and are often eaten fresh rather than cooked.;
, In general, there are two popular ways of growing onions: using either onion sets (bulbs) or using onion seeds. Gardeners tend to prefer planting onion sets, as they are a bit hardier and stand up to poor weather better than onion seeds. However, if you’re able and willing to grow your onions from seeds indoors and transplant them outdoors, you can certainly raise them all on your own from seeds.You can also plant your onions in the ground in warm weather.You can choose to grow onions from transplants/cuttings, but this isn’t always successful and is much more difficult to accomplish than just using sets or seeds.
Visit a local nursery to get recommendations on sets and seeds that grow well in your area.

, Onions can be tricky to grow if they’re not planted at the right time. If planted in cold weather, they can die off or waste energy in blossoms rather than bulbs in the spring. If you’re planting seeds, start them indoors at least 6 weeks prior to planting outdoors. Make sure that you sow the onions 6 weeks before your average last frost date, and set them out after that date., Onions aren’t too terribly picky when it comes to growing conditions, but they do have some preferences. Select a place with plenty of room and full sunlight. Onions will grow quite large if they’re given enough space, so keep in mind that the more area you give them to grow, the larger they will get. Avoid planting them in a location that is shaded by larger plants or trees.


Onions grow well in raised beds, so if you’re unable to find adequate garden space, you can build a separate raised bed for your onion crop.

, Although it takes some forethought, if you are able to prepare the soil of your plot for planting several months in advance, you’ll receive a better onion crop down the line. If you’re able, begin tilling the soil and adding in manure in the fall. If your soil is very rocky, sandy, or has lots of clay, mix in some potting soil to help even things out. Additionally, test the pH level of your soil and add in any necessary compounds in order to create a pH that falls between 6 to 7.5.


Testing and altering the pH of your soil is best done at least a month prior to planting, so that any additives have time to take effect on the soil and prepare the foundation for the onions to grow.

, When you’re ready to plant, till the soil about 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep and add a layer (1 cup per 20 feet) of phosphorous fertilizer. However, only do this if your soil is low on phosphorus. Be sure to test your soil first to find out. Using a mixture such as 10-20-10 or 0-20-0 will provide an extra boost for your developing onions. At this point, be sure to remove any weeds that may be present in the garden plot you’re planting in.

, Plant onions so that no more than one inch of soil is placed above the sets or seedlings; if too much of the bulb is buried, the growth of the onion will be reduced and constricted. Space onion sets 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) apart, and onion seeds 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) apart. As your onions begin to grow, you can transplant them and space them further apart in order to increase their growing size.

, Place your seeds in the holes you’ve dug, covering them with ¼ to ½ inch of soil. The sets should be no more than two inches deep. Use your hands or shoes to firmly tamp the soil over the top of the onions; they grow better in firm, rather than loose, soil. Finish up planting by adding a bit of water, and you’re set to watch them grow!


Transplanted onions require more water than sets or seeds, so give yours a little extra moisture if that’s what you planted.

, Onions are relatively delicate plants, as they have a fragile root system that can easily be damaged or abused by weeds and tugging. Use a hoe to cut off the tops of any weeds that emerge, rather than pulling them out; tugging the weeds could tug out the roots of the onions, and make growing difficult. Give your onions about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week, and supplement with a nitrogen fertilizer once a month for nutrients. Immediately after planting, add a light layer of mulch between each plant to lock in moisture and block out weeds.


If you want your onions to taste a bit sweeter, give them more water than you normally would.
If any of your onions flower, pull them out. These onions have ‘bolted’ and won’t continue to grow in size or flavor.

, Onions are fully ripe when the tops appear golden yellow; at this point, bend the tops so that they lay flat on the ground. Doing this will move further nutrients towards developing the bulb rather than growing the shoots. After 24 hours, the tops should appear brown and the onions are ready to be pulled. Remove them from the soil and trim off the shoots at 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the bulb and the roots. Leave the onions to dry out for a day or two in the sun, and then move them to a dry space indoors for two to four weeks to continue drying.


Store onions in stockings or over a wire screen to allow good airflow when drying. This will help them to keep for longer and maintain their flavor.
Sweet onions will go bad earliest because of their high moisture content, so eat them first in order to prevent rot from making an appearance.Discard, or cut up and use, any onions that show signs of decay so they don't spread disease to other onions in storage.

You can also use last year's cages again.
Tomato cages can be metal, wooden or plastic. Metal cages hold up better against the elements but can be prone to rust. Garden shops and home improvement centers sell tomato cages in all 3 varieties.
Check previously-used metal cages for rust. Tomato cages can be reused every year, but metal cages can rust due to rain and the elements. Check each tomato cage for rust and broken wires. Replace any faulty or rusty cages to avoid scrapes or cuts when gardening.;
,


Plan to cage tomatoes after a regular watering. This will soften the soil and make it easier to push the cages into the dirt. Watering will also revive any drooping or wilting tomato plants, making it easier for you to install the cage around the plant.

, The stake will help support the weight of the plant and direct its growth upwards.


Use 1 wooden garden stake per tomato plant. Space the stake about 2 inches from the main trunk or base of the plant to avoid hitting its roots.

, Pound it down 2 to 3 inches so it's stable. Be sure to hold the stake straight while you pound it into the ground.


To support heavier plants, anchor them to the stake. Tie a piece of coated wire or twine around the base of the plant and the stake. This will keep the plant from breaking under the weight of the fruit and help it climb up the cage.

,


Hold the tomato cage above the plant and stake. Center it so that they are in the middle of the cage. Lower the cage down slowly over the plant, being careful not to impale any leaves or tomatoes.

,


Push the cage down with both hands or use the hammer to pound the wire anchors of the cage into the ground. The wire anchors should be completely anchored into the dirt so the bottom rung of the tomato cage is even with the base of the tomato plant.

,


Place a hand on either side of the top of the cage and try to move it. It's stable if it holds in place and the plant doesn't move. Pound it down into the ground another inch if the cage shifts when force is applied.

,


Position the plant's branches so that they are over the rungs of the tomato cage and being supported by the structure. This encourages the plant to continue using the cage for support.

, Remove it when the plant stops producing fruit.


Check the plant inside the cage frequently and adjust branches if needed to help it support its weight on the cage. Prune plants and harvest tomatoes through the open sides of the cage.
When the plant is done producing tomatoes, pull the cage out of the ground, wash it off to remove dirt or bugs and store it for the winter.

Place potting soil in shallow containers.
Set the Brandywine seeds into the containers, about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) deep.
Fill a pan with water and place the containers in the pan until the soil has soaked up all the water.
Place the containers in a warm location, ideally about 75 degrees F (24 degrees C).
Move your containers to a warm, well-lit location as soon as the seedlings pop up (about 5 or 6 days). Keep them there until the last frost, when you are ready to plant.;
,


Check your soil. Brandywines prefer a soil with a pH of about 6.5, with less nitrogen. Too much nitrogen will encourage more foliage on the tomatoes and less fruit. Make sure the soil is well draining and supplemented with organic material.
Choose a location with lots of space and full sun. Because of their heavy foliage, Brandywine tomatoes need extra space to grow.

, This is to allow the small plants to acclimate to the weather, and it is often called ""hardening.""

, Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the root ball of each small plant using a trowel. Place the plants in the holes and cover with the dirt. Space the tomato plants 18 inches (46 cm) apart.

,


Press a wooden or metal stake into the ground at the base of each tomato plant.
Tie the main stem of the plant securely to the stake.

, Pull off any suckers that attach from the leaf stem to the main stem. Thin out any heavy areas of foliage to allow the plant to receive more nutrients.

, Make sure you water only the base soil, not the leaves of a plant. A garden drip system is best for tomatoes, as it will provide steady moisture to the soil, but not wet the entire plant.

Purchasing an onion set allows you to skip straight to the planting phase rather than having to sprout seeds first. The sets come ready to be put in the ground.
Pick the right onion for your climate. Long-day onions, which means they need lots of sunlight, do better in northern climates. If you buy them from a local store, they should be stocking onions appropriate to where you live.
Short-day onions do better in southern climates, where they can grow through the winter, if it's mild enough.;
, You should start out seeds indoors to give them more time to grow.You can even start as early as 8 to 10 weeks ahead.In other words, you can start seeds as early as late January.
Starting the indoors gives them more time to leaf, which leads to bigger bulbs. If you don't want to start indoors, buy plants to use outdoors.

, If you have a seed starter with individual cells, you can start out by adding 4 to 5 seeds to a cell. They should be about 1/2 inch deep. A cell is just the individual cup of soil that you plant seeds in.If you have a flat planter inside, plant them 1/4 inch apart.
You still want to plant them 1/2 an inch deep, though.

, While they are growing, your plants may get too tall. When they do, they'll start drooping. If that's the case, it's fine to trim them back to 3 inches., Onions should be planted in a sunny location. That means that the area doesn't get any shade from other plants, including trees or your house.The best way to figure out which location is sunniest in your yard is to monitor it.
Spend a day going outside every couple of hours. Notice which areas are sunniest throughout the day.When choosing the location, pick the one that has the most sun for onions.

, They are usually bordered with wood, concrete, or wood bricks. They raise the surface of the bed above the ground.


Start by measuring out your bed. Four feet by four feet is fairly standard, as most people can reach to the middle of the bed. Make the ground even with a shovel or rake.Get the wood you'll need. You'll need 4X4s as stakes for the corners. They should be a foot each. You'll also need 2X2s for the center stakes, four of them. Finally, you'll 2X6s for the sides. They need to be 4 feet long, and you'll need 8 of them.Lay out your 2X6s on the square. Start by screwing one 2X6 into the side of the 4X4 post, flush with the bottom and the outer edge. Place another 2X6 on top of the other one in the same position but further up the post. It should be flush with the top and right up against the first one. Screw it in.The next set of 2X6s should be added so that they go to the edge of the post but cover up the ends of the other boards. In other words, the first boards should run into the second, with the post sticking on the outside rather than the inside. Continue around the square until all the boards are joined. Once you've done that, measure across the square diagonally to make sure it's all square. If it's not, adjust the square by moving it slightly.Add the other stakes. Hammer them into the ground up against the middle of each wall on the outside, then use deck screws to attach them to the wall. Finally, add in soil., Another option is raised rows. Raised rows are like raised beds, but they aren't structured like raised beds. Instead, you create them with just the soil.When the soil is dry, spread biodegradable material on top of it, such as compost or rotting hay or grass. With a garden rake or rototiller, work it into the soil until the soil is loose and crumbly.
Stake out how you want your rows to go. You want them to be about 4 feet wide or a little shorter if you can't reach to the middle. Between the rows, you need space to walk. If you want room for a wheelbarrow, make the in-between part at least a foot to two feet wide.
Create raised beds by moving the soil from the paths into the raised beds. A rake is good for this purpose. You may need to use a shovel near the end. To keep the paths from growing anything, line them with newspaper (5 pieces thick). You can also use cardboard. Put mulch or wood chips on top.

, You can find soil kits at your local gardening store, or you can take a soil sample into your county extension office for testing. Your soil should be at between 6 and 6.8 pH.You may need to adjust the pH of the soil.
If you need to make it more acidic (down towards 6.8), you'll add powdered sulfur, aluminum sulfate, or iron sulfate.
To up the pH (make it slightly more alkaline), add lime.If you need help deciding how much, use a pH kit from your local university agriculture extension office, which will give you detailed instructions about what to add. Find your local extension at http://nifa.usda.gov/partners-and-extension-map?state=All&type=Extension.

, Onions need nitrogen to grow well. Therefore, always add nitrogen to the soil before planting. You can also work nitrogen in the soil in the fall to help for the next spring.The easiest way to add nitrogen is to use a fertilizer rich in nitrogen. Good sources of nitrogen include fertilizers, composted manure, blood meal, and other composted organic materials., You should harden off the plants when it starts warming up outside, and you are getting ready to move them outside. Hardening off the plants just means you start getting the plants accustomed to being outside by giving them short visits. Start by putting them outside for a couple hours on a temperate day. It should at least be in the 40s.Increase the amount of time they spend outside each day by a couple of hours.Also, start lessening how much you water them. As they move outside, they'll get less water. You have to get them accustomed to them. Give them just enough water to keep them from wilting., Once you've spent a week to a week and a half hardening the plants, it's time to plant them. You can plant outside once the temperature reaches about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.You should be sure that the temperature won't go below 20 degrees outside when you plant.Each plant should go in about 1/2 inch.Late March to early April is usually a good time.
Of course, if you have late winters, you may need to wait longer.
You can plant 2 to 4 weeks before the last frost date., If you want especially large bulbs, put them 4 to 6 inches apart.If you want them smaller, make them 2 inches apart. You can plant them even closer if you have scallions.The rows should be 12 inches a part.Whether you did rows or beds, that means you should be able to get 2 furrows (rows) per row or bed.

, The plants should be about 4 inches once they are in the ground. Use shears to trim down the plants once you get them all planted., Onions need a lot of water. In fact, they need about an inch a week. If you aren't getting rain, you will need to water the onions regularly.If you're not sure when to water them, check the soil to see if it's moist. While the plants are leafing, it needs to always be moist. However, once a week should be sufficient as long as they get a good soaking.Once the bulbs start getting larger (when the plant part stops growing), the bulbs need to be kept much drier., You can add a layer of mulch around the plants. The mulch will suppress weeds coming up.Mulch is just a layer of material you put over the dirt. It can be things like bark pieces, grass clippings, or straw, as well as inorganic materials such as stones, plastic, or brick chips. You can find mulch for sale at your local garden store, though you can also just use grass clippings from your yard.Organic materials also improve the soil over time.
Mulch helps the soil retain water, as well.
However, you'll need to remove the mulch once the bulbs start to enlarge. You should see them start pushing up the soil a bit. The bulbs need to be drier, and mulch retains too much moisture., For large, dry bulb onions, you'll need to wait at least 100 days but up to 175 days to harvest. If you're fine with green onions, you can harvest them in as little as 3 weeks to a month."

Pinch off the shoots once your peas are 6 inches or longer.",How to Grow Sweet Peas," Sweet peas are usually started from seed. You may either plant them in seed trays indoors and later transplanting them to the garden bed, or start them outside. Seeds are available for purchase at any garden store. For rarer varieties, check online retailers.


""Old-fashioned"" sweet peas will produce very fragrant flowers.
Spencer varieties have bright colors, but less fragrance. You'll find them in pink, purple, blue, white and red.;
, Sweet peas can be grown in any growing zone, but it's important to know the right time to get them ready. They must be planted as early as possible to form a strong root system and survive the summer. Therefore, starting seeds early in the year is usually your best bet.


If you live in a temperate area where the ground does not freeze in the winter (USDA zones 8-10), you can plant your seeds directly in the ground as early as November, though waiting until January or February is also fine. Be sure to water them over the winter, and they'll emerge in spring.
If you live in an area where the winters are cold, starting seeds indoors is your best bet. That way, the seedlings will be ready to plant as soon as the first frost has passed. If you wait too long to plant your seeds, they won't have time to take hold in the soil before the summer weather gets hot.Another option is to sow seeds directly in the ground in late winter, and then allow them to come up when they are ready.

, Sweet pea seeds have the best chance of germinating if you help penetrate the seed shell before planting. You can do this by either soaking them in a pan of water overnight, or using a tiny knife or nail clipper to nick the surface of each seed.If you soak your seeds, only plant those that have swelled during the overnight soaking. Discard those that haven't changed in size.

, About 5 weeks before the last frost (usually mid-February or so), prepare small seed trays or peat containers with a seed starting mixture. Plant the seeds 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep and 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart, or in separate compartments.

, Water the seeds trays and cover them lightly in plastic wrap for the first week or so, to regulate the temperature. Keep them in a greenhouse or in a sunny window in a place where the temperature won't drop below 70 °F (21 °C). Once the seedlings sprout, remove the covering and keep them moist and warm until it's time to plant them just after the last frost.


If you're using seed trays, thin out the seedlings to space them 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart once they've sprouted leaves.
Pinch of flowers and buds before transplanting, so the seedlings' energy can be channeled into growing new roots.

, Sweet peas of all varieties thrive in sunny areas, making them a great choice for exposed sections of fence and walls. In the heat of summer, sweet peas will do fine in partial shade, but it's better to find someplace sunny to be on the safe side. Since sweet peas love to climb, find a spot where they can grow toward the sky. They produce small tendrils that will latch onto any type of pole you plant them near.


Sweet peas make an excellent natural decoration for fences. If you have a wooden or chain link fence you want to brighten up, plant sweet peas there.
Sweet peas are often grown on trellises or archways. This is another lovely choice, and will lend your garden a country cottage feel.
If you don't have a suitable place for sweet peas, erect a few bamboo posts in your garden and plant sweet peas there. It'll lend some height and interest to your garden. You could also create a tower of stakes in a pot or a small arbor.
You can plant sweet peas among other plants, like shrubs or vegetables.

, Sweet peas grow best in rich soil that drains well. Prepare the soil for planting by tilling it to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm) and working in some compost or manure. This is especially important if your soil is clay heavy; you'll need to work in extra compost to make sure it drains well enough for sweet peas' roots.To determine whether the soil drains well enough, observe it after a heavy rain. If water collects and puddles and takes time to drain, the soil there doesn't drain well. If the water soaks in right away, it should be fine for your seedlings.
Using a raised bed is a good option if you feel your soil is too clay heavy to support seedlings. This will come in handy for other plants you want to grow as well.

, Whether you started your seeds inside and are planting seedlings, or you want to plant your seeds directly in your garden bed, early spring is the right time to do it. If you live in a warm area where the ground never freezes, you can plant in January or February. If you live in an area where the ground does freeze, wait until just after the first frost, in early to mid April., If you're transplanting seedlings, dig holes 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart and deep enough to set the seedlings root balls into the ground. Pat fresh soil lightly around the stems of the seedlings. For seeds you're planting directly in the ground, dig holes one inch deep and 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart. When they sprout, you'll need to thin them out to 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart, so each plant has plenty of room to grow.

, Finish by giving the plants a good dose of fresh water. The sweet peas will begin to spring up quickly once warmer weather sets in.

, Sweet peas must be kept nice and wet throughout the summer. Water them lightly every day it does not rain. Check the soil surrounding the sweet pea stems often to make sure it doesn't dry out.

, Sweet peas are quite prolific, and a monthly application of mild fertilizer will keep them blooming for many weeks. It's not mandatory, but it's helpful if you want to make the most of your flowers. Use compost, manure or a high-potassium commercial fertilizer application.

, Cutting the flowers promotes new growth, so don't hesitate to bring in some fresh blossoms or make a bouquet for a friend. Wait until the flowers have reached their fragrant and colorful peaks before cutting. You should also remove faded blossoms, which sap energy from the plant and prevent more flowers from growing., These annuals won't come back on their own next year, but you can enjoy them again if you save the seed pods and plant them again in the winter or spring, depending on where you live.

, This will encourage new growth in the form of more side-shoots and flowers.You can just use your fingernails to pinch off the shoots."

Gather stakes, ties and a hammer or mallet to stake tomato plants.,
Plan to insert the stakes into the ground either when you plant your tomatoes or shortly after, before they get very tall.,
Pick a spot about 3 to 6 inches (7.62 to 15.24 cm) away from each tomato plant.

,
Pound your stakes into the ground using a hammer or mallet.,
Start tying your tomato plants to the stakes as soon as blooms begin to appear.

,
Tie the main stalks to the stakes first.,
Tie branches as they grow, as well as new growth on the main stalks, using longer ties so there is enough room to wrap them around the branches and the stakes.

,
Check your tomato plants each day to be sure to tie new growth before they get unruly or touch the ground.

",How to Stake Tomato Plants,";
,


If you wait too long, you can damage the roots or stalks when you put the stakes in the ground.

,,


Put them deep enough so that they are not wobbly or in danger of falling over. Check them by moving them back and forth and pound them deeper into the ground if they do not feel secure.

,, Wrap the ties around the tomato plants and the stake loosely, and secure it firmly with a knot.

Carefully hammer your stakes into the ground, with two plants between each stake.,
Hammer two stakes together at the ends of the rows for extra reinforcement.

,
Tie the end of the string to the stake at the end of the row about 8” off the ground.

,
Carefully bring the string in front of the first plant next to the stake, then behind the second plant.

,
Pull the string tight and loop it around the next stake once.

,
Proceed to the next set of plants, repeating steps 4 and 5, keeping the string parallel to the ground.,
Return to the starting end, tie off and then cut your twine.",How to Tie Tomatoes Using the Florida Weave," The stakes should be as straight and vertical as possible, and should be in line with the plants. Make sure the stakes are at least 6” in the ground. The stakes should not wiggle.;
,,,,,


Note that when you have reached the end of the row, loop the string around the end stake twice, and work your way back down the other side of the plants, putting the string on the side of the plant that doesn’t already have a string. The two strings should cross half-way between each pair of stakes. Don’t pull this side too tight, or you’ll break the plants.

, You are now ready for your next row(s).

Obtain the seeds.,
Prepare a garden pot.,
Plant the seeds.,
Keep the pots in a warm but shady place.",How to Grow Prickly Pears1," You can do this by purchasing them from a nursery or garden store, or you can extract them from prickly pear fruit. Prickly pear fruit is a red, egg-shaped fruit that grows off the top of the prickly pear plant. To remove the seeds from a fruit:Put on gloves to protect your hands from the thorns. Slice the ends off the fruit. Stand the fruit up on one end.
Make a thin, vertical slice down one side of the skin, and carefully stick a finger underneath. Peel away the skin by unwrapping the fruit like an orange.
Use your fingers to break apart the flesh to find the seeds, which are studded throughout the fruit.;
, Take a small garden pot that has a hole in the bottom. Cover the bottom of the pot with a layer of small rocks, which will allow water to drain better.


Fill the pot with soil that contains about half soil and half sand, rough pumice, or loam. These soils drain better than ones with a high clay content, and are more similar to the natural desert soils a cactus prefers.You can also purchase a pre-mixed cactus or succulent potting mix.
If you don’t have any garden pots, you can use a plastic cup. Poke several holes in the bottom to allow water to drain out.
To grow multiple prickly pears, prepare several garden pots in this way.

, Lay one or two seeds on top of the soil. Gently press the seeds into the soil and cover them with a light dusting of soil.Add a small amount of water. You want the soil to be moist, but not wet.

, Cactus seeds don’t need direct sunlight the way established plants do. Keep the pots in a shaded area that’s surrounded by sunlight to allow for a warm climate.


As the seeds grow, keep the soil moist until they germinate.Water the soil when it starts to become dry to the touch.
Prickly pears grown from seeds tend to take longer to grow than propagated plants, and the resulting cacti could take three to four years to produce flowers and fruit. However, growing plants from seeds is important for ensuring genetic diversity."

Find an establish prickly pear to propagate.,
Cut off a pad.,
Let the pad form a callous.,
Prepare a garden pot.,
Plant the pad when the cut has healed.,
Water the plant.,
Place the pad in the sun.",How to Grow Prickly Pears2," Another way to grow prickly pear is to use a cutting from an established plant. Ask friends and neighbors if you can take a cutting from one of their plants if you don’t have any established prickly pears of your own.


To propagate prickly pear from existing plants, you use cuttings from the pads of the plants, which are actually modified stems or branches.The pads are the flat, green, fleshy parts that make up the majority of the plant.

, Select a healthy pad that’s medium or large in size, and between one and three years old. Ideally, look for a pad that’s free of damage, specks, or any deformities.To take a cutting, hold the top of the pad with a gloved hand and slice the pad above the joint where it attaches to the rest of the plant.Don’t cut the pad below the joint, because this can cause infection and the plant will rot.

, To prevent infection and rotting, you must let the cactus pad cutting form a callous where it was cut before you can plant it. Lay the pad on a bed of soil or sandy soil for one to two weeks, until the cut has healed.Leave the pad in a shaded area while you're waiting for the callous to form.

, Fill the bottom of a medium planting pot with stones to allow for drainage. Fill the rest of the pot with sandy or loamy soil, which will also allow for good drainage.


The ideal soil will be a half-and-half mixture of soil and sand or pumice., Make a one- to two-inch hole in the soil with your finger. Place the pad upright in the garden pot, with the cut end in the soil. Bury the end. Do not bury the end more than one or two inches deep, otherwise it could rot.If the pad is having trouble standing, surround it with a few rocks to prop it up.

, Water the plant only when the soil looks dry, about once or twice per week., Unlike prickly pear seeds, pads need plenty of direct sunlight. However, the pads can sunburn in hot sun, so it’s important to protect the pad from direct sunlight between the hours of 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., when the sun is strongest.To avoid having to move the prickly pear constantly, you can position the plant so the broad sides of the pad are facing east and west, so the thinner sides of the pad are facing the sun when it’s at its hottest.
This will protect it from sunburn so that you don’t have to move it out of the sun every afternoon.
Once the cutting has established roots it will be ready for full sun exposure.

Choose a permanent location for the cactus.,
Transplant the cactus.,
Harvest pads and fruit once the plant is established.,
Cover the soil with mulch in winter.",How to Grow Prickly Pears3," You can continue growing your prickly pear in a pot, or you can transplant it into the ground. To transplant the cactus, choose an outdoor location that gets lots of full sun exposure.


Even if you keep the prickly pear in a pot, it still needs to be positioned somewhere that gets full sun.
If you live in a climate with colder winters where temperatures dip below 14 degrees F (-10 degrees C), keep the prickly pear in a pot so you can move it indoors when the weather gets cold., The best time to transplant a prickly pear is in the late spring, when the risk of frost and excessive rain are done.Dig a hole that’s about the same size as the pot the cactus is in. Get the pot as near to the hole as possible. Gently tip the pot upside down and cup the plant with a gloved hand.Place the roots in the hole and cover it with soil. Pack the soil down with your hands and saturate it with water.
During the first week, water the plant every three to four days. After that, water the cactus every three to four weeks. After the first year of establishment, it will not need any extra watering aside from the rain it gets.

, Let the prickly pear establish itself for several months before harvesting pads or fruit. Wait for the plant to grow a second or third pad before harvesting pads,and wait until there are at least eight blooms on a pad before harvesting the fruit it produces.Cut pads with a sharp knife in the late morning or early afternoon. This is when the acid content is lowest. Remove the pads just above the joint.
Harvest fruit by twisting the fruit and gently pulling it away from the pad. You know the fruit is ripe when the glochids, or thorns, fall off the light or dark colored bumps on the fruit.
Be sure to wear gloves to protect your hands from thorns when harvesting from the prickly pear.

, To prevent damage from the cold, even if you live in a warm climate, cover the soil surrounding the prickly pear with mulch in the fall.If you live in a cold climate and have your cactus in a pot, bring the prickly pear inside in the fall to prevent it from freezing.

Purchase all materials.,
Germinate your seeds.,
Transplant the seedlings.",How to Cultivate Lemongrass1," Lemongrass can be grown from seeds for very little money and with very little supplies, most of which can be found right near your home. The best time to begin growing is mid-February to early March , however, with the right care, you can grow them any time of year.


Stop at a garden store to find a 5 gallon container for every plant you’d like to grow, as well as sterilized seed starting mix, potting soil, and several planting trays with plastic domes - plastic bags also can work as a substitute. Seeds are sometimes harder to find at garden stores, but you can also buy them online at multiple nurseries.
If your seeds will not be constantly at least 70 degrees while they are germinating, consider buying a seedling heat mat as well to help nurture your seeds at a constant temperature as they grow.
If you wish to speed up the process, you can also purchase a nitrogen organic fertilizer like Alfalfa Meal or Blood Meal.;
, At this stage, the seeds are too fragile and vulnerable to go directly into soil, so you need to give them 1-2 weeks in a dark, warm place to sprout by tending to them very carefully. This is easier in a warm environment, but it’s possible to do in a colder place as well.


Put your seed starting mix into your seedling trays, inserting them about ¼ of an inch deep.
Place the domes, or your plastic bags, over the seeds so they are covered.
If the area around the seeds is cold, place your seedling heat mat beneath the trays.
Spritz the seeds with water daily, keeping them moist but not wet, replacing the dome or plastic bag each time.
When green seedlings appear from the seeds, remove the dome or bag from the trays and move them into full sunlight.

, Seedlings need more room and nutrients in order to grow into stalks, and each will need their own 5 gallon container to do this properly. So when your seedlings are roughly 6 inches long, it’s time to transplant!Fill each of your 5 gallon containers with four gallons of rich, well draining soil.
If you purchased fertilizer, mix a ½ cup of this with your soil before filling your container.
Move each seedling to its own pot, placing it roughly a ¼ of an inch down into the soil.
Water your plants at least 2 or 3 times every week, or a few times more if the weather is over 80 degrees and the soil feels dry like sand.

Keep your eye on the stalks as they grow.",How to Cultivate Lemongrass2," Growing your lemongrass from stalks is a quicker, and more cost-effective method, so it’s ideal for those with less gardening experience, those with a smaller budget, or just those who want an easier way to utilize this delicious herb!


Stop by any asian market. Usually they can be found in abundance. If there isn’t an asian market in your neighborhood, a local health food store, organic grocery store, or co-op.
Stop at a garden store. Purchase as many 5 gallon planting pots to accommodate each stalk, potting soil, and a large jar that will comfortably fit your stalks if you don’t already have one at home.
If you want to encourage your lemongrass to grow bigger, purchase organic fertilizer as well.

, With only some sun and a jar of water, roots will grow from the fleshy white base of the plant. It's important to grow these roots before placing your stalks into the pot, as they will help transfer nutrients to the rest of the plants, helping it grow faster and stronger.Find the spot in your house that gets the most sunlight for the longest time during the day. It’s helpful to observe your home at several key hours in order to determine this, including early 8 am, 12 pm, and later as the sun begins to set at 5 pm in the winter, or 7 pm in the summer.
Fill up the jar with an inch or two of water and place it in the sunny spot in your home.
Place the stalks into a large glass jar. Be sure to insert them with the thicker, lighter side down. into a large jar with an inch or two of water at the bottom.
Change the water in the jar daily. If you skip a day or two, it won’t be fatal to your plant, but be sure to change it out at least every 48 hours.
Wait 1-2 weeks. Stalks will be ready to plant when roots at the base grow about 3 inches long, and new leaves appear at the top of the stalks.

, Be gentle with the fragile roots at the bottom of your stalks, and don't bother drying them off, the extra water will be needed as they begin to grow.


Fill each container with four gallons of rich, well draining soil.
If you purchased fertilizer, mix a ½ cup of this with your soil before filling your container.
Place them root first into your 5 gallon pot, to leave plenty of room for growth.
Move each seedling to its own pot, placing it roughly ¼ of an inch down into the soil.
Water your plants at least 2 or 3 times every week, or a few times more if the weather is over 80 degrees and the soil seems to be dry like sand.

, When it looks like the stalks are getting a bit crowded, most likely the roots of your plants are fighting for nutrients. Replanting them into a larger container will help the roots of your lemongrass stretch out and absorb as many nutrients as possible.


Fill a larger pot with soil, and dig a hole roughly the size of your old pot.
Hold the stalks firmly in one hand, and tip the pot over to release the roots. Transfer it to the larger pot filled with soil.
You can also move your plants to the ground outside using the same method. If you do so, be sure to plant them 36-60 inches apart. However, keep in mind that you should only do this if you live in a warm climate, classified Zone 7 or higher. Otherwise, you’ll want to keep your plant in pots so you can move them back inside once the weather becomes too cold, or prepare to harvest them from the ground entirely.

Pull the stalks from the ground.,
Use the stems.,
Use the leaves.",How to Cultivate Lemongrass3," Once your stalks are at least 12 inches tall and the stems are ½ an inch thick, they are ready to harvest! There are a few different ways you can choose to do so.


Grab the stalk firmly down at the base nearest to the ground, and pull quickly. The stalk should be removed fully and cleanly.
If you live in a warm climate and would like the stalks to grow back next year, cut the stalks about an inch from the ground. Be sure to use a sharp knife as the plant can sometimes be hard to cut, but be aware that it may dull your blade. Once your stalks are harvested, cut the leaves from the stem using a knife. Both portions of the plant can be used for different purposes, so be sure to save both!

, Peel away the outer layers of the stem to expose the soft white insides, or the heart, which is the most flavorful part of the stalk. You can mince or puree the soft heart inside, and use them in many ways for flavoring food.Rice, salad, and sauces are a popular option for this herb, and you can also add the pureed stalk to smoothies.
In its rawest form, the lemongrass will help ease muscle pain, and aid in digestion.Store the stems by freezing them in a plastic bag, which will help keep them fresh for a few months.

, The leaves are most flavorful when raw, however, they can still pack a punch when dried.


Fresh lemongrass can be steeped in tea, used to create soaps, salves, or other lemony scrubs!
If you’d like to dry your lemongrass, start by bundling them up with string, and hanging them upside down in a dark place.
Dried lemongrass leaves can be added to soups, sauces, or any other dish.
Dried lemongrass leaves also help keep away insects, so put them along the ground outside your house to keep out any unwanted visitors!Store any unused dried lemongrass leaves in an airtight jar or container, they will stay fresh for up to a year.

, Plants cannot be actively growing when they are divided.

, Plants such as mint, chives and tarragon grow this way and are good candidates for division.

,


Push the shovel deep into the dirt, beneath the plant. You want the shovel to go beneath the root to bring up the entire herb plant. Gently lift the herb plant out of the ground.

,


Insert the knife or spade into the center of the plant, and cut down through the dirt and roots. Cut it in half so you have 2 plants.
Repeat the cut again with the 2 plants if you want to continue dividing. You can make the sections as small as you want, just make sure each new plant has roots and leaves (also called shoots).
Try pulling the plant apart if you do not want to use a knife. Some herbs, such as chives and lemongrass, will divide easily, without the use of any tools.

, You can put them in different spots, or keep them planted close together.


Dig a hole in your garden that will accommodate the roots. You do not want any roots to be sticking up out of the dirt.
Cover the roots and bottom of the plants with soil. Use a potting mix with whatever you have in your garden. Pat it into place.

, You do not want the roots to dry out. Continue to water daily until the new herb plants have become established, or begun growing new roots. You will know this has happened when you see new growth on the plant.

, If you do not want to put all of your newly divided herb plants in the garden, choose a decorative pot for them.


Put some soil on the bottom of the pot. Fill it about halfway, or enough so that the roots of the herb plant will be covered.

, The adult Elephant Ear plant will need at least 3 feet (1 meter) of space, at a bare minimum, for proper growth and show in a relatively shady area. A really healthy plant may need as much as 5 feet (1-2 meters) of space.

, Dig a hole, (if possible, in rich organic soil) about 3-4 times the size of the tuber.

, Refill the hole as necessary with loose soil enough so that the tuber will be about 1-2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm.) below ground level when planted.

, Lay (plant) the tuber with its top up - if in doubt, plant the tuber sideways and let nature figure it out!

, After the tubers have been planted and covered with soil, water the area deeply. After watering, about 1"" to 2"" (2.5 cm - 5 cm) of soil should cover the tuber.

, It will take a few weeks for the plant to emerge from the soil. Use a stake or other marker so you won't forget where you planted the Elephant Ear.

, The amount of time it takes for the first growth to show depends on the air and ground temperature.

, Elephant Ear plants perform reasonably well in average soil. Periodic fertilization (every 2 to 4 weeks) with a common plant fertilizer will help them do their best.

, Good drainage is a big plus, but the plant should not be left to go dry for any length of time. When this happens, the droopy leaves will give early enough warning for the plant to recover nicely if watered within a day.

, At the peak of the warm season, large, beautifully lush foliage can grow to heights of 3 to 5 feet (1-1.6 meters). If any leaves turn brown at the edges, just cut away and new ones will certainly grow.

, The plant will start having difficulties when the temperature falls below 50ºF (9-10ºC) or so for more than a few days. Before freezing temperatures take over, the tuber (root system) will have to be dug up.

, A healthy plant will have developed multiple new tubers during the growing season. It's best to leave these intact during storage. Separation will not do significant damage though.

, Trim most of the green vegetation (top growth) off the top of the tubers: leave no more than half to 1 inch of leafy growth on the tuber. Let the freshly trimmed tubers sit in open air so they can visibly dry out before final storage - maybe a couple of days at most will do. Drying out minimizes the potential for mold and bacteria to develop.

, During the colder, winter months, store the tubers in a cool, dry place (45-55ºF is desirable). Don't store in a plastic bag. Instead, a plain paper bag with plenty of holes for ventilation will do nicely, as will storage in sphagnum peat moss or garden vermiculite.

, When the warm season comes around again, separate the tubers as necessary, plant anew and enjoy![[Image:Grow Elephant Ear Plants Step 16.jpg}}"

Dry the seeds.",How to Harvest Parsley," Younger parsley plants have the strongest flavor. The leaves can be harvested even after the first year, but if you have the option of harvesting leaves from a plant in its first year of growth, doing so will give you the best yield and product.;
, Check the stems. If the stems have three or more clusters of leaves, they are mature enough to harvest from. Stems with one or two segments should be left alone.


Most parsley plants will be ready to harvest from within 70 to 90 days after you initially plant them., When harvesting entire stems or bunches of parsley, snip the herb off at the base of the plant instead of cutting from the top.


Cutting the parsley near the base of the plant will encourage the plant to produce even more stems, resulting in an overall bushier parsley plant with an improved yield.

, If you only plan on harvesting a few small sprigs of parsley for immediate use, you should snip them off from the outer portion of the plant and not from the inside.


Even if you plan on cutting a few full sprigs at the base of the plant, you should cut from the outside instead of the inside. The inner part of the plant will benefit from being able to mature longer.
Removing leaves from the outside will ensure that the oldest growth is being harvested, thereby preventing it from browning or otherwise remaining on the plant too long.
Harvesting old growth also allows the plant to focus its energy on producing and maturing the newer growth. This effort will produce an overall healthier parsley plant.

, Parsley will continue to grow throughout the entire season, even after you harvest the leaves. As such, you can have a steady supply of the herb and do not need to harvest it all at once.


Parsley grown outdoors will usually remain a vibrant green until late fall to early winter. Once the color starts to fade, its flavor will decline dramatically. Until that happens, though, you can keep harvesting the plant on an ongoing basis without a loss to the herb's flavor or health.

, If your parsley is kept outdoors and unprotected, it will die off during the winter. Before that happens, harvest the rest of it so that the plant has a chance to grow back the following year.


Parsley will continue to grow throughout the winter if you keep it protected in a warm place indoors. Make sure that the indoor plant receives plenty of sunlight on a daily basis by placing it near a sunny window.If you have an indoor parsley plant, you do not need to make a final harvest before winter. Instead, continue harvesting the parsley on an ""as needed"" basis.

, Parsley is best used fresh. It can, however, be stored for several months if necessary, but the flavor will not be as strong once you dry out the herb.


If you cut off the leaves a little at a time, it is recommended that you use the parsley immediately. If you cut more than you can use for a single meal, wrap the rest in a damp paper towel and store them in the refrigerator for up to two days.Similarly, you can place entire sprigs of parsley in water and store them in the refrigerator for up to seven days.
If you plan on storing the parsley for long-term use, your best bet is to freeze it.This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, but one of the easiest is to cut up the leaves into small portions and place them into ice cube trays. Fill the trays will a little water and freeze as normal. When ready to use, melt an individual cube of parsley, drain the water, and add to your dish. Note that frozen parsley will retain its flavor but lose its crispness.
You can dry parsley by hanging full sprigs upside-down in a well-ventilated, dark, and warm area indoors. It should dry in a week or two, at which point, you should crumble the leaves and store it in an airtight bag or container.

, Parsley plants do not go to seed during their first year. If you plan on harvesting the seeds, you will need to monitor a plant already in its second year.Parsley plants are biennial. Typically, the plants will only live for two years, and at the end of their lives, they will flower and seed.
To maximize your seed harvest, it is recommended that you remove imperfect or weak two-year-old plants at the end of the first season. In doing so, you ensure that the healthiest plants can fertilize each other and produce good seed.
When harvesting and storing seeds, try to separate those that were ready for harvest early from those that were ready later in the season. The seeds from early seed producers should be given priority over those that came from plants that produced seed late.

, To harvest entire seed heads, wait until the majority of the seeds have turned dark brown. If you harvest the seeds any earlier, they may not germinate well later on.


Parsley seed goes through three basic stages. Immediately after it finishes flowering, the seed will emerge as a light or bright green color. It will eventually take on a tan tint during the second stage, and during the final stage, it will be brown or otherwise dark in color.

, Snip off the seeds by cutting directly below the seed head. Pinch the stem just below the seed head with your thumb and index finger. Cut the stem just below your fingers.


Remove the seed heads carefully, shaking them as little as possible as you work. If you shake the seeds while clipping them off, you could end up scattering the seeds. Since the seeds are fairly small, seeds that are scattered will likely end up lost.

, Gently shake the seed heads into a paper bag to quickly and easily remove the majority of the mature seeds.


You could also lightly shake or tug on the seeds over a tightly woven patch of fabric or plastic sheeting.
Shake or remove the seeds using a gentle motion. If you apply too much force, the seeds can fly off and scatter in all directions.

, If a few young seeds still remain stuck to the seed heads, you can let them ripen by setting the cut seed head out in the sun for a few days.


To ripen more of the seeds, spread out the cut stalks on plastic or tightly-woven fabric sheets and place them in direct sunlight indoors. Keep the parsley stalks in a single, thin layer as they dry.
The remaining seeds should be ripe within two days.
Keep the seeds indoors as they dry. If you dry the seeds outdoors, birds or other small animals may end up getting to them before you do.

,


Parsley plants have a tendency to ripen at an irregular pace. Some seeds might be ready to harvest an entire three weeks earlier than others, even if the seeds are on the same head.
Be careful as you pluck off seeds. The force you use to pluck off individual seeds can cause the stem to recoil, and if there are too many mature seeds on the plant, they may break off with the force of that recoil and fly off as a result. As a result, it is recommended that you pluck individual seeds only if the majority of the seeds are not yet ready for harvest.

, The seeds will need to dry out for about 10 to 14 days before you can store them and use them later on.


To dry the seeds, spread them out in a single layer on a baking sheet with shallow sides and place them in a warm, dry location.
Turn and mix the seeds each day to prevent them from drying unevenly.
The seeds must be thoroughly dry before you can store them.
Store the dried seeds in airtight plastic bags or containers. Keep them in a cool, dry, and dark location until ready to plant.

If the stem does not snap when you bend it, the plant is too young. If you cannot bend the stem easily, then the plant is too old.The best time to take a cutting is during the morning, during spring or early summer.


The leaf nodes appear as little bumps along the stem. They are important, as that's where the roots will form.
If it is not possible to find a sprig without any flowers, choose a sprig with as few flowers as possible, and nip them off. Producing flowers take a lot of energy, and your cuttings will need all the energy they can get to put out roots.;
, Sterilize a sharp knife or garden shears with rubbing alcohol, and then cut a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) section from the top of the plant. Cut at an angle, just below the node. If there is no node 4 inches from the top of the plant, cut at the node closest to the top., The water should be deep enough to hold several of the leaf nodes. Avoid submerging any leaves in the water, however, or you will risk rotting the leaves.

, A bright window is ideal, as long as there is no direct sunlight. While sunlight is important for plants, too much sunlight can burn or wilt the leaves., Because there is so little water in the cup, it will grow murky and stale quickly. You will need to pour out the old water and fill the cup with fresh water every day until the roots develop. This will take one to two weeks.

, When the roots are about 1 to 2 inches long, take the cutting out of the water and plant it in a small pot filled with good-quality soil. Make sure that the soil is damp but not soggy. Keep the pot in a bright window, but out of direct sunlight. The pot must have a drainage hole at the bottom.


Consider dipping the roots in rooting hormone to encourage root development before planting it in the soil.

, Once the cutting is large and strong enough, you can choose to transfer the plant to a larger pot or your garden. Keep in mind, however, that catmint is an invasive plant. If you choose to plant it in your garden, make sure that you surround it with a brick, plastic, or wood border so that it does not spread over your entire garden.


While not as attractive to cats as catnip, catmint still attracts cats. If you dislike cats rolling over your plants, you may have to protect your catmint by rolling chicken wire over it.

If you are planning on using very fine soil, you can prevent it from escaping through the drainage hole by lining the bottom of the pot with a coffee filter. The paper will prevent any soil from escaping through the hole, but it will still let water pass through and drain.

, The soil should be good-quality gardening soil with nutrients. It should also be damp, but not soaking wet or soggy. Catmint will also do well in coco peat, perlite, rockwool, vermiculite, and other soil-less potting mixes., Take a chopstick, dowel, pen, or pencil and make a few holes in the soil. You will be inserting the cuttings into these holes, so make as many holes as you have cuttings.

, Look for a stem with little to no flowers and plenty of leaf bumps or nodes. The stem should be easy to bend and snap. If the stem does not snap when you flex it, then the plant is too young to take cuttings from. If the stem does not bend easily, then it is too old. The best time to take cuttings is in the morning, during spring and early summer.


The leaf nodes appear as little bumps along the stem. They are important, as that's where the roots will form.
If it is not possible to find a stem without flowers, choose a stem with as few flowers as possible, and pull them off. Producing flowers requires energy, and the cuttings will need that energy so that they can get to put out roots.

, Sterilize a sharp knife or garden shears with rubbing alcohol, then cut a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) section from the top of the plant. Cut just below a leaf bump, at a slight angle. If there is no leaf bump 4 inches from the top of the plant, then cut below the closest bump.

, Gently tuck each cutting into the holes you have made and pat the soil around the stems. Make sure that there are at least a few leaf bumps on the stem section going into the soil. The roots will grow from these bumps.


Consider dipping the cuttings in rooting hormone to encourage root development., You can do this by placing a glass cloche over the pot, or by draping a plastic bag over it.This will help keep the cutting damp while it grows.

, After your cuttings grow a few more sets of leaves, you can move them to a larger pot or even a sunny spot in your garden. Keep in mind, however, that catmint is very invasive. To prevent it from taking over your garden, consider reining it in with a brick, plastic, or wood border. Also, cats do find catmint attractive; if you do not wish to have cats rolling around in your catmint, consider protecting it by covering the plant with chicken wire.


If you are planting multiple cuttings in a garden, choose a location with well-drained soil that gets plenty of sunlight. Plant the cuttings 18 to 24 inches (45.72 to 60.96 centimeters) apart."

Harvest as early as 7 weeks after planting.,
Pick the bottom leaves first.,
Cut American cress regularly.,
Choose what parts you’d like to keep for food.,
Wash it off.,
Store the cress for up to one week.,
Eat both the leaves and seeds.",How to Harvest American Cress," It is ideal to plant American cress directly after the last frost so that it is ready for harvest during the summer. You can, however, plant this cress anytime between March and September. If planting late in September, you should plant the seeds no later than six weeks before the first frost.You can do a quick online search to see what the expected first and last frost dates are according to the area where you live.;
, American cress thrives in partial shade. If partial shade isn’t possible, it will also grow in full shade and full sun. The best choice for American cress is to plant it in a semi-shaded area on a north facing wall.You can also plant American cress in boxes, pots, and other containers. Make sure the container has good bottom drainage. The best place to put the container is on a windowsill.American cress is great as an edge crop in an herb or vegetable garden.

, Although there are ideal conditions for the soil, American cress can be grown in a variety of soil types. You can plant it in sandy, loamy, or clay soils. Look for an area where the soil has a pH of 5.6 – 7.5. The soil should be cool and moist to the touch.You can test your soil’s pH by buying a test as your local gardening store. Dig a small hole in the soil, pour some water into the hole, and insert the test.
It’s possible to adjust the pH of your soil if necessary. If the soil is too acidic, you can add pulverized or granular lime. To decrease the pH, you can add an organic material—like pine needles or compost.

, Once you have decided on the location, you can begin to sow the seeds ½” (1.3 cm) deep. Each plant will grow about 12 inches (30 cm) wide, so make sure that you plant the seeds far enough apart. Keep the plants 4 to 6 (10 to 15 cm) inches apart once they start to sprout.You can transplant some of the seedling once they start to grow to keep them far enough apart.

, American cress requires frequent watering, especially when planted during the spring. When watered, the soil should be moist, but never muddy. You can water American cress more or less than once a week, depending on how the soil feels.Check the soil once a day or every two days to see how dry or moist the soil is.

, American cress rarely experiences problem with mildew and fungus, but it can occur during very wet weather. You can often remove some of the disease by rubbing two affected leaves together. If that doesn’t work, look for a mild fungicide and spray it on the plants as directed by the specific product’s label., American cress typically does not have a problem with pests, so pesticides are rarely needed. You should pick off aphids or caterpillars if they appear on the plant. Slugs should also be picked off, and they may appear more often during wet fall weather.Do not use a chemical pesticide if you do experience a problem with pests since American cress is usually grown for consumption. Look for an organic pesticide instead.

, American cress grows quickly and can be harvested in as few as 7 weeks, though it may take slightly longer. The plant is ready to be harvested when it reaches 3 or 4 inches (7 to 10 cm) high., Once the plant reaches 3 or 4 inches (7 to 10 cm), begin to cut it back. Start with the bottom leaves and work all the way up through the plant. Hold the stems and cut off the leaves. Once you’ve cut off all of the leaves, cut the plant back to a half an inch (1 cm). This height is best to stimulate regrowth. You should keep the leaves and seeds, but you can remove and throw away the stems.You can cut or pinch off the tips of the plant whenever you want because it will grow back.

, Once harvested, American cress will grow back quickly. Cut or pick off the leaves as soon as the plant grows back. Regularly cutting the leaves will promote fresh growth., The young, tender leaves are the best to eat. You can, however, eat any part of the plant that is green. Throw out any part of the plant that is yellow., Make sure that you wash off the cress before eating. Ideally, you should wash it off after harvesting and before storing. Simply hold the plant under running water. Run your hands through the plant to make sure all dirt and other particles have been removed. Dry off the cress by putting it in between several layers of paper towels., American cress can be stored in the refrigerator for one week after it has been picked. Wrap the plant loosely in a paper towel. Put the covered plant into a zip-top bag. Store it in the refrigerator’s crisper drawer (if you have it)., You can eat all of the American cress plant. American cress goes well with soups, salads, and sauces. It is also good to use as a garnish for meats."

Divide the roots from a mature yarrow plant in early spring or autumn; or
Plant yarrow seeds in trays or plant punnets in early spring. Use seed-raising mix and keep the containers warm, moist, and shaded while the seeds germinate. Transplant the seedlings when they grow large enough to handle, after gradually exposing them to more light and outdoor temperatures.
Purchase seedlings from the local nursery and simply transplant them as needed.;
, Dig a hole large enough to take the roots of the plant. Gently firm the soil surface around the plant base and ensure all foliage is above the ground.


Yarrow prefers full sun for best growth.
Yarrow loves rocky spaces, so can be grown in awkward garden spots such as rock embankments.
The soil should be well drained and not overly rich.

, After planting, water deeply, occasionally. Yarrow's deep roots will burrow down into the soil and find its own sources of water.


Yarrow plants will rot if they're over-watered. Don't plant in soil that stays waterlogged.

, There is no need to fertilise yarrow. It's a fairly hardy plant that will thrive under many conditions.

, When pruning cut yarrow down to the ground in the period from mid-autumn to late autumn. It is best done after the frosts have begun.


New growth will appear every spring.

, The best time to harvest yarrow is when the plant is dry and it's in full bloom. Cut both stems and flowers in the morning.


Yarrow can be dried by tying the stems together and hanging them upside down in a dry, dark, and well-ventilated spot.
After drying, remove the flowers and store separately. Store foliage and flowers in airtight containers for later use.

, Yarrow can be used in a number of ways, both fresh and dried. Here are some suggestions:


Add very young leaves to salads, chopped. Only choose small leaves and be aware it is a bitter taste, so some people may not enjoy it.
Dried yarrow can be used in herbal tisanes (teas).
Garden beauty and herb garden necessity. The flowers are pretty and the herb is a must-have in any herb garden.
Use its fresh leaves to stop bleeding. Dry leaves make an instant scab.

Grow your garlic outdoors.,
Examine your soil to determine whether you should grow the garlic in flat beds or raised beds.,
Grow garlic in planters or containers if you prefer.,
Loosen the soil using a small rake or a shovel.",How to Grow Garlic In Florida1," The soil does not have to be perfect, because garlic will take whatever it needs from the soil you provide. However, outdoor rather than greenhouse planting produces a richer head of garlic.;
,

Use flat beds if you have sandy soil that does not hold water well. This is typical in coastal areas of Florida. Flat beds are planted on the natural ground.






Plant garlic in raised beds if you reside in regions of Florida that are inland, and your soil is rich and moist. The raised beds will help reduce fungal infections that might occur after heavy rain because the water drains more easily. Raised beds are built up and lifted off the natural ground.







, This is possible only in warmer climates such as Florida. In northern climates, garlic would freeze in the pots.


Fill a planter with potting soil to prepare the garlic bulbs. The best soil for garlic has a pH of 6.5 or 7. The pH level reflects the number of hydrogen ions in the soil. It classifies soil as acidic or alkaline.







, Add some compost if you have it available, to richen the soil.

"
"
Peel an entire head of garlic and break it apart into separate cloves.

,
Place each clove 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) deep in the soil, and about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) apart.

,
Keep the pointy end of the garlic sticking up, with the roots facing down into the soil.

,
Cover the garlic bulbs with soil.,
Cover the garlic with straw or leaves.,
Water only when the soil becomes very dry.,
Leave the garlic to take root and grow through the winter and the early spring.",How to Grow Garlic In Florida2,",,, You can plant as many as you want, just make sure they are healthy. Larger garlic cloves will usually produce a larger head of garlic at harvest time.

, This will act as natural mulch.

, Florida winters can be unpredictable. You might get enough rain, or you might have to water every couple of days.

, The bulbs should be ready to pick by April.

"
Be sure that the garlic was planted at the correct time of the year.,
Wait until it is fully matured to harvest but before it has gone to seed.,
Harvest it shortly before you are ready to braid it.","How to Grow, Harvest and Preserve Garlic in a Braid"," Garlic is best grown when planted in the autumn and harvested in the early summer. It is important to know that it is a biannual plant which means that it will take 2 years to reach full maturity. After the 1 summer the planted garlic will produce a small garlic clove but when left an additional year, the size and taste will be much better.


Purchase organic garlic heads at your local nursery. Separate the cloves and plant them individually 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart. Water the soil. Plant the garlic 1 month prior to first freeze, about mid-October for Zone 5. It can also be planted in the spring, late March. This allows the roots to grow before the ground is too hard. Place a good coverings of hay on top of the soil to ensure it is protected from the cold & snow. No need to remove the hay in the spring, the garlic should appear mid-May. To ensure the plants have enough nutrients you can drizzle fish fertilizer on the plants occasionally.;
, If it appears to be flowering, break the stems off to slow down this process. When it is ready to be harvested, the tops of the stalk will appear brown, usually early July for Zone 5. When digging the cloves from beneath the earth, gently wedge a shovel beneath the soil and slowly pull them towards the surface. Avoid pulling them out with your hands otherwise the cloves may break in the process. Keep the necks intact! Bring them inside so that the necks do not dry out in the sunlight.

, Garlic is easiest to braid when it has very recently been harvested and the necks have not yet dried out. When they are newly harvested, the necks will still have retained the soils moisture, making it easier to bend. Don't worry about the soil on the head, it will fall off once it has dried. Also, only use the garlic if the outer leave are in tack.


Choose the three largest heads, these will be the ends of the braid. Begin the braid 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) away from the garlic head, and braid the leaves together. Add in additional heads as if you were French braiding. For your first garlic braid don't worry if the heads are slightly further apart, with practice they will become much tighter! Add in as many garlic heads as you fancy. When you're done, braid the remaining garlic leaves either into a loop or in a straight line. Wrap twine around the loop and down the braid to reinforce the garlic heads in place. Hang the finished garlic braid in the kitchen where it is exposed to much air. Pull garlic off when needed.

Determine the type of tarragon you want.,
Find seeds or whole plants.,
Choose the right soil.,
Find the right location.,
Prepare the hole.,
Give the plant plenty of space.,
Cover and water the roots.",How to Grow Tarragon1," There are two types of tarragon, each with different characteristics. French tarragon is considered to be the best variety for cooking. However, it can be more difficult to plant and care for. On the other hand, Russian tarragon is a hardier plant but it has a less robust flavor. Depending on your growing situation, and what you intend to use the tarragon for, each plant has its own pros and cons.If you are concerned about having an authentic tarragon flavor, it is recommended that you go with the French variety. This is the type grown in most gardens and is used by chefs and foodies.
Russian tarragon might be a good choice if you want a nice widow herb and are less concerned about the flavor. It tends to not be good for cooking, but makes an attractive plant.;
, If you decide to plant French tarragon, you will need to find a whole plant at a store or take a plant from a friend’s garden. It is very difficult to grow French tarragon from seeds, and they are very rarely available for purchase. However, you can grow Russian tarragon from seeds. You should be able to find both seeds and whole plants are your local home and garden store.The roots of French tarragon are very sensitive, so try not to damage them when transplanting a plant.

, Tarragon grows best in a deep, loamy soil that holds moisture, but drains well. Tarragon prefers a soil pH of 6.5, but will grow in a range between 6.5 and 7.5.If you are growing the plant in a pot or window planter, cover a layer of gravel with ordinary potting soil mixed with some garden soil. In a garden, use a bagged garden soil that is not too high in nitrates to avoid burning out the plant’s delicate roots.Avoid using peat, which is too acidic. Tarragon likes slightly alkaline soils.
You can also use soilless potting mixes, perlite, vermiculite, rockwool, coco peat, and Oasis Rootcubes., Due to its temperamental nature, you will want to plant tarragon in a place where you can easily manipulate the soil and somewhat control the temperature and amount of water it receives. A raised garden or herb bed is ideal. Be sure to plant it somewhere where it can get at least 8 hours of sunlight a day.You may want to consider planting your tarragon near an eggplant. It is believed to be particularly beneficial to the vegetable’s growth.If you live in a temperate region, consider planting the tarragon in a raised garden where it can get plenty of sunshine year round.
If you live somewhere that experiences front and snow each year, consider planting the tarragon in a pot that you can bring indoors during the winter.

, If you are planting French tarragon or a Russian tarragon plant, you will need to dig a hole where you intend to plant it. Because its roots are delicate and do not like to be disturbed, you will need to dig a hole big enough to accommodate the size of the pot the tarragon plant is in. Ideally, when placed in the hole, the top of the soil in the pot should line up with the top of the hole.Russian tarragon seeds should be planted about one inch (2.5cm) in the soil.

, Tarragon will grow to cover about one foot (30cm) of soil in your garden or window box. Therefore, you will want to make sure that there is at least 2 to 3 feet (60-90cm) of space between it and other plants.These dimensions apply to both Russian and French tarragon.
Because it is so delicate, you may want to avoid planting tarragon with other herbs, such as oregano, which can spread quickly and choke it out.

, Once you have planted the French tarragon plant or Russian tarragon seeds, you will want to cover its roots with soil and gently pack it down with your hands. This will ensure that the roots make contact with the new soil. You will then want to water the plant and cover the roots with a bit of mulch to keep the sun from damaging them.This step does not apply to Russian tarragon. Simply plant the seeds approximately one inch (2.5cm) deep and let them grow.
Russian tarragon seeds will germinate about 10 to 14 days."

If you take a cutting, choose one with a lot of roots on it. This can be planted straight into the garden as they root extremely easily.;
, Vietnamese mint will grow best in well-draining, fertile soil that stays moist. Add some well-rotted manure or compost to enrich the soil if needed. Choose an area with bright dappled shade, and where it will definitely get shade during the hottest part of the day.

, The mint needs lots of water to establish well.


This plant grows fast so you might want to consider containing it within a container.

, Remember that it's tropical, so it needs a wet season, or a simulation of one.

, A soluble fertiliser with a high proportion of nitrogen or a complete plant food is ideal, given occasionally during the spring and summer months.

, Vietnamese mint grows rapidly and is ready for harvesting within a month, so it needs to be pruned regularly to keep its rampant growth in check.

, The leaves are best between spring and autumn but can be harvested all year. Harvesting can begin about 4-6 weeks after the initial planting.

, Vietnamese mint is excellent washed, chopped, and added to salads and Thai and Vietnamese dishes. It's a far more authentic addition to cold/fresh spring rolls than common mint. It is best used fresh.

Prune the plant often.,
Fertilize if needed.,
Water regularly.,
Maintain your tarragon in winter.,
Weed when needed.",How to Grow Tarragon2," After about seven weeks, you should have a fully developed tarragon plant. At this point, you will need to begin pruning it regularly to prevent flowering. This will help keep the plant from getting too large. It will also help more leaves grow. If you are growing your plant indoors or in a window planter, you will want to be particularly diligent about maintaining your plant. Make sure that it stays around two feet (60cm) tall; otherwise, it may get too heavy and fall over.You can use a pair of pruning clippers or scissors to maintain your plant.
You can also cook or dry whatever leaves you prune.

, Tarragon generally does not require much fertilizer. In fact, it can easily be killed by an over application. However, if you do need to fertilize your tarragon, do so in the early spring when the plant is coming back after winter. It may need the extra nutrients.You may also want to fertilize it again in late summer after you have harvested its leaves.

, The right amount of water is essential to maintaining your plant’s health. If it is outside in the summer months, you will want to water your tarragon plant daily. Ideally, you will want the soil to go almost dry between watering, followed by a thorough soaking. This is true of indoor tarragon plants as well.Avoid over-watering your plant and letting the soil get soggy. This will kill your tarragon.

, If you live in a more temperate climate, you may be able to winter your tarragon plant with a little mulch in the fall. Simply cover the roots with about one inch (2 ½ cm) of mulch. If you live in a colder climate, your plant will die back after the first frost. To protect the roots and ensure that the plant grows back in the spring, you will want to cover the roots with mulch and trim off brown stems in late fall., Regularly check for weeds growing underneath and around your tarragon plant and be sure to remove them early. The weeds need to be removed before they are able to grow large and get entangled with your tarragon plant’s roots. The less you have to bother your plant’s roots, the better.You can also put a ½-1 inch (2-3cm) layer of mulch over the roots to prevent weed growth.Weeding should not be an issue if you grow your plant indoors.

Gather your tarragon leaves.,
Dry the leaves.,
Freeze the harvested leaves.",How to Grow Tarragon3," Although you can harvest tarragon throughout its growing season, the best time to harvest is in the late summer.This is when the plant’s aroma and flavor are at their fullest. At this point, you should pick a large quantity and preserve some leaves for later use.Do not cut off the entire stock. Just remove the fresh lighter green leaves.
Be sure not to harvest more than one-third of the leaves from your plant. Harvesting too many leaves may weaken or kill it.

, After you have harvested the leaves, tie the tarragon into loose bundles and hang them out to dry in a warm, arid, airy place. There needs to be enough air circulation to ensure that the leaves properly dry. It is also important that the leaves dry quickly. Otherwise, they may mold and get discolored, which will ruin them.If stored in a cool, dark cupboard, your dried tarragon should last one to three years.
You can also dry tarragon in a vegetable dehydrator or in an oven on its lowest heat setting.

, Once you have harvested your tarragon, rinse the leaves and chop them up. Then, place the diced herbs on a tray in the freezer. Once they are completely frozen, place tarragon in freezer bags and seal. After they are thawed out, the herbs can be used as a seasoning.Once frozen, your tarragon should keep its flavor for several months.
Do not use thawed tarragon as a garnish. The frozen leaves will still hold their flavor, but the texture will be dry and crunchy.

Purchase valerian seedlings or starts from a garden shop.,
Consider harvesting “daughter” or volunteer sections of the root system from older plants.,
Germinate your seeds at home.,
Keep the seedlings inside until they start to sprout their second, larger set of leaves.

,
Amend the soil with compost or manure before you plant.,
Find a garden bed that gets at least six hours of direct sunlight per day.,
Space plants approximately three feet (90 cm) apart on all sides.,
Plant the valerian start in an area where it can grow tall.,
Place a wire mesh cage over the seedling to prevent birds from eating it.

,
Water generously.,
Cut the blooms of the valerian plant to use for bouquets.,
Wait a full year before starting to harvest roots and leaves for medicinal use.,
Separate a large valerian plant in half with a spade.,
Dig deeply so that you can get the entire root system.,
Cut the roots into half inch and one inch (1.6 to 2.5 cm) sections with shears.,
Spread them out on a drying rack.,
Separate the leaves for use in tea.",How to Grow Valerian," They will usually be in the herb section of the store. Valerian seeds can be finicky, so this is the best way to ensure you will have young plants for your garden.;
, If valerian grows naturally in your area, you can usually find a number of young plants sprouting in the spring. Dig up the root system and plant it in your garden after the last frost.

, Purchase fresh seeds that are less than one year old. Unlike other herb seeds, valerian seeds don’t take well to storage.


Plant them in a rich seed starting mix four to eight weeks before you want to plant them in your garden.
Sprinkle the soil with warm water and keep the plants in the sun. Fluorescent lights and grow lights can aid germination rates.
If your home is somewhat cold, you can try creating a mini-greenhouse over your seed trays with plastic wrap.

,, Valerian doesn’t generally require a lot of fertilization unless the soil is poor. The soil should be between 5.5 and 7.0 in pH., The plants do well with some afternoon shade.

, They are large plants, so they need plenty of room to grow roots.If your valerian plants don’t tend to grow to a full four feet (1.2 m) tall, you may be able to plant them closer together.

, It can send out runners, so it may be best when offset from a vegetable or flower garden. Harvesting the blooms can keep it from being too invasive.


Valerian leaves and roots are known for a strong, musty odor. The flowers can smell of vanilla, but are too strong for some gardeners. Keep this in mind before planting near a patio.

,, Valerian likes well-drained soil and plenty of water. Soak it every few days when you are not receiving regular rain., This keeps the plant from going to seed and spreading too far.It can also make the roots more potent if you are harvesting them for a sleep aid.


Use a sharp pair of shears and cut near the base of the stem.
Valerian starts blooming early in the spring. You may get two or three blooms, depending upon the placement of the plant and its age.

, Harvest mature root systems in the fall for drying. Allow the plant to go a few days without water before you harvest so that the natural compounds are more potent.

, You can also dig up older plants for medicinal use and let younger volunteers grow for next year.

, Rinse the roots off with your garden hose before you take them inside.

, Wash them thoroughly by soaking them in a bowl.

, Let them dry in a cool, dry place for two to three months. They are extremely pungent, so they shouldn’t be dried on a kitchen table.Simmer the roots for use as a sleep aid.
You can also give the dried roots to cats, who love it like catnip., Use clean, fresh leaves as a nighttime relaxation tea or dry them to make a loose-leaf tea blend.

However, if you already have an established sage plant, you can use cuttings or layering techniques to grow a new plant.;
, Sage grows well in rich clay loam that drains well and is rich in nitrogen. It prefers soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.5.


If you're using clay soil, try mixing in some sand and organic matter. This lightens the soil and helps with drainage.
Sage grows best when it is planted with other perennial herbs, such as thyme, oregano, marjoram and parsley.

, After prepping your soil, you can plant the sage either in pots or in the ground. You can either plant sage plants or plant seeds.

If you are transferring a sage plant into the ground, then make sure to plant it at the same level as it was in the pot.
If you decide to plant seeds, they should be planted in late spring (in a bed or in a container) about 1/8 inch deep and 24 to 30 inches apart. They will take 10 to 21 days to germinate.

, When the sage plants are small, you should mist them with water to keep the soil moist.


But when they reach maturity, you should only water sage when the soil surrounding the plant is dry to the touch.
In fact, in some climates you won't need to water your sage at all - they'll get all the moisture they need from rainfall.
Sage is a tough little plant and is very drought-tolerant.

, Ideally, sage plants should grow in full sun, but they will also survive in light shade in hotter areas.


If sage is exposed to too much shade, it will grow leggy and flop over. So if you keep your sage plant in an indoor area without much sunlight, you can use fluorescent lights instead. Standard fluorescent lamps should be 2 - 4 inches above the plants.
However, high output fluorescent, compact fluorescent, or high intensity discharge (metal halide or high pressure sodium) plant growing lights work better and, if used, should be placed 2–4 feet (0.6–1.2 m) about the plants.

, Prune the older, woodier stems in early spring, after the danger of freezing is past but before new growth has really begun. Prune each stem by about a third.

, Mildew is one of the only problems sage-growers have to deal with. You can avoid it by watching the plants carefully during hot, humid weather and by thinning the plants regularly to increase air circulation.


You can also try mulching the earth around the plant with pebbles, as this helps any moisture to evaporate more quickly.
If mildew does develop on you plant, try spritzing it with a horticultural oil or sulfur spray.

, Sage is usually not a target for pests, but sometimes it will be affected by spider mites, thrips, and Spittlebugs. If you notice any pests, try using an organic pesticide (like pyrethrum) or an insecticidal soap to keep them under control.

, After about three to five years, the sage plant will become woody and straggly and will need to be replaced. You can either start again with a new plant or seed, or use the old plant for cuttings or layering.



To layer the plant, bend a branch of the existing sage towards the soil. Use some wire to pin the branch to the ground, about 4 inches from the tip. After about four weeks, roots will begin to form. Then you can cut the branch and transplant the newly formed sage plant to another location.

To use cuttings, cut the top 3 inches from the branch of an existing sage plant. Strip the lower leaves from the stem, or use a scissors to cut them off. Dip the ends in rooting hormone, then place in sterile sand. Wait 4 to 6 weeks for roots to form, then move to a pot and later the garden. It is best to take cuttings of plants in early spring, just after you notice some new growth.

, Harvest the sage lightly during the first year, picking off leaves as you need them.


In subsequent years, you can harvest the sage year round by cutting entire stems from the plant. Sage is considered to be at its best just before the flowers bloom, usually in mid-summer.
Do your last full harvest approximately two months before the first major frost of the year. This gives any newly formed foliage enough time to mature before winter sets in.

, Sage is one of the few herbs that develops a stronger flavor when dried. However, it needs to be dried quickly to avoid developing a musty taste.


To dry sage, tie a bunch of sprigs together and hang them upside down in a warm, well-ventilated location away from direct sunlight.
Once they are dry, store the leaves (crumbled or whole) in an airtight container.

, In addition to being used as an aromatic herb in cooking, sage can also be used in potpourri and soap. Here are some things you can do with sage:


Make Parmesan and Sage Biscuits
Make a Violet and Sage Cold Sore Cream
Make Oatmeal and Sage Soap
Make Sage and Ginger Tea

Buy thyme plant seedlings from a nursery.,
Plant seedlings in full sun when the ground is warm.,
Provide an environment with excellent drainage.,
Maintain a soil pH between 6.0 and 8.0.,
Control the weeds around your plants.,
Let the soil get completely dry between waterings.,
Avoid over-fertilizing thyme.,
Cut thyme back every spring.,
Harvest thyme just before the plant flowers for the best flavor.Thyme will bloom with tiny white, lavender or pink flowers.,
Clip off sprigs off as needed using scissors or pruning shears.,
Dry the harvested thyme sprigs somewhere warm and shady.",How to Grow Thyme," Thyme can be grown from seeds, plant divisions, or seedlings. However, growing thyme from seeds can be difficult because their germination is often sluggish and uneven. Most gardeners suggest buying young thyme seedlings, which you can obtain at any nursery, or take cuttings from someone else’s thyme.The most popular varieties of thyme are: Common Thyme, Golden King Thyme, Mother of Thyme, Lemon Thyme, and Garden Thyme.;
, Plant your thyme seedlings in spring about two to three weeks before the last frost.For best results, plant them in soil that is about 70°F (21°C). Space the seedlings 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters) apart. Thyme thrives in full sun, so plant them in a very sunny area.


Most thyme plants will eventually grow to be 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) in height.

, Thyme likes dry, sandy soil with good drainage. Plant thyme in well-drained soil. Never plant this herb in soggy or heavy soil.This can result in root rot. If your soil does not appear to drain well, add some compost, sand, or organic material to help improve drainage.


Thyme can be planted as a ground cover, around paving stones, or near a wall, as long as the drainage is good. You can also plant it in containers.

, Thyme likes somewhat alkaline conditions and its nutrient requirements are minimal. If you need to raise the pH of your soil, add lime to it. You can fertilize the young plants in spring with compost, diluted fish emulsion or some other organic matter, but otherwise you won’t need to do much else to the soil., Weeds will compete for the soil’s nutrients and slow the development of young thyme plants. Control the weeds around seedlings either through weeding or mulching.Mulching with limestone gravel or builder’s sand can improve drainage around the plants and prevent root rot. You can try other mulches made of organic matter like leaf mold or straw, as well.

, Thyme is a hardy, drought-resistant herb. You need to water the plants on a regular schedule, but not often. Too much water will cause root rot. Give the plants a good watering when you see the soil around them has gone completely dry. Soak the ground thoroughly and wait until the soil dries completely before watering your plants again., Once your seedlings take off, the plants will need very little attention to thrive. Thyme doesn’t need a lot of nutrients to survive and too much fertilizer will cause it to lose its flavor and become gangly. Mulch your plants in autumn with organic matter like leaf mold, well-rotted animal manure or compost.


This will deliver the minimal nutrients thyme requires all year long, as well as protect the plants from frost once winter arrives., If you want your plants to continue being bushy and producing tender stems, you will need to prune your thyme back to half its previous height every spring. Do this after the last frost. If you do this, the next spring it will flourish again. After three to four years of growth with the same plants, their stalks will become woody and the plant will produce fewer leaves.


At this point you may want to start a new batch of seedlings, especially if you cultivate thyme for culinary purposes.Use an almanac to check when the last frost usually occurs. After this date, it may be safe to cut back the thyme.

, If you grow your thyme for culinary purposes, you’ll get the most potent flavor from the herbs if you harvest right before the flowers begin to open. As for the flowers themselves, feel free to pinch them off if you like. This will stimulate the production of more leaves.


However, the flavor of thyme won’t be negatively affected if you allow your plants to bloom. If you enjoy the way the flowers look, allow them to grow freely., You can harvest thyme at any point in the year, although the flavor is usually the best in June or July. This is when the flavor is most concentrated. Cut off fresh green sprigs in the morning. Leave behind the woody parts of the stalk. Strip the tiny leaves off the stems before using them.


When trimming off sprigs, always try to leave behind at least five inches of growth on the plant. This will help it continue to flourish.
The more you trim and prune your thyme, the more it will grow. Regular trimming will also make your plants grow in a more rounded shape.Check an almanac or online to see when the first frost usually occurs in your area. Stop cutting thyme about two weeks before this date.

, Hang the sprigs in a dark, well-ventilated area to dry them. You can also dry them by laying them out on a tray and putting them in a food dehydrator. Once the pieces dry out completely, the leaves will easily fall off the stems.After you’ve removed the dried leaves, store them in an airtight container until you’re ready to use them.


You can also store your dried thyme in the freezer or preserved in oil or vinegar."

Thin the seedlings.,
Keep the sorrel very moist.,
Weed the sorrel bed.,
Control aphid infestations.,
Remove flower spikes before they mature.,
Divide established sorrel in spring.,
Pick leaves when they are 4 or 5 inches (10.2 or 12.7 cm) tall.,
Harvest throughout the season as the leaves keep growing.,
Eat sorrel while it's fresh.",How to Grow Sorrel," Different varieties of sorrel grow to different heights, and each has a unique flavor. Many nurseries offering sorrel will just label it ""sorrel,"" without naming the variety, but if you're offered a choice or if you're buying seeds instead of established plants, look for the following distinctions:French sorrel: Grows 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) tall; lemony leaves are used in salads.

Garden sorrel: Gets very tall, up to 3 feet (0.9 m), and is good for salads or sautéing.

Blood sorrel: Has beautiful reddish leaves that are only edible when very young.

Common sorrel: A wild variety that is edible when the leaves are very young.;
, Sorrel grows best in full sun, so choose a planting spot that gets at least six hours a day. A spot with a little partial shade is fine, but be sure not to plant sorrel in a very shady place.


If you're in growing zone 5 or warmer, your sorrel will grow as a perennial once established. Bear this in mind when you choose a planting spot.
Do not plant sorrel near other vegetables that will grow tall, such as beans or tomatoes. Strawberries make a good companion plant.

, Test the soil in your preferred planting bed to make sure it's suitable for sorrel. Sorrel needs a soil pH of 5.5 to 6.8. When you've chosen a good patch, till the soil to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm). Mix in organic compost to enrich the soil so that it's very fertile.


Sorrel needs well-draining soil. Dig a hole and fill it with water to see how well the soil drains. If the water stands for awhile before draining, mix in more organic compost and a little sand to help it drain better.
You can get a soil pH testing kit at any local nursery. It's a good tool to have on hand for any vegetable gardener.
If you wish, grow sorrel in a pot filled with fertile potting soil. Make sure it's at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep.

, Sorrel is frost hardy and can be planted several weeks before the last frost of the season. Work the garden bed and plant the sorrel seeds in 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep holes spaced 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) apart. If you're planting sorrel in rows, allow 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) between each row. Water the planting bed well.


You may start sorrel seeds indoors if you prefer. Plant the seeds in seed substrate. Start them in very early spring so you can transplant the seedlings right around the last frost of the season., Once they sprout, thin them out so that the strongest seedlings are spaced about 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) apart. This will give them the best chance of surviving and prevent overcrowding.

, Sorrel needs plenty of water throughout the growing season. Test the soil to see if it needs water by inserting your finger in the soil near the sorrel's roots. If it feels dry, go ahead and water the sorrel.Water near the roots, rather than sprinkling water over the leaves. This will prevent the leaves from catching mold and rotting.
Water in the morning, when the sun has time to dry the plants before nightfall. If you water too late in the day the plants will be prone to growing mold at night.

, Sorrel beds tend to get very weedy, so be diligent throughout the growing season. Pull out weeds by the base to make sure you extract the roots, so they don't end up growing right back. Avoid using an herbicide, since it will harm the sorrel as much as the weeds.

, Aphids are the one pest that pose a threat to sorrel. The best way to get rid of them is by simply picking them off the leaves when you see them. For mature soil, you can spray the aphids off using a steady stream of water from your hose.

, Male sorrel plants produce flower spikes that produce a lot of seeds. Examine the spikes and cut them away before they mature, while seedheads are still green. If you leave the seedheads on the plants, the seeds will mature and fall off, and the plant will reseed.


Remove flower spikes by simply pinching them off at the base with your fingers.
Sorrel will also bolt (go to seed) in hot weather unless shaded.

, After a year or two, when your sorrel plants are established, you can divide them to create more sorrel plants. Divide the plants near the base, making a clean cut through the root system without damaging it too much. Plant the new sorrel plant in a sunny, fertile spot and water it well.

, Sorrel leaves taste best while they are still young. The flavor becomes bitter as they age. Pick off the young leaves before they grow too large.Not only will the young leaves taste delicious, but removing them helps the plant grow more vigorously.

, After you pick off a leaf, a new one will grow in its place. You can harvest sorrel all season long in this way. Don't forget to remove the flower spikes before they mature, since the plant will stop growing new leaves if the flower spikes are allowed to remain.

, Like other leafy vegetables, sorrel is best eaten soon after picking. It will keep in the refrigerator for about a week if you can't eat it right away. Sorrel may also be dried or frozen, but processing it causes it to lose much of its flavor. Prepare sorrel in the following ways:


Toss it in a salad
Sauté it in a little butter
Add it to leek and potato soup
Add it to a quiche
Put it on sandwiches

Water deeply.,
Prune.",How to Grow Rue," If using seeds, plant them in small seed-raising trays or punnets using seed-raising mix. During germination, keep the soil moist and in a warm, bright but shady position. Increase the sun exposure gradually prior to planting in the garden.


If you prefer to use cuttings, take these towards the end of summer. Avoid woody growth; look for mature green growth and take cuttings of about 10 centimeter (4 in) in length. Place in sandy soil to strike, keeping the soil moist. As with the seeds, bright shade is the best positioning while the roots develop.
Rooted layers can be dug up and replanted. You'll see roots developing where stems touch the ground.;
, Rue grows best in cool and warm climates, but it doesn't like humidity during summer. If you're in a cool climate, ensure that it has a position with full sun. In a warmer climate, a little shade is fine but not too much.

, Rue likes poor soil but it must be well drained and deep. Sandy or gravelled soils are the best choices.


If the soil is too rich for the rue, its growth will be excessive.

, A deep watering every two weeks is best from mid-autumn to mid-spring. During summer, water only if it gets very dry; let rain do most of the watering.


Don't fertilise. Rue doesn't need it.

, Prune if it looks untidy. Cut back to the main plant shape in early spring.

Fix each cutting into its own container.,
Moisten the rosemary by misting it with a spray bottle.,
Prepare the cuttings for transplanting once they take root.,
Fill a terra cotta pot with sterilized potting soil.,
Pinch the top bud.",How to Grow Rosemary Indoors1," The quality of the mother plant will determine the quality of the propagated plant. Recent growth indicates that the plant has not grown dormant, so you should be able to spur new growth from a cutting.;
, Choose the most recently grown stems, since these have the greatest growing potential.

, Use scissors or shears to cut them off. Yanking the leaves off by hand could cause damage.

, The cuttings do not need to soak. They just need to be a little moist.

, Dip the bottom of each cutting into the powder, immersing it by about 1/4 inch (2/3 centimeter). Doing so will increase the cutting's odds of taking root.

, Other small containers, ranging from pots to plastic cups, can also be used.

, If using a seedling tray, place one cutting in each separate compartment. Press the cutting down into the growing medium until the exposed stem is completely buried. Do not cover the leaves, however.

, Do not allow the growing medium to become completely soaked. Continue misting as often as necessary to keep the medium moist to the touch, paying special attention to your plant on dry, sunny days.

, This usually occurs within two to four weeks. If your plant continues to grow after a few weeks have passed, it has likely taken root.

, Select a pot that is at least 3 1/2 inches (9 centimeters) in diameter and depth.


Terra cotta draws moisture out of the soil faster than plastic. As a result, using a terra cotta pot will reduce the risk of over-watering and cut down on occurrences of root rot.
An all-purpose soil should work fine most of the time, but do not use standard garden soil. Dirt from your garden could contain pests and diseases that might damage your rosemary.
For a more precise soil mix, blend two parts potting soil with one part sand or perlite to promote better drainage. You can also add 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of lime juice to a 5-inch (12.7 centimeters) pot to increase the soil's alkaline properties.

, Pinching the top terminal bud increases the likelihood of your rosemary branching. Once the bud develops, literally pinch it out with your fingers or snip it off with a pair of scissors or snips. Removing the bud at the tip of a branch redirects the rosemary's energy to other buds along the sides, leading to more branches and a bushier plant.

Continue growing until the plants are ready for transplanting.",How to Grow Rosemary from Seed1," Rosemary seeds take a long time to germinate, and many seeds do not germinate at all. By starting your seeds well before the last frost, you can improve your chances of having a decent rosemary seedling to transplant by spring.;
, Allow them to soak for several hours. Doing so lets the seeds absorb water, making them more likely to germinate.

, A commercial base designed for seeds will often work, or you can use garden sand or vermiculite., Since rosemary has a low germination rate, you should plant several seeds into one slot to improve your chances of a seedling growing in each slot. Sprinkle the seeds onto the top of the potting mix before sprinkling a little more potting mix over the seeds.

, Spray the seeds with a gentle mist from a spray bottle. The soil should be moist, but not damp.

, Put plastic wrap over the tray, tightly wrapping it across the top.

, The seeds require warmth to germinate. You can also sit the tray in a warm spot if you do not have a heat mat, but the ideal temperature should be between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 30 degrees Celsius)., Within six to eight weeks, you will likely see small seedlings begin to peak through the soil. At this point, you can remove the plastic wrap.

, After germination, rosemary needs plenty of warmth and light to continue growing. You should also keep the plants lightly watered during this time.

, The rosemary will be ready for transplanting once the sprouts are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall.

When using seeds, you can generally expect that roughly ¼ of the seeds won't grow, so you may want to plant several.Clippings should only be taken from established plants. You should wait until the roots of your plants are well developed and new growth begins appearing before taking clippings.;
, Oregano is a plant that loves sunshine and soil that drains well, so you should choose a planting location that has these two features. If you live in a colder part of the world, you may want to start your plant indoors and transfer it outside when the weather warms up.


Oregano grows best in moderately fertilized soil. It's unlikely that you'll need to add compost or fertilizer for it to grow well. , A fully grown oregano plant will be about 2 to 2½ ft tall (61 to 76 cm) and about 2 ft wide (61 cm). For best results in your garden, you should give your oregano about 10 in (25 cm) of space between plants.If you plan on growing your oregano indoors, choose a pot that is about 1 ft (30.5 cm) in diameter. This way your plant has adequate room to grow., You can plant your oregano as early as 6 to 10 weeks before the last predicted frost of spring.However, in colder regions or during a cold snap, you may want to protect your plants with a layer of hay.In place of hay, you can also use bed sheets, blankets, or plastic sheeting. To prevent damage to budding plants, you can use stakes to prop up your covering.
Once the sun has risen and the air warmed, you should remove your covering from the plants. When using hay, you should remove it from covering the plants after the last frost., You'll want to plant seeds about ¼ inch (.64 cm) deep and bury clippings ½ inch (1.3 cm) deep. You should be patient while awaiting your plants to emerge from the ground since seeds often sprout slowly, though indoor planting may see seeds sprout in less time.


You should avoid attempting to use seeds that have been stored long periods of time. As time passes, the chance the seeds will grow decreases.Strip cuttings of their leaves on the end being planted.
Plants usually take 5 to 10 days to sprout from the ground. However, your oregano may take more or less time depending on factors like soil quality, sunlight, and frequency of watering., During the first few months of growth, water your plants regularly to get them started. Once they are established, you can reduce the amount of water. Check whether your plant needs water or not by touching the soil around it. If it feels dry, you should thoroughly water the area.Plants in containers should be treated similarly to outdoor grown oregano. However, when watering, you should douse the plant until you notice water dripping from the drainage holes in the bottom of the container., By trimming or pinching the leaves and ends of your plant, you can encourage the growth of denser leaves. Wait until the plant is about 4 in (10.2 cm) tall, and use a pair of shears or scissors to lightly thin the outer growth.


Trimming also helps prevent excessive stem growth in your plant. This condition, called legginess, will reduce the yield of your crop.
Where you trim your plant, you should notice it branch at that point when it continues growing. In turn, these branches will bear more leaves, meaning more oregano for you.As you trim, you can use the fresh oregano in a recipe, or dry it to use later on.

, Sick or thin plants can crowd better ones and steal resources, negatively impacting the potential of the healthier plants. Plants that are three or four years old are at the end of the oregano life cycle and will be less productive, making these prime candidates for removal.You may not remember which plants are old and which are young. In this case, you should wait until early spring when you should be able to judge the plant's age by its initial growth., Weeds can steal valuable nutrients from your oregano, block out the much needed sun, or soak up the water intended for your plants. Try to target weeds when young, as these will be easier to remove at that time. Grasp the weed firmly at its base with firm, steady pressure, and try to pull up as much of the roots as possible.There are many garden tools you might use to assist in your weeding endeavors. A spade or rooting tool could make your weeding less of a chore.

, Oregano can be used fresh from the garden, though you should wash it first to rinse off dirt, bugs, and bacteria. Allow the washed herb to air dry or pat it dry with a towel. Now it's ready to be used in any recipes that call for fresh oregano.


Oregano reaches peak potency right before it blooms. Blooming season is usually in early July, though this may vary depending on the region you live in., The easiest time for you to do this is in the morning after the sun has risen and evaporated any dew. Use a pair of shears or scissors to cut leafy bunches free of the plant, leaving a portion of the stem remaining. Then, gather the bunches into small bundles and use a rubber band around the stems to fasten the bundles together.Try not to bundle the oregano together too densely. This can cause uneven drying and could result in a less than desirable finished product.

, This will prevent dust from accumulating on your oregano as it dries and will keep the sun from bleaching the color from the plant. Paper bags work well for covering your bundles, but you should cut slits in these bags to promote airflow so the herb dries better.


You should keep an eye on your oregano while it is drying. Direct sunlight can sometimes cause moisture to build up in the bag, which could cause mold to grow and ruin your dried oregano., The time it takes to dry will depend on your climate. In some regions, it may take a few days, others may take as long as two weeks. You'll want to hang your plants in an area that is warm and dry, but out of direct sunlight. Some places you might consider for drying your oregano include your attic, porch, a clothesline, or even in your kitchen.


If you plan on drying outside, you should keep an eye on the weather. Rain could spoil your hard work., When the leaves have become brittle, it's ready to be stored. Lay out a sheet of wax paper and place your bundles onto it. Then you should crumble the plants and pick out the stems, which can be thrown away. Store your dried oregano in an airtight jar, and enjoy it throughout the year.


To easily transfer your dried oregano into a container, you might want to take the wax paper by two corners and form a funnel with it. Place one end of the funnel above the mouth of your container and tap the paper to shake the dried leaves into it."

Allow the top 2 inches (5 centimeters) of soil to dry out before watering.,
Keep the air in the room mildly humid.,
Use fertilizer sparingly.,
Allow an electric fan to stir the air around your rosemary.,
Treat your plant with a fungicide if mildew or another fungus forms.,
Apply neem oil to your rosemary if it gets infested by pests.,
Harvest rosemary by snipping directly above a stem joint.",How to Grow Rosemary Indoors2," A window that faces south or west may be the best choice. Your rosemary needs, at minimum, six hours of direct sun.

, If you do not have a window that can provide your plant with adequate sun, fluorescent grow lights can work just as well. Place the lights 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) above the top of your plant and leave it on for 14 hours per day.

, Rosemary thrives in a little dryness, but do not allow the soil to dry out completely. When you water, do so thoroughly, but do not allow the soil to become soggy.

, During the spring, summer, and autumn, the room's natural humidity should suffice. During dry winters when the furnace comes on, however, you may need to provide your rosemary with extra humidity by sitting the pot on a humidity tray, or by running a humidifier in the room a few hours each day.

, Feeding your rosemary once or twice a month with a balanced liquid fertilizer should do fine. Dilute the fertilizer with equal parts water before applying it to your plant.

, Rosemary can get powdery mildew if the air around it grows too stagnant and stale. Letting a fan blow on it for a few hours each day dramatically improves air circulation and decreases this risk.

, You can also treat your rosemary before it gets a fungal disease, but many gardeners prefer to use as few chemicals as possible, making post-disease treatment more favorable than preventative treatment.

, Indoor plants do not get infested as often, but it can still happen. Neem oil is harmless to humans and most pets, making it safe to use on plants intended for consumption.

, Snipping above a joint allows new growth to continue forming on that stem. Never remove more than 1/3 of the plant at one time.

Prepare a medium pot for each rosemary plant.,
Fill the pot with well-draining soil.,
Dig a small hole in the soil.,
Remove the rosemary from the tray.,
Place the rosemary in its new container.",How to Grow Rosemary from Seed2," The pot should have at least one drainage hole to prevent the roots of the plant from becoming waterlogged. Clay pots work especially well.

, A light potting mix, preferably one that mixes potting soil with sand or vermiculite, will do best to maintain proper moisture conditions.

, The hole should be approximately the same size as the seedling tray slot that the rosemary currently sits in.

, Gently squeeze the sides of the tray until the plant and soil can be wiggled free.

, Pack the soil around the stem to hold it in place.

Keep the plant lightly watered.,
Give the plant plenty of sunlight.,
Keep the plant indoors during cool weather.,
Run an electric fan nearby.,
Watch out for pests.,
Keep the plants a little cool indoors.",How to Grow Rosemary from Seed3," The soil should be moist, but not damp. Avoid letting the soil dry out too much in between watering, but do not allow it to become soaked. Water the soil directly instead of pouring the water over the leaves. If the leaves get too wet, mildew can form.

, Rosemary often does best when given full sun. A sunny window that faces south usually works best.


Rotate the pot on a weekly basis to make sure that every side of the plant gets exposed to the sun.This is especially important after the first year, once rosemary plants start to grow a little taller.

, You can keep your rosemary outside during the spring and summer, but once temperatures fall below 30 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 degree Celsius) they need to come indoors in order to continue thriving.

, Air circulation can help prevent mildew from developing on the plant. You should run the fan three to four hours each day, unless you are able to keep a nearby window open part of the time.

, Outdoor insects do not often attack rosemary, but aphids and spider mites are known to cause problems indoors. If an infestation occurs, spray the rosemary with insecticidal soap until the pests are gone and the plant is healthy again.

, Even though they thrive well in heat outdoors, indoors, rosemary often does best at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 degrees Celsius). Warm or cold, you should also keep the room it is in fairly dry to prevent the development of mildew.

Purchase patchouli seeds.,
Prepare the soil and lighting conditions for your planting flat.,
Sprinkle the patchouli seeds over the surface of the flat.,
Spray the flat with a fine mist of water.,
Blow air over the surface of the trays with a fan.,
Separate the seedlings into four-inch pots.",How to Grow Patchouli1," Visit your local nursery to discuss the options for ordering it in, or purchase seeds online from a reputable garden retailer.If you don’t own planting flats, you should purchase them at the same time as the seeds.;
, Fill a planting flat or tray with warm, humousy soil. You can use regular potting soil. Leave the soil rough on the top. You should have it in a sunny part of your house, such as in front of a window, or under grow lights.You could also prepare your own potting soil with a mix of equal parts vermiculite, peat moss and perlite.It is best to start seeds in wide, shallow containers. Wide containers such as seeding flats or trays prevent overcrowding.You can also use recycled plastic containers, such as yogurt containers.

, The seeds should fall down between the cracks of the rough surface of the soil. Then, pat down the humous-rich soil with the palm of your hand. After tamping, the seeds should be barely covered by the warm, humousy soil.Each seed needs to be in direct contact with the moist soil in order to germinate.You can also use the bottom of a glass or a pestle to tamp the seeds into the soil.

, Use a fine mist setting on your garden sprayer, so that you don’t dislodge the seeds with the force of the sprayer. Keep the planting flat in a nice warm location until germination, which should take between one and three weeks. During this time, keep the soil nice and moist.If you are concerned about fungal infection or “damping-off,” you can sprinkle a mixture of fifty percent milled sphagnum and fifty percent starter chicken grit. Spread it thinly over the surface of the flats, which will help prevent pathogens.
To retain moisture, you can put a plastic wrap over the seed tray. This will help to create a humid environment.Avoid overwatering the seeds, which will disturb the seeds and prevent proper germination.
If you put your finger an inch into the soil and it feels dry, you should water. If it is still damp, you don’t need to water.

, Place a fan in front of the tray. Put the fan on a low setting. Blow air over the top of the trays to promote good air circulation, which will help to prevent disease., Once the seedlings grow a second set of leaves, you can separate them out of the planting tray. Gently pull up the plant from the soil, lifting the plant up from below the roots. Transplant the seedling into a four-inch pot. Let them grow until they fill the pot with roots. At this point, they are ready to put in the ground outside or in a larger pot.To see whether the pot is full of roots, look underneath the four-inch pot. You should be able to see the roots through the water holes at the bottom of the pot.
If you don’t have time to germinate the patchouli yourself, you can buy a seedling from the garden center or online.

Water sparingly after roots set in.,
Care for as an adult plant.",How to Plant Aloe Vera," Aloe plants have relatively short roots and heavy leaves, so they are commonly moved to a heavier pot when they become top-heavy and tip over. If Aloe vera runs out of space for its roots to grow, it may start to produce ""pups"" that can be moved to their own pot (see the Propagating section). If you are more interested in the adult plant growing than producing new plants, transplant it to a larger pot before the roots begin to circle the walls of its container.If you wish to transplant a young plant growing at the base of an older one, see the Propagating section instead.;
, Aloe vera plants prefer 8–10 hours of sunlight a day.While they grow best in warm or hot temperatures, they are capable of surviving cooler seasons in a more dormant state. However, they may suffer harm if exposed to temperatures below 25ºF (-4ºC).


Hardiness zones 9, 10, and 11 are most suitable for keeping Aloe vera outdoors year round.If you live in another zone, you may wish to keep your Aloe vera outdoors most of the year, and bring it indoors before the frost.
The sunniest windows are those facing west or south if you live in the northern hemisphere, or those facing west or north if you live in the southern hemisphere.
Despite the plant's adaptations that allow it to thrive in hot conditions, it is still possible to burn the plant. Move it to an area of light shade if the leaves begin to turn brown., Aloe vera plants are adapted for survival in dry conditions, and may rot if planted in soil that collects standing water. Use a cactus potting mix, or create your own mix using equal parts soil, sand, and gravel.








If planting Aloe vera in a container, make sure the container has a hole in the base for water to drain through.

, Place the Aloe vera root ball just below the soil surface. If any of the thick, green leaves are partially buried or touch the soil, they may rot.







, Place a layer of small rocks around the base of the aloe plant to keep the soil in place and reduce evaporation.This is not required for your aloe plant to thrive, so you may leave the soil exposed if you prefer the appearance.









White stones will reflect warmth from the sun to the base of the plant, which can be a good idea if you do not live in a hot climate., Before you start watering, give the aloe plant a few days to repair any roots that may have been damaged during planting.. Watering damaged roots increases the chance of root rot. Aloe plants store plenty of water in their leaves, and should not be harmed by the lack of water during this time. Give it a light watering the first one or two times you water if you would like to be extra safe.


For watering instructions in day to day care, see Providing Daily Care.

, During summer, or any time the weather is warm and sunny, aloe plants will grow fastest with regular watering. However, it is much easier to overwater aloe plants than to dry them out, so do not water until the soil has dried out to a depth of 3 inches (7.5 cm).







, Aloe plants often go dormant during winter, or when the weather is cold for a prolonged period of time. Unless you are keeping them in a heated room year round, you should only water them once or twice a month during this period., Aloe plants do not require fertilizer, and overuse can harm the plant or cause it to grow in an unhealthy manner. If you wish to encourage growth, use a low nitrogen, high phosphorous, low potassium fertilizer, such as a 10:40:10 or 15:30:15. Apply once a year in late spring, at the start of the growing season.







, The soil around the aloe plant should be free of grass and weeds. Remove these regularly if the plant is outdoors, but do so carefully. Because good aloe soil is loose and sandy, it is easy to damage the roots with vigorous weed-pulling.







, If the leaves are growing flat and low, increase sunlight. Aloe vera leaves should grow upward or outward at an angle, toward the sunlight. If they are low to the ground or growing flat outward, the plant is probably not receiving enough sun.Move it to a sunnier area. If it is indoors, consider keeping it outdoors during daylight hours.

, If the leaves turn brown, decrease sunlight. While aloe is hardier than most plants when it comes to sun exposure, it is still possible to burn the leaves. If the aloe plant turns brown, move it to an area that receives shade during the early afternoon.

, If the leaves are thin and curled, increase water. The thick, fleshy leaves store water that the plant uses in times of drought. If the leaves are looking thin or curling, water the aloe plant more frequently.Be careful not to overcompensate: water should drain quickly through the soil to prevent root rot, which is difficult to stop.

, Yellowed or ""melting"" leaves are suffering due to excess water. Stop watering altogether for the next week (or two weeks during the dormant season), and water less frequently once you resume. You may remove any discolored leaves from the plant without much chance of harm, although it is best to use a disinfected knife.

, While any healthy aloe plant has a chance to produce younger plants, or ""pups"", this is most likely to happen when the adult plant has reached the boundaries of its container., Your Aloe vera plant should start to produce ""pups"", which are clones of itself that share some of the mother plant's root system and may be attached to the base as well. These will sometimes grow out of the drainage hole of the container, or even from roots snaking over to neighboring containers!Pups tend to be a lighter green than the adult plant's leaves, and when first emerging do not have the same spiny leaf edges as the adult., The young plants will do best if you wait until they are a little larger and mature enough to have a few roots of their own. While this size varies with subspecies and individual plants, a good rule of thumb is that the young plant should be at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) tall, and preferably 5 inches (12.5 cm).If the container has sufficient space, wait until the young plant is 1







, Sanitize your knife first to reduce the chance of infection. Clear away the dirt at the base of the pup to see whether it is attached to the mother plant. If it is, cut it away, making sure to keep the young plant attached to its roots if any are present. The presence of its own roots will increase the odds of success, but they may not be easy to find before you remove the pup.








, Instead of planting the new aloe immediately, you may wish to allow the plant to form a callus over the knife cut. Placing the cut surface of the plant directly against soil increases the odds of infection.

, Place the young plant on top of well-draining soil, without burying the leaves. Because the root system is likely to be small (or even nonexistent), you may need to prop up the plant with a layer of pebbles and lean it against another object. The root system should grow large enough to support the plant within a few weeks.








More detailed information can be found in the Planting section, which applies to young plants as well as mature ones.

, Before the roots have grown in, do not water the plant. Wait at least a couple weeks for a pup to grow its own roots before watering it. Instead, mist the plant with a spray bottle once every three days.







, Aloe plants can last a long time without water, and if you water the plant before its roots are extensive enough, the water could pool and rot the plant.If the pup already has its own root system, you may instead get the roots to set by giving it one watering and leaving it in the shade for 2 to 3 weeks., Once the plant is in its container and has grown roots, it can be treated as an adult plant. Follow the instructions in the section on Providing Daily Care.

Find a sunny place for your patchouli plants.,
Give the patchouli plants some room to grow.,
Place the seedlings in composted planting holes.",How to Grow Patchouli2," The patchouli plant likes moist but well-draining soil. It likes full sun to partial shade, so find a nice place in your backyard or near a sunny window.Patchouli will grow as a container plant indoors. Just don't place it too close to the window where it can easily burn.
Patchouli doesn’t like temperatures that go below 15 Celsius (59 Fahrenheit)., Your patchouli plants should grow up to somewhere between 15 and 31 inches in height (40–80 centimeters). You will need to plant them between 23 (60 centimeters) and 39 inches (100 centimeters) apart., Dig a hole for each seedling. Put some compost at the bottom of each hole. Make sure that the soil is warm before planting the seedlings. Transfer the seedling from the pot where you germinated it. Tamp the soil down around the plant. Then, mulch the plant to help keep moisture in."

Cut short branches from the crown of the plant.,
Get multiple cuttings to ensure you get one that takes root.,
Put the cuttings into room temperature water in clean mason jars.,
Fill a large pot with moist potting soil.,
Put the cuttings in the pot with the roots in the soil.",How to Grow Patchouli3," Use a sharp knife or snips to get a clean cutting.Cut short, two or three inch branches from near the crown of the patchouli plant. Remove the leaves from the bottom of each cutting.Choose branches that have at least one node, which is where you have a stem with little buds where flowers or leaves are growing.If you have a friend with a pot of patchouli, you can use cuttings from their plant to grow patchouli.
It is best to gather cuttings in the late summer or early fall., To make sure you get at least one cutting that takes root, you should cut three or four branches from each of your patchouli plants. This will give you some insurance in case some of them fail to grow., You should use sterilized glass jars, such as mason jars. Fill the jar with water up to the lowest set of leaves on the cutting. The water should be room temperature. When the roots of the cutting grow to between one quarter and half an inch in length, you can plant them in a pot.Every three days, replace the water in the jar.
Patchouli roots in water very easily., Use a small stick to make little planting holes in the pot. Space the holes a few inches apart, wherever you want to propagate a patchouli plant., Each cutting should have one node that is above the soil. Water the cuttings. Put a cover over the pot to retain humidity. Eventually, at least a couple of the patchouli plants should take root. You will have a new patchouli plant by springtime!If you live in a cooler climate where freezing occurs, you should bring the pots inside during the winter.

Remove patchouli plants before the fall frost.,
Harvest patchouli leaves.",How to Grow Patchouli4," The patchouli plant needs to remain moist, especially as the temperatures rise in the summer months. It may need daily watering during the summer and in hotter climates. You can use the mister on your garden hose or a sprinkler to increase humidity.To determine whether the plants need water, put your finger an inch into the soil. If it feels a bit dry at the bottom of your finger, you should water the plants.

, Use liquid fish fertilizer or rotted manure.You can use a 10-10-10 fertilizer. Apply the fertilizer in the spring and then once per month until the fall., A chalk-like powder that is entirely harmless to humans but kills insects by dehydrating them, diatomaceous earth is a wonderful solution for organic pest control. Sprinkle it on top of the soil surrounding your patchouli plant. Any insects that try to eat the patchouli will be kept away or die., Since patchouli plants are extremely sensitive to cold temperatures, you’ll want to bring the plants inside before the cold weather hits in the fall. Look at upcoming weather and bring your plants inside well ahead of the first frost date in your region., The leaves can be harvested as soon as they develop their distinctive green color. They can be harvested continuously throughout the growing season, as long as you are just pruning a part of the plant or taking a few leaves. If you want to harvest more of the plant, you should probably wait until the fall.Dry them and add them to potpourri sachets for a rich, earthy fragrance.It is best to harvest in the morning or at least before noon.It is best to only harvest about a third of the plant at a time, unless you are planning to pull the whole plant up at the end of the season.

, Planting in cups also helps with keeping the soil warm and moist. Choose a cup that is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) deep and equally as wide per 2-4 seeds. It will likely become too large for a windowsill but a bright sunny window will do fine.

, A mixture of organically sourced compost, tap water,and 2 oz. potting soil with a light bottom layer of crushed limestone mixed in sand and fertilizer. Check the PH of your fertilizer; it should be between 6.0 and 7.8.


5% dust products are a source of Organic pest control and are registered for use against bed bugs, roaches, crickets, fleas, ticks, spiders, and many other pests

, Misting with a spray bottle may be helpful if you are growing indoors, to keep the humidity up. Do not drink the water, especially in warmer climates but be sure to not let it freeze, especially in colder climates. Turmeric will not tolerate wet feet for long and will start rotting in the soil if kept too moist.

, Monthly feedings of an organic fish emulsion or bi-monthly compost tea applications will do just fine if you have prepared your potting soil well.

Plant the herb seed in the starter kit according to directions.,
Prepare the soil for seed transfer.,
Transfer the herb seed from pot to garden at the start of spring.,
Water your herbs deeply once a week.,
Trim and harvest the herbs periodically.",How to Grow Perennial Herbs," Where you live will impact which perennial herbs you can grow. By researching local growing conditions and matching them with herbs that grow best in your local growing conditions, you can make the entire process easier for yourself.


Refer to a USDA Hardiness Zone Map. The Map covers North America, dividing the entire continent into 11 different zones based on how cold it gets in those areas. Find out which zone you live in.






Research the perennial herbs you plan on growing. At your local gardening store, look at the seed packets for perennial herbs. On the back of those packets, there will be information about that herb's ideal growing conditions. If you know your zone, you can easily pick out herbs that will grow well in your area.
Some common perennial herbs that are grown in home gardens are mint, oregano, rosemary, sage, tarragon, and thyme. Not only are they some of the easier herbs to grow, but they have a number of culinary uses--great for adding a boost of flavor if you cook. If you don't cook, fresh herbs can be a great gift for friends or family members who do cook.;
, Most seeds for perennial herbs are not very expensive, although the heirloom varieties will have a bit of price markup. Heirloom plants are plant types that were grown commonly in the past but aren't used in modern large-scale agriculture.

, Each individual variety of perennial herb will have specific growing conditions and instructions. Often, the instructions will be located on the back of the seed packets. It is important to adhere to the individual herb growing conditions.


Begin the potting process in late autumn or early winter. Perennial herbs have internal sensors that signify the coming of spring and will not grow until those internal sensors are triggered. Before you can move the plant outside, the seed must grow accustomed to being in soil in order to sense the passing of winter when it is moved outside. This preparation process can take up to 12 weeks depending on the type of perennial herb.

, When winter is coming to a close, pick a spot in your garden where you will be planting and growing herbs. Perennial herbs tend to grow best in well-drained areas that receive at least 5 to 6 hours of sunshine every day.


Using a spade, cultivate the area where you will be planting your herb. As you cultivate, mix in some compost into the soil in order to boost the nutrient levels. If you don't have compost, you can research the nutrient requirements for your specific herb and buy a fertilizer pack that meets those requirements.

, Check the back of your seed packets for specific instructions and information regarding your exact herb type--e.g., soil depth.

, Watering a plant deeply means to soak the soil all the way through, at least 8 inches (20 cm) down into the soil. Shallow watering--sprinkling water so that only the surface soil gets wet--will produce weak plant growth. It is better to water deeply once a week than to water shallowly every day.

, To prevent your herbs from growing too big for your garden, you should trim and prune them to size at least once a year. Pruning consists of picking or cutting the outer leaves off.

Be patient.",How to Grow Orris Root," In late spring, carefully lift a plant, preserving as many roots as possible. Cut the creeping rhizome into sections and discard the old center of the clump. Once it has flowered, it won't do so again.


When cutting, ensure that each section has its own fan of leaves and a growing point (bud or shoot). Make the cuts at the narrow spots where the rhizome changes growing direction.;
,, The soil should be well dug over and this plant prefers a deep, fertile, and well-drained soil. Ensure that the position has full sun.

, Place them 35cm (14"") apart. They should be planted half above and half below the soil. Any deeper and there is a tendency for the rhizomes to rot.

, Orris root does not tolerate prolonged dry periods.

, Add a complete plant food when planting but there is no need to feed again. Old rotted manure or compost can be used as a mulch.

,, To get the orris root for home use, lift out the orris root in autumn. Remove soil and any debris and hang them to dry in a warm place.


If you're wanting to replant some and use others, lift them out in early summer and put the younger pieces back into the soil to keep growing, while drying the rest.
The root can be dried in the sun before storing in a jar.

, The fragrance of dried orris root takes about one year to develop. Keep it in an airtight jar.

Wait until the second year to trim a lavender shrub.,
Trim lavender right when the flowers open.,
Use a very clean set of pruning shears.,
Gather the stalks and trim the shrub back by a third.,
Trim again when the second flush of flowers opens.",How to Trim Lavender1," Lavender takes a few years to get fully established. The first year you plant it, it may only produce a few stalks of flowers. In subsequent years, it will produce an ever-larger bush of flowers. The first time you trim lavender, during its second year of growth, you may only get a handful of stalks. By year 3 or 4, you should have 5 - 8 bunches of lavender you can use to dry and use or display.;
, Lavender is at its most fragrant right when the flower buds open. This should happen in late spring or early summer. Trim lavender in the afternoon, when the essential oils are strongest.You can wait a few weeks after the flower buds open to enjoy them in your garden, but by the time you trim them, the oils won't be as strong. If you're using the lavender to make essential oil, its better to trim them early.

, Use a hand pruner or shears that have been washed clean of dirt and disinfected in a bleach solution. Taking this precaution will help ensure that the plant doesn't pick up a bacterial disease. You should also make sure the shears are very sharp, so that the make a clean cut that will heal over quickly.


Avoid using craft scissors to trim lavender. They don't make a clean enough cut.

, Use one hand to gather together enough stalks to make a fistful, then trim the stems with the shears. Trim them back so that 1/3 of the length of the stems is left on the shrub.If your shrub is on the older side, you'll likely have to cut more than one bunch.
Don't cut into the woody part of the shrub. Make sure to leave all of the wood intact, since cutting it could injure the plant.

, Later in the summer, the shrub will produce another flush of flowers. You can trim these the same way you trimmed the first flush, cutting the stalks by the fistful.

Put flaxseed oil in the refrigerator after use.",How to Use Flax Seed," Ground flaxseed, also referred to as “milled flaxseed” or “flax meal”, can cause bloating and abdominal discomfort if you do not give your body time to adjust to it. If you are just starting to use flaxseed, start with 1 tbsp (14 g) a day, and gradually add more to your diet.Do not exceed 2 to 4 tbsp (28g to 56.7g) of flaxseed a day.;
, You can consume whole flaxseed and still receive some nutritional benefits. But grinding the flaxseed will ensure your body digests the seed and processes it properly. This will allow your body to receive the maximum amount of health benefits from the flaxseed., Flaxseed can cause bloating and abdominal discomfort. If you have existing bowel issues like acute or chronic diarrhea, diverticulitis (colon disorder), or inflammatory bowel disease, avoid flaxseed as it can make these conditions worse., You should also avoid this seed if you are allergic to flaxseed oil, or any other members of the Linaceae plant family.Allergic reaction symptoms include itchy palms, hives, itchy eyes and weeping, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting after consuming flaxseed.

, Check with your doctor before you consume flaxseed to avoid other health issues.If you currently have breast cancer, limit flaxseed to 2-3 Tbsp per day and avoid flax supplementation. Talk to your doctor and health care team before beginning this regimen., Look for whole flaxseed if you have access to a coffee grinder or small powerful blender, like a Ninja or Bullet, as whole flaxseed will pass through your body without being digested and you will not get the healthy benefits of this superfood.Buying ground flaxseed is also a good option as you will not have to grind the flaxseed yourself.

, You can also use a mortar and pestle to grind up the flaxseed. Don’t worry about making the flaxseed very fine or ground, simple break up the seeds so they form smaller pieces that your body can digest., You can put the ground flaxseed in a liquid or consume it with a liquid on the side. Your intestines may be obstructed if you consume flaxseed without enough water or liquid., Soaking the ground seeds will give them a soft, chewy texture that blends well in your smoothie or juice.Put one heaping spoonful of ground flaxseed in a bowl. Pour enough water to submerge the seeds and cover the bowl. Leave the flaxseed to soak overnight.
Add the swollen seeds to your morning smoothie or juice. Blend or stir them into the smoothie or juice.

Choose your pots.,
Soak your seeds in a wet paper towel for 2 to 4 hours before planting.,
Sprinkle the seeds with water and place them in indirect sunlight.,
Place the seeds in the sun when they germinate and start to sprout.,
Plant your seedlings 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep into your larger pot, if you are transplanting from a seed tray or planting starts.,

Snip off the starts of neighboring herb plants to prevent overcrowding.,
Snip off sprigs of herbs to use in your recipes.,
Leave at least 1 healthy sprig of your herb plant at all times, so that it can continue to grow and be healthy.

,
If your herb garden gets overcrowded or you aren't using it and they have become bitter, you can cut down the overgrown plants just above the soil.",How to Start a Window Herb Garden," Herbs must have at least 6 hours of sunlight per day, so choose an east or south facing window in your home. Measure the windowsill so you know how wide your pots can be.


Fluorescent light can help your herbs to thrive, so you should also choose a room where you have Fluorescent light to help keep your plants alive through cloudy and/or winter months.;
, You should choose herbs that you use a lot in your cooking, because they need to be trimmed back, or used, on a regular basis. Not all herbs are the same; the following are types of herbs that you can plant.


Plant annuals, such as sweet basil or parsley. An annual plant will die back each year. You may need to remove it each year and start anew.
Plant perennials, such as oregano, rosemary, chives, thyme and sage. Perennials grow back each year and do not usually need to be replanted. You do not want to plant annuals next to perennials, because removing the annual plant can disturb perennial roots.

, If you want to plant seeds, you will need to buy a seed packet and start them in a moist environment, before weeding out the stronger plants from the weaker ones. If you buy seedlings, you need only plant a seedling with already-formed roots in your container and water it as usual.


You can find seeds at most gardening and home improvement stores. You can find seedlings or ""starts"" at home improvement stores or farmer's markets.

, Bring a ruler to the gardening or home improvement store so you can measure according to the width of your windowsill. Seeds require smaller pots, where starts require larger pots.


You can find a special container at gardening stores for planting seeds. A seed planter divides each seed into a small section. You plant the seeds in potting soil and keep them warm and moist. After they start to grow, you replant the sprout and roots in a larger pot.
Pick containers with excellent drainage. This means that they should have holes in the bottom where the water can seep out. If clay, plastic or wood pots come with trays, that is even better, because it keeps a wooden windowsill clear of water. Drainage is essential to keep the herb roots from rotting.

, Place potting soil in the seed tray or small pot up to 3/4 of an inch from the top of the pot. Sprinkle the seeds in, and then cover them with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of potting soil.

, If your house is not very warm, you can create a small greenhouse over each seed pot by covering it tightly with plastic wrap. You want to create a warm, moist environment.

, Spray them with a spray bottle to water them, so that you don't break the seedlings with strong water pressure.

, Place a small amount of gravel in the bottom of each pot to improve drainage. Place some potting soil into the container, and make a hole in the center for the plant.


It is a good idea to choose a potting soil with perlite in it. Perlite is a volcanic glass that has high water content. If not, you can add about 20 percent perlite to it for an even healthier planting environment. You should also choose a potting soil with peat moss in it.

, Do not let the soil get dry, or the plants will die off. Water from the bottom, near the soil, since some herbs do not like to get water on their leaves.

, You can use kitchen shears and cut them off at soil level, so they will not be competing for the same nutrients. Frequent snipping and trimming can give you bushy plants that provide enough sprigs for cooking.

, Wash them thoroughly. Use immediately.

,, They will regrow tender shoots.

Prune to an inch above the wood.,
Don't take away the wood itself.,
Trim away dead or damaged parts in spring.",How to Trim Lavender2," In the fall, after the second flush has come and gone, prune the stems down to an inch above the wood. Leaving them long will create space for snow to collect on the shrub and break it, or wind to blow off weaker branches. Pruning the shrub to prep for winter will make it much more likely to survive the harsh weather.


Taking the time to do this will also help to prevent more of the shrub from turning to wood. The parts of the plant that turn to wood won't produce new lavender stalks; the stalks grow from new shoots that emerge from the shrub every year. A big, woody base is prone to cracking or rotting, so the idea is to keep it from getting too woody.

, Even though you don't want the base to get too woody, you can't cut away old wood on a lavender shrub. Some shrubs rejuvenate themselves when you cut back the wood, but lavender doesn't. What you cut won't grow back. Make sure you never cut the part of the shrub that has turned to wood., If you live in a place with heavy snows and harsh weather, your lavender bush is likely to lose a few branches over the winter. Examine the shrub in early spring, before it begins producing new shoots. Remove any broken or rotting branches to make way for new growth.

Dry the lavender.,
Use lavender in craft projects.,
Cook and bake with lavender.",How to Trim Lavender3," After you've trimmed lavender, you can display it in a vase or dry it for further use. To dry lavender, you have two choices: you can tie it into bunches and hang it up, or lay it out in the sun and let it dry over the course of a few days.


To hang your lavender to dry, use a rubber band to tie the stems together. Hang the lavender bunch upside-down in a cool, dry spot. Allow it to dry for a week or tow. Drying lavender this way preserves its color and scent.
To dry your lavender in the sun, lay it flat on a screen, and set the screen in a sunny spot. The lavender will dry over the course of 5 days or so. Lavender dried in the sun tends to fade to a lighter color.

, Lavender's relaxing yet stimulating scent makes it a popular ingredient in lotions, soaps and deodorants of all kinds. Remove the dried buds from the lavender stalks and use them to create essential oil, sprinkle them into homemade soap, or mix them with rose petals and other dried flowers to create potpourri.

, Lavender is an edible herb that tastes delicious in both sweet and savory dishes. Flavor yellow cake with a teaspoon of ground lavender, or add lavender buds to the pot when you're making roast beef. Lavender also makes an excellent herbal tea.

Source garlic to plant.,
Get ready to plant in the fall or the spring.,
Prepare a planting site.,
Plant the garlic cloves.,
Mulch the area heavily.,
Cut off flower shoots in the spring.,
Keep the garlic watered.,
Fertilize and weed as necessary.,
Harvest when the tops turn yellow and begin to die off.,
Remove the bulbs from the ground without breaking them.,
Let the bulbs cure for 2 weeks.,
Use the garlic when the skin is dry and papery.,
Save the best bulbs for next season's planting.",How to Plant Garlic," You can always try planting garlic you bought from the grocery store, but you'll have a much higher chance of having a successful crop if you buy garlic cloves, or seeds, from a plant nursery that stocks varieties that grow well in your area. Shop online for a wider selection of garlic and choose one to your liking. Some strains are stronger, some are hardy during cold temperatures, and so on.


The garlic stocked in grocery stores is often shipped in from faraway places, so it won't necessary be a strain that works with your climate and soil type.
Garlic sold in grocery stores has usually been treated with chemicals to make it last longer on the shelf. It's harder to grow treated garlic than untreated garlic.;
, If you live in a northern area that gets a hard frost, it is recommended that you plant garlic in the fall. Garlic overwinters well, and planting it early will cause the bulbs to be larger and more flavorful than a spring-planted crop.However, if you live in a southern area that doesn't have cold winters, plant your garlic early spring instead.


If you're planting garlic in the fall, plan to plant it 6 - 8 weeks before the ground freezes.
If you're planting garlic in the spring, plant it as soon as the ground can be worked in February or March.

, Choose a spot with full sun and well-draining soil. Work the soil to a depth of 4 inches using a garden rake or hoe. Enrich the soil with compost to add nutrients that will help the garlic grow strong and healthy.


If you wish, prepare to grow the garlic in a pot. Choose a pot wide and deep enough to hold the garlic you wish to grow, and fill it with rich potting soil.

, Divide the bulb into individual cloves, keeping the papery skin intact. Plant the cloves 4 inches apart and about 2 inches deep. Make sure that the flat root side is pointing down and the tapered side is pointing up - otherwise the garlic will grow in the wrong direction. Cover the planted garlic cloves with soil and pat gently.

, If you're planting your garlic in the fall, cover the area with 6 inches of straw to protect the garlic during the winter. In the spring, the mulch can be removed. If you're planting your garlic in the spring, be sure to mulch it to retain soil moisture.

, You should see the garlic scapes emerge from the ground in early spring. Cut off any flower shoots you see, since if they're left to grow they'll take energy away from the bulb formation and result in smaller bulbs.

, Water the garlic every 3 to 5 days throughout the growing season. When you see the soil get dry and dusty, that means it's time to water. Garlic plants don't need to be water during the fall and winter.

, If the garlic shoots look yellowish or limp in the middle of the growing season, you can dress the plants with fertilizer to help them perk up. Keep the garlic bed weeded so that the garlic doesn't have to compete with other plants for nutrients and water., At the end of the growing season, in July or August, the tops of the garlic plants will start looking yellow and begin to fall over and die. This means it's time to harvest the garlic.


Don't harvest the garlic too late in the season - the bulbs will shrivel and the garlic won't be good to eat.
Garlic harvested too early won't cure properly.

, Use a spade to dig around the garlic bulbs without breaking through the cloves. Brush off excess dirt. You can leave the garlic stem attached to the bulb.

, Before you use the garlic, it's necessary to let it cure. During this time the skin will dry and the bulb will become firm. Store the harvested garlic in a cool, dry place for curing.


You can cut off the stem and cure the garlic bulbs individually in a storage bin. Make sure they get plenty of air circulation.
Another common way to cure and store garlic is to leave the stems attached and braid them, then hang the garlic in a cool, dry place.
You can also cure your garlic by hanging the cloves upside down in a warm, shaded area with the leaves attached.

, The cloves should be firm to the touch, and easy to pull apart.

, Pick out a few large bulbs to plant either in the fall before the ground freezes or in early spring. Choose the best-looking bulbs to ensure that next season's plants are big and flavorful."

If wished, place a little hormone powder for plants on the ends of the cuttings.,
Plant in the pot.,
Place the pot in semi-shade.,
Water regularly.",How to Strike a Lavender Cutting," Don't try to strike a cutting when it is too hot or too cold. Temperature extremes will cause the cutting to shrivel and die. The best times for striking a cutting are early autumn and early spring.;
,, Both of these provide the perfect medium for a cutting and do not have too much moisture. Soil or potting mix can retain too much moisture, causing the cutting to rot.

, Hormone powder can provide the extra zip needed to overcome any adversities such as very hot or cold spells, insects, soil that isn't ideal, etc.

, Pat down gently into place but do not make too firm.

, Preferably provide more shade than not.

, Water every day if very hot but don't drench the soil; aim for moist, not wet, soil or the cutting will rot.

,, Keep your plant inside of its pot (but remove any other plastic wraps or containers surrounding the pot) and place the whole container inside of the bag.

, The reason why it's wilted is because the roots are dehydrated. This lets the roots rehydrate quickly.

, Once you are sure your plant is hydrated, carefully remove your plant so you do not wash away your soil, and then pour the water out of the bag.

, By sealing the bag, you are creating a humid environment, letting your plant hydrate the rest of the way without drowning the roots.

, You still want it to receive light but you don't want to cook the plant in the bag. It should take as little as a few hours up to several days for your plant to revive.

, Some herbs need lots of light, some are more shade tolerant. Be sure to place your herb in the appropriate light and water from the bottom so the roots can stay hydrated.

Remove your seedlings from their pots or pellets.,
Make a small hole in your potting soil.,
Put your seedlings into the hole.,
Water your seedlings.,
Place your seedlings in the sun.,
Check on your seedlings.",How to Transplant Herb Seedlings," Since transplanting the seedlings is hard on the plant, it's important to make sure they are strong enough to be moved. To check this, see if your herb seedlings have grown their “true leaves.” This should be the plants’ second set of leaves, which will be fuller and frond-like, as opposed to the thin and stringy nature of their first set of leaves. They should appear after 5-6 weeks.You can also check to make sure the herb seedlings have formed a ball of roots, but this can be difficult to do without removing the plant from its pot or pellet.;
, You should do this about two hours before you try to transplant your seedlings. You want the plants to be as strong as possible before being moved so they are more likely to grow once transplanted. The water will make sure the soil is loose and easy to break apart, which will help you transfer your seedlings quickly. Be careful to use just enough to make the soil moist. , You should use moist potting soil and make sure you have enough room at the top for the seedling’s stem base to come up just below the top of the pot. This should be 1 to 2 inches below the pot’s rim depending on the size of your seedlings. You also want to make sure you aren't packing the soil. It shouldn’t be loose, but you don't want it compacted or it will be difficult for the roots to continue forming.


You can also add rocks to the bottom of your pot to help drain the water.
Try to stick to pots between 6”-8” for single plants and 10” and up for multiples.

, If your seedlings are in a small planting pot, place your hand over the soil with the seedling in between your fingers. Then gently turn the pot upside down and shake it till the soil dislodges. However, if your seedlings are in pellets, simply peel off the skin around the soil., You can do this with your hands or a trowel. If you are planning to transplant more than one seedling, make sure you have enough space to make multiple holes without overcrowding the plants. Each hole should be deep enough for the seedling’s ball of roots.


If you are unsure of how many seedlings to put in each pot, a common rule to remember is that a pot that is 8 inches or smaller should have only one plant, and one that is 10 inches or larger can have multiple plants.

, Once placed, move the soil back in over your seedling, and pat it down lightly. Remember, you want the soil tight, but not too compacted. You should also make sure that your seedling isn’t buried. You should be able to see its leaves and a little bit of its stem.

, You want to water towards the base of your seedlings, since pouring water over their leaves can be damaging. You should also water them until you see some of it drain out of the bottom of your pot. If you are using a pot without holes in the bottom, try to watch the edges of the soil for water bouncing back upward. If you see this, you’ve used too much.

, You don’t want to put them into direct sunlight until they adjust to their re-potting. Direct light and heat will damage the plant and may prevent it from growing. Instead, try gradually introducing the seedlings to sunlight a little at a time., Even after transplanting, you should make sure to check on the growth of your seedlings regularly. You want to make sure that the roots have grown and taken hold in the pot. You can try and check this by turning your plant’s pot on its side and gently tapping to dislodge the root ball. However, if your plant is showing positive signs of growth it is likely to have taken root in its new home."

Wash the herbs lightly and use immediately.,
Prune your herbs regularly.",How to Plant a Culinary Herb Garden," The most practical way to do this is to make a list of herbs you routinely use while cooking. This could be anything from garlic to basil to chives. Only choose herbs that you feel you would use, or that you could dry for later use. Culinary herbs fall into the following three categories:


Annual herbs, like dill, cilantro and basil, die after they flower and usually need to be replanted each year.
Herbaceous herbs, like mint, chives, oregano, tarragon and sweet fennel can be cut regularly and they usually grow back the next year.
Evergreen herbs, such as rosemary, sage and thyme should be pruned at least once per year, and they are also perennial.;
, Most of these herbs do well in a variety of climates as long as they are cared for properly. If you want to plant a particular herb that needs special care, you can always plant it in a pot and keep it indoors to control the surrounding temperature.


Certain perennials, such as rosemary, do best in climates with mild winters and long, dry summers. You can still plant rosemary if you live in a place with cold winters, but you may have to treat it as an annual and replant again the following year.
Consider using pots for herbaceous plants that may be invasive in your area. Mint, lemon balm and comfrey plants. These plants can be invasive, multiplying easily, taking up space and competing with other plants for nutrients. Place the pots on the corners of your herb garden, so that you can water them together.

, Choose the number of herbs you will plant according to how often you use the herb. For example, if you love cooking with rosemary, you might want more than one plant so you can use it as often as you'd like. If you cook Italian food a lot, you would want to plant more basil and parsley plants.


Different herb varieties produce different-sized plants. For example, some rosemary varieties grow into large bushes, while others remain quite small. Take this information into account when you're planning your garden.
If you like making pesto, plant at least two or three basil plants. Pesto requires a large amount of basil leaves, and picking too many from one plant can cause it to die.
If there's an herb you use as an occasional garnish, one plant should suffice. For example, if you like to sprinkle chives over your potatoes or omelets, one or two plants will be sufficient.

, The easiest way to quickly jumpstart your garden is to buy young plants you can transplant into the ground. The roots will immediately begin to grow, and you'll have the herbs you need for cooking right away. If it's too early to plant full-grown plants, you can try growing them inside. You might consider choosing seedlings or seeds instead.


If you plant from seeds, start the seeds about two weeks before the outdoor temperature is warm with no chance of another frost. Moisten the seeds for 2 to 4 hours, as indicated on the package. Plant herb seeds in a seed tray and keep them on a warm windowsill. Keep the soil moist, and you should see seedlings within 7 to 14 days.Place a sheet of plastic wrap over them to create a ""greenhouse effect"" if the room is chilly.

, Choose a place that's easy to get to from your kitchen, so you can pop out and harvest herbs whenever you need them. Most herbs need full sun to thrive, so look for a place that gets at least six hours of sun per day.If you don't see a suitable place in your yard, you can easily plant herbs in pots instead of in the ground. That way you can place them in the most convenient location possible.
Or you can have an indoor culinary herb garden if you can't find just the right spot outside. Choose a windowsill in a southern location, if possible, to optimize sunlight.

, You'll want to place the herbs that need plenty of water on one side of your herb garden and plants that need less on the other side. This will allow you to water plants in groups and meet their individual needs. For example, basil needs a lot of water, but rosemary likes to remain somewhat dry. Planting according to package instructions will help you care for them correctly.


Herbs that stay close to the ground, such as thyme and some varieties of rosemary, should be placed on the south side of the garden, so they aren't overshadowed by taller plants during the sunniest times of the day.
Place taller-growing herbs in the center or north side of the garden to give shorter plants plenty of sun access. If you're uncertain which areas get the best light, look at your potential areas at different times of day (morning, noon, evening) to determine which area consistently gets the most light.
If you are growing herbs for preserving, plant these all together so that they can be removed at the same time. The area can then be replanted.

, Culinary herbs have similar soil needs, making it easy to plant them all close to each other in the same garden. The soil should be well-drained, organic, and fertile, whether you are planting your herbs in the ground or in pots.If the soil doesn't drain well, add a layer of compost and till the soil and compost together. This will improve drainage as well as enriching the soil.
If you plant into pots, use a standard potting soil and place some gravel into your pot before adding soil. This will help to keep the roots moist, but not moldy.

, Seedlings and plants can be planted as soon as there is no risk of frost. Plant each herb 12 to 18 inches (31 to 46 cm) away from the next herb, according to package directions. Dig holes deep enough to hold the root balls and place them in the ground. Place soil around them and pack it lightly.

, When the soil dries out, the herbs will suffer. Water the herb garden as often as necessary to keep the soil evenly moist; in the heat of the summer, this might be every day or every two days. There is no need to water after rainfall or when the soil is already moist.


Test to see if the soil is damp by inserting your finger near the stem of one of your herb plants. If your finger comes out dry and dusty, time to water.
Water near the base of the stems, rather than showering water from above. This keeps the leaves from getting damaged.
Water in the morning, so the sun has time to dry the area before nightfall. Leaving the herbs wet overnight could cause mold to grow.

, Never use chemicals or pesticides on your herb garden. Since most herbs go directly into food, it can be harmful to your health. Instead, plant garlic, mint and onions nearby.


You may not need to worry about pests getting to your herbs. Most herbs attract beneficial insects, so pests are rarely a problem.
You can deal with aphids and other common pests by washing the leaves daily with soapy water. Mix a natural insecticide out of 1 to 2 tablespoons of plant-based soap, such as Castile Soap, and one quart of water. Spray it on your plants and it will kill soft-bodied insects.
Weed the garden regularly, pulling the weeds out from the roots so they won't grow back.

, When your herb plants grow sturdy stems and begin producing plenty of leaves, you can start harvesting them several times a week. In the height of summer, you may be able to harvest certain plants every day.Harvest herbs in the morning. In the morning, the flavor of the herbs is strongest. Harvest your herbs just as the dew is drying.
Be sure to harvest your herbs regularly, before they have time to produce flowers. When flowers are produced, the plant's energy is directed away from healthy leaf growth.This can change the flavor of the herb in a bad way. To delay this in basil plants, remove the flower buds.

, You may also use a sharp, clean pair of pruning shears. Be sure your equipment is clean to avoid contaminating the herb plants when you cut them.


Leafy annual herbs, such as basil, can be cut back severely, and they'll grow back within a week or so. Cut the new growth and leave about four to six inches of the stem intact so the plant keeps growing.
For perennials, such as thyme and oregano, remove only the leafy tips, or top growth, to keep the plant compact.

, Herbs are best used soon after they are cut; storing them will cause them to lose flavor. If you need to store fresh herbs for a few days, place the stems upright in a glass of water. Place the glass in the refrigerator and cover it lightly with a plastic bag until use.

, Harvesting your herbs will provide natural pruning, but in between harvests you still need to prune your herbs to encourage healthy growth patterns. If you don't prune, your herbs will become leggy and tall or produce seeds, which impairs the production and flavor of the leaves.


At the end of the growing season, cut back herbaceous herbs to within a few inches of the ground. They'll return next year.Cut back evergreens by a third to keep them from becoming woody over the winter. Remove all dead and dying stems, and place mulch around the roots.
Pull out dead or dying annuals that won't return the following year.

Use sticks and strings to mark boundaries. You will probably only need 3 to 5 plants, initially, since they multiply easily.

Note: Perennials form a lasting part of a landscape. They need regular seasonal care every year, rather than weekly care for one summer. Perennials should survive the winter if it doesn't get too cold. They can invade other plants if not given room and look unsightly if not tended properly.

Cut a 4 inch (10 cm) sprig about ½ inch (1 cm) above a junction to allow new branches to grow in its place. The sprig does not need to have many leaves, and almost any sprig will do. Place the sprig in a glass of water, and remove any leaves that fall below the water line.Within a week, small white roots should appear under water. Wait a few more days to another week to allow the roots to develop into a decent length.


Add water to the glass as necessary. Make sure that you change the water every four to five days to prevent rot.;
, You can find mint seedlings at most nurseries and garden stores. There are many varieties of mint, such as sweet mint, chocolate mint, spearmint, lemon mint, apple mint, and peppermint. Spearmint is most commonly used for cooking. Mint is a fast-growing, fast-spreading plant and is perfect for one of your first attempts at growing plants.

, Runners are long stems that grow away from the current plant and set their own roots in the ground. These can be carefully dug up and transplanted. If you have a friend growing mint, the plants will have runners that could be transplanted., Ideally, you should plant your mint in the spring, or in the fall if you're in a climate that is free of frost. Though mint is a resilient plant, it's best to start growing it under optimal conditions.

, Potting mint is the most popular way to grow it because you can easily keep it in check this way, as well as keeping it close to your kitchen so you can use it frequently. Mint spreads rapidly, and its roots have a tendency to choke out the roots of other plants.As a result, it is often best to plant mint in a container without other plants. Use a 12-to-16-inch wide pot for one plant.


You should add a water-retaining polymer to the potting soil so that it stays moist and doesn't dry up. You can also use pearlite or vermiculite instead of a polymer., If planting multiple seedlings, plant them 6 inches (15 cm) apart. This will give each seedling enough room to grow.

, When you plant your mint or place down your potted mint plant, you'll need to choose an area that receives morning sun and partial afternoon shade. You want the plant to get some light without drying it out completely. Mint grows best in deep, moist soil, so you want to keep it that way. You can even place your mint pot indoors, on a windowsill, as long as it's in a location that will get enough sunlight.

, If you're planting it in the ground, then use a damp area with full sun or partial shade.The best conditions for growing mint in the ground require a fertile soil with a pH that is between 6.0 and 7.0. Though it can grow on its own without a problem, a little bit of fertilizer every few weeks won't hurt it. Make sure that the soil is moist by placing some mulch around the plant's roots to protect them., If you go this route, you should submerge your mint in a container, such as a pot or a mesh bag that is at least 5 inches (about 13 cm) deep. You should leave the rim of the container above ground level so that the plant's root system will be contained. If you don't do this, your mint will spread rapidly into places you don't want it to be.You can also plant mint in its own raised bed container, on a bare spot in your garden that you would like to fill in, or section off part of your garden with bricks or timbers to create a barrier for the mint.

, During the first year that you have your mint, you will need to water it frequently.Test the soil with your finger to determine how dry it is. Keep the soil damp, but don't soak it. If your mint is in direct sun, water it more frequently. Check on it frequently to make sure that it gets adequate water, but not too much.

, This will help to contain the plant's height and keep the leaves nice and full around the sides of the plant.This also creates a better harvest. When you check on your plant to see if it needs water, see if the plant has gotten too tall.

, A mint plant's small flowers will typically bloom from June to September. You should trim the buds before they have a chance to open so the plant doesn't grow out of control. Pinching off the plant's flower buds as they appear will also extend your plant's harvesting season.

, After a few years, your mint will match the size of the container, causing its roots to become cramped. De-pot it and carefully split apart the mint into several plants. Lifting and replanting your mint every two to three or even three to four years will help keep the scent and the flavor of the mint nice and strong.

, Rust, a fungus that creates orange-brown patches on the undersides of a plant's leaves, is one of the few diseases that mint is susceptible to.

, Your plant may fall victim to diseases such as verticillium wilt or mint anthracnose and it may be infested with insects such as flea beetles, root borers, spider mites, or root weevils.This is not a likely occurrence, however, since the strong odor of mint wards off most insects and other pests. Just provide good air circulation and soil that is well-drained to keep your plants healthy. If you notice any insects, spray them off with a garden hose.


You can also wash your leaves with insecticidal soap.
Make sure to look for pests under the leaves of the plants, too. This is a place where they like to hide.

, Never harvest more than 1/3 of the leaves at once and allow the plant to regrow before harvesting more. You can just harvest as much mint as you need at a time.


If you want to air-dry your mint, then you should hang the stems upside down. Separate them into bundles secured with some string or a rubber band or spread them on a flat surface. When the leaves and stems feel crispy and dry, pluck off the leaves and put them into jars, Ziploc bags, or plastic containers with lids., The roots will survive the frost and regrow the following spring, but the above-ground plant matter will die off. Protect your mint roots by covering the plants with a layer of mulch before winter. To harvest the leaves, you should pinch off the stems. If you have a larger harvest, then wait until right before the plant blooms and cut the whole plant just above the first or the second set of leaves.


Typically, you can harvest a larger harvest of mint about three times a season.

, There are endless uses for mint, and you can do whatever you like with it. However, there are some typical uses of mint that you should be aware of. Here are some great ways to use it:


Serve it as a compliment to fish, chicken, lamb, or another protein dish.
Use it to spice up veggies such as carrots, peas, and potatoes.
Spice up salads such as fruit salads, fig and radish salads, or walnut and goat cheese salads.
Use them in drinks such as iced tea, punch, or lemonade.
Use the mint in cocktails, such as the mojito or the mint julep.

Choose a well-lit location.,
Make sure the soil has adequate drainage.,
Check the pH level of the soil.,
Purchase your lavender.",How to Grow Lavender1," Lavender is a Mediterranean herb, so it thrives in hot, sunny locations. Choose a spot in your garden where the plant will receive full sun for at least eight hours a day. The spot should also be as sheltered as possible to protect the plant from wind., Dampness is the enemy of lavender, so your most important consideration should be to choose a location where the soil is well-drained. The soil should be light, fluffy and well-aerated for optimum lavender-growing conditions. To improve soil's drainage, you can mix in a little silica sand before planting. Silica sand offers many benefits: it drains well, does not cement, and is very reflective, which helps reflect sunlight onto the plant. This is especially helpful in colder and wetter climates.Alternatively, try planting your lavender on a raised bed, at the top of a slope or beside a wall to maximize drainage., Lavender grows best in slightly alkaline conditions, with an ideal soil pH level of between 6.7 to 7.3.You can test your soil's pH level using a commercial test probe. These are available for purchase at home improvement stores and garden centers.


If necessary, you can increase the alkalinity of your soil by adding a little lime. The amount you add will depend on your type of soil and the test recommendations., There are many species of lavender available for home growing. Whether they flourish or fail will depend on the conditions in the area in which you live. The types of lavender sold at your local nursery or garden center will usually be compatible with your area's conditions, though you can check the label on the plant or ask a nursery employee if you are unsure.Mustead and Hidcote Lavender are two especially hardy varieties.
While it is possible to grow lavender from seeds, this is not recommended as the seeds require scarification and chilling and can take nearly a month to germinate.

Give sprouted seeds plenty of light.",How to Grow Lavender from Seed1," Lavender seeds can take a while to germinate and should be started early indoors so that they have plenty of time to grow into mature plants during the warm growing season.;
, In this process, seeds should be placed in a sealable plastic bag filled with moist soil. Use a commercial soil specially formulated for starting seeds. Place the plastic bag with the soil and seeds inside the refrigerator and allow it to sit for three weeks.

, The seed starting mix should be a light potting mix that drains well. You can either use a plastic seedling tray or a wide, shallow container without divisions.

, Sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil.


If using a plastic seedling tray, plant one seed per slot.
If planting in a division-free container, space the seeds 1/2 to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) apart.

, A light coating of potting mix protects the seeds, but the seeds also need access to sunlight in order to germinate.

, A heat tray often works best, but another work location may also work as long as the temperature remains around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius)., Keep the growing medium moist, but not damp, and water the seeds in the morning so that the soil can dry some before evening hits. Soil that is too damp and cool will invite fungus to grow, and fungus will destroy your seeds.

, Lavender seeds can take two weeks to one month to sprout.

, After the seeds sprout, you should move the container to a location that receives plenty of direct sunlight. If no such location is available, place a fluorescent grow light about the sprouts and allow them to sit in the artificial light for eight hours a day.

Grow your Lantanas from seed if you can’t get a healthy cutting.",How to Grow Lantana Plants1," If you grow Lantana from seed you have harvested, you may not get a plant exactly like the parent plant. When you propagate Lantana from cuttings, the plants you grow will be more predictable.


Propagate Lantana cuttings in the spring.;
, Take about five inches of fresh, healthy-looking growth, remove the lower leaves and dip the cutting in rooting hormone or powder. Then insert the lower two inches into a pot with moist cutting compost.

, Cover the pot that you have placed your cutting in either with a clear plastic bag or an inverted clear plastic bottle with the spout cut off; doing this makes a mini greenhouse of sorts.


Make sure the plastic doesn’t touch the cuttings; use plant sticks to support the bag and keep it away from the stem if necessary.

, If you keep your cutting moist, it should root in about a month. After the last frosts have passed you can harden your cutting off and plant it out in the garden.


Hardening off means that you slowly acclimatize your cutting to outdoor temperatures. This could mean moving it outside during the day, and then storing it in your garage overnight.

, If you do grow your Lantana from seed, start the Lantanas off indoors about a month before the last frosts occur. Seeds may take a few weeks to germinate.


If you are growing from seeds, fill a pot with potting soil and plant the seeds. Keep the pots in a cool dry place out of direct sunlight.

Water lavender in its nursery pot before planting.,
Prune the lavender.,
Prepare the roots.,
Plant the lavender.",How to Grow Lavender2," Use a trowel to dig a hole in the location you have chosen for your lavender. The hole should just be deep enough and wide enough to contain the roots when you spread them out.If you're planting the lavender in a pot or container, choose a very large pot — the root system for lavender is much larger than the actual plant., Prepare the soil to receive the lavender and optimize its growing conditions by placing two heaped handfuls of 1"" round stone, along with half a cup (total) of lime, well composted manure and lime meal into the hole. Mix well. Cover this blend with a light layer of soil.The stone will help with drainage, the lime will alkalize the soil, while the bone meal and fertilizer will help to get your lavender plant off to a good start., You should water the lavender plant in the pot you bought it in, at least an hour before planting. This will ensure that the roots are hydrated, but not damp, before going into the soil., Lightly prune your lavender before planting. This will give the plant shape, ensure good air circulation through the stems, encourage new growth, and prevent the center of the stems from becoming woody, which is a common problem with lavender. Good airflow is especially important if you live in a more humid climate., Remove the lavender plant from its nursing pot and gently shake to remove any excess soil from the roots. The lavender should be planted into its new home with bare roots, to ensure it quickly and easily adapts to its new growing environment., Carefully place the lavender plant into its prepared spot and rest it on a layer of soil slightly above the stone blend you mixed earlier. Make sure the roots do not come in direct contact with the blend. Fill in any extra space around and above the lavender's roots with soil, lightly patting it into place around the base of the stems.If you're planting more than one lavender plant, leave about 36 inches (91.4 cm) between each plant. This will guarantee good air circulation and allow the lavender space to grow."

Fertilize the soil once a year.,
Water sparingly.,
Prevent weeds.,
Prune the lavender plant.,
Harvest the flowers.",How to Grow Lavender3," Lavender is a fairly low-maintenance plant and will only need to be fertilized once a year, if that. Use a light top dressing of mixed compost and bone meal, sometime in early spring.An ideal time to fertilize your newly planted lavender is after the first watering. Allow the soil to dry, then apply the fertilizer.

, As mentioned before, dampness is the enemy of lavender and if the roots of the plant become excessively damp, it will kill the plant quicker than any drought or freezing temperatures. In fact, over-watering new lavender plants in spring is the main cause of growth failure. Once the lavender is planted, deeply water it every seven to 10 days.To achieve the proper level of watering, make sure that the soil dries between each watering; however the plant itself should not be allowed to become dehydrated.If you are growing lavender in a Northern climate, you will water the plant very sparingly until the summer, when temperatures can skyrocket and dry out the soil. You will then want to begin watering the plant every seven to 10 days.
If you're growing lavender in a pot, make sure the pot has excellent drainage to prevent water from pooling at the bottom.

, You can prevent weeds from growing around the base of your lavender plant by covering the soil with a thin layer of mulch. Use a light-colored mulch, such as coarse sand, gravel or oyster shells.Mulch will also help to protect the plant's roots from winter frosts.


Do not use wood mulch, which will retain moisture and can lead to root rot.

, You should prune your lavender plant about once a year, preferably in spring before the new growth begins. You should prune about 1/3 – 1/2 of the plant when it shows new spring growth. Use pruning shears or hedge trimmer to achieve a tidy, rounded shape.New growth looks like long, thin legs sprouting from the leafing branches. The plant will also begin to form blooms. This is also a good time to fertilize the plant.
Pruning your lavender will encourage new growth and stop the the plant from breaking open and sprawling.
Just make sure not to over-prune your lavender as this may kill new growth altogether.

, The best time to harvest fresh lavender is when the bottom flowers of each stem are just beginning to open. This is when the lavender is at its most vibrant and fragrant. Cut the flowers at the base of the stems, near the foliage.Prune the plant back to the new growth leaves. This may encourage your plant to bloom a second time, in the fall.
If all or most of the blooms have opened on the lavender plant, then it is too late to harvest for herbal purposes. If you plan to dry the lavender, harvest when about 3/4 of the blooms have opened.
To dry the lavender, bundle about a hundred of the flowers together, tie with a rubber band and hang indoors in a warm, dark and dry location, suspended upside down from a nail, for about 10 to 14 days.If you wish to remove the dried lavender from the woody stems, you can roll the bundle on a metal screen placed over a bucket. This is called ""garbling"" the lavender.
If you want to decorate your house with lavender, place the flowers in a vase, but do not put the roots in water. This just causes the flowers to fall off faster and makes the stems mushy."

Expose the lavender to outdoor conditions slowly.,
Choose a sunny location.,
Prepare the garden soil.,
Transplant the lavender plants 12 to 24 inches (30 1/2 to 61 cm) apart.",How to Grow Lavender from Seed2," Wait until the leaves are ""true leaves,"" or fully matured. At that point, the root system will have grown too large to continue sitting in a shallow tray.

, You no longer have to seed starting mix, but the potting mix you do use should be light. Look for mixes that are made of part soil and part peat, part perlite. Peat moss is endangered; use coir dust instead, if possible. Do not use vermiculite, which may contain asbestos, even when the label doesn't say so.


The pot for each plant should be at least 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Alternatively, you can also use a larger pot or division-free tray and space multiple lavender plants in the tray 2 inches (5 cm) apart from one another.

, Use a small amount of granular slow-release fertilizer that contains balanced proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

, Dig a small hole in the fresh growing media that is about as big as the compartment the lavender presently sits in. Gently pry the lavender out of its original container and transplant it into the new hole, packing the soil around it to keep it firmly fixed in place.

, The plants must reach a height of 3 inches (7.6 cm) before they can be transplanted to their final location, but they should still only have a single stem. This could take anywhere from one to three months.

, Place your pots outdoors in partial shade or partial sun for a few hours at a time. Do this for about one week, just long enough for the lavender to have time to adapt to outdoor conditions.

, Lavender plants do best when grown in partial to full sun. Shaded areas tend to be soggier, and soggy soil can invite fungi that will destroy the plant.

, Chop the soil up with a trowel or digging fork to loosen it and mix in a healthy dose of compost. Compost has uneven particles, creating looser soil and making it easier for roots to stretch out.


Check the soil of the pH after adding compost. The soil pH should rest between 6 and 8, and preferably between 6.5 and 7.5 for best results. If soil pH is too low, mix in agricultural lime. If it is too high, add a small amount of plant litter pine sawdust., Dig a hole that is as deep as the container the plant currently grows in. Remove the plant from its pot, using a garden trowel to carefully slide it out, and plant the lavender into the new hole.

Water the lavender only when dry.,
Avoid chemicals.,
Prune the lavender.,
Mulch during cold weather.",How to Grow Lavender from Seed3," Mature lavender is fairly drought-resistant, but while lavender is within its first year of growth, it needs regular watering. Normal weather conditions often suffice, but if you live in an area that is particularly dry or if you have not received much rain, you should regularly soak the soil. Allow the soil to dry out in between watering, though.

, Herbicides, pesticides, and even fertilizers can kill the beneficial organisms that live in the garden soil and help your lavender to thrive. Skip the fertilizer altogether once planted in the ground. If a pesticide is needed, try an organic pesticide solution that contains no chemicals, since this is less likely to have a negative effect.

, Lavender grows slowly during the first year, and most of the plant's energy goes toward root development and vegetative growth. You should encourage this process by cutting off any flowering stems once the first buds begin to open during the first growing season.


After the first year, cut flowering stems after 1/3 of the buds have opened to encourage further growth. Leave behind at least 1/3 of the new growth.

, Keep the soil warm by applying gravel or bark mulch around the base of the plant, leaving 6 inches (15 1/4 cm) of free space around the stem for air circulation.

Bring your plant indoors during harsh winters.",How to Grow Lantana Plants2," Lantana will grow fairly slowly. Non-creeping varieties usually grow to a height of about 1.5 meters (4.9 ft).


Trailing varieties only grow to about 20 inches (50.8 cm) in height but spread by several feet.

, Lantana prefers a moist but well drained soil in full sun.It will benefit from being fed regularly during the growing season, which occurs in spring and summer.


Lantana prefers to be kept moist even over winter.

, Start by digging the soil over and incorporating some well-rotted manure or compost to enrich the soil and improve drainage. Consider incorporating a slow-release fertilizer.

, Put your Lantana in and fill the hole with soil, pressing it down with your hands. Give the plant a good soak and continue watering the plant twice a week (unless it’s very rainy) until the plant is well established; this usually takes a few months.


Try to water the ground rather than soak the foliage.

, Established Lantana plants don’t require much attention although they will appreciate a feed in the spring.


Don’t over feed them but try to apply a weak liquid feed with a general purpose fertilizer (avoid those high in nitrogen relative to other ingredients) once a month during the growing season.

, Apply a thick layer of mulch when the ground isn’t too cold; this will help conserve moisture and protect the roots. Once a year, remove the old mulch and reapply a fresh layer.

, Cut the top inch or two from the stem tips, always cutting just above a leaf set. Remove any dead or damaged growth.


Give it a good prune in the early spring before it begins growing again; cut it back to within about a foot of the ground,

, Lantana will be affected by a few pests and diseases. Mildew may be a problem if the plants don’t get enough light. Whiteflies and lace bugs may also affect the plant.


Try using a spray insecticide to control these pests if they emerge.

, If you are in a zone cooler than zone 9 (where temperatures drop below 20 degrees Fahrenheit or -6.7 degrees Celsius), you’ll need to bring your plant indoors in the fall. Water it occasionally through the winter.

Give your trailing Lantana lots of light.,
Don’t let your trailing Lantana get too dry.,
Trim your Lantana.,
Prune your Trailing Lantana.",How to Grow Lantana Plants3," Trailing varieties of Lantana are pretty robust and will tolerate drought but do need plenty of light. They will tolerate a small amount of shade for some of the day but you’ll see them grow leggy (with long stems rather than compact bushy growth) and produce fewer blooms if they aren’t getting enough sun and water.


You can encourage bushy growth to make good ground cover by pinching the plant back. To do this, remove the stem tips just above where each stem branches into two stems. This will encourage more side branches to form.

, Although Trailing Lantana tolerates drought, it will bloom better if it doesn’t get too dry.


Water once or twice a week during dry periods.

, Removing spent flowers will encourage new ones to form so don’t be shy about trimming the bush during the growing season. You should try to trim just above a leaf set.

, Every few years the Trailing Lantana may get a little too woody and overgrown. A vigorous prune to within a foot of the base will usually rejuvenate the plant. Do this over the dormant season in winter or early spring.

Lightly prune during the growing season.",How to Grow Lantana Plants4," Lantana benefits from being pruned in the mid-springtime before growth begins. This will improve flowering later in the season.


Avoid pruning in the fall.

, Remove any branches that are crowded or grow over other branches. Cut back the Lantana by about a third of the size of the plant.


Give the plant a liquid feed after pruning.

, During the growing season you should lightly prune your Lantana, as this will encourage new flowering. Take about two inches off each growing tip with a sharp pair of garden scissors. This should encourage new growth.


It’s always a good idea to feed the plant after pruning.

Expect the following characteristics from hyssop:


Grows to a height of about 60cm/ 24 inches
Will be about half as wide as it is tall
Has long-pointed oval leaves of a dark green shade
Blooms with purple or blueish, white or pinkish flowers from midsummer to mid-autumn
Has a strong aroma (stem, flowers and leaves).,
Prepare an area of the ground that gets full sun.,
Dampen the soil prior to planting.

,
Plant hyssop seeds in damp soil in early spring.,
Keep watered and weed-free as the plants grow.,
Keep trimmed.,
In harsh climates, replace after five or so years of growth.,
Pick flowers and young flowering tops of hyssop soon after flowering starts.,
Pick leaves any time during growth.

,
Use hyssop as required.,
Divide the roots in the spring.,
Take stem cuttings from late spring to early autumn (fall).,
Plant in well-draining and moist compost enhanced soil (half sand and half compost is ideal) inside a container.",How to Grow Hyssop,";
, The soil should be light, well drained and with a pH of 6.0 (alkaline).

,, Space the seeds about 30cm apart, or thin out the seedlings later.

, Hyssop needs minimal care but does appreciate a little manure and mixed fertiliser in late winter to encourage new growth.

, To avoid scraggly plants, it is important to trim after it finishes flowering and again in late winter.

, While hyssop can withstand very cold temperatures, if subjected to severe winters, hyssop will likely fail to thrive after several years and will need to be replaced.

, This is when the flowers are at their best.

,, Some suggestions for use include:


Add the flowers to salads, ice cubes or and use as a garnish; use them in place of violets for sugared/candied flowers
Use the leaves in meat dishes, fish dishes and salads; also good in soups, vegetable bakes, fruit salads and with pulses
Use as a companion plant. If grown near cabbages, it may serve as a decoy plant to keep some of the white cabbage butterflies off the cabbages.
Use in potpourri to impart its fragrance; dried leaves and flowers can be used in potpourri.
Make a tea from hyssop for medicinal purposes, such as helping with coughs and improving digestion. Consult reliable herbal remedy books for directions and contra-indications.

, Dig out, divide gently, then replant both the old and the new plants.

,


Pull off a healthy shoot without a flower, along with some of its heel (the woody section of the plant).
Make a clean cut across the base of the heel and strip off the lower leaves using a sharp and clean knife.
Dip in hormone rooting powder.

, Plant it so that the soil reaches almost up to the leaves that have been left on, but leave some stem peeking up.


Keep in a cool spot out of direct sunlight as the cuttings take root.
Mist for the first week or so but don't overdo it.
Expect roots to have formed within a month. They can then be left to grow as usual or replanted in the garden.

Purchase or obtain lovage seeds.,
Choose a suitable area in the garden for planting.,
Sow seeds directly into the garden or place seedlings into the soil.,
Keep the soil moist.,
Fertilize.,
Prune.",How to Grow Lovage," Alternatively, purchase lovage seedlings from your local nursery.


Roots can be divided for propagation after two seasons of growth. This can be done in autumn/fall or spring.;
, Lovage likes full sun or semi-shade. The soil should be moist, rich, and well drained. Lovage requires an alkaline soil.

, Thin or keep seedlings apart at about a distance of 30cm (12"").

, Water lovage well, especially during hot, dry months.

, It is sufficient to fertilize lovage once every spring using a complete plant food.

, The plant can be pruned to make it more bushy; prune off the flowers in summer.

Take a cutting from an herb plant between spring and fall, when the plants are healthy and growing steadily.,
Avoid cuttings on plants that are currently flowering.,
Focus on cuttings from new growth, rather than old growth.,
Avoid cuttings from plants that have been overly fertilized.,
Water herb plants thoroughly at least 12 hours before taking cuttings.",How to Grow Herbs From Cuttings1," Many herbs slow down growth when temperatures begin to drop, so cuttings taken during cooler weather may not root.;
, The cutting is not likely to root strongly while flowering because the plant's energy is focused on the flowers, not the root. If you do take a cutting from an herb that is flowering, remove the flowers from the cutting before propagating.

, The new growth on most herbs is lighter in color and higher up on the plant. The new growth is most likely to root because the stems aren't as hard.

, If a plant has been heavily fertilized to stimulate growth, it is unlikely a cutting will take root. Rather, take cuttings from healthy plants that are growing steadily without the need for excessive fertilizer.

, Well saturated plants are likely to produce healthy cuttings.

"
"
Evaluate what herbs will thrive indoors.,
Determine what quantity of herbs to grow indoors.,
Bring in existing potted herbs for continued winter growth.",How to Grow Herbs Indoors Under Lights1," Not all herbs grow well indoors. Short-lived annuals like coriander, dill and garden cress, do not produce continuous crops and are not well suited for indoor growth.


Consider the following varieties of herbs that will yield healthy plants indoors: Grolau chives (Allium schoenoprasum), Fernleaf or dwarf dill (Anethum graveolens), English mint (Mentha spicata), Greek oregano (Origanum Vulgare hirtum), Blue Boy rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), Creeping savory (Satureja repandra), Broadleaf thyme (Plectranthus amboinicus), Spice Globe basil (Ocimum basilicum minimum) and Dwarf Garden sage (Salvia officinalis compacta).;
, How many herbs you grow should be determined by how much you will use them. If you use rosemary springs in roasted chicken every week or make homemade pesto from basil leaves regularly, you will need larger quantities of those herbs. If you only use a scattering of oregano on an occasional pizza, then 1 plant should suffice.

, Many potted perennial herbs will provide continual harvests throughout the winter when provided with the right growing conditions. Consider bringing in perennial herbs like rosemary, sage and tarragon to grow indoors.


Avoid transplanting perennials herbs planted directly in the garden. The transplant shock may kill the plants that normally would return the next growing season. Only choose perennial herbs in pots to grow indoors during the winter months.

"
"
Prepare your tools.,
Cut the stem.,
Strip the stem.",How to Grow Herbs From Cuttings2," Clean all tools used for cutting with warm soapy water. Sterilize the tools by wiping them with alcohol. The type of tool you use will depend on the plant, but common tools include pruning shears, scissors, razor blades and sharp knives.

, There are several different types of cuttings that can be used to propagate herbs. Determine the type of cutting you desire, and cut the stem accordingly. Regardless of the type, the cut should be at an angle to maximize the cambial tissue exposed to the soil. Cut right below a node, which is a joint or growing point of the stem from which side branches and leaves may grow.


Remove a tip cutting. A tip cutting is removed at the end of a stem. The plant will grow upward and often produces a single vertical stem. A tip cutting is ideal for creating a topiary. To remove a tip cutting, cut about 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm ) from the tip of a stem. The stem can be a main stem of the plant or a healthy side shoot.
Take a sectional cutting. A sectional cutting is from the middle of the stem, so it has 1 cut on each end. Herbs propagated from sectional cuttings typically are bushy because they grow through side shoots. Slice the upper portion of the cutting straight across the stem, and the lower portion of the cutting at an angle. This helps in recognizing the top of the cutting from the bottom. You can take a sectional cutting with a single node, or with several nodes.
Remove a basal cutting. A basal cutting is an entire side shoot that is about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long and typically unbranched. Basal cuttings tend to root quickly because the cutting is younger than the main stem. Basal cuttings typically grow up in direction, similar to a tip cutting. Remove a basal cutting where the side branch meets the main stem.
Take a heel cutting. A heel cutting is a basal cutting with part of the main stem attached. To remove a heel cutting, hold a side shoot where it connects to the main stem, and pull down so that a shallow strip of the tissue from the main stem peels off with the shoot. The tissue from the main stem encourages rooting and is not likely to damage an established plant. Do not take 2 heel cuttings opposite from each another or you may weaken the stem.

, Remove all side shoots and leaves from approximately the lower two-thirds of the stem. Stripping the stem creates a wound at each node, which exposes more cambial tissue and encourages rooting. Removing the leaves and stems also helps to prevent root rot.

"
"
Apply rooting compound.,
Select rooting containers.,
Prepare the rooting medium.,
Prepare the container.,
Stick the cuttings.,
Label the pots and/or flats.",How to Grow Herbs From Cuttings3," Rooting compound, also referred to as rooting hormones, is comprised of synthetic auxins that encourage embryonic root development. Most compounds also include small amounts of fungicide to help prevent disease while the cutting is rooting. The compound is available in a powdered form at most garden centers.


Shake a small amount (about 2 to 3 tablespoons or 30 to 45 ml) of rotting compound onto a paper plate. Dip the lower part of the stem into the compound and then lightly shake off the excess. Apply root compound conservatively; too high of levels may inhibit growth development as the plant matures.

, Cuttings can be rooted in any container with drainage holes. You can root the cuttings in individual pots, or in a flat that contains several 2- or 3-inch (5- or 7.6-cm) cells.

, The rooting medium should provide a mix of moisture and air so that the cutting is supported, but root growth is not restricted. The most popular rooting medium is a mix of garden soil, peat moss, perlite, turface, vermiculite, and hardwood or pine bark. Commercial blends are available at most garden centers.

, Fill the container about three-quarters full of rooting medium. Place the container in a pan of water and let it sit until the top of the rooting medium appears moist. Then allow the container to drain for 10 minutes.

, Poke a hole in the rooting medium a little larger than the stem using a pencil or straw. The pre-formed holes allow the rooting compound to stay on the cutting, rather than being brushed off onto the top of the soil. Then insert, or ""stick"" the cuttings into the rooting medium. The lower parts should be firmly supported by the rooting medium, and should not be touching the bottom of the container.

, If you are planting different kinds of herbs, label each pot or flat with the name of the herb and the planting date.

"
"
Remove stressed foliage.,
Water the cuttings.,
Maintain a moderate temperature.,
Provide indirect sunlight.",How to Grow Herbs From Cuttings4," Because the process of creating new roots causes stress to the cut stem, the existing foliage may rot or dry out. Remove any dried or rotten leaves, and remove any flowers that may form during the rooting process.

, Keep the rooting medium moist at all times. Hand-mist the cuttings several times an hour for the first several days. If you can't hand-mist regularly, create a humid atmosphere around the cuttings with a plastic tent, such as a food storage bag. Be sure the tent does not touch the leaves or they may rot. Commercial propagation boxes also are available at most garden centers.

, Keep the soil temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees F (18.3 and 26.7 degrees C).

, The process of regeneration requires light for photosynthesis. However, direct sunlight will burn the fragile cuttings. Place the cuttings in a north-facing window or provide artificial lighting.

"
"
Transplant the cuttings to a pot or a garden as soon as roots can hold soil.,
Water the plants thoroughly after transplanting.,
Apply a fertilizer.",How to Grow Herbs From Cuttings5," It may take 2 to 7 weeks for the root system to form. The herbs will begin to produce new leaves when the root system is formed. If you lift up on the stem and the soil comes with the plant, it is ready to be transplanted. Roots also may be visible in the drainage holes.

, Water the herbs daily, or even several times a day, after transplanting. Keep the soil around the plant moist.

, The plant may go into shock when transplanted. Lightly apply a one-quarter diluted 20-20-20 fertilizer to the herb. Fertilize less than the recommended amount for the specific herb, and gradually work up to full amount.

"
"
Understand the lighting needs of your herbs.,
Consider fluorescent lighting for your herbs.,
Consider high-intensity discharge (HID) lights.",How to Grow Herbs Indoors Under Lights2," Each type of herb requires different lighting conditions for successful growth. Determine the lighting needs based on the herbs you will be growing indoors. In general, most herbs require 10 to 16 hours of supplemental light.


Evaluate the light intensity required for your herbs. The light intensity will be determined by the bulb wattage of the indoor lights and how close the plant needs to be to the light source. The brightness of an indoor light is measured in foot candles or lumens. Foot candles refers to the amount of light hitting a given area, while lumens is the amount of light at the actual light source. Most herbs and vegetable plants require a high light intensity to yield a harvest.
Evaluate the light spectrum color best suited for your herbs. Natural sunlight contains a complete light spectrum, from red to yellow to violet. While herbs require a full color spectrum for photosynthesis, blue and red light are most critical. Blue light regulates plant growth, while red light stimulates flowering and vegetative growth.

, Fluorescent tubes are a low intensity lighting option ideal for herbs. Fluorescent lighting provides 60 to 80 lumens per watt, which is 2 to 3 times more light than incandescent bulbs. At a distance of 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the bulbs, fluorescents provide 700 foot (213.4 m) candles; at a distance of 12 inches (30.5 cm) away, they provide 450 foot (137.2 m) candles.


Choose full-spectrum fluorescent lighting that most closely mimics natural light. The light color is created by a phosphor coating on the inside of the bulb. If full-spectrum natural light tubes are not available, use a combination of standard warm- and cool-white tubes.
Place herbs close to the fluorescent lighting source, preferably no more than 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the tube, to accommodate for the lower intensity lighting.
Select fluorescent lighting as the least expensive option for indoor gardening.

, Most commercial herb producers utilize HID lamps to grow herbs indoors. They typically produce 2 times more light than incandescent or fluorescent bulbs. HID lighting provides 120 to 130 lumens per watt, and is available in 150-watt to 1,000-watt bulbs. At a distance of 3 feet (.9 m) away from the bulbs, 400-watt HID lights provide 1,000 foot (304.8 m) candles and can illuminate about 25 square feet (7.6 square meters).


Choose metal halide or high-pressure sodium HID lights. Metal halide HID lights give off a bluish-white light that promotes strong plant growth. High-pressure sodium lamps are the most energy efficient HID lighting option, and give off a reddish light.
Place herbs several feet or meters away from the HID lighting source to ensure the lights don't burn the vegetation.
Choose HID lights for energy-efficient lighting.

"
"
Select a location to grow herbs indoors.,
Provide adequate lighting.,
Grow herbs in proper soil.,
Water herbs regularly.,
Fertilize herbs.,
Cultivate herbs.",How to Grow Herbs Indoors Under Lights3," When using indoor lights, you can grow herbs in almost any location in your home. The most important factor is temperature. Herbs grow best in temperatures below 70 degrees F (21.1 degrees C). Do not locate the herbs near a heat source, such as a heat vent or radiator.


Consider the humidity. Herbs require ample humidity to promote growth. If the air in your home is dry, place the herb containers in a tray lined with small stones. Fill the tray with enough water to reach the bottom of each container. The water will provide a humid environment ideal for growing herbs.

, The intensity of your light source will determine how much light is required for your herbs each day. In general, most herbs need 10 to 16 hours of supplemental light.


Maintain proper distance between the herbs and the light source. The distance will vary depending on the type of light source you utilize. To determine if the light source is too close, place your hand where the light hits the herb plant. If you feel warmth from the light, it is too close.
Rotate the plants each week if you use fluorescent indoor lighting. Fluorescent bulbs are more intense at the center than at the ends, so rotate the plants weekly to ensure even light coverage.

, Most herbs thrive in soils with pH levels between 6 and 7. To improve drainage, plant herbs in a compost-based soil mixed with sand, peat moss or perlite.

, After the initial planting, water herbs when the soil feels dry. Water thoroughly until you see water coming out of the bottom of the pot. Do not overwater indoor herbs, or the plants may become waterlogged, yellowish or develop mildew diseases.

, Most indoor herbs benefit from occasional feeding with an all-purpose water soluble fertilizer, fish emulsion or seaweed. In general, fertilize herbs every 2 weeks and follow the instructions based on the fertilizer type. Only feed plants when they are actively growing and do not over-fertilize. Too much fertilize may kill the herb plants.

, To promote continued growth and longevity, harvest the herbs regularly. Trim back all plants to prevent flowering. Once the herb flowers, its energy will go toward flower production, rather than plant growth, which will shorten its life.

Soak the seeds in water for a few hours, or even overnight, before planting them.,
Assemble the soil and containers for growing the seeds in.,
Sow the herb seeds 1-3 times deeper than the size of the seed.,
Remove the plastic once the seedlings emerge.,
Transplant the plants by pinching off the lower set of leaves.,
Finished.

",How to Grow Herb Gardens from Seed,";
, Poke holes in the bottom of your containers for drainage. Fill containers full with a soil mixture. Pat down the soil to be sure there are no air pockets or your seeds might drop right to the bottom.

, Very tiny seeds need only to be pressed into the soil. Water the seeds and cover the containers with plastic kitchen wrap. This will keep the soil warm and eliminate the need to water until the seedlings emerge. Place flats in a warm, sunny area. Until the seeds emerge, keep the soil damp.

, If you plan to transfer your seedlings to the garden, wait until at least two sets of leaves have emerged. Once it is warm enough, start leaving them outside a few hours a day. This will ""harden them off"" and get them ready for the harsher outdoor conditions. Water well.

, Dig a hole deep enough to hold the plant just over the point where you pinched the leaves. These leaf nodes will grow roots. Gently turn the pot upside down and allow the plant to fall out into your hand. Don't pull the plant by the stem or leaves. Place the plant in hole and pat soil around your plant. Water once daily for a week and twice weekly thereafter. When the plants begin to get bushy, add mulch around them to discourage weeds.

Select your herb pots.,
Fill large pots partway with lightweight material, such as wine corks or Styrofoam.,
Buy good potting soil.,
Add organic fertilizer to your potting soil and mix it well in a large flower pot or other container.,
Fill your planter almost to the top of the pot with the fertilized potting soil.

,
Plant herb seeds or transplant herbs you have purchased from a store.,
Thoroughly, but gently, water your herbs.,
Place your herb pots in a sunny window that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight every day.",How to Grow Herbs in Pots," Make sure the pots have drainage holes in the bottom and that they have a diameter of at least 8” (<<). Your herbs can become root bound if you plant them in too small a container. Choose lightweight pots because you may have to move them around occasionally. It’s also safer to use lightweight pots if you plan to use some of them in hanging baskets.;
, You can also place a medium-sized empty plastic pot upside down in the center of a large pot. “Filling” your pot partway will reduce the amount of soil you need. Too much soil will cause your herbs to spend their energy on developing a root system instead of producing leaves.

, Using dirt from your garden may introduce pests into your home and the pests might destroy your herbs, and garden soil is usually quite dense and won’t drain well.

, The soil in potted plants dries out quickly; depleting the nutrients, so mixing in organic fertilizer will help keep your herbs healthy.

,,


Follow the seed package directions to make sure you have the right depth and spacing for each type of herb seed.
For transplants, make a hole deep enough to contain the roots of the herb.






Place the plant in the hole and firmly tamp down the soil around it.

, Make sure each pot sits in a tray or shallow bowl so that the drainage water doesn’t damage anything.

, Sunlight is the magic ingredient that helps herbs manufacture their essential oils. If your herbs don’t get enough sunlight, you must supplement the natural light with grow lights or fluorescent lamps.

, Horehound will grow in poor soils but if the soil is rich, it will grow more vigorously and last longer.

, Cover barely.

,, Regular watering after this is not necessary; the plants will fend well for themselves.

, Remove any scraggly ones (you'll get plenty of vigorous growers).

, After a year's growth, cut the horehound back by half. Remove the flowers to avoid self-seeding, as this plant can get away from you!

Buy hop rhizomes.,
Choose a place to plant the hops.,
Get the planting bed ready.",How to Grow Hops for Brewing Beer1," Hop plants are grown from hop rhizomes, pieces of a hop plant that sprout into a new plant. Rhizomes are available early in the spring, when hop farmers dig them up and sell them to suppliers. Order rhizomes online or check with your local nursery. Plan to plant them in late spring, after the last frost.


Conduct research to decide what variety of rhizomes to buy. Hops affect the flavor of beer. Do you plan to brew a light, citrusy beer, or perhaps one that's woodsy or floral? Choose a variety that fits with the type of beer you want to create.
When your hops arrive, wrap them in damp paper towels and store them in the refrigerator to keep them from drying out until you're ready to plant them.;
, Scout out an area in your yard that gets at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight every day. In addition to needing a lot of sun, hops require the following conditions to thrive:


Plenty of vertical space. Hops grow on vines that stretch 25 feet (7.6 m) or longer into the air. You can choose a planting spot near your house, so you'll be able to lean a tall trellis against the roof. If you'd rather not use your roof to prop up the bines, the trellis can instead be propped against a sturdy pole or another structure close to the garden.
Well-drained soil. Choose a spot that has good drainage; if you often see water standing over an area after a heavy rain, that means the soil there doesn't drain well.

, Measure out the area where you want to plant the hops, and use a garden rake and hoe or a soil tiller to break up the soil. It should be loose, with no large clumps or dense spots. Remove stones and sticks from the area and pull out any weeds by the root.


Fertilize the soil by raking in some manure, bone meal, blood meal or compost tea. These help plants grow healthy and strong by enriching soil with nutrients it lacks.
Make sure the soil is loose and fertilized to a depth of at least one foot.

"
"
Mound the soil.,
Plant the hops.,
Train the bines.,
Trim the bines.,
Care for the plants.",How to Grow Hops for Brewing Beer2," Create one mound for each rhizome you will be planting. The mounds should be spaced about 3 feet (0.9 m) apart, so the hops have plenty of room to grow.

, Dig a 4-inch hole in each mound. Plant the rhizomes horizontally, with the root side down. Mound soil over the rhizomes and loosely pack it down, then cover with straw or a light mulch to inhibit weed growth. Keep the soil consistently moist until the hops begin to sprout.

, When the hops emerge and grow about 6 inches (15.2 cm), they need to be ""trained"" around the trellis you are using to help them grow vertically. Place the trellis near the plants and gently wrap them around its base.


Continue training the hops for a few days. After awhile, they'll begin growing clockwise around the trellis on their own.
If some of the shoots that sprout look damaged or weak, remove them, rather than allowing them to take up space on the trellis. Each rhizome should produce between 4 and 6 healthy vines.

, After a few months of growth, trim the leaves off the bottom 4 feet (1.2 m) of the bines. This prevents the plants from getting damaged by diseases or fungus that may be present in the soil.

, As the vines begin to grow tall and strong, keep the soil around them weeded. Water the hops every day so that the soil stays moist, but not drenched. Continue caring for the hops in this way until late summer, when it's time to harvest them.

"
"
Examine the cones.,
Pick the ripe hop cones.,
Dry the hops.,
Store the hops.",How to Grow Hops for Brewing Beer3," In the late summer, when it's time to harvest the hops, examine the cones on the bines to see if they are mature. Hope cones are ripe when they're dry and papery, aromatic, springy, and filled with yellow lupulin powder. Test one by cracking it open to see if it is ripe.


Hop cones that are heavy and green aren't ready yet. Be patient; your hops might not ripen until early fall.
Don't leave cones on the vine until they turn brown.

, Gently twist off the ripe hop cones as they ripen. Some will ripen more quickly than others, so leave the ones that still need time.


You can use a ladder to pick the hop cones that are out of reach.
If it seems that all the hops are ripening at once, and you prefer not to use a ladder, cut the bines at their bases. Lay them flat and pull off the cones.

, Place ripe hops on a flat surface away from sunlight. Make sure they are only a single layer deep. Turn on a fan and let it blow over the hops for a few hours. Flip them over and continue drying them on the other side. Continue drying and flipping the hops until there is no moisture left on their surface.


You may also store your hops in a paper bag in a cool, dark and dry place to let them dry out over the course of a few weeks.
Check home-brewing websites for hop-drying kits that make the process faster.

, Hops should be stored in airtight food storage bags in the refrigerator. If you won't be using them for awhile, you can freeze them.

"
"
Cut back the bines.,
Revive the hop plants in spring.",How to Grow Hops for Brewing Beer4," When the harvest is over, cut them back to about 3 feet (0.9 m). The first frost will kill them, after which you can trim them back further and cover them with a tarp or other protective cover for the rest of the winter.

, Use a shovel to uncover the rhizomes and trim back the roots on each one. Fertilize the soil around them and mound it loosely into 1-foot hills. Add a layer of mulch and moisten the soil with water until the hop plants sprout once more.

Choose herbs to grow.,
Decide where to grow the herbs.,
Get potting soil.",How to Grow Herbs1," What herbs do you like to use in your cooking? When choosing what herbs to grow, start by thinking about your own preferences. Since herbs are easy and fun to grow, you might want to try your hand at growing an herb or two that you wouldn't normally buy at the grocery store. When you have a few in mind, buy packets of seeds at your local nursery or online.



Basil, dill, sage, rosemary, thyme, oregano and mint are wonderful herbs that are used in many cuisines. If you'd like to grow a variety of herbs, these would make a good foundation for an herb garden. You can also grow an herbal tea garden.
If you're planning on growing your herbs outside, you'll need to take your region's climate and soil properties into account. Determine what regional growing zone you fall into and make sure the herbs you pick out are able to thrive in your area.





;
, Herbs are easy to grow both outdoors and indoors. You can also choose between planting them directly in the ground or in a growing container. Most herbs need plenty of direct sunlight, so choose a spot that isn't shaded.


If you're growing herbs as part of your vegetable garden, plant to separate the herbs from the vegetables with about 6–12 inches (15.2–30.5 cm) of space.






You can grow herbs in separate pots, or buy a large pot and grow several types of herbs together.







, Soil composition is an important factor for successful herb gardening. Herbs thrive in a somewhat neutral pH (between 6.5 and 7), but soil need not be especially fertile. In fact, if it is too rich, growth will be rampant and flavor, diluted. More important than fertility is drainage. The soil should be loose and crumbly so that it drains well.


If you're starting your herbs from seed, look for a seed starter potting soil that has not been enriched with extra nutrients, since seeds contain the nutrition they need to sprout and take root.For older seedlings, choose potting soil that hasn't been treated with pesticides.
You can mix commercial soil with compost to help the herbs grow strong and healthy."
"
Start in early spring.,
Prepare seed containers.,
Soak the seeds.,
Plant the seeds.,
Thin the seedlings.",How to Grow Herbs2," The best time to start seeds is when temperatures are still cool and the growing season has yet to get underway. This gives the seeds time to sprout and become established; they should be ready for planting when the temperature begins to rise.

, Herb seeds can be started in any type of small container, like an old egg carton, yogurt cups, or containers available for purchase at the nursery. Label the containers so you'll know what seeds you're planting in which. Fill each one with potting soil, then dampen the soil with a bit of water. Place the containers in a sunny area with a steady temperature around 70 degrees. At this early stage the seeds should not get hours of direct sunlight, or they may overheat.


Even if you plan to grow your herbs outdoors, it's easier to start the seeds inside, where you can control the water and temperature.
Most herbs need a humid environment to germinate. If you live in an area where the air is very dry, cover the seed pots lightly with plastic wrap. Don't wrap them too tightly, though - the seeds need air flow to germinate.

, This step helps to get the seeds ready to germinate. Place the seeds in an even layer between two damp paper towels. Let them soak for about 4 hours on the day you are going to plant them., Check the seed packages to determine how each type of herb should be planted. Some just need to be scattered evenly across the surface of the soil, while others won't germinate unless they are buried under the surface. Over the next few weeks, the seeds will germinate and begin to sprout and grow leaves. Keep the temperature and sunlight steady, and make sure the soil never gets the chance to dry out.

, Once the seedlings have grown leaves, you'll need to remove some of them from the pots so that the stronger ones have room to grow. Take out the less developed seedlings and leave about an inch of space between the remaining plants."
"
Prepare the planting bed.,
Plant the seedlings.,
Care for the herbs.",How to Grow Herbs3," Use a garden rake to loosen the dirt and rake in the soil mixture you purchased for the herbs to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2 cm). Sprinkle water over the soil to moisten it. Dig holes several inches apart in preparation for planting the herbs.


If you're planting the herbs in pots, determine how many will fit in each one. Many herbs get quite large as they grow, so you may not want to plant more than 2 - 3 seedlings in each container.
You can add a bit of fertilizer to the soil, but again, don't over-fertilize or the herbs won't thrive.

, The herbs are ready to plant when they are well-established and have sprouted several mature leaves. Plant them when outdoor temperatures are above 50 degrees, and the chance of frost is gone. Carefully lift the seedlings from the pots, loosen their roots, and plant them in the ground. Pat soil around the base of the stems, then dampen the area with water.


If you're planting the herbs outside, it's a good idea to transition them to outdoor temperatures by allowing them to ""harden off"" in a garage or other covered outdoor space for a few days before you plant them in the ground.

, How that the herbs are established, you have only to care for them by making sure they consistently get enough sunlight and water. Pay attention to the moisture level of the soil, and never let it get dried out. Your herbs will grow healthy and strong, and soon it will be time to harvest them.

Garlic grows well in a wide range of climates. It does less well in areas of high heat or humidity, or where there is a lot of rainfall.
;
, Garlic needs a lot of full sun, but it might tolerate partial shade provided it's not for very long during the day or growing season. The soil must be well dug over and crumbly. Sandy loam is best.









Before adding nutrients to your soil, you should know what is already there. If you haven't done a soil test, contact your local county extension office for a soil sampling kit.Ensure that the soil has good drainage. Clay-based soils are not good for planting garlic.
Use compost and manure to add nutrients to the soil before planting the garlic.

, Garlic is grown by planting the cloves — called seeds for our purposes — so to get started all you need to do is buy fresh garlic. Choose garlic from a store, or even better, a farm stand or the local farmers market. It's very important that the garlic bulbs chosen are fresh and of high quality. If you can, choose organic garlic so that you avoid garlic that has been sprayed with chemicals.









Choose fresh garlic bulbs with large cloves. Avoid garlic that has become soft.
Each clove will sprout into a garlic plant, so keep that in mind when you're figuring out how many heads to buy.
If you have some garlic at home that has sprouted, that's great to use.
Nurseries also offer garlic bulbs for planting. Visit a nursery if you want to get a specific variety or to get advice on local conditions for garlic.
Mail-order catalogs and online seed stores offer many types of garlic and will include specific planting instructions for the type of seed you buy.


, Be careful not to damage the cloves at their base, where they attach to the garlic plate. If the base is damaged, the garlic will not grow.









Plant the larger cloves. The smaller cloves take up just as much space in the planting bed, but they produce much smaller bulbs.


, Point the tips upward and plant the cloves about 2 inches (5cm) deep.









The cloves should be spaced about 8 inches (20cm) apart for best growing conditions.


, Suitable toppings include hay, dry leaves, straw, compost, well rotted manure, or well rotted grass clippings.








, The planted garlic needs a complete fertilizer at the time of planting.









Fertilize again in the spring if you are planting your garlic in the fall, or in the fall if you're planting it in the spring.

, Newly planted garlic needs to be kept moist to help the roots to develop. Don't overdo the water, however, as garlic does not grow well, or may even rot, if sodden during cold months.









Water deeply once a week if rain has not fallen. Watering garlic is not necessary unless there is a drought, in which case water sparingly, as garlic hates wet soil.
Reduce the watering gradually as the season warms up. The garlic needs a hot, dry summer to allow the bulbs to mature.

, Insects, mice, and other creatures may come to eat the garlic or make a nest among the plants. Beware the following pests:









Aphids seem to enjoy garlic leaves, and the flower buds. They're easy to get rid of — simply rub your fingers over them and squash them or apply a
Many people tend to plant garlic underneath roses to deter aphids; the roses benefit from the aphids being drawn away.
Mice and other small creatures sometimes nest in mulch. If you have a problem with mice in your area, consider using plastic mulch or landscaping fabric.

, As the garlic plants begin to grow, long green stalks called scapes will emerge. Pull off a few scapes and eat them if you wish. The best part of the scape is the young, tender shoot.









This may damage the garlic bulbs themselves, so don't do it to every plant.
Use gloves when pulling off scapes; otherwise your hands will smell of garlic for days.


, Garlic bulbs are ready to be harvested when you can feel the individual cloves in the bulb, and the leaves turn yellow or brown.









Once the scapes start to dry, it is important to harvest the garlic or the head will ""shatter"" and divide into the individual cloves.
Begin harvesting at the end of the summer. Harvesting can continue well into autumn in most places.
Some warm climates may enable earlier harvesting of garlic.

, Pull the bulbs out of the ground. If using a fork, be careful not to stab the bulbs underground.









Be careful with the digging process, since garlic tends to bruise easily.
The plants should be kept complete and unwashed, and hung up to ""cure"" for two weeks. The ideal temperature is 80°F (26.7°C) for curing. Once cured, the outer flaky layers of the bulb can be brushed off, leaving clean skin below. Trim the tops and the roots, and store in a cool, dry place.
Washing garlic will prolong the curing process and potentially cause it to rot. Also, if the garlic is not cured, it will rot quickly in the pantry.

, Dried bulbs can be kept in a garlic keeper (usually made from pottery), and individual cloves can be pulled off as needed.








, The dried leaves can be kept back and plaited or braided into a strand, from which you can hang the garlic bulbs in your pantry or kitchen. This is both decorative and useful.








, Garlic cloves can be kept in oil or vinegar. However, to avoid the potential for bacterial growth, keep in the refrigerator and consume quickly.









WARNING: Extreme care must be taken when preparing flavored oils with garlic or when storing garlic in oil. Do not store garlic in oil at room temperature. Garlic-in-oil mixtures stored at room temperature provide perfect conditions for producing botulism toxin (low acidity, no free oxygen in the oil, and warm temperatures). The same hazard exists for roasted garlic stored in oil.

Keep an eye out for signs that your ginger plant is in trouble.,
Wait until the plant has been growing for several months.,
Push the soil aside to find some ginger rhizomes and cut some off.,
Recover the rhizomes with soil.",How to Grow Ginger Indoors," For a ginger plant, it’s best to use a wide, fairly shallow pot. That’s because the plant’s roots grow horizontally rather than vertically.A pot that's approximately 12-inches (30-cm) wide and 12-inches (30-cm) deep is usually a good option for ginger.
Make sure that your pot also has good drainage holes so the roots don’t become waterlogged.
You should have a fairly deep saucer to place underneath the pot to catch the water that drains.;
, Once you’ve selected your pot, add potting soil to it. It’s important to choose a soil that drains well so the ginger’s roots remain healthy.Look for a potting soil that contains sand, which provides air space that helps the water drain out more easily. Perlite and vermiculite also help create air space for better drainage, so you can use soil mixes that contains those ingredients as well.
An all-purpose soil-free mix is also good for ginger plants because it contains a high amount of organic material, such as peat, but also features sand, perlite, vermiculite, or a combination of all three that helps the soil drain effectively.

, To grow ginger in a container indoors, you need a living ginger root. You can purchase one from a garden supply store, nursery, or seed company. If you have a friend or neighbor with a ginger plant, you can also ask for a root cutting.Make sure that the ginger root that you choose is plump and firm. Its skin should be tight with several eye buds on it.
Eye buds are similar to the eyes that you’d find on potato.

, When you’ve gotten a ginger root, fill a small bowl with warm water. Place the root in the water, and allow it to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight.Soaking the root helps stimulate germination, which is particularly important if you’re using a store bought root.

, After you’ve filled your pot, stick the ginger root in the soil. Make sure that the root’s eye buds are pointing upwards when you set it in the pot.If you’re planting more than one root in your pot, you should place them at least 6- to 8-inches (15- to 20-cm) apart so they have adequate room to grow.

, When the root is in the pot, place 1- to 2-inches (2.5- to 5-cm) of soil over it. The entire root should be covered by the soil., You want to ensure that the root has sufficient water to grow. Fill a watering can with water and add enough water to the soil to thoroughly wet it. While you want the soil to be watered well, you don’t want to oversaturate it. Make sure that all of the water is fully absorbed so there aren’t any puddles on the surface., To grow a healthy ginger plant, you want to keep the pot in a warm area of your home. However, choose a location that doesn’t receive a great deal of direct sunlight because sun exposure can turn the ginger green.The ideal temperature for the area where you keep the ginger plant is 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 32 degrees Celsius). Make sure that temperature is maintained even overnight.

, It’s important not to overwater the ginger as it grows, but its soil needs to remain moist. Fill a spray bottle with water, and lightly mist the soil daily.If you prefer, you can lightly water the soil with a watering can twice a week instead of misting it daily.

, To ensure that the roots are kept warm and protect the plant from sun exposure, you should mix some rich compost into the pot regularly. Sprinkle 3- to 4-inches (8- to 10-cm) over the top of the soil once a month.You can purchase compost from your local garden supply center or home improvement store.
Look for compost that's identified as multipurpose or potting compost. Those are typically the best options for potted plants.

, When a ginger plant doesn't receive the proper amount of water and sunlight, it will show signs that it isn't healthy. Pay attention to the color and texture of the plant's leaves, so you can correct issues as soon as they occur.If the plant's leaves become yellow, it's usually a sign that you're overwatering it or the soil isn't draining properly. Cut back on how often you water the plant and check the pot's drainage holes to ensure that they're not blocked.
If the leaves begin to look dry or scorched, it usually indicates that the plant is receiving too much direct sunlight. Move the plant to an area where it doesn't receive direct sunlight and prune away the affected leaves.
If the leaves develop brown tips, it's usually a sign that you're applying too much compost or fertilizer. Only apply compost once a month.

, Ginger grows fairly slowly compared to other herbs. Two to three weeks after planting, you should start to see shoots coming up through the soil, but it won’t be ready for harvesting until three to four months after the shoots emerge.You can usually tell that the ginger is ready to harvest when the stems above the soil are approximately 3- to 5-inches (8- to 13-cm) tall.

, When you’re ready to harvest, use your fingers to push some of the soil aside at the edge of the pot. Find a ginger rhizome, which is the underground part of the root that grows continuously, and use a small knife to cut off a piece of the ginger., After you’ve finished cutting off some of the ginger, replace the rhizomes in the soil. Make sure that they’re fully covered with soil so they’ll continue to grow.Continue misting the soil with water daily and adding compost to the pot monthly to keep the plant growing.

Choose a fennel variety.,
Plant the fennel outdoors.,
Plant the fennel indoors.,
Care for the fennel.,
Harvest the fennel leaves.,
Harvest the bulb.,
Harvest the fennel seeds.,
Leave the fennel to grow as a perennial.",How to Grow Fennel," The type of fennel you choose to grow will depend on what part of the fennel plant you wish to use -- the bulb, the fronds or the seeds.



Florence Fennel is grown for its bulbous stem, which can be eaten raw, grilled or baked. It is also possible to eat the thicker stalks which sprout from the bulb, as they are similar to celery.

Herb fennel does not produce the same bulbous stem. It is grown for its delicate leaves, which are used as a herb. Herb fennel also produces seeds which have a licorice-like flavor (as does the rest of the plant) and are used for seasoning.;
, The process for planting both varieties of fennel is the same. The seeds should be planted directly into the garden, around the time of the last spring frost.


Plant the fennel seeds in fertile, well drained soil. If necessary, loosen the soil a little before planting and add in some compost and a little soil for drainage.
Plant the seeds approximately ten inches apart and cover them with a light layer of soil, about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) deep. It's probably a good idea to plant a few more seeds than you need, then thin them out later.
Plant the fennel far away from any dill or coriander -- these plants tend to cross-pollinate, which reduces seed production and affects the taste.You can use an almanac to determine when the last frost typically occurs in your area., If you prefer, you can plant the fennel seeds in containers approximately 4 weeks before the last spring frost.


Once the seedlings have grown to height of 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm), you can harden them off in a cool greenhouse or cold frame before transplanting them to the garden.
Alternatively, you can keep the fennel in a container. As fennel is a deep-rooted plant, it will require a container at last 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep, filled with light soil with some added gravel for drainage.
If you plant more than one fennel plant in a container of this size, it will be too crowded to produce a large bulb, but you will still be able to enjoy the leaves and seeds.

, Fennel grows best in full-sun. At first, you should water it regularly to keep the soil moist. Once it has established itself, you may only need to water it if there is a drought. Be careful not to overwater, as this may cause the roots to rot. There is no need to fertilize the soil during growing season.


Once the bulb begins to form at the base of the stem, hill up the surrounding soil to cover it. This shades it from the sun and prevents it from turning green. This is known as ""blanching"", as it keeps the bulb white and sweet (which is only necessary if you intend to eat the bulb).Fennel is not usually affected by pests or disease, but occasionally you will spot aphids or whiteflies on the leaves. If so, you can use a pyrethrin-based insecticidal soap to get rid of them.

, You can start harvesting the fennel leaves once the plant becomes well-established.


Don't take too many leaves at once though, or you might harm the plant.
The fennel leaves can be used to add an aromatic, anise or licorice flavor to soups, salads and other Mediterranean-style diets.
If you use fennel regularly, try planting multiple plants. Harvest one plant a week, but remember to keep watering and fertilizing the plant after harvest.

, Florence fennel bulbs can be harvested once they reach the size of a small tennis ball, usually in late summer/early autumn.


To harvest, cut the fennel below the bulb at the soil line. Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator for several days.
Fennel bulbs will survive a frost or two, so there is no rush to harvest them as soon as the weather turns cold. However, you shouldn't allow the fennel bulb to grow too large, or it will turn bitter.

, Fennel seeds can be harvested as soon as they're ripe and the plant's flowers have turned brown.


The seeds are very loose, so the best way to collect them is to place a large bowl or sheet underneath the plant and shake the seed head. Alternatively, you can wrap the seed heads with cheesecloth while you're cutting the stalks and remove the seeds later.
Allow the seeds to dry completely, then store them in a cool, dark place in an airtight container. They will keep for up to six months.

, Fennel grows as a hardy perennial between USDA hardiness zones 5 and 10. It self-sows very easily, so if it has bloomed once, the seeds will have likely fallen to the ground, allowing it to re-emerge the following spring.


Every spring, you should fertilize your fennel patch with a standard fertilizer, or nourish the soil with some fresh (preferably homemade) compost.
However, in northern zones (or areas where winter temperatures regularly drop below 15 degrees F/ -10 degrees C) fennel should be treated as an annual and will need to be replanted each spring.

Wait a full season or two before harvesting your homegrown ginger for culinary purposes.",How to Grow Ginger in Your Garden," A number of online retailers sell this perennial as a plant, but it can easily be started from a root-like tuber known as a rhizome. Gardeners who plan on starting their own plant should select an organic rhizome or one that has been obtained from their local health food store.


These are less likely to have been sprayed with chemicals (GMO, antibiotics...) that will keep them from sprouting and limit one’s success. If gardeners suspect this could be the case, they will need to soak their rhizome for a few hours in lukewarm water to remove the chemicals.
Choose plump, healthy pieces that have greenish eye spots that sort of resemble roots on their nodules for best results.;
, The entire root can be planted as it is or gardeners may choose to cut their rhizome into pieces measuring between 1 and 2 inches long, each of which should have an eye of its own.

, Culinary gingers can be started indoors in cooler climates and gradually moved outside full time when temperatures consistently reach above 50 °F (10 °C).


Gardeners in warmer areas may choose to sit their pots outside in the spring instead. These plants will sprout on their own, but it may take them longer to get started than those started indoors.

, Ginger grows perfectly fine in ordinary potting soil and also in most yards. However, if drainage is a problem in one’s yard, sand can be added for better results.

, These plants reach anywhere from two to four feet in height and should be grown in dappled sunlight, which mimics their native environment.


Culinary ginger will also perform well if it has bright sunshine in the morning and bright, dappled shade in the evening.
Growing ginger in full sun can cause the plants to struggle and the leaves to turn brown at the tips.

, If you are growing these plants in containers, it is best to use a large plastic pot. This will allow the edible rhizome to reach a much larger size than it would have otherwise done in a smaller container.


Using plastic pots helps hold in moisture, which in turn causes the root to become plumper.

, These perennials should be watered regularly and not allowed to dry out completely, because they like damp soil. Do not stop watering the plant until the leaves have died back.


Until this point, the ginger specimen should be watered just enough to keep the soil from completely drying out.

, This plant is largely resistant to humidity as well as insect pests and diseases.

, As with most plants, ginger benefits from light applications of fertilizer during the growing season. It can also be watered with spoiled milk to improve the nutrient quality of the soil and increase the plumpness of the rhizomes.

, Ginger goes dormant during the cooler months, even in its native habitat. Gardeners should be aware of this fact and not get stressed out if their plant dies back to the roots.


During the dormancy period, rhizomes can be left in their containers in a location where the temperature will not drop below 50 °F (10 °C).
Alternatively, the dormant rhizomes can be dug up and stored in a warm location. This method is ideal for gardeners that wish to recycle the same pots for winter growing or if their specimens are in areas where winter temperatures may result in the death of the plant.

, This allows the rhizome plenty of time to fatten up before being used. If one wants fresh ginger before that point, small portions can be sliced off using a handheld spade.


This is another good reason to grow these plants in plastic containers because gardening implements and terracotta pots don’t mix well.

, You could get this from a plant nursery or from a neighbor's garden. The planted parts of the garlic bulb are called ""cloves"". The whole garlic is the bulb.









You may want to get the garlic bulbs from a gardening supply store, since many supermarket bulbs are chemically treated to prevent sprouting and will not grow well.

,, It should be a 3 to 1 ratio of soil to sand.








,, Hold the cloves with the flat end (the bottom) facing down and the pointed end facing up.








, There should be 1 inch (2.54 cm) of soil between the top of the clove and the top of the soil.








,, A great place to store the pot is on a kitchen windowsill.








, Water the soil by sprinkling it evenly with water. Allow it to drain through the holes in the bottom of the pot.

Decide which herbs to plant.,
Consider whether you want a perennial, annual, or biennial herb.,
Buy seeds or starts – or grow a cutting.,
Research the individual needs of any herbs that you are considering.,
Don't over-water or under-water.,
When harvesting, always cut back to a leaf or stem.,
Split the plant or grow a cutting to increase production.",How to Grow Fresh Herbs1," Some herbs are eaten after they have been dried, while others are typically used fresh-picked from the plant. These ""fresh"" herbs include basil, chives, mint, tarragon, and rosemary. You can plant herbs in a sunny spot of your garden, or you can grow them in a pot near a window in your kitchen.This guide will focus on basil, chives, and mint. Consider the benefits of growing each herb:


Grow basil. Basil is a fast-growing herb, so you may need to sow it more frequently to ensure a fresh supply. It is, however, a versatile plant that is great for a first experiment into herb-growing. Basil needs well-drained soil and a good deal of sunshine.Grow chives. This small, grass-like herb is often added to soups, salads, and sauces; it's prized for its light flavor and aesthetic appeal. Chives need a lot of sunlight and soil with good drainage. Consider planting chives in your garden to repel carrot flies, Japanese beetles, and aphids.
Grow mint. Mint is a fast-growing, fast-spreading herb. It's a hardy plant, and it's perfect for one of your first attempts at growing plants. Mint grows best in damp, fertile soil with full sun or partial shade. You can use the leaves to spice up fruit salads, lamb and fish dishes, and even drinks like teas and cocktails.;
, Annual and biennial herbs such as basil, coriander, parsley, dill, and chervil are fast-growing, and you may need to sow them at intervals throughout spring and summer to ensure a continuous fresh supply. Perennial herbs like oregano, mint, thyme, sage, rosemary, and chives are slower to grow, and thus require a more permanent home.

, You can buy herb seeds and grow them from scratch, and you can buy already-growing potted plants. You can also raise most herbs from a small cutting of a mature plant. Visit a local nursery for seeds and starts.


If you want to grow from a cutting, try mint because it's one of the easiest to grow using this method.

, Find out how much water a given plant needs, how much light it needs, and its preferred temperature. They may also have specific needs in relation to the pH, the texture, and the humidity of the soil.

, Over-watering and under-watering are common causes of poor plant health. As a general rule of thumb, let the top of the soil dry out between waterings, but don't let the soil dry fully. You should fall into a routine as you become attuned to your plants.


Check by pushing your finger into the soil. If it's still moist beneath the surface, it can go a while longer. If it's completely dry, immediately give it a thorough watering.
Keep in mind that specific water needs may vary depending on the species. However, the finger-feeling trick works for most plants that don't naturally grow in particularly wet or dry areas.

, Not only does this look better than leaving stubs, it also helps the plant heal more quickly. Keep in mind that cutting the tip off of a stem will cause new leaves to appear along nodes, due to the way hormones are distributed throughout the plant.


Take your leaves from areas that you wish to be bushier. Use hand pruners to cut the stems. Using your hands is generally more difficult, and it increases the risk of damaging the plant., If you need use leaves faster than they can grow, you can split the plant (if it has multiple stems) or dip a cutting in rooting hormone and plant it to get more plants. Each option is a great way to get more herbs without spending any money on a new plant.

Start growing a basil plant.,
Prepare seed containers.,
Plant the seeds.,
Transplant the basil plants.,
Keep the soil damp, but not soaked.,
Pinch off flower heads to keep.,
Harvest and prune.",How to Grow Fresh Herbs2," You can buy a pre-started basil plant, or you can start a seed from scratch. Start seeds indoors four to six weeks before the last frost of the winter. Basil needs warm air and sun to do well, so it's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they'll get damaged by frost. If you live in a hot climate, you can start the seeds outside instead.

, Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite, vermiculite, and peat. Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets. Dampen the mixture with water so it's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate.

, Drop one to two seeds into each container. Cover them lightly with soil. Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap, so they stay moist. Leave the containers in a sunny window. Water them twice daily.


If you are using containers that are wrapped in plastic, then you only need to water them every 3-4 days. To do so, remove the plastic, add the water, and then re-wrap the plant. Once the first leaves emerge, remove the plastic wrap.

, Once two sets of leaves have formed, you're ready to plant your basil into your garden or into permanent containers. Basil does not tolerate frost, so don't plant too early. It's best to put basil in well-drained soil, where it will get a good deal of sunshine.To plant the basil in the garden, dig holes spaced at least six inches (15.2 cm) apart. Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems. Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets.
If you want to plant the basil in a container, make sure it's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you're growing. Basil grows quite large, as herbs go, so plant your starts at least six inches (15.2 cm) apart.

, Basil does best in well-drained soil, and it won't grow well in standing water. Water the mature basil plants once a day or twice a week, depending on how damp the soil feels.


Water your plants in the morning so that the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight.

, When you see flower buds, pinch them off, along with the two pairs of leaves beneath them. Blooming flowers spark a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor and quantity of new leaves. This is called ""bolting,"" and is more likely to happen when there's extra sunshine.


If you leave the flowers, the plant will become tall and lean, and the leaves won't be as full or tasty.

, As the plant matures, pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height. If you look closely, at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off. Cut close to those tiny leaves, but be sure not to damage them.Pinching encourages the plant's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves. This helps the plants grow thick and healthy.
Don't pinch on the lower part of the stem, or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy. You want them to get bushy – so pinch from the top.

Fertilize and mulch your chive patch.,
Harvest your chives 3-4 times per year.,
Cut chives two inches from the base.,
Prune the chives at the end of the growing season.,
Divide chive plants every 3 to 4 years.",How to Grow Fresh Herbs3," There are two ways to grow chives: from a preexisting plant/cutting, or from seeds. Most gardeners recommend growing your chives from a bulb or from a start from another chive plant, because growing chives from seeds takes two full years. If you choose to grow from a preexisting plant (available at nurseries), select a start that is bright green, full, and at least 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) high. These qualities indicate a healthy chive plant which is likely to flourish in your garden.To grow from seed, you must start the seeds indoors a few months prior to planting them outdoors, then transplant them into the ground when spring comes. The seeds will grow into full plants, but they will not be mature enough to harvest for another two years.
Chive plants grow in bulbs that are divided every 3-4 years. Thus, you can plant a divided bulb from a friend or neighbor’s chive plot, and it will grow into an entirely new plant.
It is a fairly straightforward process to plant seeds, bulbs, and starts outdoors. Seeds take a bit of extra work prior to outdoor planting.

, Chives are sun-loving plants, and although they will still grow in shade, they will produce the biggest harvest when placed in full sun. Find a plot in your garden that has sunlight most of the day. If your garden is shaded, choose a patch that gets at least 4-6 hours of sunlight., Although some plants can grow in dense, hard soils, chives need light, loamy, and sandy soils with good drainage. If you’re working with soil that has a lot of clay or is very dense, mix in some sand or peat moss to loosen it up. Consider adding a garden-quality compost mixture to mix nutrients into the soil. If possible, amend the soil 4-6 weeks prior to planting, so that the soil can have time to adjust to the changes.

, Dig a hole 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) deep. Place each chive plant into the hole, and replace soil over the top. Make sure that the soil does not go above the base of the stems, as this will slow the growth of the plant.


If you are starting your chives as seeds, start them indoors 8-10 weeks prior to your outdoor planting date. Try to plant the herb 1-2 weeks after the last frost of the winter – typically around March or April, depending on your growing zone.
Chives grow from small bulbs at the base, so make sure to fully cover the base when you plant them. The bulbs aren’t typically that large, so you shouldn't need a hole bigger than 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) deep and wide.

, The soil should be moist when you water your chives, so you need not water them again immediately after. Chives don’t require a lot of moisture, so add water only when the soil is completely dry. The frequency of waterings will depend on the weather in your area, but may vary from once every 1-3 days.

, Apply a bit of fertilizer once every 3-4 weeks to make your chive harvest prosper. Choose a 20-20-20 mixture (equal parts nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) or an organic fertilizer, and incorporate it into the soil according to package directions. If you’re concerned about weeds in your garden, adding a layer of mulch will help block them out. Mulch is a type of compost, bark, or straw that is available at most garden supply stores. Add a layer 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) thick over the top of the soil, to block out weeds and to trap in moisture for longer.

, Wait to harvest your chives when they are at least 7 to 10 inches (17.8 to 25.4 cm) in height. For the best-tasting crop, harvest your chives during the summer and late fall – 3 to 4 times total during the year. It is not necessary to harvest the entire plant at once; only cut what you need from a patch, and harvest that particular patch 3-4 times per year.


The overall size of your chives will vary depending on the variety you grow, but all varieties are harvestable around 7–10 inches (17.8–25.4 cm). This normally occurs around mid-summer, and will continue until the weather cools below freezing.
In some area with light winters, chives will remain evergreen and produce harvestable plants until the following year., Use a pair of gardening shears or scissors to cut your chives straight across, starting from the outside of the plant and working in. Cut the chives about two inches from the base of the plant, as this will stimulate new growth for additional harvests.


Do not harvest the entire plant at one time. Cutting all of the leaves off will stop future growth.
Try not to cut them at an angle, as this will cause them to lose moisture more rapidly than if they are cut straight across. Cutting at an angle exposes more of the stem, and therefore moisture in the plant dissipates more quickly.

, Cutting off all the chives in the late fall (October or November) will help to produce a better crop the following summer. Use your gardening shears to cut off the top of the entire chive plant 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) from the base. Chives are perennial plants, so they will continue to grow back on their own so long as you take care of them.

, Chives can get quite large if they're allowed to grow continually for many years. Divide the chive plants every few years to prevent them from overtaking your garden and becoming unruly. Chives are a type of bulb, so they are easy to divide. Simply dig down in the dirt to reach the bulb, and split each large plant into sections 1/3 the original size. Replant each of these, or throw out the extras if undesired.Consider replanting chive your spare chives at the base of your apple trees. The chive plants will prevent a disease called ""apple scab"" from spreading on the trees.
Chives are said to repel deer. Consider planting your spare divisions in an area of your lawn or garden where deer have been a problem.

Start a patch of mint.,
Choose a location with adequate sunlight.,
Transplant the seedling or rooted sprig into a container.,
Consider planting your mint in the ground.,
Water your mint frequently for the first year.,
Maintain your mint plant.,
Harvest fresh green leaves as needed from the late spring through the early autumn.",How to Grow Fresh Herbs4," Plant your mint in the spring for best results; you can also plant it in the fall if you live in a climate that's free of frost. Either buy a mint seedling from a nursery, or start with a cutting from an existing mint plant – it is difficult to grow mint from seed. Follow these steps to cultivate a mint cutting:


Cut a sprig a centimeter above a stem junction to allow new branches to grow in its place. The sprig does not need to have many leaves, and almost any sprig will do.
Place the sprig in a glass of water. Within a week, small white roots should appear under water.
Wait a few more days to another week to allow the roots to establish themselves. Add water to the glass as necessary., When you plant your mint or place down your potted mint plant, you'll need to chose an area that receives morning sun and partial afternoon shade. You want the plant to get some light without drying it out completely. Mint grows best in deep, moist soil, so you want to keep it that way. You can even place your mint pot indoors, on a windowsill, as long as it's in a location that will get enough sunlight.


In winter, don't leave the plant on or above a radiator. The hot air will dry the soil rapidly. If it is very cold outside, don't let the leaves touch glass – this will chill and kill them.

, Potting mint is the most popular way to grow it: you can easily keep its growth in check, this way, and you can keep the pot near your kitchen so that you can harvest herbs frequently. Use a 12-to-16-inch wide pot for one plant. Plant the rooted sprig or seedling 5 centimeters deep. If planting multiple seedlings, plant them 15 centimeters apart. This will give each seedling enough room to grow.


Mint spreads rapidly, and its roots have a tendency to choke out the roots of other plants. Thus, it is usually best to plant mint in a container without other plants.
Consider adding a water-retaining polymer to the potting soil so that it stays moist and doesn't dry up.

, Be aware that mint spreads by sprouting along its long, tendril-like roots, and it can quickly grow out of control. Try planting it with a pot or other barrier around the roots. Submerge your mint in a pot or a mesh bag that is at least five inches deep. Leave the rim of the container above ground level so that the plant's root system will be contained.


Plant mint in a damp area with full sun or partial shade. The best conditions for growing mint in the ground require a fertile soil with a pH that is between 6.0 and 7.0. Though it can grow on its own without a problem, a little bit of fertilizer every few weeks won't hurt it. Make sure that the soil is moist by placing some mulch around the plant to protect the roots.
Never plant mint directly in the ground if it isn't native to your area. If it doesn't naturally grow in your area, letting it reproduce could choke out native plants and disrupt the local ecosystem. Plant it in a pot or a raised bed instead.

, Test the soil with your finger to determine how dry it is. Keep the soil damp, but don't soak it. Water mint more frequently if it's in direct sunlight. Check on it frequently to make sure that it gets plenty of water – but not too much.

, Mint is relatively low-maintenance, but there are a few things you can do to keep your harvest in top shape. Trim the top of the plant to ensure a stronger and more consistent harvest. Keep the flower buds in check so that the plant doesn't spread seeds across your yard. Split your plant every 2-3 years to keep the roots from getting cramped.Keep the top of the plant trimmed. This prevents it from growing too tall, and encourages it to grow more leaves to the side. If the leaves grow laterally, they'll be less likely to shade the leaves below them. An even sunlight distribution creates a better harvest.
Trim the flower buds. A mint plant's small flowers will typically bloom from June to September. Trim the buds before they have a chance to open so that the plant doesn't grow out of control. Pinching off the plant's flower buds as they appear will also extend your plant's harvesting season.
Split your plant every 2-3 years to keep a strong scent and flavor. After a few years, your mint will match the size of the container, causing its roots to become cramped. De-pot it and carefully split apart the mint into several plants.

, Pinch the stems with your fingers, or use a small pair of clippers. Only harvest as much mint as you need at any given time. Never harvest more than 1/3 of the leaves at once, and allow the plant to regrow before harvesting more. If you have a larger harvest, wait until right before the plant blooms, then cut the whole plant just above the first or the second set of leaves.Consider air-drying your mint. Hang the stems upside down in small bundles or just spread them on a small tray. Once the stems and the leaves are brittle, you can remove the leaves and place them in airtight containers.
Harvest as much mint as possible before the frost each year. The roots will survive the frost and regrow the following spring, but the above-ground plant matter will die off. Protect your mint roots by covering the plants with a layer of mulch before winter.

Harvest leaves within 2 months of planting.",How to Grow Dill," Dill is very easily grown from seed sown in later spring to early summer. Bear in mind that dill does not transplant well, and is best being sown direct where it will continue to grow.

Select an area where permanent regrowth of dill won't bother you; dill will easily self-sow after you've first planted it.;
, Dill favors poor soil provided it is well-drained. Moreover, the best growth occurs in direct sunlight – feathery leaves and umbels of yellow flowers.

, Water well but do not soak the soil.

, Do this when they reach approximately 5cm (2"") in height.

, This is especially important during hot weather.

, Use rotted organic matter (compost, old manure, etc.).

,, If the dill appears scraggly and wind is buffeting it, use a stick or bamboo stake to provide adequate support for it to grow against.

, Choose the cooler part of the day to harvest. When removing leaves, cut close to the stem.


The flower heads can also be picked several weeks following flowering, in order to collect the seeds. Place them in a paper bag stored in a cool, dry place until the seeds ripen, then hang upside down until the seeds fall.

,, Do not over-water.

, Evening primrose ""thrives on neglect"" so it's fairly hard to lose it for lack of nurture. The real problem is keeping it under control because it self-seeds so readily. Be prepared to clean up any spread regularly.


Snap off the flower stems after the blooms fade and discard of them. Doing this will prevent the seeds from ripening and spreading.

, Chervil likes a good loam that is fairly rich. Choose an area of light or dappled shade, or place under plants that can provide it with protection. The soil should drain well but stay moist.


Chervil is a great container plant too; choose a pot, window box, trough, or similar. It will grow happily indoors if desired.







, Simply sow shallowly and barely cover. Keep moist to enable germination.

, Once the seedlings start to grow, thin out to about 25cm (10"") apart.

, It loves being kept moist.

, An occasional soluble, nitrogen-rich fertiliser will help it to grow more leaves.

, Chervil has a long cropping period. Harvest the leaves from about 6 to 8 weeks after planting. Use the leaves as soon as possible because they lose their flavour quickly.


Chervil makes a great herb butter addition.
It won't ruin a dish if you add too much!

Divide chive plants every 3 to 4 years.",How to Grow Chives," Onion chives, also called common chives, are the most popular variety of the plant. Onion chives are slightly onion flavored and scented (as the name suggests), and are used in salads and as toppings for many cooking dishes for a subtle flavor enhancement. These chives grow anywhere from 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) in length, and are bright to dark green in color. They have the traditional tube-shaped stem which is hollow at the center.;
, Sometimes called ‘Chinese chives’, garlic chives are another type of chives used in cooking. These chives smell like violets when the stem is crushed, but taste reminiscent of garlic. As a result, they are used in dishes to bring out the garlic flavor. Unlike onion chives, garlic chives have flat stems, and the flower buds can be used in cooking as well (typically in stir-frys). Garlic chives are bright to dark green in hue, and grow to be 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) in height.

, Although the name sounds quite grand, giant Siberian chives are actually just a slightly larger variety of onion chives. These chives have the strongest flavor, but are typically used in gardens for their size (20-30 inches in height) around the borders of a plot. Giant Siberian chives are blue-green in color, and are tubular in shape. They have an onion-esq flavor and scent when added to cooking dishes., Although many people only think of chives as the baked potato topping, chives are actually a type of lily which produce lovely purple blooms. The flowers are about the size of a quarter and feature many rows of small, thin petals similar to a dandelion. The flowers of the chive plant entice beneficial insects to your garden, which in turn kill off the pests and unwanted bugs that might be around. Additionally, chive flowers are edible, making them a great addition to your cooking.


Cut off the flowers before they have completely opened, and add them to salads or use them as decoration on baked goods.
All varieties of chives grow flowers.

, There are two ways to grow chives: from a preexisting plant/cutting, or from seeds. Most gardeners recommend growing your chives from a bulb or from a start from another chive plant, because growing chives from seeds takes two full years. If you choose to grow from a preexisting plant (available at nurseries), select a start that is bright green, full, and is at least 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) in height. These are indicators of a healthy chive plant, and increase the likelihood of it flourishing in your garden.Growing from seeds involves starting seeds indoors a few months prior to planting them outdoors, and transplanting in the springtime. The seeds will grow into plants, but they cannot be harvested for 2 years.
Chive plants grow in bulbs that are divided every 3-4 years, so you can plant a divided bulb from a friend or neighbor’s chive plot, that will grow into an entirely new plant.
Planting seeds, bulbs, and starts outdoors is the same process. Seeds are the only growing method that take a bit extra work prior to outdoor planting.

, Chives are sun-loving plants, and although they will still grow in shade, they will produce the biggest harvest when placed in full sun. Find a plot in your garden that has sunlight most of the day.If your garden is shaded, choose a patch that gets at least 4-6 hours of sunlight to satisfy the chives’ sun needs. Chives planted in partial sun will grow slowly, so expect smaller or less frequent harvests.

, Although some plants can grow in dense, hard soils, chives need light, loamy, and sandy soils with good drainage. If you’re working with soil that has a lot of clay or is very dense, mix in some sand to loosen it up. Additionally, add in a garden-quality compost mixture to mix nutrients into the soil. If possible, amend the soil 4-6 weeks prior to planting, so that the soil can have time to adjust to the changes.

, Chives need soil with a pH between 6 and 7.Test the soil, and if it is too low, increase the pH by chopping agricultural lime into the soil using a garden trowel or small shovel. If it is too high, lower the pH by mixing in a fertilizer with urea phosphate or ammonium nitrate, or by adding compost, manure, or plant litter.



Test the pH using cabbage for an easy DIY method.
You can test soil pH by using a store-bought test probe for exact measurements.

, Chives are summer-blooming plants that should be planted in the early spring. If you are starting your chives as seeds, start them indoors 8-10 weeks prior to your outdoor planting date. Planting outdoors should occur 1-2 weeks after the last frost of the winter, typically around March or April (depending on your growing zone)., Prior to planting your chives, wet the soil with a hose so that it is damp. This will help to prevent transplant shock of the new chive plants in your garden. Make sure that the soil is not muddy, just moist enough to form clumps when squeezed in your hand.


Transplant shock is a plant’s reaction to being dug up/relocated to a new environment, and is totally normal. It can cause problems if the plant is not cared for post-transplant, though.
Your plant might have transplant shock if it is wilted-looking and generally sickly in appearance., Chives grow from small bulbs at the base, which need to be covered fully when planted. The bulbs aren’t typically that large, so a hole no bigger than 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) deep and equally wide should be necessary.

, Place each chive plant into the hole, and replace soil over the top. Make sure that the chives are planted at the same depth they were in the pots. If the soil buries part of the stem that was previously exposed to air, the plant could rot.

, The soil should be moist when you water your chives, so you need not water them again immediately after. Chives don’t require a lot of moisture, so add water only when the soil is completely dry. The frequency of waterings will depend on the weather in your area, but may vary from once every 1-3 days.

, Your chive harvest will prosper with a bit of fertilizer applied once every 3-4 weeks. Choose a 20-20-20 mixture (equal parts nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium), and incorporate it into the soil according to package directions.

, If you’re concerned about weeds in your garden, adding a layer of mulch will help block them out. Pull all weeds around the chives first, then apply a layer of mulch to prevent new weed growth. Mulch is often sold in the form of compost or bark at garden supply stores, but can be any organic material used as a surface treatment for soil. Add a layer 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) thick over the top of the soil, to block out weeds and to trap moisture for longer.

, Few pests are interested in chives, but onion pests, like the onion fly, may gravitate toward your chives if you have true onions planted nearby. A few fungal diseases, like rust, may also attack chives on a rare basis. A small amount of pesticide or fungicide can usually restore your chives if these problems do occur., The overall size of your chives will vary depending on the variety you grow, but all varieties are harvestable around 7–10 inches (17.8–25.4 cm). This normally occurs around mid summer, and will continue until the weather cools below freezing. In some areas with light winters, chives will remain evergreen and produce harvestable plants until the following year.

, Use a pair of gardening shears or scissors to cut your chives straight across, starting from the outside of the plant and working in. Cut the chives about 2-inches from the base of the plant, as this will stimulate new growth for additional harvests. Do not harvest the entire plant at one time; cutting all of the leaves off will stop future growth. Try not to cut them at an angle, as this will cause them to lose moisture more rapidly than if they are cut straight across. This is because cutting at an angle exposes more of the stem, and therefore moisture in the plant dissipates more quickly.

, For the best-tasting crop, harvest your chives during the summer and late fall 3 to 4 times total during the year. It is not necessary to harvest the entire plant at once; only cut what you need from a patch, and harvest that particular patch 3-4 times per year.

, Chives can become an invasive species, as they are self-seeding and pollinating and may take over your garden. To prevent this, cut off the flower heads at harvesting time. This will prevent the flowers from seeding and spreading to other areas of your garden. Continue deadheading the flowers at each harvest., As a form of pruning, cutting off all the chives in the late fall will help to produce a better crop the following summer. Use your gardening shears to cut off the top of the entire chive plant 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) from the base. This should be done around the months of October or November. Chives are perennial plants, so they will continue to grow back on their own so long as they are taken care of.

, As a result of continually growing for many years, chives can get quite large. To prevent the chives from overtaking your garden and becoming unruly, it is practice to divide the chive plants every few years. Chives are a type of bulb, so they are easy to divide. Simply dig down in the dirt to reach the bulb, and split each large plant into sections ⅓ the original size for replanting.Give the extra sections to friends and neighbors to start their own herb garden, or add them to your compost.


Consider replanting chive your spare chives at the base of your apple trees. The chive plants will prevent a type of disease called ‘apple scab’ from occurring on the trees.

When planning, consider such things as placement near flower beds, alternating colour types and plant types, and the possibility of using the herbs as well as admiring them for their presentation.;
, The herbs to prefer are those which have a good strong colour or have variations in colour that make them interesting. Some good choices include:


Golden lemon thyme (Thymus citriodorus ""Aureus"")
Golden marjoram (Origanum vulgare ""Aureum"")
Golden feverfew (Chrysanthemum parthenium ""Golden Ball"")
Ginger mint

Sage (Salvia), tricolour and purple types

, It is helpful to plan out the placement on paper first. When put together in clumps, the colour feast should look amazing.

, After foliage, consider a focus on the flowers produced by many herbs. Beautiful colourful flowers can be found on a wide variety of herbs, including chives, borage, valerian, feverfew, clary sage, thyme, lavender, etc. If you focus on foliage first, then you will have guaranteed consistent colour and when flowering time occurs, you gain an added dimension with the different colours from the blooms.

Choose the time of year.,
Prepare a spot in your garden.,
Plant the cilantro seeds.,
Care for the cilantro.,
Prevent overcrowding.,
Harvest the cilantro.,
Decide whether or not you want to leave the cilantro plants to flower.",How to Grow Cilantro1," The best time to plant cilantro depends on where you live. Cilantro won't survive in frosty conditions, but it doesn't like extreme heat either. In temperate climates, the best time to start planting cilantro is in late spring, between the months of March and May. In more tropical climates, cilantro will grow better during cooler, dry times of year, such as fall.


You may also have success by planting cilantro late in the summer and allowing it to grow into the fall.
If the weather grows too hot, the cilantro plants will start to bolt - which means they will flower and go to seed, so choose your time of year wisely. To get a head start on the weather, try starting your seeds indoors and then transfer them outside as the weather improves.;
, Select a patch of soil where the cilantro will get full exposure to the sun. It will tolerate some shade in southerly areas where the sun gets very hot during the day. The soil should be light and well-drained with a pH of 6.2 to 6.8.If you wish to cultivate the soil before planting, use a shovel, rototiller or spade to work 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of an organic mulch such as compost, rotten leaves or manure into the top layer of soil. If you are using manure, make sure the manure is composted or aged for at least 3 months so it doesn't burn the young plants. Rake the area smooth before planting.

, Sow the seeds about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) deep, spaced 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) apart, in rows approximately 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. Cilantro seeds need plenty of moisture to germinate, so make sure to water them frequently. They need about an inch of water per week. They should germinate in about 2 to 3 weeks.As cilantro grows so quickly, you should plant a new batch of seeds every 2 to 3 weeks to ensure that you have a fresh supply of cilantro throughout the growing season., Once the seedlings have reached about 2 inches (5.1 cm) in height, you can fertilize them with compost or organic fertilizer. Be careful not to over-fertilize, you only need about 1/4 of a cup for every 25 feet (7.6 m) of growing space.


Once the plants have established themselves, they do not need as much water. You should aim to keep the soil damp, but not soggy, as cilantro is a dry climate herb., Stop the cilantro plants from becoming overcrowded by thinning the seedlings when the cilantro is 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tall. Pull out the smaller plants and leave the strongest ones to grow larger, allowing 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm) between each plant. The smaller plants can be used in cooking and eaten.You can also prevent weeds from growing by spreading some mulch around the base of the plants as soon as they are visible above the soil.

, Harvest cilantro by cutting off individual leaves and stems from the base of the plant, near ground level, when the stems are 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) tall. Use the fresh, new shoots in cooking, not the older, ferny-type leaves which can taste bitter.Don't cut off more than one third of the leaves at one time, as this can weaken the plant.
Once you have harvested the leaves, the plant will continue to grow for at least two or three more cycles., Sooner or later the coriander plants will start to flower. When this happens, the plant will stop producing fresh, new shoots with edible leaves. At the this point, some people cut off the flowers in the hopes that the plant will produce more leaves.


However, if you would also like to harvest coriander seeds from the plant you should leave it to flower. Once the flower dries, you will be able to harvest coriander seeds that can be used in cooking.
Alternatively, you can allow the seeds to naturally fall to the ground where the cilantro plant will self-sow, providing you with more cilantro plants the following growing season.You can also save the dried seeds and plant them the next growing season.

Harvest the cilantro.",How to Grow Cilantro2," Choose a flower pot or container that's at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) wide and 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm) deep. Cilantro does not take kindly to being moved, so the pot needs to be big enough to contain the full grown plant., Fill the pot with some fast-draining soil. You can mix in some fertilizer too, if you like. Moisten the soil with a little water until it's just damp, not soggy. Sprinkle the seeds lightly over the soil to disperse evenly. Cover with another 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of soil.

, Cilantro needs full sun to grow, so place it in a sunny window-sill or conservatory. South-facing windows offer the most light and best growing conditions for cilantro. The seeds should germinate within 7 to 10 days., Keep the soil moist using a spray bottle to lightly mist the soil. If you pour water onto the soil, it might displace the seeds.

, Once the stems of the cilantro reach 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) in length, it is ready to be harvested. Cut up to 2/3 of the leaves each week, as this will encourage the plant to keep growing. This way, it is possible to harvest four crops of cilantro from a single pot."

Keep it trimmed up.",How to Grow Damiana," Make sure the soil is damp and put the pot in a sunny spot so the seed can germinate. If you have sown them during the early spring or late winter months don’t put them outside just yet, wait until you know there is going to be no more frost.;
, Again, wait until you are sure that there is going to be no more frost before you put the plant outside. Pick a nice sunny spot in your yard. Southern exposure would probably be your best bet.
Another good tip for you planting your Damiana outside is if you do live in a colder climate plant the seeds in a large pot that can be placed in the ground outside. This way when winter comes you can simply dig up the pot and bring it inside during the winter months. If you do that be sure to put it in a nice sunny room or green house.

, Where it will grow just fine in rich or sandy soil it needs to be moist but not flooded.

, You want to make sure to prune any shoots that look ratty to make your plant look nice. Don’t toss the leaves though; you can dry them to make tea.

Harvest and air dry leaves.",How to Grow Catnip," Local home and garden stores carry both catnip seeds and small catnip plants ready for planting. Your local pet store might even carry seeds or plants. If you want to save money, or if you know of someone who already is growing catnip, you could ask them for a plant or some seeds.;
, Catnip seeds can be sown outdoors only during the spring. If you’re planting seeds directly into your outdoor garden, sow them as soon as any threat of frost has passed. Bury seeds 1/8 of an inch (3.2 mm) beneath the soil and space them at least 15 inches (38.1 cm) apart.Water them well during their germination period, which lasts up to ten days.
You should begin to see sprouts after this period.

, If you’re sowing seeds indoors, you can plant seeds in either spring or fall. Plant them in small individual pots or in a seed trough or bed. Make sure they get enough sunlight, or they will get leggy. If you can’t provide enough sun, you can use a fluorescent lamp above them. Water them well as they germinate. If you’re sowing in the spring, grow the plants until they are 4-5 inches (10.2-12.7 cm) tall and transplant outdoors after any threat of frost has passed.If sowing seeds in the fall, grow them by a sunlit window, preferably one that will receive at least six hours of sun daily. Transplant outdoors in spring or when there is no danger of frost.
Seeds sown in the fall tend to yield a denser, bushier crop of plants., Catnip prefers full sun in most locations. If you live in a hot, dry climate, consider an area where plants will have some shade from the afternoon sun. It will still need at least six hours of full sun, but in locations in the south, the sun at its highest and hottest could damage leaves.Catnip grows best outdoors, but can be grown indoors if you place it by a window that gets at least six hours of full sun per day.If growing a plant indoors, you should place it no more than three feet away from the sunlit window.
Alternatively, you can grow it indoors away from a sunlit window if you have access to high output fluorescent plant grow lights., Use standard potting soil if you’re container planting, or whatever soil you have in your garden. Soil should allow draining, so it shouldn’t be too rich or compacted. Catnip, like most herbs, will thrive in poor soil.Give seedlings or young plants ample room to grow, leaving about 18 to 20 inches (45.7 to 50.8 cm) between each plant to prevent crowding.They might look thin when you first plant them, but they will need the room to grow and will soon fill out the space.
Catnip will grow in just about any soil, but sandier soil tends to yield more aromatic plants.Water frequently after first planting. After a couple weeks, or after you see that the plants have adjusted to transplanting and are starting to grow, water only when the soil has dried out a few inches below the surface.

, Once established, catnip can grow aggressively, and can take over an entire garden. To keep it from invading your yard, grow it in a controlled garden, such as one with permanent stone dividers. If you don’t have a controlled space, using containers offers total control of where and how your catnip plants grow.If you want the look of an herb garden, but don’t want to risk catnip taking over, plant it in containers then bury the containers in your garden.
Placing the plants in containers beneath the soil will help confine and control their roots, preventing them from wandering throughout your garden.
Look for shoots and new spouts that might try to grow beyond the pot. Pull new shoots when you see them, and don’t place too much soil on top of the container when you’re burying it.

, Catnip plants like drier soil, and root rot can set in if the soil is too moist. When you water, thoroughly soak the soil to saturate the roots. Let the soil dry out completely, and test it out by touching a finger to it before watering.If the soil feels moist or wet, don’t water the plant and check it later that day or the next day.
Catnip plants are fairly hardy and quite drought-resistant, so you should be more concerned about over-watering than not watering them enough.

, After your plant's first flower blooms finish, remove the spent flowers. Shear back the plants by one-third to promote new growth and a new bloom of flowers. Remove any dead or dried leaves regularly.Shearing and deadheading plants will result in bushier plants that flower more consistently.

, You can propagate, or make new plants, by dividing one plant’s root system. Dig up a cluster of plants with at least two to three stalks, or remove them from their pot if you used a container. Soak the root ball to the point of complete saturation. Use a clean trowel or garden knife to divide the root cluster in half, then replant each new plant.Continue to water frequently after you’ve divided the plants. Don’t let the root system dry out as you would with a normal catnip plant.
Dividing plants can help control overgrowth, renew fading plants, or simply allow you to share a plant with a friend.

, Cats are of course attracted to catnip plants, and love to nip at their leaves and lay in plant beds. If you have an outdoor cat, don’t plant catnip next to delicate flowers or plants you wouldn’t want your cat to damage. If using containers, avoid positioning pots in places where they might easily be knocked over or broken.Consider using garden fencing, bracing, or bamboo sticks to support the plants and prevent your cat from laying on them.

, To harvest, trim down a stalk to its base, or just above a leaf joint, or cut off the whole plant at the base. Cutting just above a joint, or where a leaf or leaves spring from the stalk, will promote more rapid new growth. Air drying is the best drying method for preserving catnip leaves.Let your leaves sit out on a paper towel beneath a sunlit windowsill for two or three days.
For whole plants, hang them upside down in a cool location for a few weeks.
Do your best to keep your cat away from your drying leaves. Consider a room with a closed door to keep the cat from jumping up and getting into the leaves.
Once they’ve dried, place them in an airtight container for storage.

, The pot can be made of clay, plastic, stone, or concrete, but it should have drainage holes in the bottom regardless of the material.

, Soak the pot in a solution made from water and a mild cleanser. Scrub, and rinse well.

, Basil seedlings are fragile and damage easily during the transplanting process. As a result, many gardeners prefer to start the plant from seed.

, Do not over-saturate it, but add enough water to make the soil mildly damp.

,


Sow a few seeds an inch or two (2.5 to 5 centimeters) apart if using a round container.
Scatter seeds along the length of the container if using a long window box. If using this method, you must thin your basil out once seedlings sprout and reach an inch or two (2.5 to 5 centimeters) in height.

, Do not pack the soil down.

, Germination should occur within a week.

, The plants should be 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) apart to ensure adequate room for growth. You can either thin them out by snipping the basil off at soil level or by removing the basil by the root. Since snipping the basil off does not disturb any roots, it is the recommended method if you plan to discard what you remove. If you want to make use of every seedling, however, remove them at the root and transplant them.


Use your fingers or a wooden popsicle stick or tongue depressor to carefully dig the soil away from the base of a seedling.
Slide the tongue depressor under the developing roots or carefully ""wiggle"" the seedling, roots and all, out of the soil with your fingers after it is exposed.
Replant the removed seedling in another pot or in the same pot 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) away from any other seedling.

Pinch off the tops of the basil once the seedlings reach six inches (15 centimeters) in height.",How to Grow Basil Indoors3," A south-facing window typically works best. Basil thrives in full sun but needs at least six hours of sunlight a day to grow properly.

, If you cannot provide enough natural sunlight for your basil, use fluorescent grow lights or specially designed high-intensity lights instead. Basil plants receiving no natural light should receive 10 to 12 hours of artificial light.


Keep standard fluorescent lights a couple of inches (5 centimeters) away from the tops of your plants, and keep high output and compact fluorescent lamps 1 foot (1 yard) above the plants.
High-intensity lights should be two to four feet (61 to 122 centimeters) above plants.

, Direct an electric fan toward the plant, allowing it to rustle the leaves for at least two hours a day. Doing this prevents the air around the plant from getting too stagnant.

, A good pH level is usually between 6.0 and 7.5. Maintain this pH with an organic fertilizer. Since basil is primarily used for culinary purposes, many non-organic fertilizers may pose a potential risk.

, Test the dampness by sticking your finger into the soil about an inch (2.5 centimeters) deep. If the soil feels dry even at this depth, lightly water the plant.

, Pinching the tops off will encourage better leaf growth and will prevent your basil from becoming ""leggy.""

After about four months of growing, your plants should be mature.

, You can stake them upside down in a traditional fashion and leave them to dry like that in the sun for a few days, but I did not. I washed mine and hung them upside down in my garage where it was about 80 degrees. I left them hanging for about two months until they turned golden brown.

, The top leaves are supposedly the sweetest with the lower leaves being harsher. I discard the lowest row of leaves, but I believe this to be personal preference.

Mulch.,
Water on a regular basis to keep moist.,
Harvest.,
Prune.",How to Grow Bergamot," There are several types of bergamot, with the most common one being the wild bergamot (M. fistula) and lemon bergamot (M. citriodora). Check your local nursery or look online. Seeds will need to be raised in trays before transferring to the garden space.


Alternatively, the plant can be grown from root divisions taken in spring or autumn/fall, or from stem cuttings taken in the summer. Growing from seeds is slow, so you may prefer this method.
Once planted, bergamot will seed readily but it should be subject to regular division, to remove the dead center. Aim for dividing every three years.;
, Bergamot likes to grow in a sunny position and the soil needs to be rich and well-drained. It will tolerate a little shade.

, Sow seeds shallowly and cover lightly in a seed raising tray. Add a source of heat beneath the tray. When seedlings grow, transfer to the garden spot after hardening off. For a root cutting, transplant directly., They are vigorous growers and will spread a lot., Add mulch to the herb in spring.

, Don't over-water though, as it can be prone to mildew.

, Collect leaves in spring or summer. The flowers can be picked when opened.


Only scatter leaves or flowers sparingly in salads; the flavor is powerful.
If making tea, infuse or simmer the leaves for 10 minutes in an enamel or glass saucepan. If you want to mimic Earl Grey tea, add the leaves to China tea.

, Cut down to ground level in autumn/fall. Mulch it well and expect its return next spring.

Harvest.",How to Grow Borage," Borage is best sown direct in the garden via seed, as the seedlings don't transplant well once established.


Tip cuttings from a mature borage plant can be placed in sandy soil in spring. Keep the soil damp and place cuttings in the garden when they have taken hold but before they're too established.;
, Borage will tolerate partial shade though. Borage likes most soil types provided they're well aerated, moist, and mulched. Its favorite soil type is sandy.

,, Leave 60cm (2 feet) between the plants.

, Don't over-water.

, Expect maturity of the borage plant within six weeks. The flowers appear at an early stage and can be picked during summer growth for use in culinary ways. When picking flowers, choose those that are open (although Violet Stevenson advises that they are best picked before they open if you want to preserve their color). The leaves can also be used. Some ideas for use include:


Adding to gin-based summer cocktails
Placing the young leaves into salads cooked like spinach or dipped in batter as fritters

Use the leaves uncooked in salads and soups, as they have a cucumber flavor
Add sprigs to wine, cider, and fruit drinks
Freeze the flowers into ice cubes

Use the flowers as garnishes in salads

,
Keep moist.,

Harvest.,
Make crystallised angelica.",How to Grow Angelica," Just be sure to plant quickly as the seeds lose viability quickly after harvesting. (Angelica seeds itself readily, so once it's growing, you should see it re-emerging continuously in your garden.) Alternatively, purchase a seedling from the nursery/garden centre.


Sprinkle the seeds into a seed-raising tray filled with seed-raising mix. Cover the seeds minimally. Keep moist across the entire tray. Wait for the seeds to germinate. This will take around 3-4 weeks but this varies. If you see no signs after 4 weeks, assume the seeds did not take and try with a new batch.
Division is another method for obtaining more angelica. Simply lift the plant when it is two years old, in the early spring. Divide the roots into smaller sections and replant immediately in loose, quality soil.
If planting new seedlings from a parent plant, plant them some distance away from the parent plant.;
, Angelica likes lightly shaded spots in the garden; however, if you have a cool climate, a full sun aspect is preferable. The soil should be fertile, drain well but remain moist.


Angelica can be grown successfully in containers.

,, This plant originates from cool, rainy areas. Use mulch (rotted compost or old manure).

, An application of a complete plant food once in early spring as new growth appears and again in early summer will give angelica a boost.

, If you'd like to prolong the life of the plant, snip off the flowers when they appear. This can extend the life of the plant considerably beyond its 2 year normal lifespan.


Cut stems after the plant has bloomed to obtain the best flavour.

Dig out the roots just as the flowers are forming and wash clean straight away.
Seeds can be harvested once ripened. Cut off the whole flower head, place in a paper bag and leave to dry in a warm, dry place. The seeds will drop off. They can be stored in an airtight jar.

, This should be done to the stems before storing.

Prune.",How to Grow Caraway," It is best to plant the seed straight in the ground where you intend the caraway to grow. Choose seed from the nursery, or a previous crop of caraway. Sow the seed in early spring. If you live in an area where the winter is not too cold, the seed can also be sown in winter (best for tropical area growth) but doesn't tolerate winter wetness.


Sow the seeds shallowly. Keep seeds about 15–20 centimeter (5.9–7.9 in) apart. If not, thin the seedlings to the most vigorous growers.;
, Compost, rotted manure, or hay are good choices.

, Watering is most important during dry periods.

, Use a complete fertiliser in the soil on planting, then use liquid or soluble fertiliser once or twice during the growing months.

, Pick the caraway seed heads when they have ripened completely. Do not wait for the seeds to begin to fall though. Spread them on a tray or open container to dry completely with the sunshine (a windowsill is fine).


If you want to eat the leaves, pick them in early spring when they're young and palatable. Roots can also be eaten when young.

, These should be stored in airtight containers until needed. Replenish each year.


If seed is not collected, caraway will self-seed every year.

, Caraway plants die down in winter. At this point they should be cut back completely to enable them to grow back robustly next spring.

Prepare for cold weather.",How to Grow a Ginger Plant," Ginger is a tropical plant that does not survive frost. Plant after the last spring frost, or at the start of the wet season if you live in the tropics.If you live in a climate with a short growing season, you can grow the plant indoors.;
, There are many species of ginger. To grow the most common edible variety, Zingiber officinale, all you need is ginger root from the grocery store. You can find ornamental ginger plants with vibrant flowers at a plant nursery, but these are often inedible.Choose ginger roots (technically rhizomes) that are plump and free of wrinkles, with visible eyes (small points) at the end of the ""fingers."" Eyes that have started to turn green are ideal, but not required.Buy organic ginger if you can. Non-organic ginger may have been treated with a growth inhibitor.Some gardeners find that soaking in warm water overnight will help stimulate inhibited plants.This guide covers Zingiber officinale. Most Zingiber species will grow under similar conditions, but for best results follow the nursery instructions.

, If you'd like to grow more than one plant, cut the ginger with a sanitized knife or shears. Any piece at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide with one or more eyes can grow into a separate plant. After cutting, leave the pieces in a dry location for a few days to allow them to heal. They will form a protective callus over the cut surface, which reduces the risk of infection.Each piece of ginger requires 8 inches (20 cm) of space. Use larger pieces if you need to save space.
A piece with three or more eyes is more likely to sprout.

, Ginger thrives on high-quality, well-draining soil. Mixing garden soil with an equal amount of well-rotted compost should do the trick.If your soil is poor quality or heavy in clay, purchase rich potting soil instead.


If you want to keep a closer eye on the ginger, you can begin with a starting tray full of sphagnum moss or coconut fiber.These materials drain very well, preventing rot in young plants. You will need to transplant the ginger to soil once leaves and roots form, which can be traumatic for the plant. The ideal temperature for sprouting ginger is 70 degrees Fahrenheit, so you may need to use a heat mat or other heat source to keep the soil a the right temperature.
Like most garden plants, ginger prefers mildly acidic soils. If soil in your area is alkaline, adjust it to between 6.1 and 6.5 pH using a garden store pH kit., Ginger prefers partial shade or areas with morning sun only, away from large roots.The growing location should be sheltered from wind and moist, but not swampy. If the ginger plant has not yet germinated, soil temperatures must be warm — ideally between 71 and 77ºF (22–25ºC).If growing the ginger in pots, choose a pot at least 12 inches (30cm) deep. A plastic pot is better than terra cotta, as long as you poke plenty of drainage holes in the base.Ginger can grow in full shade in the tropics, but these locations may be too cool at other latitudes. Try to plant the ginger a place that gets two to five hours of direct sunlight per day., Plant each piece of ginger 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) below loose soil, with the buds pointing upward.If planting in rows, keep each piece 8 inches (20 cm) apart. If planting in pots, plant one piece per large pot (14 in./35 cm diameter)., Water lightly right after planting. Check the soil daily and water just before it dries out completely. Soggy soil will quickly rot your plants, so reduce watering or improve drainage if water does not drain quickly.

, Ginger grows slowly, especially outside of the tropics. A sprout might appear within a few days if you're lucky, but continue to water for at least a couple weeks before giving up on the plant.


Stick to the same watering treatment after germination.

, Fertilization is not required if the ginger is in rich soil, especially if you've mixed in compost. Have the soil tested first and fertilize accordingly.If soil is poor or you'd like to improve yield, fertilize with a small amount of complete liquid fertilizer each month., Once the ginger has sprouted, mulch will keep it warm and fight weeds, which can easily out compete slow-growing ginger. A thick layer of mulch is mandatory if soil temperatures fall below 50ºF (10ºC) during the growing season.

, The stems of the ginger plant will turn yellow in late summer or early fall, as temperatures drop. Reduce water as this happens, and stop watering entirely once the stems die.


The ginger plant might not flower the first year or two after planting, or if the growing season is short.

, Ginger develops a much stronger flavor if allowed to develop in the ground. After the stems die, and at least 8 months after planting, dig up the ginger rhizome. Cutting off pieces for cooking will not kill the plant as long as you leave some eyes behind.Young ginger is sometimes harvested 3–4 months after planting, usually intended for pickling. Young ginger must be harvested carefully due to its thinner, easily bruised skin.Use a sanitized knife to cut the plant.

, Unless you live in the tropics, bringing the ginger indoors for the winter is recommended. Store in a warm, dry location. If you leave the ginger outdoors, cover it with a thick layer of mulch as soon as the temperature drops below 50ºF (10ºC). Ginger is a perennial plant in warm climates, but will rarely survive frost.

While Arnica can be grown from seed, it takes up to two years for it to germinate, so you'll need to be patient! If sowing seeds, do so in early spring in a shallow tray filled with equal parts loam, sand, and peat. Keep in a cold frame or a greenhouse until mid-spring.;
, It needs sandy soil that is rich in humus and has excellent drainage. Arnica prefers a sunny position (full sun) and will also tolerate indirect sun.

, The soil should be kept moist.

, Typical of sub-alpine plants, it knows how to thrive without fertilizer.

, The flowers can be picked off in mid- to late summer. The root can be dug up when the leaves die in autumn for more division. Use the flowers as decorations or for drying.

Choose the herbs you want to grow.,
Plan the location where you will grow your herbs.,
Decide if you want to grow your herbs from seeds or seedlings.,
Ensure that you have containers that are well-draining.,
Use the best potting mix available.,
Fertilize with a product designed for herbs.,
Combine herbs appropriately.",How to Grow a Container Herb Garden," Your choices will depend on several considerations. The first is taste - you'll want to grow herbs that you'd actually want to eat in your cooking. It is also helpful to choose herbs that pair well with vegetables you may already be growing in your garden; homegrown tomatoes pair well with basil, for instance. Most herbs are fairly easy to grow, but if you are particularly worried about keeping the plant healthy, mint is one of the most hardy and aggressive of herbs.;
, Most herbs originally hail from the Mediterranean, and are therefore adapted for heavy sunlight. If growing your herbs indoors, you will need a south-facing window (or a north-facing one if you are in the southern hemisphere) that gets about 8 hours of direct sun a day. A better location would be on a patio or window flower box.

, Seeds are much cheaper, can be stored, and give you access to a wider variety of species. Seedlings, on the other hand, produce quicker results and don't require the extra process of germination and transplanting. Herb seedlings are readily available at most nurseries.

, Herbs are very susceptible to root rot, and so you need to avoid growing them in overly moist soil. Plant them in pots with large holes in the bottom for drainage. Note that soil in larger pots will retain an appropriate moisture level for longer between waterings, so use larger pots rather than small ones. It is better to plant multiple herbs in a single large pot than in individual small ones.

, When gardening with any small, potted plant, it is always better to use products packaged as ""potting mix"" rather than ""potting soil."" Potting mixes are almost wholly composed of organic material like peat, and therefore they regulate moisture levels effectively. This is especially important for herbs because root rot is a prime concern.

, Most fertilizers are designed to increase the growth of a plant's flowers (and in the case of fruiting plants, the attached ovaries) at the expense of leaf growth. However, when growing herbs, leaves are the part you'll be harvesting. Plan to use a fertilizer marked especially for culinary herbs, as this product will have been formulated for leaf growth.

, If planting multiple herbs within a single large pot, make sure to compare their soil and water preferences to make sure they're compatible. For example, basil likes very moist, fertilized soil, while rosemary does better in dry, lean soil. These herbs should be planted in separate containers.

Monitor the seedlings.",How to Grow a Chilli Plant from a Seed1," Dampen two paper towels. Scatter your chilli seeds on one paper towel and layer the second paper towel on top of it. Place the seeds in a zip lock bag or plastic container and seal it shut., As a general rule, chilli seeds need a temperature of 23-30 degrees Celsius (73-86 degrees Fahrenheit) to germinate. Place your seeds in a spot with consistent warmth (e.g. on a heated mat) for a period of 2-5 days, until they swell or sprout. Make sure that the heat source isn't hot enough to melt the zip lock bag or plastic container that your seeds are stored in.Pre-germinating the chilli seeds this way before planting them in compost or soil will give them a better chance of sprouting successfully.
In warmer climates, the seeds can be left outdoors to germinate, provided that the temperature does not drop below 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit)., Fill a large planting tray or a multi cell seed tray to the brim with a light compost. Break up any large clumps. Push the compost down 1-2 millimeters and water it.The compost should be watered right before adding the seeds, and then very little until germination occurs.

, Drop individual chilli seeds on top of the compost, about 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Cover them lightly with more compost. Gently firm the compost and mist it lightly with a spray bottle., Place plastic wrap over the planting tray to lock in heat and moisture. Place the tray in the same warm spot you put your seeds initially. Alternatively, you can purchase an electric propagation mat or tray (available at garden centres) which will keep your seedlings at a warm, consistent temperature., Keep an eye on the planting tray to monitor growth and ensure the compost quality. The compost should be moist but not wet, and should not be watered unless it feels especially dry. Sprouting should begin after approximately two weeks."

Make sure your plant gets warmth and light.",How to Grow a Chilli Plant from a Seed2," Once your chilli plant seedlings have reached about 2 inches (5 cm) and have 5-6 leaves, transfer them to a larger area so their roots don't get constricted. Gently lift them from the tray. Make sure to disturb the roots as little as possible.Water the seedlings before removing them to ensure that the compost doesn't fall apart during the transfer.

, Find a pot that is approximately 2.75 inches (7 cm) in diameter and fill it with compost. Water the compost lightly and make a well in the center of it. Gently place a seedling in the empty space and fill around it with compost.If you live in a cooler climate, plant chilli plants in pots and keep them indoors.
Chilli plants can be transferred from pots to a garden whenever the weather is warm enough.

, As your chilli plant grows, transfer it to bigger pots. Prepare a larger pot by filling it with with compost, then make a well in the center. Gently dig out the plant, leaving a large clump of compost around its roots to protect them, and place it in the larger pot.If you wish to keep your chilli plant small, keep it in a small pot to thwart further growth.
The standard progression of pot sizes goes from a diameter of 2.75 inches (7 cm) to 6 inches (approximately 15 cm), then finally to 8 inches (approximately 20 cm).

, Place your potted chilli plant near a window, or outside to get sunlight, making sure to bring it back inside if the temperature drops. The amount of light the plant receives will directly affect the speed and size of its growth.If you keep the plant indoors in a home that doesn't get much natural sunlight, purchase a mini greenhouse or artificial light (available online or in gardening centers).

Plant the chilli plant.,
Water and feed the plant regularly.,
Keep your plant warm.",How to Grow a Chilli Plant from a Seed3," Find a sunny spot in your garden and dig a hole large enough to accommodate the seedling or plant. Use a gardening fork to gently dig up some soil at the base of the hole and rake a handful of compost into it. Gently insert plant and fill the space around it with an even mixture of soil and compost.Plant chilli plants at least 18 inches (45 cm) apart from any other plants to ensure that they will have adequate room to grow.

, In a warm, sunny climate, water your chilli plant every day to keep it hydrated. Avoid over-watering by making sure that the soil is moist, but not swampy. Feed plants with a general purpose liquid fertilizer (available at gardening centers) every two weeks., Chilli plants should only be transplanted outdoors in warm climates or places with very long summer seasons. In the latter case, it is best to transfer them outdoors in June. Purchase fleece or a gardening cloche (i.e. a protective dome cover that goes over the plant and is burrowed into the soil around it) to cover plants in case of unseasonally  cold weather."

Sprinkle granular fertilizer that has a ratio of 5-10-5 on the soil around the herbs.,
Avoid using natural fertilizers like compost, compost tea and fish emulsion.,
Water the herbs after applying the fertilizer.,
Do not get fertilizer on the leaves of herbs as it will burn the leaves.,
Fertilize the herbs again after four to six weeks if they look weak and are growing slowly.,
Keep in mind that the fertilizer will likely wash quickly out of the soil.,
Use a liquid, water-soluble houseplant fertilizer with a 5-10-5 ratio.,
Water the herbs with plain water.,
Do not give container-grown herbs fertilizer solution when the soil is dry.,
Fertilize indoor container-grown herbs every six weeks.",How to Fertilize Herbs," Do this in the spring.


Wait until newly-planted herbs and perennial herbs that have survived the winter begin to grow again.
Use 3 ounces of fertilizer per 30 square feet.;
, These will not provide the right balance of nutrients for healthy herbs., This will help to wash it down to the root zone.

, If it does get on the leaves, wash it off immediately with clear water from the garden hose.

, Keep in mind that too much fertilizer will cause herbs to grow too quickly, resulting in leaves that are deficient in the essential oils that give them their flavor.


Too little fertilizer will cause herbs to grow slowly, produce fewer, smaller leaves and look generally weak and unhealthy.

, Herbs grown in containers must be watered more often, sometimes as often as every day, because of the smaller volume of soil around their roots which dries more quickly than garden soil. This frequent irrigation will quickly wash the fertilizer out of the soil.

, You need to dilute the fertilizer at half the rate recommended by the manufacturer.


A common dilution rate is 1 tablespoon per gallon of water, which should be cut down to 1 ½ teaspoons per gallon for herbs.
Do not use garden fertilizer as it is too strong and could burn the herb’s roots., Then, pour the fertilizer solution evenly over the soil until it begins to drain from the bottom of the container.

, This can burn their roots.

, Outdoor container-grown herbs need to be given fertilizer every three to four weeks.


You should not give indoor herbs fertilizer during the winter as they naturally grow more slowly in the winter and will not use the fertilizer. If it is given to them during the winter, it will burn their roots and cause dried, brown leaf edges.

If your basil keels/bends over and won't get back up, gently push it up with your finger.",How to Germinate and Care for Basil Seedlings,";
, You can use newspaper cups. Spray it with water to make the soil moist to the touch.

, Too many seeds will make the basil feel crowded not germinate. Basil seedlings are extremely tiny and have a hard time finding their way to the surface of the soil if covered with soil, so leave them uncovered.

,, Basil will usually sprout on the third day or anytime after. Only spray the soil with water when the soil is dry to the touch.

, After the seeds have germinated or sprouted, it is important to spray them daily to keep the humidity levels healthy inside the container.

, The first two leaves that appear on basil (and every other seedling) are called ""cotyledons"". Cotyledons are actually part of the basils embryo. They help feed the plant nutrients because the seedling can not yet photosynthesize.


The 2nd set of leaves that look very different from the cotyledons are known as the ""true set of leaves"". These leaves will photosynthesize for the plant.

, The longer you leave the basil seedlings in their container with humidity the better. Most basil seedlings will die because they are transplanted to soon. A perfect time to transplant them is when they have their third set of leaves.


Before transplanting basil, a way you can double check that they are strong enough to be transplanted/moved out of the container with humidity is by opening the lid. Let all the humidity out of the container and leave the plants for a while. When you come back to check on them they should look as you left them. (If the basils bend or keel over put the lid back on and they will recover.)

, When basils are transplanted, watering is an important key to their survival. Anytime the soil is dry give the plants about an inch of water. Don't pour the water directly on them because they can be damaged easily.

, The basil should not come across any pests, for example pests like aphids dislike their strong smell.

, Add some dirt around the base so the basil doesn't fall over easily.

Prune mint back by about one third after flowering.,
Shape your mint plant.,
Store your mint for future use.,
Mint is usually harvested fresh throughout the year as needed.",How to Prune Mint1," Wait to prune mint until after it's fully flowered. Using a pair of shears, cut about one third of the length off the end of each stem.Mint is a relatively hearty, fast growing herb, so do not be afraid to prune--your plant will be fine.


Pruning can actually encourage growth. This is not a destructive thing to do to your mint plant.
If you don't have shears or don't like to use them, you can also prune mint with your fingertips. This process will take a bit longer, but is just as effective. With your fingertips, pinch off about one third of the length of the stem. Use your fingernails when pinching the stems to create a clean break.It may be easier to use your fingertips if you're pruning a small amount of mint indoors. You might also want to use scissors or a sharp knife.;
, As you're trimming your mint plant, consider what shape you'd like your plant to be in. You want to shape the mint in a way that grows in the confines of its pot without getting out of control. Mint can grow fast, and in many directions, so you want to trim your plan into a shape that's compatible with the pot.Shape the plant so it does not have too many leaves and shoots pouring over the plant.
Focus on trimming around the plant. Make sure the plant isn't sprawling too far over the side of the pot.

, After a big harvest, it's important to store your mint properly so that it can be used for months to come. There are various ways to store mint, the most popular being drying mint. There are several methods to dry mint, including baking it on the oven, hanging it to air-dry, and dehydrating it.


You can freeze mint. Pick through your mint leaves and remove any damaged leaves. Pat dry the mint leaves with a towel. Cut up the mint leaves and remove the stems. Place about 1 to 2 teaspoons of leaves in various compartments of an ice cube tray, fill with water, and place in the freezer. Once the cubes are frozen, place them in an airtight container or bag and leave them in the freezer. Frozen mint will keep for three months.
You can also vacuum seal mint. Once again, pick through mint to remove damaged leaves and pat the plant dry. Place the mint in a bag and label it with the date. Use a vacuum sealer, which can buy online, to vacuum seal the bag. Each vacuum sealer operates slightly differently, so you'll have to follow manufacturer's instructions.

, Avoid harvesting if the plant is not growing very well due to very cold weather or other bad conditions."

Trim your mint plant regularly.,
Use mint for cooking.,
Turn a small harvest into a new mint plant.",How to Prune Mint2," Mint is mature when it begins to bloom (after about 90 days), but it can be harvested any time after it is 3 to 4 inches tall. Trimming your mint plant regularly will allow it to become full and healthy. You'll also be able to use fresh mint after each mini harvest.


Make sure to trim your mint carefully each time it needs to be cut back. Remember to trim the mint so it grows in the rough shape of the pot you're using. If you're trimming mint outside, make sure to trim mint so mint plants do not overgrow your garden.
While you can use shears to prune mint, small plants can easily be pruned just using your fingers.

, Small pieces of mint can be used in many recipes. If a recipe calls for dry mint, try using freshly cut mint in its place. This can add a stronger mint flavor. You can all add mint leaves to beverages like lemonade or mojitos to add flavor., If you want more mint plants, you can create them using the trimmings from your existing mint plant. Clip off 6 inches of a stem from your mint plant, and place it in a pot filled with potting soil. This stem will transform into its own plant with lots of sunshine and water.Fill a plant with potting soil mixed with a heavy amount of compost. Take the stem you cut from the original mint plant and slide it into the soil.
You can also place mint stems in a glass of water. Remove any leaves that would sit below the water line or they will rot. Eventually, roots will start to grow.

Plant your mint in a pot.,
Choose the right time to plant mint.,
Water your mint plant often.,
Fertilize your mint on occasion.,
Plant your mint properly.",How to Prune Mint3," Mint plants have a fast-growing root system, which is why it's best to plant your mint in a pot. If you plant mint in your garden without a container, it will quickly spread to take over the entire garden.


If you want to plant your mint outside, dig a hole at least 5 inches deep, and place a container (such as a pot or a mesh bag) into the hole. Then, plant your mint inside of the container and pack dirt on top of it. The container will keep the roots from spreading to the entire garden.
If you want to plant your mint indoors, purchase a pot to plant your mint in. Place the pot near a window where it will get sunlight throughout the day. Don't place the plant near a heat source., If you're leaving your mint outdoors, when you plant your mint is important. Make sure to plant your mint in the spring if you live in a climate that experiences winter. If you live in a frost free climate, mint will thrive in mid-fall., Make sure to water your mint often, as mint thrives in damp soil. Mint can grow in a variety of soils, but doesn't do well in dry environments. If you live in a dry environment, keep an eye on the plant and water it more frequently. Water your mint plant at least once per day.

, For the most part, mint should grow well enough on its own. However, you should occasionally supply a light amount of fertilizer to the soil surrounding your mint. This will encourage healthy growth. This can be especially helpful if you harvest your mint a lot.Do not fertilize your mint often. Harvesting it every 3 to 4 weeks should be enough.
Choose a fertilizer that's low in salt, as salt can cause the tips of mint leaves to turn brown.

, When you plant your mint, plant it so that it is about 1/4 inch below the surface. You should only plant one seedling if you're using a pot. If you're planting your mint in your garden, plant each seedling about 2 feet apart. Be sure to plant each seedling it it's own container.


Make sure to plant mint where it can receive sunlight. When planting mint in pots, make sure you can move the pots near direct sunlight. Do not choose pots that are too big to fit on a porch or patio.
While it's best to grow mint indoors, you can plant it inside. If you choose to do so, pick an area where your mint will be consistently exposed to morning light. You should also keep it away from anything like a heater or furnace, as this can dry mint out.
Make sure the pot you use to plant mint is free from cracks. Mint roots grow fast, and they will spread through the crack of a damaged pot.

Water the seeds and place the pot in a sunny spot.",How to Grow an Indoor Herb Garden1," You can find seed packets in garden shops, nurseries, and in well-stocked supermarkets. If you are new to cooking with herbs and don't know where to start, try any of the following herbs: basil, chives, cilantro, marjoram, oregano, parsley, or rosemary., Having a bunch of herbs growing in one big pot may look nice, but it really is not good for the herbs. They won't have much room to grow, and will always be in competition with each other. Your herbs will be much healthier growing in their own pots.


Terracotta pots are a great choice. They offer plenty of ventilation and keep the soil from becoming waterlogged and moldy.
You can use other containers, such as cans or mason jars, but you'll need to give them proper drainage.

, Do not use a pot without a drainage hole. The pot must have proper drainage, or the water will sit and cause the roots to rot., Try to get soil with vermiculite or perlite. This will help it drain better.Some gardeners also recommend getting soil meant for growing vegetables because it helps the herbs produce bigger, healthier leaves.


If you are growing basil, rosemary, or thyme, consider adding a spoonful of crumbled eggshells. This will give these herbs some extra lime to help raise the soil pH, which benefits these plants., You will want to plant several seeds at one time, because not all seeds will sprout. Also, not all seeds will survive. You can always thin your herbs out later.

, Don't make the layer too thick. About ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) will be enough.

, Water the soil enough so that it is damp, but not soaking. Then, place the pot where it will get plenty of sunlight, such as a window.To learn how to further care for your herbs, click here.

Place the herb into a pot and water it.,
Keep the herb in a shady spot for the first few days before moving it to a sunnier location.",How to Grow an Indoor Herb Garden2," Try to choose herbs that you like to cook with, such as basil or chives. You may also want to buy more than one of each type of herb, in case some of them do not make it.

, Don't go any larger, or the young plant will spend too much energy on expanding its root system, and less energy on growing tasty leaves.Try to choose a terracotta pot. It will keep the soil from becoming waterlogged and moldy.


Most nursery herbs will come in cheap, plastic pots. These pots are temporary. Herbs (and other plants) are not meant to grow in these pots for long periods of time.

, Do not use a pot without drainage holes. This is important. If the pot does not have proper drainage, the water will sit and cause the roots to rot.

, Ideally, the soil should also contain some vermiculite or perlite to help the soil drain better. Some gardeners will also recommend soil meant for growing vegetables, because it helps the herbs produce bigger, healthier leaves.


If you bought basil, rosemary, or thyme, consider adding a spoonful of crumbled eggshells. This will help raise the soil pH, which these plants prefer.

, Loosen the soil by gently tapping on the sides of the pot or by squeezing the sides of the pot. If there is a drain hole, try pushing up through it to nudge the plant out of the pot. Turn the plant on its side and allow it to slide out. The entire plant, roots, and a good chunk of soil should come out.

, Dig a hole in the soil large enough for the roots to fit into. Carefully slide the herb into the hole. Pat the soil around the herb. When you are done, water the herb until the soil is damp, but not soaking wet.

, Don't worry if the leaves turn droopy at first. This is simply the plant adjusting to its new home.To learn how to further care for your herbs, click here.

Water the soil until it is damp, and place the pot in a sunny location.",How to Grow an Indoor Herb Garden3," Not all herbs grow well from cuttings. The following herbs tend to grow better from cuttings than others: lemon balm, mint, oregano, rosemary, and thyme., Measure down three to four inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) starting from the tip. Cut the herb using a pair of sharp scissors.Take your cutting in the springtime when the plants are starting to grow because actively growing plant stems will root the best.


Make sure that the herb you are cutting from is healthy. The leaves should not be withered looking or yellow.

, You will be placing the cutting in water. Any roots on the bottom can rot. They can also prevent any roots from forming.

, Make sure that the water is no higher than the leaves. Also, take care to avoid direct sunlight, as this can damage the cutting.


If you want to plant the cutting immediately, use root hormone, which will help the stem form roots after it's planted in soil. Dip the cut end into root hormone, then plant it into the ground. You can also use ground cinnamon in place of the hormone.This will kill any bacteria that can lead to rot or mold. It will also give the roots a ""boost.""

, Depending on the type of herb you cut, you might see roots forming in as little as 2 days. It can also take as long as 2 weeks. Changing the water is very important. If the water is not fresh, bacteria may develop and keep the herb from growing roots.

, Poke a hole into the soil, and slide the cutting in, until the roots are covered. Pat the soil around the cutting, and water it.

Water only when the top layer of the soil is dry.,
Make sure that your herbs get enough sunlight.,
Don't forget to feed your herbs.,
Remember to prune and harvest your herbs.",How to Grow an Indoor Herb Garden4," Keep watering until water leaks out through the drain hole at the bottom of the pot.You shouldn't have to water your herbs more than once or twice a week.If you water too often, the soil will become waterlogged. This can lead to root rot, which can kill your herbs.

, Every herb is different, so you might want to read the seed packet, or the label that came with your herb. In general, however, most types of herbs need 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day.A bright, sunny window would be ideal. If you live in a place that gets very little sunlight, consider getting a UV lamp for your herbs.


Consider rotating the pots every 4 to 5 days. This will help the herbs grow straight up, instead of bent to the side., Water, sunlight, and potting soil are not enough to grow healthy herbs. You will need to fertilize them every once in a while. When buying a fertilizer, make sure that you get something that promotes healthy leaves instead of pretty flowers. After all, you eat the leaves of herbs, and not their flowers., This will help them produce more leaves. When harvesting, make sure that you leave a few inches of stem on the plant. This will allow the plant to continue to grow. You also want to avoid taking the large leaves. These leaves capture the most sunlight, and aid the plant with photosynthesis.Many herbs will produce flowers. You will want to pinch these off, so that the herb can focus on producing tasty leaves rather than pretty blooms.The one exception to this is chamomile; the flower itself is the herb.
Pick leafy herbs, such as basil, right at the top of the stem.Snip delicate herbs, such as cilantro and parsley, closer to the base of the stem.Trim woody herbs, such as rosemary, with scissors or garden shears."

",How to Plant a Herb Pot," When making an Herb pot, it is essential to have a good variety of herbs and companion plants that will assist your culinary pursuits. Some good choices include:


Sweet Marjoram
Lemon Balm
Sage
Common Basil

Mint
Lime Basil
Thyme
Oregano
Strawberries
Hot Pepper;
,


Make sure that your pot has holes in the bottom for good drainage.






Take your gravel or grit, and pour this into the container to about a quarter of the pot's depth. This will help water drain out from the bottom of the soil.







, Once the gravel is in place, start to fill the pot with a multi-purpose, or soil-based compost. This should fill approximately three quarters of the pot's remaining depth.

,


Place the herb plants into the pot, with about 15 centimeter (5.9 in) between each stem.






Squeeze each herb gently from its temporary pot, and tease the roots from the root ball; this will encourage them to spread out.







, This will help to ensure the best growth. The display may look messy at first, but do not worry, as this will start to fill out and look lush within a few weeks.

, Once you are happy with the positions, start to fill the gaps between the plants with compost.


Firmly push the compost into the gaps by pushing your fingers deep into the soil that you have just added, being careful not to damage any roots.






Add more if necessary. Leave a couple of centimeters between the pot's rim and the soil, so that the pot does not overflow when watered.







, Cut the tops off the taller plants, roughly halving them in height. This will encourage each herb plant to bush out and provide more leaves to pick at harvest time.

, Obtain a controlled release fertilizer.


Push 3 - 5 of these into the soil, depending on your pot size. Simply push the controlled release fertiliser deep in with your finger and then re-cover with soil. These slow-release fertilisers should last a whole season, meaning that you needn't feed the pot again.

, Water thoroughly, until the water starts to drain out of the bottom of the pot. The compost needs to absorb a lot on first watering, so expect to apply four litres or so. Continue to water over the coming months, at least every few days, or when the soil seems dry. Herbs like to dry out between water, and some herbs such as Rosemary can easily be over-watered.

Harvest rosemary.,
Store the sprigs in a cool, dry place.,
Eat rosemary.,
Use rosemary around the house.",How to Grow Rosemary," Rosemary is easiest to grow from a cutting, rather than planting seeds. Visit a community garden and ask for a cutting, or ask a friend for a cutting of their plant. After you find a rosemary plant, clip off a few 4 inch pieces to propagate. The best time to do this is in the late spring, but if you live in a warmer climate, this can be done during early autumn as well. The plants you'll be able to grow from the cuttings will have the same qualities as the original bush.


If you'd prefer to grow a variety you haven't seen in your area, you can order a cutting online or ask your nursery to get one for you. There are many varieties of rosemary, each with slightly different properties. Some grow very bushy and tall, while others tend to trail; some have purple or blue flowers, some white.
You can also buy a seedling or small plant from a nursery if you don't want to propagate a cutting.;
, Before planting the rosemary, strip the leaves off of the lower section of the cutting (about an inch from the end of the stem). This part of the plant will go into the soil.


It is important to strip these leaves because leaving these leaves on will cause the stem to rot instead of grow.

, After you have stripped the leaves, put each cutting into a small pot of soil filled with two-thirds coarse sand and one-third peat moss. Set the pot in a sunny place, but not in direct sunlight. Water the cuttings regularly and keep in a warm spot until the roots form, which should take about three weeks.


To help the cuttings grow, you can place the entire pot inside a plastic bag with a few holes punctured in the top. This will help regulate the temperature and keep things warm and moist.You may also dip the tips of the rosemary cuttings in rooting powder to give them a head start.

, Once roots have formed, you can plant the rosemary either in pots or outdoors in your garden. Rosemary will adapt to most growing conditions and is quite hardy. It's happy with snow, limestone, high temperatures, by the seaside, and all sorts of soils. It will grow its best however, in a warm to hot, fairly dry climate. Choose a full sun aspect that is fairly dry.


Decide whether you want to keep growing it in pots or as a shrub in the garden. It can also be trained as a delightfully scented hedge. For cooler climates, containers may be best so that you can move them if needed.
If planting in the garden, pot the cutting up once so it can establish more roots and gain strength before planting it outside. Then, choose soil that drains well. Rosemary can suffer from root rot in waterlogged soil. The more alkaline the soil, the more fragrant the rosemary will be. Dig in some lime if the soil is too acid.

, Rosemary prefers a drier soil, so don't overdo the watering. It will be happy with the average garden watering. It likes to source most of its water from rain.

, This is not an herb that needs it. However, make sure that there is some lime in the soil.

, Though rosemary is hardy, it can suffer in very cold weather (lows of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or less) and its branches can get damaged when laden with heavy snow. To ensure the plant survives the winter, it's best to bring it indoors.


If your winter lows do not get down to 0 degrees F, then you do not have to do this.

, Pruning isn't necessary for the health of the plant, but rosemary bushes tend to grow quite large and take up a lot of garden space. Cut the branches back by a few inches each spring to help them retain their shape.

, Pick sprigs of rosemary leaves as needed. The bush will just keep on happily growing. Since rosemary is evergreen, you can harvest it all year round.

, You can also freeze rosemary by placing it in food storage bags and storing in the freezer. Alternatively, strip the leaves from the stems and store in airtight jars. Stored this way, rosemary will slowly dry and will keep for several months.

, Rosemary is a wonderful compliment to both sweet and savory dishes. Use it to add depth to meat and chicken, bread, butter, and even ice cream. These delicious recipes make use of rosemary:



Herb bread.

Marinated pork.

Rosemary syrup.

Lemon sorbet with rosemary.

, Rosemary can be dried and made into scented drawer sachets, used as in ingredient in homemade soap, turned into a fragranced water that makes your hair shiny and soft, and more. You can also simply brush against your rosemary plant to experience a fresh burst of its uplifting scent.

Freeze the leaves for later use, or dry them and store them in airtight containers.",How to Grow Parsley," Parsley comes in two general varieties: curly leaf and flat leaf (also known as Italian parsley). Flat leaf parsley tends to have a slightly stronger flavor than that of curly-leaf parsley, but both types are relatively mild. You will also need to decide if you want to grow your parsley from seed, or if you will grow the plant from a start/potted version.;
, Parsley works well in any garden or pot, as it doesn’t have strict growing conditions under which it thrives. Choose an area that gets at least partial sunlight, either in its own plot or between other garden plants. If you decide to pot your parsley, place it on a windowsill that gets morning sunlight, such as on an eastern-facing windowsill.

, Soil that is relatively loose, full of compost/nutrients, and has a pH level between 6 and 7 is perfect for parsley. Test the pH of the soil, and incorporate peat moss into it if the soil is too basic. To create the perfect soil mixture, mix 50% potting soil with 50% compost for nutrients. This will create a light and airy soil mixture that will make it easier for the small root-system of the parsley to attach itself to., Fill a large cup or bowl with warm (not hot) water. Add a splash of dish soap, and stir the mixture to help it to dissolve. Place all of your parsley seeds into the mixture and allow them to soak for one hour. The heat of the water and the dish soap will help to break down the notoriously tough outer casing of the parsley seeds, helping them to grow faster than they would without soaking.

, Using a small strainer, pour the soapy water out and run the seeds under lukewarm water. This should remove any traces of the soap, and prepare them for the next step. Fill a bowl with very warm water (near 105 degrees Fahrenheit) and place the seeds in the water. Leave these to soak overnight to continue the germination process.

, After 24 hours soaking in the water, remove the seeds with a strainer and lay them out on a piece of wax paper to dry. When they have been fully dried, they are ready to be planted.

, If you want to speed up your planting time even further, you can plant your parsley ahead of time in small containers and move them to their final destination after sprouting. 6-12 weeks prior to the last frost before Spring, plant your parsley seeds into small containers and water them daily. This should give them enough time to begin sprouting, increasing their time to full bloom when planted outdoors or in a larger pot., Wait until all possibility of frost has passed and sow the seeds directly in the garden if you did not start them indoors. Typically, the seeds should be planted at the very beginning of Spring, around March or April.

, Using a small trowel, make the rows in your garden approximately 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) apart and long enough so that the seeds can be sewn in 3-inch intervals. The seeds/sprouts need only be covered with ½ inch of dirt, so these holes/rows need not be very deep., Transplant seedlings started indoors into your garden after the last frost and when the plants are at least 3-inches tall. Place the seeds so that each plant is at least 8 to 10 inches from the other plants, in rows that are 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart. This will give the parsley plenty of space to grow, which it will take full advantage of with the commencement of late Spring.

, Water your parsley deeply at least once a week to encourage the development of a long taproot. You may need to water more frequently during extremely hot and dry periods. If you’re planting your parsley in pots indoors, give them enough water so that the soil is just barely moist. Consider setting up a drip system if you’re unable to water the parsley regularly., Weeds can easily blend in with the parsley, but they take up valuable nutrients and block out sunlight. Mulch around the plants to help the soil retain its moisture and discourage weed growth. Further, pull any weeds on sight and dispose of them far away from your garden.

, Along the way, seedlings will need to be thinned out so that there is only one plant every 8 to 10 inches. Once the seeds start to develop into plants, go through with a pair of scissors and snip out some of the smaller or less healthy looking plants right down to the soil. If you want to transplant these seedlings to a different location, then you can carefully dig them up using a small spade., Fertilize the parsley once a month using a general purpose fertilizer to sustain production of the herb for the entire season. You can also add compost to the soil to help keep it full of nutrients, giving your parsley an extra boost.

, When the parsley sprouts out with sets of three leaves that are fully developed, it is ready to be picked. Harvest the parsley slowly throughout the season by cutting the outer stalks of the plants just above ground level to encourage additional growth. Harvesting the leaves from the top of the plant will reduce your yield., Use your stored parsley within a year for optimal flavor.

, It is used very commonly in the Southern United States.

, It is one of the less invasive species of mint.

,, This variety is popular in fresh salads and drinks., Mint does not germinate from seed too easily, so only the most experienced gardeners should start from seed. Plant directly into potting soil or compost after you bring it home.


A garden store will have more varieties of mint; however, you may be able to find mint seedlings and plants at your local farmer’s market and supermarket.

, Ask a friend if you can harvest from an existing mint pot or find one in a local garden. Cut approximately one cm above a stem junction with sharp scissors.

, It is not guaranteed that you will be able to grow a plant from each cutting, but it is a good way to use leftover mint if you are willing to experiment.

, Place freshly cut sprigs in the glass to grow new roots. Keep it in a warm, sunny place and wait for white roots to grow out of the cut stem.


Add water as needed to keep the glass full.

, They can even extend to the bottom of your pot depth.

, A mint plant needs plenty of space to grow.

, A mint plant thrives in well-drained soil. Purchase a saucer to place below the pot to avoid staining your windowsill or patio.

, You can submerge the whole 12-inch pot in a larger pot, next to other herbs. Keep in mind that many species of mint will still find a way to take over the entire pot through the holes in the bottom of the mint pot.


If you want to plant it with other herbs, you will want to separate the herbs later in the season.

, You can also combine potting soil with rich compost. Mint plants need rich and well-drained soil to thrive.

One option is to connect with a licensed ginseng dealer in your state. You may be able to visit their location with your ginseng, have it weighed, and get a price quote on the spot. If you don’t like the price they give you, then you can simply try a different buyer.You can check your state’s registry of licensed ginseng dealers to find one in your area. There may be several in your area that you can visit to find the best price for your product.
If you want to cut out the middle man and sell and export ginseng yourself, then you might consider getting a dealer license. The rules for dealer licensing vary by state, so check to find out what your state’s regulations are. You will at least need to complete an application and pay a fee.Some people also sell their ginseng on an auction site, such as eBay. However, you will still need to have an export license to do this.;
, This method mimics the plant's natural environment. While ginseng grown this way typically takes eight years to mature, the end result is much more valuable than field-cultivated ginseng due to its color and shape. You may attempt to alter this process by using artificial shade or tilling the soil, but then you will be growing woods-grown ginseng, which may grow into a different, less valuable shape.The field cultivation method results in a mature plant at 4 years, but requires intensive labor, greater risk of disease spreading, and roughly $20,000 to $40,000 per acre.Most small scale farmers opt for the method described here instead, which results in a much more valuable plant and costs roughly $2,600 plus labor.Note that these costs are rough estimates.

, If you want to grow ginseng using the ""wild-simulated"" method, you'll need to have land within the plant's natural range. Ginseng grows in cool, temperate climates containing hardwood forests in areas of 20 to 40 inches of annual rainfall.This type of environment is found in areas of the northwest, midwest, and northeast United States, southern Canada, and mountainous regions of the southern United States.If you are not sure whether ginseng can be grown in your region, search online or contact your state or region's wildlife management department.

, State regulations on growing ginseng vary, but you will often need special permits or licenses, especially if you are growing for commercial harvest. Research regulations for your area, and contact your local extension service or state agriculture or commerce departments to find out what you need to do to legally grow ginseng. You should also look into organic certification well before planting your seeds. The ""wild-simulated"" method as described here is organic.


Of the 19 U.S. states that allow ginseng harvesting, 18 of them require any plants harvested to be at least 5 years old with 3 leaves, while Illinois requires the plants to be at least 10 years old with 4 leaves., Ginseng grows best in well-shaded sites (especially on north- or east-facing slopes) of moist hardwood forests, especially ones with deep-rooted, deciduous trees such as yellow poplar, oak, sugar maple, or tulip poplar.Mature forests with large hardwood trees and a canopy that blocks at least 75% of sunlight are ideal.Shrubs, briars, and other tall, thick undergrowth can compete with the ginseng and take up most of the available nutrients, leaving little for the ginseng.


Probably the best way to determine if a site is appropriate is to look for wild ginseng growing there.
Since wild ginseng is so rare, you can also get some idea of suitability if ""companion plants"" such as trillium, cohosh, jack-in-the-pulpit, wild yam, goldenseal, Solomon’s seal, wild ginger, or rattlesnake ferns are present.Search for pictures of these online and check which grow in your area, or have a local botanist assist you.
In addition, be aware that ginseng poachers are a serious problem: Be sure to choose a spot that is hidden from public view and not near a hiking trail or roadway.

, The soil should be loamy and moist, yet able to drain quickly. Avoid swampy soil and hard clay. When you have a site in mind, take several soil samples of equal quantity from around the potential planting site and mix them together in a plastic bucket. Have a soil analysis performed at a state soil test laboratory or university.Your garden supply store may have a kit that you can use yourself to test soil pH, but calcium and phosphorus tests are more difficult to perform on your own. While there is some controversy over what type of soil is best, qualities to look for include a pH of 4.5 to 5.5 (acidic soil), calcium levels of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds per acre (~0.35 kg per square meter), and phosphorus (P) levels of at least 95 pounds per acre (0.01 kg per square meter).Soil with the right level of moisture should not ball up in your hand or stick to your skin when you squeeze it.Some growers prefer a more neutral pH between 6 and 7.Unfortunately, there have not been enough definitive studies to determine the perfect environment for ginseng, but it should grow adequately in any pH range from 4 to 7.

, If you find a site that is perfect except for its soil chemistry, you may wish to amend the soil in the plot to adjust the pH or increase the quantities of phosphorus or calcium. If you want to sell wild-simulated ginseng instead of woods-cultivated, you must avoid fertilizer, or at least apply the fertilizer to the surface of the soil instead of mixing it in. The soil pH may be raised by adding lime (calcium carbonate), and calcium level can be increased--without altering pH--by the addition of gypsum (calcium sulfate).


Note that ginseng is able to grow in areas with lower calcium or phosphate, but may produce smaller roots or grow more slowly. Consider spacing the plants further apart in these situations so plants aren't competing for the same nutrients.
Also, be sure to test and amend the soil once every year

, Note that some regions have laws prohibiting or limiting the harvest of wild ginseng; look these up for your state, country, or region before searching for wild plants. If you are not legally allowed to pick them, or you cannot find the exceedingly rare wild plant, purchase seeds from a local grower or online. ""Green"" seeds will be cheaper than cold stratified seeds, but require a few months of preparation, described below.


Soft, moldy, or discolored seeds are not suitable for planting.You may be able to return them to the seller for a replacement.
Order seeds in advance in July or August, and have them delivered in the fall. Waiting until fall will likely leave you with the lowest quality seeds., Keep purchased, stratified seeds in the refrigerator in a plastic bag. Mist the seeds with a spray bottle once a week until you are ready to plant. If the seeds ever dry out, they will die., When a ginseng plant produces seeds in the wild, the seeds do not sprout the following year. To accomplish this, they require a year of stratification, a process in which the seeds lose the flesh of the berries that encase them and prepare to sprout. Most store-bought seeds are already stratified, but if you harvested them yourself or bought ""green"" seeds, you'll need to perform the process yourself. Depending on how many seeds you have, use one of the following methods:


Place a small amount of seeds in a pouch made of lightweight mesh, tied with wire. In autumn, bury the pouch under 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13cm) of loose, shaded soil. Cover with several inches (~10cm) of mulch. Mark the location well and keep it moist, but not soaked.
Place a large amount of seeds in a special container to drain water and keep out rodents. Construct a wooden box with a screen top and bottom, up to 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30cm) deep if you have enough seeds for several layers. Fill the box with alternating layers of moist sand and seeds. Bury the box with the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5cm) below the soil. Cover with mulch and mark the location. Water it if the soil dries out.

, If you stratified your own seeds, dig up the container and see if any of the seeds are ready. Discard soft, moldy, or discolored seeds. If any seeds are sprouting, plant them immediately. Return the rest to the container and bury it again, stirring them around first and checking that the sand or soil is still moist., Most seeds should be sown in the autumn, after the leaves have fallen from the trees but before the ground freezes. Ginseng seeds will do best when sown in late fall or early winter, and planting should occur when the ground is moist, such as after a rain.

, Unless your seeds are sprouting, soak them in a mix of 1 part household bleach and 9 parts water.Leave them in for 10 minutes to kill some of the fungus spores that often infect ginseng seeds. Seeds that float are most likely empty and dead, and should be discarded. Rinse the remaining seeds in clean water afterward and take them to your site to plant.


You may also treat your seeds with a fungicide, but make sure it is safe for use on ginseng first.

, It is not desirable to remove all plants from the area, but small underbrush will compete with the ginseng. Ferns in particular create a chemical that can kill nearby plants, so remove them or avoid areas adjacent to those plants., If you want your ginseng to grow in the most wild conditions possible, or if you have a large quantity of seed, you may wish to simply scatter the seed on the selected planting site. Remove the leaf litter from the ground first. Aim to scatter about 6 to 12 seeds per square foot (65 to 120 seeds per square meter)., Even most wild-simulated ginseng is planted with a little preparation and a couple standard gardening implements. First, rake leaves off the forest floor to expose the topsoil. Use a hoe to create furrows running up and down the slope. Plant according to needs:


Plant the seeds 6 to 9 inches (15 to 23 cm) apart if you plan to harvest large, 7+ year old ginseng. This is a typical planting method for wild-simulated ginseng, as the wide spacing reduces the risk of disease spreading.
Plant as little as 1 inch apart if you have a large number of seeds and want to harvest sooner.This method is more commonly used for field-cultivated ginseng, since the densely planted ginseng must be carefully watched and treated for disease and pest control. It is not recommended for first time growers.

, Replace the leaf litter that you raked off, or add a layer of mulch. This keeps the ground moist, which is vital for ginseng. Use 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5cm) of ground cover but no more, since the ginseng sprouts will not be able to push through a thicker layer. You should use 4 inches (10cm) of mulch if you live in an area with cold winters and frequent frosts, but remember to reduce this to lower levels in the spring.Do not use whole oak leaves. These are too tough and large for sprouts to grow through. Shred them first if you have already bought oak leaf mulch., You’re not going to need to visit the site much, and the look of the forest can change a great deal over the 7+ years it takes for your plants reach maturity, so make sure you can find them again. The best way to do this is to use a GPS device to determine the exact coordinates of the plot. This way you don’t leave any telltale signs that might invite poachers. If you must mark the plot, make sure your markers don’t readily draw attention.

, Because wild ginseng is so valuable, poachers are common in regions where it is grown. Fencing off the area won't deter someone who knows the ginseng is there, but it may prevent people from discovering the site.A loud dog may be an excellent thief deterrent.

, Ginseng that grows too close together may spread disease between plants or compete with each other for nutrients. Consider removing or transplanting plants after the first growing season to get down to 6 plants per square foot (65 per square meter), and again after the second year of growth down to 1 or 2 plants per square foot (11 to 22 per square meter).You may also plant ginseng in other areas each year during the fall to develop an ongoing harvest. Many growers do this so they have mature ginseng to harvest each year after the first batch matures.

, One major advantage to the wild-simulated method is a reduced risk of pest and disease, due to the wider spacing. While a few plants or berries may be eaten occasionally, you are unlikely to lose many of the valuable roots, and diseases shouldn't spread between plants at a high rate.If you do encounter a problem, contact your local wildlife department for information about ginseng pesticides.


Keep in mind that you may lose your organic certification or your credibility in selling wild-simulated ginseng if you use pesticides.

, You'll need to wait about 7 to 10 years for your plants to mature into large, valuable roots, but with the right site and a little luck. Growing ginseng with the wild-simulated method requires a lot of patience, but almost no maintenance. Check periodically to see if the ground remains moist and covered with a small amount of leaf litter.


If your ginseng is planted densely, harvest after 4 years or the roots might begin to dwindle These roots will not be as valuable, however., The part of the ginseng plants above the surface will die back in the autumn, but grow again in the spring. It will grow bigger each time, and all the while, the root below will be growing larger.

, Once the plants have matured, they will produce a cluster of red berries with the seed in the center. Pick these in the fall if you want to harvest the seeds for planting or selling. Keep in mind they will need to be stratified as described under Preparing the Seeds.

, Given how long it takes ginseng to reach maturity, you’ll probably want to harvest your plants as soon as you can, which is typically 7 years for a high quality root. If you’re not in any hurry you can leave them in the ground for many more years and they will continue to grow. If you are in a hurry, check local laws for regulations on how early you can harvest ginseng.

, Use a pitchfork or needle-nose spade to dig under the plant, and leave plenty of space (about 6 inches or 15 cm) between the plant and where you push the pitchfork or spade into the ground. If the plant is close to immature ginseng plants, use a smaller implement such as a stout flat blade screwdriver about 8 or 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long, and work with extra care. If there is any risk of damaging the roots of adjacent immature ginseng plants, do not attempt to harvest the plant until the other plants mature.



Note: Ginseng plants typically grow at a 45º angle into the soil, not straight down, and will fork into several sections. Dig carefully and make sure you don't break the root., Briefly soak the roots in a bucket of cool water to remove excess soil. Then place the roots in a single layer on a wooden tray and wash them gently under a sink faucet or with a hose. Make sure the roots are not touching and let them dry on a wooden rack in a well-ventilated room with a temperature between 70º and 90ºF (21–32ºC). Humidity should remain between 35 and 45% to prevent drying the plant too quickly and reducing its value.Turn the plants once per day. The roots are ready when you are able to snap them, but you should only do this on a single test root now and then.


Do not scrub the roots or wash them too vigorously—some of the medicinal chemicals are concentrated in the root hairs, and removal of these hairs will decrease the usefulness and value of the root.
Small roots take a day or two to dry, but large, mature roots may take up to six weeks.Direct sunlight usually dries the roots too fast, but if you see any mold or discoloration growing, put them in direct sun for a few hours to kill the infection.

As spinach, green drink, tea or brew, remembering that relatively small quantities are sufficient. As a preventative and health food, but that larger doses are necessary to provide an effective cure. Patients who need to take comfrey in quantity, can prepare a green drink.

, This drink promotes rapid healing after operations, being rich in Vitamin C and Allantoin.

Choose the kind of basil you wish to grow.,
Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost.,
Prepare seed containers.,
Plant the seeds.,
Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge.",How to Grow Basil1," Basil comes in many different varieties, each of which have a unique flavor and smell. Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you, then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store. Here are a few ideas:


Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice, and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers.
Lemon basil actually contains citral, an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit, and smells very lemony.
Purple basil is often grown for decoration, as well as its scent and flowers.
There are perennial basils which come back year after year, like African Blue Basil (which has pretty blue veins on its leaves) and Thai Basil, while most other varieties are annuals, which you'll have to plant year after year.
Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow, but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained.;
, Basil needs warm air and sun to do well, so it's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they'll get damaged by frost.


If you live in a hot climate, you can start the seeds outside instead.
To figure out when the last frost will be, consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area.

, Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite, vermiculite, and peat. Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets. Dampen the mixture with water so it's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate.

, Drop one to two seeds into each container. Cover them lightly with soil. Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap, so they stay moist. Leave the containers in a sunny window. Twice daily, remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water.


It is important to keep your basil seeds warm after you plant them. You might consider using a heat mat or an overhead lamp to keep them warm.

, When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil, it's time to remove the plastic wrap. Keep watering the sprouts twice daily, never letting the soil dry out. When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature, it's time to transplant them to a larger container.

"

Transplant the basil plants.,
Keep the soil damp, but not soaked.,
Pinch off flower heads.,
Watch for pests and mold.",How to Grow Basil2," Once two sets of leaves have formed, basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers. Basil does not tolerate frost so don't plant too early. It's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil.To plant the basil in the garden, dig holes spaced at least 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems. Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets.
If you want to plant the basil in a container, make sure it's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you're growing; they need to be planted 1 foot (0.3 m) apart, since they grow quite large.

, Basil does best in well-drained soil, and should not be subjected to standing water. Water the mature basil plants once a day, in the morning, so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight.

, When you see flower buds, pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off. Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves, as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows. This is called ""bolting"" and is more likely to happen when there's extra sunshine. You'll notice that if you leave the flowers, the plant will become lanky and the leaves won't be as full or tasty.

, Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles; the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand.If your plants show signs of mold growth, they may not be getting adequate sunlight, or they may be too close together. Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space.

"
"
Harvest and prune.As the plant matures, pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height.,
Enjoy the basil fresh.,
Store the basil in the refrigerator.,
Freeze the basil.",How to Grow Basil3," If you look closely, at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off. Cut close to those tiny leaves, but be sure not to damage them.


Pinching encourages the plant's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves. This helps the plants grow bushy.Don't pinch on the lower part of the stem, or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy. You want them to get bushy, so pinch from the top.

, Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese.

, You'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh, so plan on storing some in the fridge. Wash the leaves, dry them well, and wrap them in paper towels. Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid.

, Freezing the leaves whole doesn't work very well, but if you puree it first or turn it into pesto before freezing, then you can store you basil in the freezer for months. Place the basil in a blender with a little water, lemon juice, and/or olive oil. Puree it until smooth, then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it."

Contact a local nursery or gardening store, which could identify the best candidates for you and/or provide reference material.You can also research which types of tree are best for your area through online resources like http://www.mortonarb.org/trees-plants/tree-and-plant-selection/using-tree-and-plant-finder
;
, Decide between planting bare root seedlings, containerized seedlings, pot-grown seedlings, or burlap-balled trees. Each is an effective method, but such factors as price, labor involved, and the best time of year to plant can vary between them.Bare root seedlings: the roots of these are entirely exposed, which makes them the most vulnerable to the elements.
Containerized seedlings: these roots are covered by soil in a biodegradable container, which can be planted directly into the ground as-is.
Pot-grown seedlings: with these, the roots are also covered by soil, but both the roots and soil must be removed from the pot before planting.
Burlap-balled trees: as the name suggests, these young transplants have their roots and soil wrapped in burlap, which can be planted as-is.

, The best window for your tree may vary in length depending on your region, but generally speaking, plan to do it in the fall or early spring (usually referred to as the “dormant season”). Avoid winter and summer, since extreme temperatures will most likely hinder healthy growth. Also bear in mind:Because of their vulnerability, bare root seedlings have the shortest window for planting. If you decide to go with these, find out exactly when the dormant season is in your area so you don’t plant your tree too early or too late.Pine trees are more resistant to frost than flowers. If you plant yours in spring, do so as soon as the ground thaws so you can maximize the later spring showers. However, you can still plant containerized seedlings, pot-grown seedlings, and burlap-balled trees later in the spring if necessary.
Planting them in the fall causes less stress in the root system. However, burlap-balled trees fare the best through wintry conditions because they’re sturdier.

, Promote healthy growth by planning to put your seedling or tree in the ground immediately upon purchase. If necessary, store them safely until the ground is ready, the weather improves, or whatever other delay involved resolves itself. To store them:Do not open their packaging. Repair any tears, holes, or opened seals with tape. Opened packages allow moisture to escape, which may cause the roots to dry out.
Keep them out of the sun, in a cool, well-ventilated area, ideally between 35 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 3.3 degrees Celsius), so they remain dormant until you’re ready to plant.
If you’ve purchased more than one seedling and they come in boxes, keep your stacks no more than three boxes high. Allow room in between each stack so air can circulate between them.

, A week before you’re ready to plant, spray the ground with herbicide to kill the roots of grass and weeds so your seedling or tree doesn’t have to compete for water. Once the roots die, physically remove them. Then use a spade to loosen the soil., You want your seedlings to have plenty of water, but you don’t want to drown them, either. If you’re worried about drainage, dig a hole roughly a foot deep (30 cm). Fill it with water and then check it 12 hours later to make sure all the water has drained. If all the water drained, you’re good to go. If not, either install land drains, select another area to plant, or only plant a type of pine proven to fare well in very wet conditions., Dig a hole slightly larger than the seedling’s root structure or container, plus a little deeper (the bigger the root structure/container, the deeper the hole). You’re going to fill that extra space at the bottom with topsoil, so as you dig your hole, keep that soil accessible. Depending on how much you’re removing, divide the soil into different cups, buckets, or piles to keep track of it., Topsoil has the most nutrients, so make this the roots’ first contact with the native soil. Once you’ve dug your hole, fill the extra space at the bottom with topsoil until the hole’s depth equals the root structure or container. If you live in a very wet region, or if this particular spot receives excessive water for whatever reason, add a little more topsoil to raise the top of the root structure/container a little bit above ground., Before you stick them in the ground, double-check their health. Ensure a healthy growth by disposing of any seedlings or trees that already seem to be on their way out. Keep in mind that seedlings are very fragile, so be very gentle when handling them. Look for:Mold and mildew
Missing or easily removed bark
Broken stems and roots
Dried-out roots

, Ensure that they spread away from the base of the tree so they cover the most ground. This way the tree will have more access to nutrients and water in the soil. Depending on which method you’re using, do the following:Bare root seedlings: gently pry any major roots away from each other if they appear bunched together.
Pot-grown seedlings: once you remove the root structure and soil from the pot, inspect the soil’s edges. If roots appear to have curved back into the soil after reaching the pot’s walls, gently straighten them. If necessary, widen your hole to accommodate them.
Containerized seedlings and burlap-balled trees: these can both be planted as-is, if desired. However, removing the container/burlap enables you to correct curling roots as you would with pot-grown seedlings. It also promotes faster growth after planting.

, Place the root structure or container in your hole. Continue filling the hole, using the topsoil first. Softly tamp the soil with a small tool (like your shovel’s handle) as you go until the surface area is flat and even with the surrounding ground or slightly domed above it.With bare root seedlings, be sure to pack topsoil in between each root when you first place it inside.
Don’t use your feet or other broad objects to tamp the soil. Stick to something that’s only one or two inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in diameter. This gives you more control so you can avoid damaging the roots underneath.
The heavier or wetter the soil is, the less tamping it will need.
With burlap-balled trees, you may need to stake them afterward to prevent them from falling over if they appear to be slanting or in danger of doing so.

, Ring the base of the stem or trunk with mulch. Keep weeds down and trap water in the ground all at once. Replenish as needed to maintain a consistent cover.If using wood chips, avoid those from black walnut trees, which contains elements that could inhibit your pine tree’s growth.

, Protect your seedling from too much direct sunlight. If the area isn’t already adequately shaded, erect a sheet of plywood roughly 2’ x 3’ (60 x 90 cm) between the seedling and the afternoon sun, when it’s usually at its most intense. Paint or seal the wood first to prevent water damage.Other materials, like cheese-cloth or some plastics, may reduce the amount of sunlight it receives, so use those if that’s all you have. But since they won’t block it entirely, opt for wood if possible.

, Test the soil underneath your mulch for dryness. If the soil is dry enough to crumble apart in your hand, add water. If the soil already feels moist, the tree should be fine as-is. Avoid over-watering, which could drown the roots.Exact water needs will vary depending on the type of pine tree, the amount of direct sun it receives, the time of year and climate, and other factors.
Contact a local nursery for more precise advice for water needs in your region.

, If you have a lot of wildlife in your area, consider your seedlings at risk of being eaten or trampled. Favor physical barriers over repellants. Use chicken-wire to fence in the area and/or fit a plastic tube over the exposed seedling.Alternatively, to kill two birds with one store, simply install a plywood sunscreen around all sides.

, Remove dead and/or lower branches in the fall or winter as the tree grows. Improve air circulation by getting rid of branches that appear dead or dying. Reduce the risk of disease by discarding any branches that touch the ground, where dead vegetation may collect and rot.Pine trees grow approximately 8 to 16 inches (20 to 40 cm) each year."

Don't overwater.",How to Plant Fruit Trees," Sweet apples, plums, pears and other fruits come from trees that have been grafted so that they produce the best-tasting fruit. Although fruit trees can be planted from seed, the resulting trees won't necessarily produce fruit that's good to eat. In order to make sure the tree you grow will produce fruit you'll want to eat, the best idea is to buy a grafted fruit tree, which is a very young tree that has been grafted onto a root stock to improve its growth.Grafted trees are available as either bare-root trees or potted trees. Bare-root trees are dug up and shipped while they are dormant. You should plant them as soon as you receive them. Potted trees are grown in a pot. They should also be planted while dormant. Potted trees will have more fine roots than bare-root trees do.
Buying a grafted tree from a local nursery is your best bet, since it will stock trees that do well in your particular region.;
, Fruit trees generally need at least six hours of full sunlight in order to grow strong and produce healthy fruit. Look for a spot in the yard where the fruit tree won't be shaded by your home or other taller trees. You should also look for a spot without a lot of other foliage nearby, so the tree won't have to compete with other plants for nutrients and water.


You should also select the location of your fruit tree by imagining it at full size. Take into account its width and understand that the roots of your tree will reach out as far as the length of the branches. This means that you don't want it too close to a building or driveway.

, Aside from full sun, proper soil drainage is the other essential condition for thriving fruit trees. The soil must not retain a lot of water, or it will cause the fruit trees' roots to rot in the ground. Check the soil drainage by digging a hole 1 foot (0.3 m) deep and filling it with water. If the water drains quickly, the area should be fine for planting a fruit tree. If the water stands in the hole, choose another part of the yard.If the soil in your yard is clay-heavy, which can cause it to drain poorly, you still have options. You can plant your fruit tree in a raised bed or till the soil and mix it with compost or peat moss in order to loosen it for better drainage.

, Fruit trees can be planted at any time of year, but in areas with cold winters or hot summers, your best bet is to wait until spring. This will allow the tree to immediately start adapting to the soil and growing roots. It's also the best time of year for breaking ground, since the soil will be thawed and easy to dig.

, If you have clay-heavy soil, or soil that is hard and packed, it's a good idea to till the soil to a depth of at least 2 feet (0.6 m) and work in some compost or peat moss. This will loosen the soil, provide better drainage and make room for the tree's roots to begin growing. Use a garden spade or a tiller to break up and loosen the soil, then add compost and mix it in.

, Use a shovel to dig a hole twice as wide as the spread of the roots of the tree you're planting. Fruit trees' roots tend to grow outward, and this will give them plenty of room. Make sure that the roots are surrounded by loose soil so that they are not challenged by compressed earth.


At the same time, it's important not to dig the hole too deep. Since you're working with a grafted bare root, it's important that the graft at the base of the tree stay above the soil.
If you're planting more than one tree, plant them at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) apart. Keep in mind that some trees require as much as 20 feet of spacing. When you buy the tree, determine how big it will grow when it is mature to determine how much space you need between trees. In general, the more space you can give them, the better., Depending on what type of tree you're planting and what your soil quality is, you may want to add organic nutrients to the hole you've dug before planting. In some cases, all that is needed is a sprinkle of compost on the base of the hole.


Check with the nursery regarding amending soil and what they suggest. In some cases you may not even have to amend the soil because the existing soil contains enough nutrition.
Don't add compost and other nutrients unless you're advised to do so. Once the roots grow past the amended soil, they'll need to be able to survive on the nutrients that are naturally available, so giving them very rich soil to begin with won't be helpful in the long run.

, Throw a little loose soil into the hole about a finger length high to create a mound, and position the root ball of your fruit tree on top of the center of the mound. Spread out the roots and make sure the graft line situated at the base of the trunk is higher than the level of the ground. Add or remove soil from the mound accordingly. Ensure that no roots are exposed.


If there are roots at or above the graft, cut these roots off and double check that the graft is above ground. If roots are able to reach the soil from the graft, the tree will always have sucker shoots growing from the base that will weaken the tree.

, Fill the hole surrounding the root of your tree with your nourished soil, and make sure that you cover all the roots completely. Stand back and check that the fruit growing tree is standing vertical. Press the soil down gently.

, Thoroughly water the area so that the soil fills in around the tree's roots. Add more soil, press it down gently and water again. Continue this process until the soil reaches the actual ground level.


Be sure not to overwater the tree, however; if the roots remain waterlogged, they can rot.

, If you're in an area with strong winds, stake it by tying it to a strong stick with a generous strip of cloth or rubber. Make sure that it is loose enough to avoid restraining the tree as the trunk grows. Staking will also help the tree grow straight and tall.

, This will retain the moisture in the soil and protect the roots. It will prevent grass and weeds from growing and competing for nutrients and water as well. Ensure that the graft line is not covered by mulch; it needs to remain visible above ground level.

, If you have deer or other animals in your area that like to browse on young trees, you may want to fence off the tree. You can do this by cutting three or four feet of chicken wire or a similar material. Mold it into a loop, and place it over your tree, securing it with a stake. Make sure that the fencing material reaches over the top of the tree., If you want the tree to produce fruiting branches low to the ground, you can prune it to knee height and cut back the side branches to one or two buds. This will direct the tree's energy to producing low branches at the cuts you made.On the other hand, you can lop off the bottom branches if you'd prefer the tree not to have branches low to the ground.

, Many fruit tree growers use a diluted solution of half white latex paint, half water to paint the tree trunk to act as a sunscreen. If you live in a region with very strong sun, like the Southwestern US, using this method will protect your tree from sun damage.

, It's important to weed the area around the tree as it grows to protect the roots and keep the tree growing healthy and strong. Pull the weeds by hand, rather than using an herbicide., Keeping the soil constantly wet is not necessary, and can lead to the roots rotting. Let the rainwater your tree. If a week has passed with no rainfall, water it thoroughly, then let it dry out again.

Avoid heavily shaded areas.
Also note that these trees are considered tropical varieties and thrive best in warm climates. Harsh winters can easily damage or destroy mahogany trees. Think twice about planting a mahogany tree if your winters reach below temperatures of 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius).;
, Mahogany trees can grow in a range of soil types, but they do thrive best in well-drained sandy loam soils.


Avoid heavy clay soils and duplex soils.
Additionally, mahogany trees do best in neutral soils. They can survive in strongly acidic soils, too, but avoid planting them in alkaline soils. If you need to use naturally alkaline soil, amend it with sphagnum peat, ammonium nitrate fertilizer, sulfur-coated urea, or agricultural sulfur.
Most mahogany trees are resistant to salt spray, so soils frequently drenched by salt water mist should not present a problem.
Since mahogany trees have deep root systems, you should make sure that the soil you plant it in runs deep, too.

, Plant the tree at least 15 feet (4.57 m) away from any house or large structure. It should also be 8 feet (2.43 m) or more away from sidewalks, streets, and driveways.Mahogany trees tend to have large canopies and long roots, which is why appropriate spacing is so crucial.
Similarly, it is best to plant multiple mahogany trees at least 15 feet (4.57 m) apart. You should be able to plant grasses, flowers, and small shrubs near the base of the tree without much problem, however.

, Using a shovel, dig a hole that is at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) deep or as deep as the container presently holding the sapling.


Between these two options, choose the depth that is deeper.
The width of the hole should be twice as long as the diameter of the sapling root system.

, Add composted cow manure and topsoil to the hole, mixing it into the soil at the bottom and sides of the hole with a shovel or garden fork.


Note that organic peat moss can be used instead of topsoil, if desired.
If desired, you can skip the soil amendments altogether. Doing so can make it more difficult for the tree to establish itself, but if you wish to add fertilizer to the area after planting the tree, there shouldn't be a problem.

, Spray the amended planting hole with a preventative ""knock down"" herbicide.


Doing so is not strictly necessary, but it can help keep the growing area free from weeds for two years or so of growth, giving the tree enough time to establish itself in the process.
Application amount can vary depending on the type of herbicide used, so follow the instructions on the label carefully.

, Free the sapling from its current container and place it directly into the center of the prepared planting hole.


If the sapling is in a traditional nursery container, carefully tip the container on its side and grab the tree at its base. Carefully wriggle the tree back and forth until it eases out of the container.
Do not disturb the roots after removing the sapling.
Stand the sapling upright in the center of the planting hole. The roots should be completely beneath the soil line.

, Fill the remainder of the hole with soil and water well to help pack the soil in.


For best results, fill half of the hole with soil, then thoroughly water this soil before proceeding.
After the water appears to drain, fill the remainder of the hole with additional soil and water again.

, To give the tree another boost and help the sapling establish itself, consider applying a balanced fertilizer containing equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.


These fertilizers will usually be labeled as 10-10-10, 30-30-30, or something similar.
Apply 0.22 to 0.44 lb (100 to 200 g) of fertilizer per tree.
You should apply the fertilizer in small pockets of soil around the perimeter of the tree. Do not spread it into the planting hole or along the surface of the ground. Surface fertilization can result in weed growth.
Note that fertilization may not be needed if you mixed organic material into the planting hole prior to planting the sapling.

, Use a garden hose to water the soil around the tree once a week, applying just enough water to create visible moisture on the surface of the soil.


During rainy seasons, additional waterings may not be needed. On the other hand, during abnormal droughts, you may need to increase your watering schedule from once to twice a week. Regardless of how the weather is, the idea is simply to keep the soil regularly moist.
Consistent sources of water are especially important while mahogany trees are young and have not yet established themselves. Fully mature trees can tolerate some drought without dying, but dry spells may cause the tree to drop its leaves early for the season., Feed the tree with a dose of fertilizer in the spring, summer, and fall. Use a balanced granular fertilizer for best results.


The same type of fertilizer used at the time of planting can be used for yearly maintenance. The fertilizer should contain equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
Follow the dosage instructions provided on the label of the fertilizer used. For best results, mix the fertilizer into the soil around the tree instead of spreading it over the surface of the soil.

, During the first two to eight years of the tree's life, yearly pruning can help control the height and spread of the tree.


Check the arrangement and space between limbs. The healthiest mahogany trees will have several evenly spaced major limbs that spread out along one central trunk or central leader. As the tree grows, these limbs will be at least 2 feet (61 cm) apart from one another, if not further.
Prune away any upright leaders aside from the central trunk. These upward growing branches can make it more difficult for the tree to tolerate strong winds and storms, thereby weakening it.
Cut away any branches that grow larger than two-thirds of the diameter of the central trunk. Such limbs can put stress on the tree and shorten its lifespan., There are a few common pests that may present a problem to the health and longevity of your tree. When you spot such pests, apply an appropriate pesticide to the area.


Some of the biggest problems come from shoot borers, longicorn beetles, powder post beetles, tent caterpillars, tip moths, scale, leaf notchers, leaf miners, Cuban leaf beetles, mahogany webworms, and Sri Lanka weevils.
Among these insect pests, borers present the greatest threat to the health and longevity of the tree. When borers are present, pesticides should be applied.
The other pests mostly cause aesthetic damage to the tree and don't often cause structural damage. As a result, pesticide application is not as crucial when these pests are spotted. You can treat the tree or choose not to do so.
When selecting a pesticide, look for one specifically labeled to work against the type of pest you are trying to kill. Do not assume that all pesticides will work on all pests.

, While diseases rarely strike mahogany trees, nectria infection can develop when the tree becomes stressed or injured.Look for discolored bark along the branches of the tree, particularly where the branch meets the trunk. As the fungal disease progresses, the discoloration can turn into small cream-colored to reddish cankers that develop on the surface of the bark. These bumps will continue to grow and can eventually kill entire branches or trees.
The best way to save a mahogany tree facing nectria infection is to remove the infected wood. You may also apply a fungicide to the tree, but fungicides do not always work on this particular type of infection.

Prune your trees.",How to Plant Containerized Trees," The tree won't have a lot of space to spread its roots, so it’s best to choose either a small variety of tree or one that you can contain by pruning.


Some good choices for container planting include olive and bay trees, Japanese Maple (Acer), and fruit trees such as apple or orange.;
, You will need to consider the conditions your garden offers — including how windy and sunny the site will be — when selecting the best variety.


Speak to an expert at your local gardening center who can help you choose the best tree variety for your specific location.

, Whatever variety of tree you plant, it is eventually likely to be top heavy, which leaves your container at risk of toppling over. This is likely to damage the tree and anything near it.


You can help to avoid this by choosing a heavy container with lots of stability and by placing the tree out of strong winds.
Stone or terracotta make heavy, sturdy pots. Check to make sure that they are frost resistant and remember that terracotta tends to dry out soil faster than other materials – so you’ll need to water more.

, Trees need good drainage so make sure the container has good drainage holes at the base. You may like to raise the pot slightly to prevent the holes from becoming waterlogged.

, Rather than put small trees in huge pots, it’s usually better to start a small sapling off in a small pot and then repot into a larger one as it grows. But be aware that repotting large trees can be heavy work.

, If you are growing tender plants that won’t survive outside in the winter, you’ll need to relocate the container inside during the coldest months.


This will be easier if you attach wheels or a pot trolley to the pot at planting time. These are available online or from some garden stores.

, Trees are either supplied as containerized, bare-root or rootballed saplings by nurseries.


Containerized saplings will do best planted in the fall or winter, but you can plant them year round.
Bare-root or rootballed saplings are usually good value but can only be planted in fall or winter – they also need planting immediately on purchase.

, Some gardeners advise putting some broken pot shards and/or a few inches of gravel at the base of the tree's pot. This can help to promote better drainage.

, However your shrub was supplied, soak it for up to an hour (not overnight) in a bucket of water ahead of planting. You’ll want to remove any string or wrappings supplied with bare rooted plants, but unwrap them as close as possible to planting to reduce moisture loss.

, If planting acid-loving plants such as Juneberry (Amelanchier), use ericaceous (acidic) compost. Place the sapling on top to judge the depth of soil.


It’s important that the tree is planted to the same depth as it was at the nursery or in the pot, so adjust the soil level and fill in the soil until you get this right.
If using a bare root sapling, you can assess the soil depth by looking at the line where the soil ends on the main stem.

, If the roots are bunched up, give bare rooted plants a gentle wiggle to try to loosen them a bit. If the sapling is potted, try to loosen any bunched roots as gently as possible.


The best way to do this is to gently tease them with your fingers until they separate a bit and no longer exactly match the shape of the pot that constrained them.
Try to retain as much of the original soil as possible as this helps preserve the roots.

, Avoid treading down the soil surface as this can damage roots. A light firming with your hands will suffice. Once the tree is in place, give it a good watering.


Consider providing support for thin saplings, especially in windy spots.
You can then add a 3–4 inch (7.6–10.2 cm) layer of mulch to help preserve moisture.

, Container planted trees will dry out quickly so attend to their watering through their lifetime, especially in dry weather. This is particularly important during the first few months, while the tree is establishing itself.

, Your containerized tree shouldn't need fertilizing for the first year. After that, it’s a good idea to fertilize each spring with a slow-release fertilizer (often advertised as ‘granular’).


Blood, fish and bone is an economical choice of slow-release fertilizer but it smells terrible so avoid if your container is near a seating area.
You will need to obtain a special fertilizer for containerized citrus trees.

, Adding a mulch layer will help preserve moisture in the soil – pebbles or gravel can make an attractive mulch for container grown trees.


It’s also recommended that you replace the top two inches of compost every year – be careful to avoid damaging the roots when you do so.

, Some trees may need relocating indoors in cold weather. Other varieties may survive outdoors with some help from you.


A thick mulch with something like manure or leaf mold will protect roots and you can wrap the tree and pot in an insulating layer of fleece or bubble wrap.
Wrapping garden-safe fairy lights around the tree before you fleece protect it can help keep the temperature above freezing if you switch the lights on overnight when there is a frost.
Be mindful that this can be a fire risk, so choose wrapping materials carefully for flame resistance.

, Trees planted in containers will benefit from pruning to keep them attractive and shapely. Follow the best pruning advice for your particular variety, In general, you should prune any dead, damaged or diseased growth.

Check if pear cultivars are considered invasive in your area or state.,
Plant Bradford  pears in loamy soil, if possible.,
Find a site with at least six hours of direct sunlight.,
For the best results, plant all callery pears, including those sold bare-root without any soil on the root system, in autumn after a hard frost.,
Water the callery pear trees every day until they can be planted.,
Dig the hole with a dirt shovel to a depth equal to the height of the callery pear tree’s root mass and twice the width.,
Remove container-grown callery pears from their containers.,
Disinfect a pair of sharp hand pruners by soaking them in household disinfectant for 5 minutes.,
Use the hand pruners to cut any roots that are growing around the outside of the root mass.,
Use a clean, sharp kitchen knife to cut the root mass.,
Set balled-and-burlapped (B&B) callery pears in the hole with the root wrapping on the root mass.,
Cut any circling roots on the B&B callery pear root mass.,
Break up any hard clumps of dirt and remove any stones from the backfill soil.,
Use your fingers to spread the roots and hold them over the center of the hole by the base of the trunk.,
Push the soil into the hole around the roots.,
Pour 1 to 2 gallons of water evenly over the soil to settle it around the roots.,
Water the tree with another 2 to 3 gallons of water.,
Spread a 2- to 3- inch depth of organic mulch over the soil.,
Water the tree when the soil in the rootball begins to dry.,
Use a watering can or a garden hose to water the tree.,
Water the tree if its leaves are wilting, curling, turning brown and yellow or dropping off.",How to Plant Bradford Pear Trees," Pear cultivars, including the “Bradford” pear tree, are classified as an invasive species in much of the eastern and mid-western United States as well as a few isolated areas in California and Utah.Always ask your local Extension office if a callery pear can be planted in your area before purchasing it.;
, However, they will also grow just fine in clay and sandy soil.They will grow equally well in highly acidic, neutral and highly alkaline soil, so a soil pH test is unnecessary., Avoid planting sites near structures, driveways or parking areas and sidewalks where a fallen branch could do damage.


The canopies on these trees will eventually reach a width of 20 to 25 feet. So, the tree should be planted at least 15 feet away to limit the possibility of damage if a branch breaks and falls.

, During this time, the tops of the trees will be dormant, allowing them to devote all their energy to growing new roots.


Planting them in autumn also gives them time to increase their root system, resulting in a healthier, more resilient tree that will be ready to grow vigorously in the spring.However, you can plant callery pears in containers or with wrapped, B&B roots any time from spring through fall. B&B are balled-and-burlapped roots.

, Keep them in a shady area where they are protected from strong, drying wind.


The root system will be damaged if they are allowed to dry out.

, If the soil is clay, use a hand trowel or hand rake to scratch up the sides of the hole.


When a shovel is pushed into clay soil, it creates a smooth surface or “glaze” that is difficult for tree roots and water to penetrate.

, You can do this by laying the container on its side and sliding the tree out. You can also grasp the tree at the base of the trunk to pull it out.

, Then, rinse them off or wipe the disinfectant off with a clean rag. Let them dry before using them.


Do not use them to cut the root while they are wet with disinfectant as the disinfectant will harm the tree.

, These are called circling roots. They will eventually thicken and strangle the tree so its best to remove them.Cut the circling roots at the base of the root where it grows from the tree.

, If the tree was root bound with a tight, full root mass in the container, use the knife to make three to four, 1- to 2-inch deep slices from the top to the bottom of the root mass.


Space the slices evenly around the root mass.
Then, gently work some of the longer roots growing out of the root mass away from the rest of the roots.
Slicing and loosening the roots will help the callery pear grow new roots into the soil instead of keeping them within the thick root mass.

, If the “burlap” is actually plastic wrapping, untie it at the top and carefully slide it out from under the tree.


If it is natural burlap, untie it, pull it down off the top of the rootball and leave it in the bottom of the hole. It will decompose on its own. Pulling it out from under the tree may damage the roots.

, As well, if there is a wire basket on the roots, which is not uncommon for B&B trees, use wire cutters to cut the basket and remove it.


There should be no wires of any sort left around the roots or the trunk.

, Use a shovel to do this., Do not crush or bend the roots. Crushed and bent roots at planting time will likely result in a dead tree.

, You should gently working it under and between the roots of bare-root trees. Then, fill the hole halfway.

, Finish filling the hole and create a 3-inch high ring of soil around the outer edge of the rootball, not the outer edge of the hole.


This will encourage the water to soak in right above the rootball where the tree needs it rather than the loose soil in the planting hole beyond the rootball.

, Pour it over the rootball and over the loose soil beyond the rootball to finish settling the soil.

, This will help it retain moisture.


Be sure to keep the mulch 3 inches away from the trunk.
Mulch pushed right up against a tree trunk can damage the bark and cause cankers, which will kill the tree.

, The best way to determine if the rootball is becoming dry is to poke your finger into it at several different spots.


If it is still wet, check it again in a couple of days.
The rootball should be kept slightly moist at all times for the first three months after planting., This way, water can be directed right over the roots but not directly on the tree trunk.


During the following year, while the tree is still become established, allow the top 1 to 2 inches of soil to dry, then give it 6 to 9 gallons or 2 to 3 inches of water.
Typically, running a hose for 5 minutes will deliver 10 gallons of water.This sort of deep watering will encourage the tree to grow its roots deeper into the soil, making it more drought tolerant.

, These are all signs the tree is not getting enough water.If it is getting too much water, its leaves will turn pale green or yellow or may stay green but become brittle and any new branches will wilt.

Look out for the specific qualities of herbs that repel insects.,
Select your herbs.,
Design your pest-repellent garden.,
Harvest and use.",How to Grow a Pest Repellent Herb Garden," When selecting herbs, you should be looking for herbs that contain phenols, naphthalene, pyrethrum and citronella. All of these chemical components are replicated synthetically or derived naturally in quite a number of commercially available products that repel pests.;
, The following herbs are good choices to begin with. Each herb shown here is accompanied by an explanation of its pest repellent qualities:



Wormwood, southernwood - lovely silvery, bushy appearance that repels moths, intestinal worm, slugs, and flies.
Rue - repels cats.It is also good for controlling fleas and Japanese beetle.Tanacetum genus (pyrethrum, tansy, feverfew) - repels moths, flies, ants, mice, mosquitoes, cockroaches, mites and bedbugs. Tansy is a strong herb suitable for growing around doorways to act as an insect deterrence. Pyrethrum is great made into a spray. Feverfew (pictured) is a good insect repellent and is also used for treating insect bites.The fact that feverfew is usually pest-free says something positive about its pest abilities.

Lavender - repels flies, silverfish fleas; add to sachets and hang in the wardrobe. Santolina (Cotton Lavender) has the strongest insect repellent properties and can be mixed with English lavender in sachets.Mint - repels flies, fleas, mice, rats and ants. Mountain mint rubbed on pants can deter chiggers and ticks.An endangered mint plant from Florida, Disceranda frutescens, has been found to be a very powerful insect repellent; try to grow some!Catnip - mosquitoes. It is even said that the essential oil in catnip, nepetalactone, is 10 times more effective than DEET!Thyme - deters insect pests and also helps with preventing musty odours; use in sachets, both flowers and leaves.Lemongrass - contains citronella - run the long grassy leaves and stalk on the skin to repel mosquitoes.Basil - fly and mosquito repellent; grow near outdoor eating areas.Sage - deters a variety of insects. Hang dried bundles in the house and at doorways., Make a design that will ensure an attractive herbal arrangement in your garden, as well as easy access for harvesting. You may choose to deliberately design an herb garden space; or you may choose to plant the herbs here and there throughout your garden, as space and design wishes permit. Take care with mint - it is probably best planted in a pot to cure its tendency to spread across your garden. Planting in pots is also fine and is especially useful when you would like the move the plants to different areas of the garden. And don't forget the value of growing these herbs near your outdoor entertaining area - this will add extra punch to the work being done by your citronella candles!

, There are numerous ways to use the plants. These are just a few suggestions; it is likely you will come up with many more of your own:


Harvest, dry and use in sachets for drawers, wardrobes, storage boxes etc.
Harvest, dry and use hanging from curtain rods in the laundry, kitchen area or from clothes hanging rods.
Keep live herbs growing in pots near doorways to discourage the entrance of pests such as flies and mice; plant mint near any areas of the house where you feel mice might be tempted to enter (and seal any holes!).
Plant rue near a garden bed that you don't want cats messing about in; be careful though, as some plants do not tolerate the presence of rue (e.g., basil).
Make water-based sprays - follow a suitable recipe.

Decide whether to plant boxwood in a garden or a pot.,
Choose the correct time to plant.,
Determine where to plant.,
Test your soil.,
Loosen the ball of roots on a new boxwood plant so they are mostly spread out.,
Dig a hole in the soil about as deep as the plant's height and as wide as the spread of the roots.,
Place the boxwood inside the hole and cover the roots with water and soil about 2 inches (5.08 cm) short of the top.

,
Pour 2 inches (5.08 cm) of mulch into the remainder of the hole and pack it down.

,
Water the boxwood once a week during warm months and much less often during cooler periods.

",How to Plant Boxwood,"


This does not change the manner of planting drastically, but the mobility of a potted plant might suit your needs better than boxwood rooted in the ground.;
,


Fall is the ideal season for planting boxwood, but it can also be successfully planted in spring or early summer.

,

Depending on the type of climate in your region, you might be limited in where you can plant boxwood. If you live in a colder area, boxwood should be planted in a location where it will receive full sunlight. Also consider positioning the plant where it will be protected from cold wind.






In warmer areas, boxwood should be planted where it will receive partial shade. In all regions, boxwood should be planted exposed to the north or south.







,


The optimal pH level of the soil is slightly acidic, around 6 or 7 on the scale. Thick, fertile soil is best. The soil should also drain well, as boxwood's short roots require quick drainage so they do not drown.

,


If the plant is a transplant, skip this step.

,


If you are planting the boxwood in a pot, place the root ball into shrub soil about 2 inches (5.08 cm) deep.

Cage young cedar.",How to Plant Cedar Trees," Whenever you are planting, envision the height of your cedar tree when mature. Cedar trees can grow very large. Depending on the specific type of cedar, they generally grow up to 50ft. (15m), but can be over 100ft. (30m) tall.Look for a clear area that has nothing hanging above where the tree might grow.


Find a location that is not directly below electric or cable lines, roofs or existing trees.
Ensure you aren’t planting directly above a septic system or well. The roots will reach deeply into the ground.;
, Plant small trees at least three feet apart, but preferably up to five feet apart. The trees need space between each other so they aren’t fighting for the same water and root territory. Calculate the space you have, especially if you’re planning a hedge or border, and ensure you have enough room to have enough spacing for the number of trees. The bottom foliage should be roughly an inch apart when the trees are planted., When planted near fruit trees (e.g. apples, crabapples, pears, quince), a rust disease can infect the nearby trees.There are multiple varieties of the disease, usually the name of the tree followed by the suffix “rust.” For apple trees, it would be cedar-apple rust.


Look for yellow or reddish lesions, gelatinous shapes, or other fungus.
The rust disease doesn’t kill the trees or the fruit, but it does cause an eye-sore.
Prevention of the disease can be accomplished via adequate pruning and fungicide application., The roots will need plenty of space to dig into the surrounding area. If the tree roots are too close to the water, or are in water too long, they may not have the support they need to grow new roots. When it comes to excessive water exposure and flooding, cedar trees are one of the more intolerant species of trees.


Death of the tree can occur in less than a month if the water exposure is significant.
Younger trees are more susceptible.
Healthy trees stand a better chance of avoiding water damage. Stressed trees are more likely to suffer damage., Although they can grow in partial sun, they will grow faster in the sunlight. There should be at minimum 6 hours of direct sunlight every day. Cedar trees can actually benefit from full sun exposure, so choose a location that doesn’t have significant eastern or western sunlight blockage., While most cedar trees can thrive in a variety of climates with minimal interaction, a lack of moisture could impact their health. Some trees that have not received appropriate moisture become more susceptible to insect infestation and disease.Very hot locations should receive extra watering whenever possible.
Very cold locations should receive extra layers of mulch in order to protect against frozen root systems., Wait until after the final thaw, and plant the trees in the early spring. They could also be planted in the early fall. The primary danger to planting at the wrong time is exposure to heat and heatwaves. The young hedges need ample water, and excessive heat could prove fatal.Early fall planting may be a better option if your area limits water because of the temperature or heat.

, Seedlings are often in buckets, containers, or burlap to facilitate transfer. Depending on how the tree is packaged, you will have to remove it before planting. Follow the guideline below depending on your cedar tree.


Bare root trees still have packaging material. Remove it before doing anything else.
Burlap packaging can be removed after placing the tree in the hole. Remember to get all twine and nails that keep the packaging together.
Some burlap under the tree may remain, particularly if the tree bulb is heavy. If the burlap is treated or vinyl, however, it needs to be completely removed.To remove the tree from a container, pick it up at a 45 degree angle, supporting the tree against your leg or body. Slowly rotate the bucket and firmly pat the outside of the bucket. The pat should have a slight downward angle, and be forceful enough to dislodge the tree., If the roots are bare, and not already in a dirt or soil bulb, you’ll need to place it in water. Place the roots in a bucket of water during the time before you plant. Take care not to disturb the roots until you must. The advised amount of time in the water is approximately 3-6 hours.You can keep the roots submerged in the water bucket for up to a week before they start to rot.

, In general, the hole should be big enough to accommodate the size of the root ball. Some recommend a sloped-side hole about a foot deep and five times as wide as the root ball. The root collar should be above the level of the land.Using a roto-tiller could greatly expedite the process as well as aerating the soil.

, Trimming off an inch of the root edges, or cutting lines into interwoven tree roots that have circled a container, is a good way to encourage root growth. Cutting a few vertical lines up the length of the root ball, and one criss-cross on the bottom, should help loosen the roots.You may not need to cut any roots at all. If the roots do not look interwoven, then cutting the smaller root fibers is not necessary.

, Aim for the center of the hole. Once inside the hole, the root ball should be above 1-1.5 inches (2.54-3.81 cm) above the ground on all sides, so there is a slight crown to allow for drainage and proper mulching.Be sure to support the root ball instead of the moving it around by the tree or its limbs.
If the tree collar is lower than ground level when you place it in the hole, add some soil under the root bulb and re-situate the tree., Point the roots downward as best possible, and fill the remaining hole with the pile of dug up soil. Compact the soil very tightly around the roots, and remove any air pockets. Use good planting soil and fresh compost to guarantee the roots have plenty of nutrients.Avoid adding any soil amendments like peat. They could potentially hinder root expansion.
Fertilizer and other chemicals are not necessary when initially planting.

, Push the soil around the edge of the tree to form a water-holding ring around it. Water it thoroughly in the trench, then refill the trench with soil. The tree should get about an hour worth of water per week. Water it once per day in hot conditions, and less when it rains frequently.If the tree changes colors, it may be receiving too much water. If the tree gets dried out and prickly, the water is likely insufficient., Mulch is beneficial to the cedar because it provides some moisture when hot, and insulation when cold. The protective mulch should be a few inches deep, covering all the soil that has been dug up. It works best if the mulch is also a couple inches removed from the trunk., Around the seedling, regularly pull weeds by hand. Avoid using a weed-eater near the tree, to ensure there is no damage to either the trunk or the limbs. If weeds are left unchecked, they can potentially sap away much needed moisture and nutrients from the sapling. Further, taller weeds could block sunlight.


Overgrown weeds are the primary cause of death for young seedlings.
Do not dig up roots deeper than 3 inches (7.62cm).
Landscape fabric with accompanying mulch can also be used to combat weed issues., The cedar tree can often get galls, which are brain or mop shaped fungi. This can lead to cedar-apple rust with surrounding trees in the apple family. If there is no location for the fungi to go, then it will terminate on the cedar tree. The best way to manage this infection is to trim the galls, then spray with a fungicide like Ferbam in late summer.If the tree is being attacked by a lot of bugs, it could be exposed to too much water, and dying from underneath. Use an insecticide like malathion to treat the tree., Fertilizers will be necessary when there is poor growth – less than 6 inches (15.24 cm) per year – or if there is severe discoloration. If the poor growth is the only problem, then nitrogen-heavy fertilizer should work. Other problems are more closely related to nutrient deficiencies, and require a soil sample to examine the pH level.Trees have greatest growth in spring, so fertilize just before then.
If the soil is sandy, some fertilizer can be applied earlier in spring, with a later application in late May.
Fertilizer during hot conditions should be immediately followed by a thorough watering., Until the trees are mature, they are susceptible to wintering deer and rabbits. A wire mesh cage works well to disinterest foragers. To effectively counteract deer, the fencing should encompass the tree just around the canopy, and low enough so the animals can’t squeeze under. It should also be anchored to the ground so the animals can’t knock it aside."

Use cuttings instead of division to create new plants.,
If your lavender is overgrown, try pruning instead.,
Before considering division, look for a consistent decrease in flowering from year to year.,
Examine the center of the lavender plant.",How to Divide a Lavender Plant1," Propagate lavender plants through cuttings instead of division, if your goal is to create more plants. Cuttings have a high survival rate and are easier to start. Division significantly increases the chance of plant death, and should only be used if necessary for the survival of the plant, using the criteria described below.Skip ahead to the softwood method for a faster method of cutting, which must be done in spring or summer.
Skip ahead to the layering method if you have enough space and time to let your cutting develop roots before removing it from the plant. This can be started at any time, but requires about three months of growth before the cutting can be separated.;
, Due to the high risk of death following division, even an overgrown lavender plant should usually not be split apart. Prune away about ⅓ of its branches instead, leaving a little of the young, green growth on the plant.Ideally, prune the lavender plant in spring or early summer, just after new growth begins. Pruning in autumn can cause the plant to waste energy on new growth, leaving it vulnerable to frost.
Do not prune lavender plants in the first year, when they are establishing roots.
If the old, woody growth is already too large for your garden, consider taking several cuttings and removing the old plant entirely once the new ones have been established for a year. Division is a more rapid solution, but one with a much lower success rate..

, Pay attention to how many flowers your lavender produces, compared to previous years. A slight or temporary decrease may be due to differences in the weather. However, if the plant has been declining for two or more years, and produces significantly fewer flowers, you may need to divide the plant. A safer move may be to start new plants from cuttings, and continue to watch the progress of the old plant.

, Older lavender plants may begin to die in the center, only producing flowers around the outside. This is one of the few situations in which dividing a lavender plant may be necessary. However, any lavender plant has a significant risk of death following division.


Opinions are divided on whether a younger or older plant has a lower risk from division."
"
Begin in spring or summer.,
Select a branch with at least two leafy nodes.,
Acquire a root stimulator (sometimes optional).,
Prepare small pots or a starting tray of special soil.,
Cut the branch with a sharp, clean knife.,
Cut off all but the top cluster of leaves.,
Dip the base of the cutting in a root stimulator (sometimes optional).,
Plant the cuttings in the prepared containers, and water thoroughly.,
Keep damp and shaded, but gradually expose to less water and more sun.,
Transplant into a larger pot or the ground once roots develop.",How to Divide a Lavender Plant2," Take the cuttings during the warm growing season, or roots may fail to form. Cuttings have the best chance to become established if you cut them early, in springtime, but if you want additional flowers, you may wait until early or mid summer, then take the cuttings after the plant has bloomed.Waiting later than mid summer is not recommended unless you live in an area with late or no frosts, as the plant needs at least six weeks to grow roots before the ground freezes., ""Nodes"" are the clumps on a branch from which a cluster of leaves sprout. Select a young branch, low on the plant, with at least two nodes. There are two different methods of selecting a branch:



Softwood cuttings use only soft, new-growth material from this year, that has not yet become brown and woody. These cuttings will grow fastest, but are only usable if the soft material is at least 5 in. (12 cm) long, and includes at least two leafy nodes.Hardwood cuttings include woody, brown stem material, but must also have at least an inch or two (2.5–5 cm) of soft, new growth at the tip. These require a root stimulator to encourage root growth, available at a gardening store.

, A root stimulator is necessary for growing hardwood cuttings. It is optional for softwood cuttings, since the young stem will grow roots without it. A root simulator may be useful for a softwood cutting if you removed it from the mother plant late, less than six weeks before the first expected frost.


Check the label and ingredients of a root stimulator before purchasing. Select a root stimulator that contains a root hormone, not just fertilizer and vitamin B1., Prepare a seed starting tray or small flowerpots to place the cuttings in for the first few weeks after cutting. Because plants without roots are sensitive to both drought and excessive moisture, use a special mix of 50% organic compost and 50% perlite to retain water at the correct level.Similar mixes sold at gardening stores can be used instead, such as a mix of sphagnum moss and perlite.


Terra cotta flowerpots are preferable to plastic ones due to their ""breathability,"" especially if you soak the flowerpot in water overnight before continuing to the next step below., Sharpen and clean a knife if necessary, to prepare for a tidy cut with low chance of infection. Slice off the selected branch just below a leafy node, removing a cutting at least 5 in. (13 cm) long, including at least two leafy nodes. The longer the cutting is, and the more nodes it has, the more likely it is to be successful.


Using scissors is not recommended, as they may pinch the stem and make it more difficult for roots to emerge., Leave the top cluster of leaves alone, as they will provide energy for the new plant. Use your knife to cut all other leaves off the plant, so it directs its energy at root development rather than excessive foliage growth.Be careful not to damage the bark while removing the leaves.

, Follow the instructions on the label of the root stimulator to dilute it to the correct strength, if your root stimulator is concentrated or in powdered form. Dip the bottom ¾ inch (2 cm) of the cutting, at the cut end, into the prepared root stimulator solution.This step is required for hardwood cuttings, and optional for softwood cuttings, as described in the steps above.

, Plant the cuttings in the containers you prepared earlier, just deep enough to keep them steady. Give them a generous quantity of water immediately after planting, relative to the small size of the container.

, Overwatering is a common mistake for new lavender cuttings. After the initial soaking, only water the cuttings when the soil begins to dry out, not when the soil is still moist.Shade will help minimize damage from the stress of transplanting for the first several days, but after this the plant can be moved incrementally to brighter environments.


Greenhouse environments may be too damp for lavender cuttings.However, if the cutting is looking limp or dry after one or two days, moving it to a greenhouse or under a plastic bag may help it retain moisture until it develops roots., After at least three weeks, and more commonly six weeks or more, strong roots will have developed in the small pot or starting tray. Once the roots have bound the soil together in the container, you can move this soil and the lavender plant into a larger flowerpot or flowerbed.Plant in rich, well-draining soil and care for it as you would any lavender plant.

"
Choose a small, young branch near the base of the lavender.,
Bury the middle of the branch in a shallow hole.,
Anchor the branch in place.,
Keep the buried branch moist.,
Dig up and cut the branch after at least three months of growing season.,
Transplant the cutting as a new lavender plant.",How to Divide a Lavender Plant3," For each cutting you plan to make, select a small branch attached to the outside base of the lavender plant. A young, bendable branch is required, or a branch growing horizontal just above the soil surface.


There are several related methods of propagation referred to as ""layering."" This one is simple and low-risk, but can be labor-intensive if you plan to create more than a few cuttings. Refer to the tips below if you want to turn your lavender plant into dozens of new cuttings instead.

, Dig a 4–6 inch (10–15 cm) hole in the soil, a short distance from the mother plant. Position this hole so you can bend the middle of the selected branch down into it, with the leaves and flowers at the end above ground on the other side of the hole.

, Hold the branch in place with rocks or a bent stake to prevent it springing out of the hole. Bury the center of the branch in soil to fill the hole, leaving the flowering end above ground.

, Water the buried section occasionally, keeping it moist but not soggy. Take care not to let the soil dry out during hot summer months.


Watering is not recommended while the plant is dormant for the winter.
Mulch can help the soil retain water, but may cause plants to overheat during hot weather.

, While you can begin this process any time, the branch may not develop a strong stem and roots until the growing season in spring and summer. After three or four months of growth, preferably as cool autumn weather begins, carefully dig around the buried branch to look for roots. If they are present and clumping the soil together, cut off the branch so all the roots are on the same piece as the flowering end.

, Move the cutting directly to its new location, moving the surrounding soil along with it to avoid damaging the roots. Keep the plant sheltered from wind until stronger roots develop, and care for it as you would any lavender plant.

"
Use this method only as a last resort.,
Divide in early spring.,
Identify areas for division.,
Dig holes for the divided plants.,
Add enriched soil to the bottom of the hole.,
Dig the lavender plant partially or fully out of the ground.,
Use a shovel to cut apart the root ball.,
Plant each section in its own hole.",How to Divide a Lavender Plant4," Lavender plants, unlike many perennials, do not handle division well. Read the section on deciding how to propagate lavender for more advice, or refer to either section on cuttings instead if your main goal is to produce new lavender plants.

, Lavender plants are dormant during winter, although they may retain their greyish-green color. Wait until early spring to divide the plant, but do not wait until the plant begins the growing season in earnest., If the center of the plant is dead, you should be able to identify individual clusters of stems circling the dead area, attached to the same section of roots. Plan to divide the plant so each new section has at least three to five growing stems and roughly equal shares of the root base.


This may require you to include multiple clusters in one division.

, As a rough guide, each hole should be about twice as wide as the root ball, and approximately 12 inches (30 cm) deep. Keep in mind that these root balls will be smaller after division.

, Organic material such as compost or pine bark can be mixed into your garden soil to use as backfill, or the material can be placed in a layer about 3 inches (7.5 cm) deep at the base of each hole.


Optionally, add a small amount of fertilizer high in phosphorus and potassium to the base of the hole as well., If the plant is not excessively large, the center is not dead, or separate divisions are not easily visible while the plant it is in the ground, you may wish to remove the entire plant before dividing it. Otherwise, remove portions of the soil around the plant to increase visibility and access to the root ball.


Pry down on the handle of the shovel as you move around the plant until the plant releases from the ground.

, Most lavender plants cannot easily be pried apart, but if your variety grows discrete clusters, you may attempt to pry them apart with two garden forks. More commonly, you will need to use a clean, sharp shovel to cut the lavender plant as you decided above, then use garden forks to pry apart the entwined roots.

, Plant each new lavender plant to the same depth it was planted previously, gently tamping down the soil around it as you fill the hole. Water thoroughly after planting to encourage new roots growth and set the plant in the soil. Continue to care for the lavender as usual.

Pick the right azalea for your garden.,
Choose a shady planting spot.,
Make sure the soil drains well.,
Determine the soil's acidity.,
Dig a hole and plant the azalea.,
Water the azalea plant.,
Mulch the area around azalea plants after the blooms fade.,
Fertilize the azalea if required.,
Trim away dead branches in the spring.,
Do a light pruning after the blooms fade.,
Do a drastic pruning when necessary.",How to Plant Azaleas," Azaleas are popularly grown in the Southeastern US, since they do well with mild winters and long summers. Azaleas are hardy plants that don't need much in the way of accommodations. Different types of azaleas have slightly different needs, so pay attention to what type you pick out to ensure you'll be satisfied with the results.


Azaleas are available in two main classes: native azaleas, which grow like vines and don't need pruning, and Asian azaleas, which grow as shrubs.
Asian azaleas are available in two varieties, both of which are evergreen:


Kurume hybrids. These are bright red and keep well-contained in one area. They can be planted in containers, raised beds or directly in the ground, and won't get larger than 3 or 4 feet (0.9 or 1.2 m) tall. They don't require much maintenance.

Southern Indian hybrids, on the other hand, grow very tall and large. They come in many colors, notably hot pink and white, and can easily grow tall enough to cover a window or door. If you have a lot of space, this might be a good choice for you, but you'll have to prune from time to time.


The Azalea Society or your local nursery can make recommendations on the type of azalea to plant in your area. There are hybrid descriptions and examples online or in local garden and landscaping shops. Stick with one type of azalea, or incorporate several different colors and species into the garden for variety.;
, Find a place in the garden or yard with some shade - ""dappled shade,"" as many azalea enthusiasts term it. This particular mix of shade and sunlight is perfect for azaleas. If you plant them in full sunlight, they won't grow as well. According to the Azalea Society of America, azaleas bloom well when planted under shady trees.


There are deciduous azalea varieties that do well with full sun, so check into these if you don't have much shade available.

, Azaleas need soil that drains very well, rather than retaining water after a rain. To determine whether the soil drains well where you want to plant your azalea, dig a hole before it rains, then check back afterward. If the hole is filled with standing water, the soil doesn't drain well; it's likely highly composed of clay. If the water is gone, the soil should be fine for azaleas.


If the soil doesn't drain well, you can mix it with compost or other organic matter in order to loosen it up. Till it to a depth of several feet to break it up, then mix in the other well-draining matter. Another option is to plant your azalea in a pot or a raised bed, where you can control the soil drainage more easily., Azaleas prefer a slightly acidic soil, such as a pH 5.5 or pH 6. If a soil test reveals an alkaline soil, mix some sulfur into the dirt before planting to balance it.

, Use a garden shovel to dig a hole in the dirt deep enough to cover the root and bottom of the plant. Dig a few inches wider than the ball of the root, and set the azalea upright in the hole so that the top of the root ball is slightly above the surface of the ground. Drop soil into the hole around the plant. Spread it around and under the azalea, and lightly pat it into place with your fingertips.


Wet the azalea before planting. Dip the root ball in a bucket of water, or use a hose to lightly dampen it, before setting the azalea into the ground.If you are planting more than one azalea, make sure the holes are space several feet apart.

, Water the plant and the soil slowly and thoroughly. Water again the day after planting. The plants must be watered at least once per week, unless they are in direct sunlight, in which case they must be watered more frequently. Take care not to let the azalea dry out, or it will wither.

, Use pine bark, pine needles, sawdust or wood chips between the bushes. This will keep the soil moist and the temperature of the dirt even. Mulch will also help keep out weeds.

, If your soil is rich and acid, you won't need to fertilize often. If you do choose to fertilize, do it in spring, right after the azalea blooms. Use an acid forming fertilizer like cottonseed meal, or choose a special azalea fertilizer.


Improper fertilizing can cause the plant to bloom at the wrong time, so be sure to fertilize only if required.

, Pruning azalea plants early will allow the plant's energy to be directed toward producing new growth. Assess your azalea to find dead branches and other spots that need trimming. Use a pair of hand clippers to thin the azaleas. Clip out any dead branches.


Don't go overboard with this early-season pruning. Each healthy branch you cut away is a branch that could have produced beautiful spring flowers. If you want to drastically change the shape of your azalea, wait until later in the summer.

, Now is the time to reshape your azalea shrub if you wish. Cut long, stray shoots next to woody branches to retain the azalea's natural form. Trim back areas that seem too crowded to promote air flow and improve the look of the bush. Be sure you make careful cuts - don't use hedge clippers to trim the bush willy nilly.


Don't prune too late in the year. Prune no later than 3 weeks after the blooms have gone - otherwise, you'll be cutting away next year's flower growth.

, If you have an azalea that has grown to large proportions and you're ready to cut it back, you can safely cut it to within a foot of the ground and it will grow back bushy and beautiful. Do it after the blooms of spring have faded, so the plant has time to reestablish itself before the next phase of growth.

Consider your yard’s conditions when picking out your shrub.,
Understand soil pH.,
Consider the amount of space you have.,
Think about how far the plant will spread.",How to Plant Evergreen Shrubs1," It may sound obvious but it’s really important to select the right shrub. Unfortunately picking the right plants for your garden is a bit like picking the right clothes to wear. You can’t always get the ones you like the look of—they have to suit your size and the weather you’re in. When picking a shrub, consider:


The amount of sun or shade.
Water levels.
Shelter.
Soil type (including drainage and pH level).
It’s also important to consider how much maintenance you want in terms of garden chores such as pruning and watering. Some shrubs need more care than others if they are to to look their best.;
, It’s a good idea to understand the pH (acidity or alkalinity) of your soil before you choose shrubs for the garden. You can get a soil testing kit to do this. Acid-loving or ericaceous shrubs (such as azaleas) will favor a pH range of 4-6, and ideally pH 5-5.5.


If your soil is more acid than that, don’t despair—you can incorporate some ericaceous compost to correct this.

, Some shrubs (such as some varieties of Spirea) grow to the height of small trees. If you don’t want to be a slave to your pruning duties, consider shrubs that will grow to an appropriate size for the available space.


Also consider how much the shrub will block the light to other plants nearby.

, Some plants (such as Japanese rose) may spread everywhere unless you are attentive to removing the suckers as they form.

Choose an area with full sunlight if possible.,
Space your Leyland Cypress at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) away from another tree or shrub.

,
Remove the Leyland Cypress plant from its original container.

,

Dig a hole approximately twice the size of the plant's root bundle.

,
Pull up any grass and weeds in and around the hole.

,
Loosen the soil around the roots.

,
Place the plant into the hole so that the top of the root bundle will be approximately 1/4 of an inch (.6 cm) below the ground surface.

,
Pack topsoil around the roots firmly.

,
Water the tree until the soil is moist to the touch.

,
Stake the tree if desired.,
Continue watering regularly over the next 2 to 3 months, keeping the soil moist but not soggy.

,
Fertilize your tree well in approximately 3 months, once the root system has been established.",How to Plant Leyland Cypress," Partial sunlight will work but is not ideal.;
,,, Then return the plant to the container or set aside until ready to plant.

,,,,,,,


Place 3 to 4 metal or wooden stakes around the base of the tree approximately 2 feet (60 cm) away.
Tie the tree to the stakes with string to secure it from bending in the wind.

,, This will speed the growth of your tree and help it to flourish.

Consider the needs of your acid-loving plants.,
Know when to plant your shrub.,
Soak your shrub’s roots before planting.,
Dig a hole.,
Loosen up your plant’s roots.,
Fill in the soil and water the ground well.,
Add mulch.",How to Plant Evergreen Shrubs2," When planting any kind of plant try to prepare the soil well ahead of time. Incorporate some compost or well-rotted manure into the location.

, If you know the soil to be clay-heavy, or if you notice puddles form after rain and do not quickly drain away, it’s likely your soil drainage may be poor. Few shrubs will tolerate this. You can improve soil drainage by:


Incorporating plenty of horticultural grit into the soil.
You may also like to incorporate a slow-release fertilizer such as blood, fish and bone into the general area around the planting site.

, If you are planting ericaceous—acid-loving—plants such a rhododendron, acer, camellia or azalea in an area with alkaline or lime-heavy soils, it’s a good idea to plant in pots containing an ericaceous compost.Some gardeners try to incorporate ericaceous compost into the ground but this isn’t always successful and the plant may fail.

, Try to plant evergreens in the spring or fall. Avoid planting when the ground is frozen or waterlogged. If your shrub was supplied bare rooted, it’s especially important to get it planted quickly.

, However your shrub was supplied, soak it for up to an hour (not overnight) in a bucket of water ahead of planting. You’ll want to remove any string or wrappings supplied with bare rooted plants, but unwrap them as close as possible to planting to reduce moisture loss.


Some bare root shrubs will be supplied in wrapping materials described as biodegradable. The label may advise that you don’t need to remove this but try to remove it if you can do so without harming the plant.

, Dig a hole the depth of the shrub’s root mass. You can tell what this is by looking at the depth of the pot the shrub comes in, or in the case of plants supplied bare rooted, look at the line where the soil ends on the main stem.


The hole should be at least twice as wide as the roots.

, If the roots are bunched up, give bare rooted plants a gentle wiggle to try to loosen them a bit. If the shrub is potted, try to loosen any bunched roots as gently as possible. To do this:


Gently tease them with your fingers until they separate a bit and no longer exactly match the shape of the pot that constrained them.
Try to retain as much of the original soil as possible as this helps preserve the roots.

, Avoid treading down the soil surface as this can damage roots. A light firming with your hands will suffice. If you didn’t dig a slow release fertilizer into the soil earlier, consider doing it now.


For example you can lightly rake some fertilizer pellets into a shallow layer of the soil. However, don’t go too deep or you’ll damage the roots.

, Apply a mulch of about 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) of compost, leaf mold or well-rotted manure to the surface of the soil. Make sure the mulch covers all of the ground below your shrub. The mulch will help protect the roots, keep weeds from growing, and retain soil moisture.

"
"
Water your shrubs until they are established.,
Reduce the amount of water you give your plant once it is established.,
Top up your mulch.",How to Plant Evergreen Shrubs3," Shrubs should be kept well watered until they are established, which usually happens after a few months. The commonest reason for new plants to fail is lack of water.


Beware hot summer weather but remember wind is also very drying even in cool temperatures.

, Because shrubs last for many years, these plants tend to establish enough root structure that they require less watering than plants such as annual bedding flowers. Most shrubs will only need watering in the driest periods after they become established.

, It’s good practice to ‘top up’ the mulch every year as this helps preserve soil moisture, reducing the amount the plant will need watering. To replace mulch:


Remove any residual mulch from the previous year.
Remove any weeds and then apply a fresh layer of mulching material.

"
"
Consider possible locations.,
Choose an attractive spot.,
Measure the roots.,
Dig the hole.,
Assess drainage.",How to Plant a Shrub1," It’s important to choose a plant that will thrive where you place it. You may not have a location that’s right for a shrub you want, but you can evaluate the available space to choose a plant that’s perfect for that spot. Before you buy your plant, take time to evaluate what type of shrub will thrive in the location you choose. Make notes of sun exposure, temperature fluctuations, soil moisture, root growth area, and soil composition and acidity. Ask someone at the nursery or garden center to help you choose the right plant.


Is the shrub being planted near your house, garage, or taller plants that will block out sunlight at certain times each day? Every plant needs a specific amount of sun and shade, so it’s important to note how much sunlight the shrub will receive.
Set up a thermometer and mark down the temperature at different times to determine how much the temperature fluctuates.
Measure the distance from the location you intend to plant to the closest objects on all sides. Roots spread laterally, so the amount of space around the planted location will determine how much room the plant has to grow. Keep in mind that other plants nearby may compete for water and nutrients in the soil.You can purchase kits to test pH at your local nursery. For optimal growing conditions, you should maintain a pH between 5.8 and 6.5.;
, Shrubs are decorative plants, so you want to take advantage of their cosmetic appeal. Use your shrub to conceal unsightly objects on your lawn like air conditioning units. Create privacy by planting a row of tall hedges, or improve the curb appeal of your home with an attractive shrub near the door., New plants come in three varieties, balled and burlapped or B&B shrubs, bare roots shrubs, and containerized shrubs. You’ll need to measure the height of the roots from the ground to the “root flare,” part of the shrub at the base of the trunk where roots begin to spread out. This process is simplest for those shrubs that are bulbed and burlapped or containerized because the roots are tightly confined. Bare roots shrubs take a little more time and effort, but it’s important to measure properly to ensure adequate space for healthy root production.For bulbed and burlapped and containerized shrubs, place the handle of a shovel across the top of the rootball. The distance from the shovel handle to the ground is how deep the hole should be. The hole should be three to five times wider than the rootball at its widest point.
For a containerized plant still in its pot, you can simply measure the height of the pot and subtract any space between the top of the pot and the dirt.For bare roots shrubs, find the darker line around the main trunk of the plant. This is where the plant was previously at ground level, and this line should be replaced at or slightly above ground level. Measure from this line to the bottom of the root system. Spread the roots over the ground gently. Try not to break or bend the roots unnaturally. It may be easiest to create a small mound of dirt, and spread the roots over the sides with the highest point of the mound below the trunk. Measure across the widest point of the root spread. The hole should be three to five times wider than the spread., Once you’ve measured the rootball you want to offer the newly planted roots soft soil that does not prevent or hinder growth. Dig out the soil, and place it on a tarp. Then, thoroughly break up the soil until it is has a granular appearance. Don’t till the earth deeper than is necessary. You’ll want the bottom to be solid to prevent shifting. Make sure the sides of your hole slope out from the middle and do not have a “glazed” appearance. Shoveling compacts the dirt, and the smooth looking soil may block out water or make it difficult for roots to grow., Once you have a hole of the right size, fill it with water. If the water completely drains away within 24 hours, you have good drainage and can place your shrub. If not, wait for the water to completely drain, and attempt the test again. If there is still standing water after 24 hours, consider planting in a different location."

Add a mulch area of a metre /a yard wide and 5 centimeter (2.0 in) / 2"" deep around the tree base.,
Water the tree again and again.,
Stake large trees.,
Remove the stake after a year.",How to Plant a Bare Root Tree," Be careful not to damage any of the roots during the unpacking process. If you do damage a few, nip them off with a pair of sterilized pruners.;
, Allow the tree to soak for 4-6 hours prior to planting. This will allow the roots of the tree to soak up water and not dry out during the initial shock of planting.

, For example, if the tree roots and soil are 50 centimeter (19.7 in) /20"" wide, dig a hole 60 centimeter (23.6 in) /2' wide to allow for maximum root spread.

, If these are left there, they will compete with the new tree and might restrict its growth. Add your organic material to the hold and mix well. This will get your young tree off to a good start.

, This is known as the ""root collar"" and it should be level with the ground. Placing dirt around the tree trunk above the root ball will cause the tree to grow in a way that will make it likely to fall over prematurely.

, Add more if necessary into the hole, taking care to pack the soil firmly around the tree.

, Give the tree plenty of water.

, Be sure not to let the mulch touch the tree itself. Leave an area approximately 10–20 centimeter (3.9–7.9 in) / 4-6"" inches around the trunk of the tree. It allows the tree to breath and a space to check the base for any possible problems or insect damage.

, Water it every two weeks, throughout its first summer. If your area is experiencing a heavy long term drought, do take the time to water your young trees in the winter about every 2 weeks. Trees get very stressed under those type of weather conditions and need the additional moisture to help them survive and thrive.

, If the tree is fairly large, it will need to be staked for a year. Hammer a metre-long (39"") stake into the ground before planting the tree, at a 45 degree angle and for three quarters of its length, in a position so that the top of the stake is above where the tree is being planted. Then tie the tree stem to the stake with a rubber tree tie.

, After one year, the tree should be securely rooted, and the stake will hinder the tree's future growth. Remove the rubber tree tie, and saw off the stake at soil level. Be careful not to injure the young tree accidentally with the saw.

Test how quickly the soil drains at your intended planting site.,
Use a pH test kit to determine the soil pH.,
Dig the planting hole based on the tree’s root ball or root mass.,
Replace the backfill soil if it is sandy or made of heavy clay.,
Choose a maple tree species that will thrive in your USDA hardiness zone and will not outgrow its space.,
Set the tree in the hole standing straight up and fill the hole.,
Spread organic mulch over the soil around the tree.,
Water your new maple tree at least twice a week, giving it 3 to 4 gallons (11.4 to 15.1 L) of water for the first year.",How to Plant a Maple Tree," Maple trees generally thrive in soil with an acidic pH below 6.8 that drains quickly. You can test the soil drainage by digging a 1 ½ foot deep hole and filling the hole with water. Check the hole the following morning. If there is still water in the hole, the soil drains too slowly and will not sustain a maple tree.;
, To test the soil, collect a soil test sample from 4 inches below the surface. Let the soil sample dry before testing it.


Pour the dry sample into a glass jar, add distilled water and the test chemicals, shake it up and let the soil settle to the bottom. Compare the color of the liquid with the test strip that comes with the pH test kit.
You can purchase a pH test kit at your local garden center.
If the soil pH is 6.9 or higher, it would be better to plant another species of tree that will thrive in soil with a neutral to alkaline pH. Soil pH can be adjusted but it is very difficult to maintain a consistently lower pH for the life of a tree.

, If your tree comes with a root ball, dig the planting hole 2 feet wider than the root ball.The hole should be just deep enough to hold the roots with about one-third of the top of the root ball exposed. If it is a bare-root tree, dig the hole 2 feet wider than the root mass when it is spread out. Planting a bare-root tree at this height allows for settling and provides better oxygen flow to the roots.


If the soil is heavy clay, scratch the side walls and bottom of the hole with a hand rake or the tip of a dirt shovel. Heavy clay soil tends to develop a glaze when the dirt shovel slides in, making it difficult for water and tree roots to penetrate it.

, You can replace up to one-third of the backfill soil with well-aged compost or good loamy soil. Improving the soil this way will help the tree flourish early and ease its transition into the native soil.


To improve the existing soil, break up the backfill soil and remove any rocks or hard clumps of dirt. Then, remove it from the planting hole with a shovel and put it into a wheelbarrow. Pour aged cow manure or loamy soil into the wheelbarrow with the backfill soil and mix it thoroughly with a garden hoe or dirt shovel. The resulting mixture should be about two-thirds native soil and one-third manure or loam.
Cow manure and loamy soil are often available at garden supply centers in 10, 20, and 50 pound bags.

, Though maple trees are generally hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 2 to 9, their hardiness can vary depending on the species and cultivar. “Flame” (Acer tataricum subsp. ginnala “Flame”), for example, is an Amur maple cultivar that is hardy in Zones 2 to 8. “October Glory” (Acer rubrum “October Glory”) is a red maple cultivar that is hardy in Zones 4 to 9. Determine if your chosen maple tree species will thrive in your USDA hardiness zone before you plant it.

, Use your backfill soil mixture to fill the hole halfway, and pour 1 to 2 gallons (3.8 to 7.6 L) of water evenly over the soil to remove any air pockets. Then, fill the rest of the hole and pour another 1 to 2 gallons (3.8 to 7.6 L) of water over the soil.


If you are planting a bare-root tree, always plant it a few inches higher than its previous hole. Adjusting the planting height will help the tree to settle and provides better oxygen flow to the roots.

, You should have a depth of 3 to 6 inches of mulch over the soil around the tree, extending out 2 to 3 feet beyond the tree trunk.


Make sure you pull the mulch 3 to 4 inches away from the trunk to help prevent cankers or collar rots, which can occur if wet mulch stays in contact with the bark for too long. The bark where cankers and collar rots develop is usually dark, moist-looking and may ooze sap. When these diseases occur on the tree trunk, the tree will usually die, so always pull you mulch away from the tree trunk.

, The best way to deliver the water is through a garden hose set at a slow trickle. This way the soil will absorb the water better and there will be less runoff. Put the end of the hose on the edge of the root ball and let it run for two to three hours. Check the soil moisture at a depth of 4 to 8 inches before watering again. If the soil is dry or just barely damp, water the tree again.


Your new maple tree may need to be watered more or less often depending on how long the soil retains moisture and how high the temperature gets during the day. Hot summer weather will cause the maple tree to transpire more, so it will need more water.
If the tree branches and leaves start to wilt on your maple tree, it is not getting enough water.

Place the shrub in the hole.,
Cut away burlap, string, and wire.,
Backfill the hole.,
Water the shrub thoroughly.",How to Plant a Shrub2," Always move B&B shrubs by the roots, not the trunk or branches of the plant. This can damage or kill the shrub. Gently place the rootball into the hole keeping the shrub vertical. The root flare should be at or slightly above the natural ground level.The hole should be as deep as the distance between the root flare and the ground.
The hole should be between three and five times wider than the rootball., After the rootball is in the hole, remove as much of these containing materials as possible. While most burlap will disintegrate, it will still impede root growth for several weeks, so it’s better to remove burlap in the beginning. Don’t worry about pulling burlap or wire from below the rootball. These will not affect the ability of roots to grow., Keep adjusting the plant to ensure it stays vertical, and return the soil the hole a few inches at a time. Hold the bush gently and tamp down the dirt with your foot as you refill. Stomp lightly to make sure there are no large air pockets in the dirt, but you don’t want to make the soil so dense it blocks root growth. Continue the process until the entire hole is filled in.


Don’t add fertilizer, peat moss, mulch or other amendments to the natural soil.
Remove any rocks or debris from the soil as you refill.
Create a small ring of raised dirt around the hole to direct water inward to the root system.
Leave a ring around the trunk free of dirt where water can collect and drain down to the roots., Allow the water to soak into the soil for several hours after you plant it, but do not over water. Water the shrub once a week. Dig down two inches. If the soil at this level is moist, you are done watering."
"
Keep roots moist prior to planting.,
Prune dead roots.,
Drench roots before placing.,
Create a cone of dirt in the bottom of the hole.,
Position the shrub.,
Refill the hole.,
Keep the shrub hydrated.",How to Plant a Shrub3," This can be done by soaking the roots in water for several hours each day, or if you need to preserve the root system for a longer period of time, you may want to consider “heeling” the plant. Heeling requires placing the shrub's roots in a shallow hole with light dirt coverage and watering it regularly. This can preserve the plant for up to three months.


Every bare roots shrub is different. Ask your nursery for specific care instructions, and make sure you let the nursery know how long it will be before you plant the shrub.
For plants that need high levels of moisture, you may need to keep the roots submerged until you plant.
For plants that need a lower level of moisture, you can typically keep them sheltered and water the roots several times a day.
Heeling is the best option if you plan to keep the shrub for several days, weeks, or up to three months prior to planting. Dig a shallow trench in the dirt. Lay the roots out resting diagonally along the trench. Cover the roots lightly, and water the soil regularly (several times a week) until you’re ready to plant the shrub., Once you’re ready to move the bare roots shrub from its temporary location to be planted, gently remove any water absorbing materials that are attached to the roots. Examine roots and remove any that are broken or bent. If there are roots that have circled, prune these away as well. Left on the plant, these roots can circle around the trunk, choking it., After pruning, soak the roots in water for at least two hours, but they can soak up to a full day. Fill a bucket or planter with water at a level high enough to fully submerge the root system without stuffing or cramping. This allows the freshly pruned roots to absorb water and ensures ease of root growth after planting. Move the shrub directly from the soaking spot to the hole., This is a supportive structure that allows the roots to rest without bunching below the weight of the shrub. Create a small, dense mound of dirt in the bottom of the hole. Then, place the tip of the cone directly below the trunk where it begins to branch out. Gently, spread the roots around the mound of dirt., Once the roots are spread over the cone of dirt, carefully shift the shrub to a fully vertical, upright position. Make sure the most attractive side of the shrub is facing the direction where it will be viewed most often. Hold the shrub in this position as you refill the hole.The hole should be deep enough to cover the full roots without bunching.
The width of the hole should be at least three times as wide as the fully extended roots, but for the best effect, the hole should be five times the width of the roots., Carefully scoop dirt back into the hole a few inches at a time, taking care not to step on, break, or harm the roots. Unlike bulbed and burlapped or containerized shrubs, do not tamp down the dirt as this may cause root damage. Instead, when the hole is half-filled, water it thoroughly to remove unnecessary air pockets and compact the dirt to support the roots without impeding root growth. Finish filling the hole, and water again., Make an impression around the trunk and a raised ridge around the outside of the hole to direct water towards the roots. Water the shrub thoroughly once a week. To ensure you water the plant adequately, dig down two to three inches in several spots around the plant before you begin watering. Check to see that the soil here is damp but not saturated. When saturated, you will see standing water."

Keep the shrub in the container before planting.,
Remove the plant from the container.,
Prepare the roots.,
Situate the shrub in the hole.,
Replace dirt around the plant.,
Spread mulch around the shrub.,
Water the area.",How to Plant a Shrub4," Ask the garden center or nursery attendant to for any special care instructions necessary while the shrub is still in the container. Water the plant regularly, and keep it in the appropriate amount of sunlight., Carefully move the shrub to the location where it will be planted. Take care to handle the shrub by holding the container. If the plant is very large, ask a friend to help. Never carry the shrub by the trunk or branches. Once in place, carefully tip the container on its side, roll back and forth to loosen the roots, and gently shift the plant out of the pot. Always handle the shrubs by the containerized rootball, but be gentle so as not to damage the roots.If you are struggling to remove the plant, roll the container gently back and forth while pressing down on the sides of the container. This should loosen the plant enough to remove it.
If you’re still unable to remove the shrub, run a spade or shovel around the inside of the container between the pot and the rootball.
You can also use small amounts of water to dampen the soil around the outer edge of the pot.
Most shrubs that are intended to be replanted are kept in plastic pots. If your plant is in a ceramic pot, you can use water to dampen the dirt, and run a shovel between the roots and the container. If you’re still unable to remove the plant from the pot, you may need to break the ceramic away taking care not harm yourself or damage the roots., Once the plant has been removed from its container, examine the rootball carefully. Prune off any broken, bent, or looped roots. Before placing the rootball, cut several vertical lines into the sides. Use a spade or knife to carefully make a ½ inch incision from the top of the containerized rootball to the bottom. Do this evenly spaced around the plant. Typically four incisions are adequate.


If the containerized roots have become bunched, hardened, or have overtaken all of the soil, you may need to purchase a different plant.
If the rootball has many looped roots that are greater than an inch in diameter, there is a high risk that the roots will wrap around the trunk, strangling the shrub. You should consider purchasing a different plant., Once the roots are prepared, place the shrub vertically in the hole. The root ball should be in the center, and the sides of the hole should slope down toward the plant.Make sure the hole is at least as deep as the dirt in the container.
Dig the hole at least three times the width of the diameter of the containerized shrub., When backfilling, replace several inches of soil at a time, and tamp down with the handle of your shovel. The goal is to remove air bubbles that may prevent nutrients and water from reaching the roots, but you don’t want the earth to be packed so firmly that it impedes root growth. Replace the dirt to the original soil line. Leave a small ring around the trunk without dirt, and create a small raised ridge all the way around the hole to direct water to the root system., Mulch insulates the soil and prevents the loss of moisture. If you would like, you can add three to four inches of mulch around the base of the shrub. Create the same ringed indentation around the trunk in the mulch as you did with the soil. Do not pile mulch against the trunk of the shrub., Soak the refilled hole for several hours. Water the shrub thoroughly once a week rather than watering a small amount each day, as this increases the risk for root rot and other plant-based diseases. To determine the earth has reached the appropriate level of moisture, dig a few inches into the soil and check periodically to see if it is damp. You want the soil to be moist, but avoid standing water."

Paint the trunks of fruit- and nut-bearing trees.,
Mix distilled water with white latex paint.,
Use a wide, thick, loosely napped paintbrush.,
Paint from the bottom to the top.,
Apply the paint in a thicker ratio if needed.",How to Paint a Tree1," This procedure has been shown to protect against animals that will eat the bark of the tree, and also protects against boring insects that would otherwise work their way into the trees’ trunks.Paint trees at least annually in the early spring before insects are active.
Painting fruit- and nut-bearing trees can also prevent the bark from splitting;
, This mixture is most effective when combined at a 1:1 ratio. You can simply combine 1 gallon (3.79 liters) of water with 1 gallon (3.79 liters) of paint to achieve the proper consistency.


White paint is more likely to reflect sunlight and, thereby, reduce heat damage.Latex paint contains polymer binders to fill and hold splits and cracks.

, This tool will be most effective and help you reach all the cracks in the bark of the tree. Dip your paintbrush into the water/paint mixture until the bristles are about halfway submerged, then withdraw the brush and apply directly to the tree trunk.


Paint up to the first line of branches. Rodents such as mice, voles, and rabbits will not be able to reach higher than this on the tree, so there’s no need to paint the upper portions of your trees.

, This will ensure maximum coverage of the tree trunk, and will allow the paint to seep into gaps or cracks in the bark.


Allow excess paint to drip down the trunk as you go. You don’t need to wipe up or clean dripping paint.
Use an airless paint sprayer if speed and convenience are a priority, but make sure paint still reaches into cracks and splits in the bark.

, In instances where boring insects are persistent or not discouraged by the 1:1 mixture of latex paint and water, you may need to apply the paint at a thicker consistency.Start with a 3:1 mixture of paint to water. If this still doesn’t deter boring insects, you may need to apply the latex paint directly to the tree trunk.

Identify pruned or damaged areas on trees.,
Paint trees to help prevent fungi.,
Remove loose bark and dirt before you paint.,
Choose a brand of tree paint.,
Apply a thick coat of commercial wound dressing.",How to Paint a Tree2," This practice is especially common among orchards where trees are pruned. Although there is no substantial evidence to support this claim, painting the wounded or pruned sections of a tree has traditionally been thought to protect the exposed area from invading insects, and to allow the tree to heal more quickly.This practice is also commonly referred to as “wound dressing.”

, Despite the general ineffectiveness of wound dressing to help trees recover from damage, the procedure has been shown to have some use in preventing fungal infection.Tree painting may also be useful in preventing oak wilt. This disease is caused by a fungal pathogen, and effects trees primarily in the Eastern United States. Tree paint should be applied to trees pruned or wounded in this region—especially if the pruning is done during the spring or summer.Oak-wilt spores are carried by insects, and tree paint is a sufficient deterrent to keep the insects from boring into the exposed tree wood and spreading oak wilt.

, You want the paint to adhere to the cut or wounded portion of the wood, not to any remnants of bark that may still be on the wood.


It’s best to wear thick work gloves while you’re brushing the bark and dirt off of a tree. Otherwise you may wind up with a hand full of splinters.

, Your local hardware store will stock a variety of tree paint brands. Work with the sales staff to choose one that best suits your needs.


Avoid tree paints that contain asphalt, as these can raise the internal temperature of a tree to a harmful level. , When applying, fully cover the wounded or pruned area with a thick layer of paint. In addition to covering the exposed wood, you should also paint up to 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) beyond the edge of the cut.


This extra coverage will seal the wound’s edges and prevent any boring insects from sneaking in around the perimeter of the painted area.

"
"
Avoid painting damaged trees when possible.,
Recognize the potential harms of wound dressing.,
Assist the tree in healing itself organically.,
Let the tree compartmentalize the wounded area.,
Prune trees correctly.",How to Paint a Tree3," Although the method of applying petroleum-based paints to damaged or pruned trees has persisted (and many hardware stores stock wound-dressing products), it has not been shown to help trees.Wound dressing trees may prevent the trees from forming callouses, which trees use to protected wounded areas.
Dark-colored tree paint—especially paint that contains asphalt—on a tree’s trunk will raise the tree’s temperature, often to a harmful degree., Contrary to helping a wounded or pruned tree, wound dressing can actually be harmful.


Painting tree wounds may interfere with the tree’s growth of “scar tissue”-like wood.Wound dressing can also seal in excess moisture (which is unhealthy for the tree) and can trap harmful bacteria and fungi inside of the tree., In most cases, trees do not need to be painted in order to resist fungal or insect infestations. Trees already have natural methods of protecting and defending themselves from foreign invaders, and do not need human help.If you prefer to take an active role, apply an organic dressing that contains beeswax and lanolin to protect the wound’s surface moisture.
You may also apply a light coating of insecticide or fungicide to the wounded or pruned wood., Unlike human bodies, trees do not “heal” wounded flesh. Rather, they use a process called compartmentalization, by which a tree can internally seal off damaged areas This is a natural process, and one which trees do not need assistance to perform. The scar tissue that develops from compartmentalization protects the tree from fungus and blocks the undamaged parts of the tree from invasive insects.
Just below the bark on a tree are systems that carry nutrients and fluids throughout the tree. These will transfer nutrients within the tree and help compartmentalize when a section has been damaged.

, Often tree wound dressing is applied to poorly pruned trees, in an effort to “heal” them from the effects of poor pruning. If a tree is properly pruned, the tree will not need to be painted.When you prune a limb, cut as close to the trunk as you can. Make the cut close to vertical (do not prune tree limbs at an angle). The vertical cut will have a smaller surface area than a diagonal cut, and will leave the tree with less surface area exposed.
Prune trees in the winter, when their growth has slowed and insect infection rates are lower."

Research the trees on your property to learn how to water them properly.,
Understand your climate to anticipate and factor expected yearly rainfall levels.

,
Water trees under two years old around the root zone at least once a week during the summer and no more than once every three weeks in colder months.

,
Consider the type of soil when watering trees.,
Soak the soil long enough without over-saturating it.

,
Adjust tree watering according to weather conditions in your area.,
Hydrate trees from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.

,
Water trees as the climate in your area necessitates when they reach the age of 2 years old.",How to Water Trees,"


Each type of tree has different watering needs. For example, trees like Arizona cypress and Mugo pine do well in dry climates while trees such as red maple and paper birch thrive in climates with moist soil conditions.
If it's a particularly dry year, more tree watering might be necessary.;
,,,


Trees in deep, rich soil need less water, while trees planted in shallow, sandy soil require more water.
The time it takes to accomplish this will depend on the type of watering method you use. For example, a hose set on full stream should take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes for proper tree watering.

,,


Young trees especially need more water if temperatures are high and it has not rained for a while.
Because it is cooler with less sunlight during this time frame, less of the water will evaporate.

,,


Once trees are mire than 2 years old, they have well-established root systems and should only need to be watered in extremely dry conditions.

Know the 5 basic techniques of trimming shrubs.,
Learn how to trim a shrub correctly because the life and health of the plant is at stake.,
Prune regularly when the shrub needs upkeep.,
Remember that trimming includes pruning branches, removing flower buds, seed pods and roots.,
Cut the portion of the shrub with a blade that is sterile.,
Clean the blade after every cut.,
Aspire to create tree form plants or espalier.,
Stimulate shrub recovery when it is suffering from transplant shock through trimming.,Eliminate low-growth of branches in case of nearby traffic.,
Thin branches so that sunlight reaches plants underneath the shrubs.

,
Enhance the flowering of shrubs.",How to Trim Shrubs," Depending on the plant, one or more techniques may be necessary. Ideal trimming is a compilation of several of the methods.


Pinching removes the terminal part of a green shoot before it is firm and woody. Pinch anytime, except late summer, by pinching or cutting an excessively long shoot so that side branching is promoted.






Heading back removes the terminal part of a woody branch all the way to the healthy branch or bud. Shape is influenced by heading back so the plant grows denser. Cut bottom buds to stifle growth and allow top buds to encourage growth.






Thinning occurs by cutting the branch at the point of origin of the parent stem to a branch that is lateral at the ground level, or at the Y of the branch section. Trim 1/3 the diameter of the branch to be removed. Use pruning shears, a saw or lopper to thin the tallest and oldest stems.






Renewal pruning, also known as rejuvenation, is the removal of the oldest branches to the ground, small stems and lively plants can also be cut back. This method can also include cutting all branches back to the same height every year.






Shearing is the cutting of terminal shoots with hedge clippers or shearers. Foundation plants tend to have this technique used on them but shearing should not be done when creating formal hedges. The natural shape of the shrub is destroyed when shearing is executed.





;
, Too little, too late or too often trimming can all have dire consequences for the shrub.


Gardeners wrongly wait to trim when the shrub outgrows the space it's currently located in. Other gardeners trim annually in the spring even if the shrub does not require cuts. Some gardeners neglect to trim until the shrub is overcome with diseased, dying or dead parts.

, Timely maintenance prevents corrective trimming later. When shrubs are trimmed, plant health is reinvigorated and remedial trimming is averted.

Shrub health is maintained by trimming the diseased, dead or dying branches or wood. When portions of the shrub are not healthy, disease and insects enter through that weakened plant section and then may spread to other parts of the shrub. A trim is the best protection to prevent a shrub from becoming infected with disease.







, If the portion of the plant is dying, diseased or dead, wherever the weakened shrub is located, it should be trimmed.

, A sterile blade removes the hazard of infecting a shrub further with disease. The cut should also be made in the healthy portion of the branch rather than in the infected or dead area.

, The blade should be dipped into a disinfectant of 1 part chlorine bleach for every 9 parts of water or 70 percent wood alcohol. Disease is spread if the blade is not disinfected after each cut.

, This special effect borders on shrub preventative maintenance and art. Trial and error as well as practice and patience are necessary when entering the creative world of tree forming.

, Shrubs that are damaged from construction work can also be refreshed with trimming.

,,, Mature plants produce smaller flowers more often. Wood is reduced when trimming occurs. The lesser amount of wood prevents energy so that flowers are fewer but larger.

"
"
Wait until the right time of year to trim trees.,
Gather the necessary tools and equipment.,
Decide which branches to remove.,
Trim starting at the bottom of the tree and move upward and from the inside and move outward.,
Cut right above where the branch or new growth attaches to the trunk or main branch.This area is called the branch collar or abscission zone.,
Use a handheld pruner to trim new growth and small branches you can reach from the ground or safely from a ladder.

,
Make selective cuts to reduce the tree's size without dramatically altering its natural shape.,
When removing large branches first make a cut on the underside of the branch( a foot away from the trunk) Cut 1/3 of the way through from the bottom of the branch to the top of the branch without pinching the saw.",How to Trim Trees," Trim deciduous and fruit trees when they are dormant, flowering trees after the blooms fade and evergreens during springtime or their growing season.;
, You'll need a handheld pruner and a larger lopping shears to trim branches that are small to medium-sized. For mature trees, you'll need a pole pruner to safely reach high branches and a handsaw or chainsaw to remove thick limbs.Wear eyeglasses in accordance with ANSI standards or risk your vision! You might also need a ladder.

,


Identify dead or diseased branches.
Look for crisscrossing branches that are making contact with each other or about to. When branches rub against each other, the resulting wound makes the tree more susceptible to disease.
Examine the tree for branches extending inward, rather than outward. These should be removed to avoid crowding, so sunlight can reach the leaves at the tree's interior.
Stand back and look at the shape of the tree. Identify any branches that make the tree look misshapen.
Look for branches that need to be removed to reduce the size of the tree. Limbs that are too close to the house should be removed. They can cause damage to the house when blowing in the wind as well as allow insects and animals to reach your house.
Branches that are below head height on more mature trees should be removed. This is called ""raising the canopy.""
Check for new growth along the trunk and main branches, called ""water sprouts,"" and from the roots, called ""suckers."" This is known as epicormic growth and these branches are more susceptible to disease and breakage.

, This will help you to keep a natural shape to the tree.

, Do not cut the branch collar because this is where the tree will heal and close up the wound.

,, If you want the tree to grow upward, rather than outward, cut an outward branch right below a side branch that stretches upward.

, Second make a cut on the top of branch outwards from the first cut. Make the second cut all the way through. The first cut prevents the branch from tearing the trunk bark. Lastly remove the stub above the branch collar, which is where it widens before reaching the trunk. This will allow a callous to form over the wound. If you make the cut flush with the trunk, it won't be able to heal properly and will be more susceptible to disease.( Some tree like pines need to be cut back all the way to the trunk)

Identify whether the hibiscus plant is tropical or hardy.,
Feed the hibiscus with a potassium fertilizer in late fall/early winter.,
Care for the hibiscus plant throughout the fall months.,
Apply a heavy layer of mulch to the soil around the plant.,
Protect the hibiscus plants from frost.,
Transplant tropical hibiscus into pots.,
Check the container-grown hibiscus for any signs of infestation.,
Rinse the plant before bringing it indoors.,
Fertilize the plant.,
Prune the hibiscus plant to make it more manageable.,
Look up care instructions for your specific variety of hibiscus.,
Provide the hibiscus with warmth and/or light.,
Keep the temperature above 55 °F (13 °C), if possible.,
Prevent the leaves from becoming scorched.,
Make sure that the soil is kept moist.",How to Winterize a Perennial Hibiscus," Before you make plans to winterize your hibiscus, it's important to identify whether it is a hardy or tropical variety. Hardy varieties can survive the winter outdoors in zones higher than 5(see tips for more info), but tropical varieties will need to be transplanted to a container and moved indoors once temperatures drop below 50 °F (10 °C).


Tropical varieties typically have dark, glossy leaves and smaller flowers. Their flowers are more likely to be bi-colored, but some solid color varieties do exist. Temperatures below 25 °F (−4 °C) will prove fatal to these plants.
Hardy hibiscuses have rougher, duller leaves and huge blossoms. They are more resistant to cold temperatures than their tropical contemporaries.;
, Feed the hibiscus plant with a potassium fertilizer in October or November to encourage profuse blooming the following year.


Do not give it a nitrogen at this time - nitrogen will encourage new leafy growth that will only be damaged by cold weather or lost during the winter.

, Water the hibiscus generously once every week or two if it does not rain. Clear any fallen leaves and other debris away from the stems to help prevent disease.


These few extra steps in the fall will help them rebound in the spring to return with a flourish of lush green foliage and beautiful flowers.
Once you have mulched the soil you will no longer have to perform these actions.

, Heavy layers of mulch will protect the hibiscuses from any unexpected dips in temperature. Adding a layer of compost under the mulch may also help protect these plants.


Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of organic mulch over the root zone but keep the mulch a few inches away from the stems.
If it already has mulch around it, loosen the mulch with a rake and add new mulch, if necessary, to bring the total depth up to 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm).

, The effects of freezing temperatures can be somewhat negated by using frost cloths. Areas that don’t get a lot of frost can protect plants during uncharacteristically cold winters by using Christmas tree lights strung over the plant and plugged into to the nearest outlet.


These lights can be utilized in conjunction underneath frost cloths or they can be used on their own.

, If your tropical hibiscus is planted in the ground, you will need to transfer it to a large container so it can be overwintered indoors. Use houseplant potting soil when replanting, rather than garden soil.


To dig up the hibiscus, push the shovel into the soil 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the stems, all the way around the hibiscus to sever the root. Then lift it with the tip of the shovel.

, Gardeners should carefully check their container-grown hibiscuses for any sign of insects a few days before temperatures are due to start dropping.


If harmful insects are noted, gardeners should apply a suitable pesticide. This is best done a few days before bringing the hibiscus indoors, especially if one has family members that are prone to allergies.

, It’s a good idea to rinse the plants off a few times before bringing them indoors. This helps get rid of any bugs that may be lurking in the foliage as well as any dirt or pollen that might still be on the leaves.


Wiping down the container that the hibiscus is in with a damp rag will also help to reduce the amount of dirt and allergens that are brought inside.

, Adding a time-released fertilizer such as Osmocote to the plant before bringing it indoors can be helpful, because hibiscuses that are fertilized regularly will return more quickly in the spring.

, Plants that have gotten too large may need to be pruned before the winter Hibiscuses are generally tolerant of heavy pruning so clipping them into shape shouldn’t cause any problems.


Since hibiscuses bloom on new stem growth, fall pruning will help them bloom more profusely the following spring and summer.
To get even more flowers, pinch the tips of the new stems after they get to about 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, and again when they reach 1 foot (0.3 m) long. Pinching will cause more branching, resulting in an abundance of new stems and flowers.

, Once indoors for the winter, the hibiscus will still need proper care if it is to survive the long months ahead. Gardeners are advised to look up the plant that they have and treat it accordingly rather than make general assumptions.


However, if the plant tag is lost or if the plant was a gift from friends, this article will provide some tips that apply to most hibiscuses.

, Hibiscuses need both warmth and light to flourish indoors, but will take the warmth over the light if they must. Ideally, these plants should be placed beside a window in the toastiest possible location.


Plants that spend their winters in a room with no windows or in one that has low lighting will benefit from having their own lamp. However, gardeners should take care to keep the device far enough away from the plants that it doesn’t burn them.
Hibiscuses kept in outbuildings will likely need a heater of some type to keep them warm enough to survive but even a tiny space heater will adequately serve this purpose.

, Tropical plants generally prefer for the temperature to remain above 55 °F (13 °C). However, cold tolerance does vary by species and gardeners will need to check their plant’s specific needs.

, Direct sunlight is recommended for most hibiscus species but some can take a bit less. If the leaves on the plant begin to appear browned or scorched, it might be best to move them to a situation with less light.

, Water the hibiscus according to the individual varieties needs. For example:


In the wintertime, Chinese Hibiscuses (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) will only need to be watered enough to keep the soil from drying out, while Mallow cultivars (Hibiscus moscheutos) will require moderate levels of moisture.
Gardeners should be aware that the Mallow types do not handle drought or being overwatered very well.

Prune young oaks in mid to late winter, or January through March.,
Establish a dominant leader branch.,
Make cuts outside the branch collar.,
Keep the crown of the tree full.,
Keep trimming each year to shape your tree.",How to Trim Oak Trees1," Trimming your tree during the winter months allows it to care for its wounds in spring when it will recover more quickly.Limit trimming only to dead or broken branches on newly planted trees.
Two to three years after planting you can begin developmental trimming to shape the tree.
Learn the growth habits of your particular type of oak tree;
, To create a healthy oak tree that create beautiful shade, you need to develop one dominant branch on the tree. Look at your tree and notice the largest branches. There maybe 2 or even 3 branches that are all large and a similar size to each other. As the tree grows, these will turn into multiple leaders and create a weaker tree.


Decide which branch looks like it is the most vertical and centered on the trunk and choose that one to be the dominant leader.Trim the other branches that may turn into other leaders by reducing their size to allow more sunlight to reach the dominant leader you chose.
Keep the dominant leader long.

, The branch collar is the swelling at the base of the branch where it begins to connect to the trunk. Trimming branches down to the branch collar will hurt the main trunk of the tree causing it damage to important tissues necessary for growth.









Shorten large branches by cutting them back to a lateral branch or bud.
Always make angled cuts to encourage growth

, Never remove more that one third of the tree’s canopy in a single season. The tree depends on a healthy crown to create food from the sunlight and grow healthy roots in the ground. This is especially important when the tree is young., You need to prune young trees yearly to keep them growing healthily. Make sure the dominant leader is always the largest branch and trim back any large splits. Trim the branches that will prevent your tree from growing how you want it to:Dead, diseased, or broken branches
Branches that cross over or rub other branches
Inward growing branches
Branches that are growing directly on top of other branches

"
"
Trim with a purpose.,
Cut the top and bottom of large branches.,
Allow the tree to heal the cut.",How to Trim Oak Trees2," Pruning branches from mature trees takes a lot of weight off the tree and can change the shape drastically, so it is important to really think about which branches you are going to trim before you make the cut. Pruning branches from mature trees should only be done for specific purposes:Removing dead, diseased or broken branches
Remove branches to create more sunlight or air flow to the canopy of the tree. Be careful doing this as you don’t want to “thin out” the canopy.

, Making a single cut to large branches may cause them to tear off the tree and rip off the bark as they fall. Proper trimming ensures healthy bark:Make an undercut on the branch about 1 to 2 feet out from the branch collar, or the point where it connects to the trunk.
Make a second cut on the top of the branch a few inches farther out that the undercut.
This prevents the falling branch from tearing the bark off of the trunk.
After the bulk of the branch falls, you can trim back the 1 to 2 feet the you left on the tree by cutting it at an angle 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) from the branch collar.

, After pruning the branches from your oak tree, leave the wound alone to let the tree heal itself in the open air.


Prune carefully to not injure the tree excessively, and make sure the tree has plenty of water.
Trees will naturally seal cuts; it is not necessary to apply an artificial sealant as this may trap microorganisms inside the tree and lead to disease.

Select a sapling to transplant.,
Choose a suitable spot to receive the new transplant.,
Dig the hole to receive the transplant first.,
Dig up the transplant tree.,
Remove the sapling by grabbing it near the ground and lifting it straight out of the hole.,
Place the sapling in the hole you have dug at the new location.,
Fill the hole level with the adjacent ground.,
Re water the tree after the initial watering has soaked in.,
Stake the sapling.",How to Transplant a Young Tree," The sapling will need to be small enough that you can dig up its root system with it - about no more than 2 or 3 inches / 5 cm - 7.6 cm thick at the base. Also, you need to make sure that it is a variety that can handle the stress of transplanting - sometimes this will just have to be a case of trial and error if you do not know. Some good varieties include oak, birch, magnolia, dogwoods, eucalyptus and tea tree.;
, The soil will need to be a similar type, with similar drainage and sun exposure for the new tree to thrive.

, Estimate how large the root system will be when you dig it out. Allow for the root system to go into the ground to the same depth it was originally at. If the soil is extremely hard or compacted, you will want to dig the hole much larger to loosen the soil around the perimeter to make it easier for the roots to spread when they begin to grow outward. Normally on a transplanted tree you will want to hold off fertilizing until it begins to get established. Adding too much fertilizer or adding it too early will tend to stimulate the tree to put more growth out than the stressed roots can support.

, You will need to begin by cutting a circle around the root system of the sapling with a sharp, round pointed shovel. Make your cuts about 12 inches / 30.5 cm from the base of the tree, as deep as you can, so that you preserve the roots intact. If the ground is firm enough and has moisture, often you can cut around and down below the main root mass and remove it intact without disturbing the roots. If the soil is very dry, you should water it thoroughly before beginning to dig. If the soil is loose and sandy, you will need a sheet of plastic or some cloth to set the sapling on to support it during the move.

, If it has a large taproot or large roots extending out from the trunk that are not cut through, you will either have to dig until you reach these or find another suitable tree. When you force these roots out of the ground you will probably do severe damage to all the roots, and the chances of success are much less. If you have pulled the tree up with most of the roots still in soil, you can carry it a short distance to replant it. If it is to be loaded and hauled to another location, set it in the center of your plastic or burlap fabric, drawn this material around it to support the roots and soil, and tie it off around the trunk. Any shaking, jarring, or other action to the root ball will decrease the chances the tree will survive by loosening the soil around the roots and allowing air to reach them, causing them to dry out.

, Make sure that the sapling is at the same depth as when you removed it. Ease loose soil in around it to support it, watering as you do so, to eliminate voids or air pockets, but not so much that you wash the soil from the roots.

, Use the excess soil that should remain, build a small dike or earth dam about 3 inches / 7.6 cm high around it, some 2 feet (0.6 m) / 61 cm or so from the trunk. This will keep water from running off when you water the tree.

, This should help the soil to settle and you can assist to refill the hole by adding more dirt.

, If there is a danger of high wind blowing the sapling down before the soil is compacted and the roots begin growing out to establish a new foot hold. This can be done by driving some re-bar, pipe, or wooden stakes spaced around the tree about 3 feet (0.9 m) / 91 cm from the trunk, and tying wire or strong string wrapped around the trunk loosely at the lower branches to these stakes. You may want to wrap the string or wire with a split cut off piece of garden hose where it contacts the tree to keep it from chaffing the bark there.

,, The leaves of the pohutukawa will appear white underneath and feel velvety to the touch. This velvet-like layer is made of many tiny hairs that slow the evaporation of water and protect the stomata from salt water. There will also be white branchlets. The leaves grow opposite one another, in pairs.


The leaves are wax-like and waterproof, and they're often curled under at the edges; this habit allows salty water to run off.

The Loblolly Pine reaches an average height of 30-35m (98-115ft) and 7-11m (23-36ft) wide with a trunk diameter of  0.4-1.5m (1.3-4.9ft).  Very large specimens may reach 50m (160ft) in height.
The Longleaf Pine grows to a similar height, however it remains more slender, with a trunk diameter of just 70cm or 28in.

,


The Loblolly Pine has scaly gray-brown bark and pale blue-green needles that range in length from 10–23 centimeter (3.9–9.1 in), and occur in bundles of three.
The Longleaf Pine has scaly red-brown bark and dark green needles that range in length from 20–45 centimeter (7.9–18 in) (8-18in) and also occur in bundles of three - often twisted.

,


Both share a medium to fine-grained texture.
With both species, the heartwood is reddish-brown and the sapwood is yellowish-white.

,


Loblolly Pine tends to have less mass and density than Longleaf Pine:  35 pounds per cubic foot compared to 41 pounds per cubic foot.
Both suffer from comparative shrinkage ratios, with Loblolly pine shrinking only slightly less.

The container you use should be approximately 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) deep.;
, Using a sharp, clean knife, trim just beneath the node of an established photinia shrub. The cutting you take should be between 2 and 4 inches (5 and 10 cm) long.


Growth hormones are concentrated in the space just beneath a node, so taking the cutting from that point will help stimulate root production.
Pinch off the soft tip and remove any lower leaves from the cutting.

, Poke a hole in the compost using your finger or a clean chopstick. Insert the bottom third of the cutting into that hole.


Photinia cuttings tend to root well without the use of hormone treatment, but if desired, you can coat the exposed bottom of the cutting with a hormone powder before planting it.If rooting more than one cutting, space each cutting 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart.

, Apply enough water to the compost to thoroughly moisten it. Allow any excess water to drain.


In addition to feeding the cuttings, the water will help settle the compost and prevent the cuttings from shifting around too much.

, Cover the cuttings with plastic bags and place them in a warm location. They should receive plenty of indirect sunlight, as well.


Remove the bag twice a week for 10 minutes to help ventilate the cuttings and prevent fungi from growing.
Another option would be to place the container in a closed propagator case that provides steady bottom heat between 64 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 and 24 degrees Celsius)., The cuttings should take root within six to ten weeks.


During this time, the compost must remain warm and moist. You may need to mist it with a spray bottle every few days. Apply water directly to the soil and not to the cutting itself.
Any dead, dying, or diseased plant matter should be discarded at least once a week during this process.

, After roots develop, you should place each cutting in its own pot. Allow the cuttings to continue growing for another two weeks in this manner.


Fill the individual containers with the same cutting compost (one part free-draining compost, one part sand or perlite).
These containers should be about twice as deep as your initial cuttings tray.
Cover the cuttings with plastic bags again, but remove the plastic bags for 10 to 30 minutes each day. Doing so will help harden the cuttings, making them durable enough to transplant.

, Seedlings and rooted cuttings are typically transplanted during the early to mid spring, after the threat of frost has passed.


If you started your cuttings early in the summer, though, they might be ready to transplant by mid autumn. Even so, you should only transplant cuttings in autumn if the soil is still warm and the threat of frost is still two or more weeks away.

, Photinia should be planted in an area that receives full sun to partial shade.


You can grow photinia in areas of full shade, but the shrub will yield fewer flowers and will be more susceptible to leaf spot and other fungi.
If you live in USDA Zone 6, you will need to choose a growing site that sits on the southern or western side of a building. The structure can help protect photinia from harsh winter winds that could otherwise kill the plant., These shrubs will grow best in soil that is fertile and well-draining. This may mean that you will need to amend the soil before planting any seedlings.If you have clay soil or other poorly drained soil, you should mix in few handfuls of well-rotted compost or manure before transplanting your seedling. Coarse agricultural sand can be used to improve soil drainage, as well.
The soil should also be neutral to mildly acidic, with a pH range between 3.7 and 7.3.If the soil is too alkaline, you may need to add agricultural lime, hardwood ash, manure, or potassium carbonate to help drop the pH.
Mix any soil amendments into the soil at a depth between 6 and 12 inches (15 and 30 cm).

, Use a trowel or small shovel to dig a hole that roughly matches the depth of the seedling's current container. The hole should also be about twice as wide in diameter as the current container.

, Carefully remove the seedling from its current container and place it in the center of the planting hole. Back-fill the hole with soil, patting the soil firmly into place with your hands or the back of your trowel.


To remove the seedling, carefully tip the current container onto its side and attempt to slide the seedling out. If the container is made from flimsy plastic, you can squeeze the sides to help coax the plant out. Otherwise, slide your trowel along one inner side of the container and use the leverage to help lift the plant out from beneath its root mass.

, Photinia plants need plenty of circulation to thrive. For most varieties, separate photinia shrubs should be planted 15 feet (5 m) apart.


Crowded photinia do not receive enough air circulation. When these shrubs lack proper circulation, they can quickly become victims of leaf spot and other fungi.

, Once all of your photinia shrubs have been planted in your garden, water the soil at the base of each plant using a watering can or garden hose.


The soil should be notably damp after you water it. You won't need to apply as much water later on, but this initial heavy dose gives each plant the boost it needs to survive the transplanting process. The water also helps settle the soil.

, When watering your photinia shrub, use a watering can to apply water directly to the soil. Do not allow any water to get on the leaves, flowers, berries, or stems.


Wet leaves are more likely to become infected with leaf spot or other fungal diseases.
Photinia do best when watered regularly, but established shrubs can tolerate mild drought. As a general rule, make sure that each photinia plant receives at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water on a weekly basis. Provide more or less water as needed depending on the health of your plant. Yellowing leaves usually indicate an over-watered plant. Wilted leaves can indicate an under-watered plant.

, Apply a balanced fertilizer in the spring to encourage new growth.


A “balanced” fertilizer contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
Do not fertilize photinia in the summer. Doing so can promote new growth late in the season. New growth that appears later in the season will be weaker against disease and frost.
The exact amount of fertilizer needed will vary on the type and brand you choose, so follow the label instructions to determine the proper dosage. Usually, you should apply fertilizer in the early morning or evening after watering the plant.

, Yearly pruning is vital since good air circulation is required for the long-term health of the plant. Prune once at the beginning of winter and once more at the start of spring.


Avoid pruning the plant during the active growing season. New growth is weaker and more likely to fall victim to leaf spot and other diseases.
In the winter, remove any diseased, damaged, or dead wood. Look for crowded areas and remove the weakest and most poorly positioned branches within those areas. Thinning the plant out improves air circulation and reduces the risk of disease.
In the spring, do some light pruning after the red growth begins to fade to encourage new growth. Remove the tips of new shoots as they first appear, cutting them just above an outward facing bud.
Remove any infected plant material or fallen leaves as soon as you spot them. Do not wait until a winter or spring pruning to do so.

, Spread approximately 2 inches (5 cm) of organic mulch around the bottom of the photinia plant. Do this once in early to mid spring and once more in late autumn.


Always rake away any old mulch and debris before applying new mulch.
Autumn mulch protects the plant against frost and other winter injury.
Spring mulch keeps the soil adequately moist and minimizes potential weed problems.

, Entomosporium leaf spot is the most common problem faced by photinia plants. As soon as you see early signs of leaf spot, you should treat the shrub with an appropriate fungicide.Entomosporium leaf spot can be identified in it early stages by a splattering of small red spots over the upper and lower surfaces of new leaves. These spots gradually spread and deepen in color as the disease progresses.
Choose a fungicide labeled for use against leaf spot. Formulas containing chlorothalonil, propiconazole, or myclobutanil are usually best.
Photinia plants are weak against several other diseases, too. These include mildew, leaf spots, and fireblight. Scale insects can also cause problems. Each of these issues should be treated with an appropriate fungicide or pesticide as soon as they are noticed.
Apply your chosen fungicide (or pesticide) directly to diseased areas and new growth. Re-apply every 7 to 14 days until the problem disappears.
Never apply fungicides and pesticides during hot, dry weather. For best results, apply the chemical in the early morning (before the heat of the afternoon sets in) or in the evening.

Determine what type of tree you plan to grow.,
Contact local agencies.,
File a tax exemption.,
Manage the tree farm.",How to Start a Tree Farm,"


The type of tree you plan to grow depends on your location and climate. Individuals who live in northern climates will fare best with evergreen, apple or pear trees. In contrast, those who live in warmer locales can grow peaches, plums and even citrus trees.
Water accessibility, sun exposure and soil content can also play a big role in determining what type of tree will grow best.;
, In most cases, the forest service in your state will oversee your tree farm.


The forest service in your state will provide guidance regarding growing, cutting, and selling your trees and can help in the creation of a management plan. In addition, state forest services can often aid in the certification of a tree farm.

, Be aware that it may take several months for the tax exemption to be received after it has been filed.


Not all individuals who manage tree farms will receive a tax exemption. Often, the granting of a tax exemption is based on the size and type of tree farm, as well as the quality of the soil in which the trees are grown.

,


Trimming, watering and ensuring overall tree maintenance are required year-round.
While small farms may be maintained by one individual, larger facilities may require the aid of numerous employees.
Make sure that the individuals in charge of tree care are experienced working with the specific variety for best results.

Find a maple tree.,
Know when to tap.,
Gather your supplies.,
Decide where to tap.,
Drill your hole.,
Put the spile in the tree.,
Hang your bucket.,
Wait for your sap.",How to Tap a Tree for Maple Syrup1," The most important step in the process of tapping a tree for maple is finding just the right tree. Look for a maple tree that is at least 12 inches in diameter and has a lot of direct sunlight.


Maple trees that give the most sap are of the sugar or black variety. Red and silver maple trees will also provide sap, but not as much as the other two species. One overlooked tree for sugary sap is the Black Walnut.
Avoid unhealthy trees that have been damaged in the past. They will not provide as much sap as a big, strong, healthy tree.
You can tap a single tree multiple times if it is large and healthy enough. For a tree 12-20 inches in diameter, a single tap is all that can be used. For a tree 21-27 inches wide, you can use up to two taps. A tree can have three taps if it is wider than 28 inches across.
Trees with a larger crown - all the branches and leaves - typically give more sap than trees with a smaller crown.;
, The best time to tap your tree depends on your location, but it generally ranges from mid-February to mid-March. It should be above freezing (32 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day, and drop below freezing at night.









The fluctuating temperatures cause the sap to flow, moving it from the tree trunk and branches to the roots below the ground.
Sap flows for around 4-6 weeks, but this depends on the health of the tree and the environment.
Generally, the best sap is gathered at the beginning of the flow.

, To tap a maple tree, you will need a bucket with a cover (to keep things from falling in), a spile, and a drill. It may also be helpful to have a large clean trash can or similar vat to use as storage for all the sap you will tap.









Thoroughly clean the spile, bucket, and cover with bleach and water. Make sure that they are completely dry before use.
For your drill, you will need either a 7/16 or 5/16 drill bit.

, Find the ideal place on the tree to tap. You want it to be convenient to reach in healthy wood. Tap the side of the tree that gets the most sun throughout the day, ideally the south side.









If you can, it is best to tap above a large root or below a large branch.
If the tree you are tapping has been tapped in the past, make sure that your new spile is inserted at least 6 inches away from the old hole.
Place the tap in a healthy section of wood. If you drill and the shavings are light brown or tan, the wood is healthy. If you drill and the shavings are dark brown or chocolate-y colored, find a new place to tap.
Drill on a sunny day when it is a bit warmer out to minimize the chance of splitting the wood.

, Hold the drill as an angle going slightly upwards to make sap flow easier. Drill in about 2.5 inches.









To know how far to drill, you can tape around your drill bit 2.5 inches from the end prior to drilling.
Use a sharp drill bit to avoid creating a rough hole, which can decrease the amount of sap that is released.
Remove all wood shavings from the hole once you’ve finished drilling.

, Tap it in using a rubber mallet or hammer to ensure it is sturdy enough that it cannot be pulled out easily by hand.








Don’t hit the spile into the tree too hard, or else you run the risk of splitting the wood.
If you do not want to buy a spile, you can make your own using ⅜” aluminum piping. Avoid using copper, as it is toxic to the tree. Widen one end so that it can be used as a spout to pour the sap into your bucket.

, Attach it to the end of the spile, or if you made your own use a bit of wire to hook it to your spout.









Make sure that the bucket is secure, so that it cannot accidentally be knocked off or blown off by the wind.
Put the cover over the top of the bucket to prevent debris from entering your sap store.

, Collect it daily in the afternoons when it is the warmest outside. If the weather is good, you will be able to collect sap for just over one month.









A healthy tree can provide between 10–80 gallons (37.9–302.8 L) of sap, depending on environmental conditions.
Sap will stop flowing if the daytime temperature does not rise above freezing, or if the nighttime temperature stays above freezing and becomes too warm.
Collect all your sap into a large container, such as an empty (clean) trash can. Otherwise, you will have many full buckets taking up space.
If the temperature rises above 45 °F (7 °C), the sap must be refrigerated. Otherwise, it will spoil and begin to grow bacteria.

Take a big knife, and skin the bark up from the tree.,
Break off a few branches on the tree, and discard it.,
Avoid making a ring around the tree when taking the bark off.,
Wait to see if the tree produces fruit after healing.",How to Help Make a Tree Produce (Skinning Bark Method)," Remember not to skin all the way to the middle of the tree- only take enough to bark to make the tree think it's injured.;
, Make sure the branches are medium-sized. It's like pruning a tree, only pruning off more than you normally would. Breaking small ones off won't do any good, but you certainly don't want to break off large ones. You may accidentally kill the tree instead of helping it produce.

, It is possible for the tree to die this way. You only want to create a wound in one part of the tree's body, and cutting a circle in the bark is more harmful than helpful.

, If the wounds have healed and there is no sign of anything being produced, you may need to try again. If this method simply isn't working for you, seek another way to help your tree thrive by looking it up on wikiHow, or going to a gardener's website to see if it has any advice.

Get your supplies ready.,
Boil the sap.,
Filter the syrup.,
Store your syrup in a covered container.",How to Tap a Tree for Maple Syrup2," You will need to use a large pan and an outdoor gas range or wood stove. You will also need a cloth syrup filter and storage containers. Avoid boiling your sap indoors, as it creates a large amount of steam.


You can use a dehumidifier to reduce the amount of steam that is produced, allowing you to boil the sap indoors.
A candy or syrup thermometer is very helpful in getting the sap to the perfect temperature.
Using a wood stove creates the best maple syrup, as it imbues the sap with a rich smoky flavor.

, Keep the sap at least 11.5 inches deep to keep it from burning. Be prepared, as sap boils down very quickly and gives off a lot of steam.


As the sap boils down, add more to keep it at the 11.5 inch level. You can add cold sap to the boiling sap, or pre-warm it.
Boil the sap until it reaches 219 °F (104 °C). This will give you pure maple syrup. If you want to make maple sugar, continue boiling until it has reached 234 °F (112 °C).

, Use a cloth maple syrup filter, available for purchase online, to separate out any “sugar sand” that formed during the boiling process. Always filter the syrup while it is hot, between 180–200 °F (82–93 °C).


Heat the syrup filter in hot water for a few minutes before use. This will help the syrup to filter better, and also kill any bacteria that might have been attached to the filter.
Store syrup that is waiting to be filtered in a closed container to help it to maintain its heat.
If the syrup cools too much, reheat it to be within the 180-200 degree range. Be careful of overheating it though, as you could burn the syrup.
If the syrup is pouring through the filter too quickly, the filter may be bad and need to be replaced. It should “ooze” more than it should pour., To extend the life of your syrup, you can keep it refrigerated once you open its container. Use in recipes and on your foods for a delicious maple flavor.

Inspect a tree before purchasing and transplanting it into your landscape.,
Consider the potential transplanting success of the type of tree.,
Take into account the season in which you want to transplant the tree.,
Select your planting site carefully.,
Take care when digging and planting the tree.,
Care for your tree immediately following the transplant.",How to Save a Tree when Transplanting," Looking for signs of stress when you buy a tree can help you determine whether the tree is a good candidate for transplanting.


Check the base of the trunk for pests or wounds. If you need to, pull back any plastic to look at the trunk for any bugs or cuts.
Look for branch spacing. The branches should be well spaced with foliage, but not too much foliage. If the branches are crowded with leaves, do not purchase the tree. A young tree needs energy to grow once it has been placed in the ground, and too many branches or foliage is an indication that it will spend extra energy obtaining nutrients for the already existing foliage, rather than on new growth.
Check the trunk of the tree. It should be straight and tapered at its base. There should not be too much soil over the trunk. If you need to dig down more than an inch to find the top of the root, you are not getting a healthy root ball.
Move the trunk back and forth slowly to feel that it has a good connection to the root ball.
Check that the roots are not constricting and overly entwined around the tree. This is called girdled, and it is an unhealthy sign that the tree is not getting enough ""breathing room.""
Check the leaves for a healthy color. Yellowed, dry or absent leaves show signs of stress or disease.
Inspect containerized plants to see that there is a dense enough root system. If you see only 1 or 2 main, strong roots, the root system will not be enough to sustain the tree during transplanting.;
, For instance, young nursery trees will sustain faster growth than older trees, deciduous trees are hardier than evergreens, and trees with shallow roots will adapt better than those with deep roots. Ask the nursery for information before you decide what type of tree to purchase.

, Woody shrubs and trees do best when transplanted in the spring or after the last frost has occurred. They also should be transplanted before any budding occurs. If the tree is transplanted when it is trying to bud, it will lose an excessive amount of needed energy.

, The transplant should take place in an area that can accommodate the type of tree you are moving. Consider soil, sunlight and wind exposure.

, Most stress occurs when the actual moving of the tree occurs.


Check the root ball continually during the process and keep it damp. Dried out root balls will be difficult to re-saturate once in the ground.
Tie all low branches up and out of the way when preparing to lower the root ball into the ground.
Use a sharp spade to remove a tree from the ground before transplanting. This will ensure that the roots are cleanly cut from the soil and most of them remain on the tree.
Check the recommended hole or trench depth for your type and size of tree. This is important so that you can accommodate all root systems.

,


Water the area around the tree thoroughly after planting, and check daily to make sure it is still moist.
Mulch and fertilize around the tree according to the instructions for the type of tree.

Know when to repot a ficus tree.,
Wait until the tree is between growth spurts.,
Stop watering the tree for at least two days, this allows the soil to dry and makes removal easier.

,
Find a pot 1-2"" (2.5-5cm) larger at the top than your current container.,
Add a 1-2 inch layer of drainage material, such as gravel, sand, or rocks.

,
Add soil, compost, or potting mix, as desired, leaving enough depth for the transplant plus 2 inches.

,
Carefully tip the old pot on its side, then ease the root ball out of the pot by grasping the tree at its base.,
If the tree is severely root bound, you may snip the root nest vertically at 4-5 inch intervals around the ball.,
Supporting the base of the root ball and the base of the tree, lift the transplant into the new pot.

,
Add soil/compost/potting mix to fill.

,
Water thoroughly, until water runs out the drain holes.

,
Try not to move your transplanted tree for a week, this allows the root structure to take hold in the new pot and minimizes trauma.

Decide whether it is even appropriate to shift the shrub.,
Choose the new spot.,
Dig up the shrub.,
Cut the roots.,
Try lifting the root ball.,
Apply an anti root-rot solution to the root ball.,
Place the root ball into the hole.,
Water well.,
Keep watering regularly through spring and summer.",How to Transplant a Shrub," Some shrubs will respond more favorably than others to being transplanted. Find out about the chances of success in relation to the actual shrub you're contemplating moving.


Older shrubs in obvious decline should not be transplanted––it's highly unlikely that they'll survive. The shrub should be in good health and growing well.
Check for ""transplantability"" of the shrub––use online and book resources.;
, You'll need to get this ready before shifting the shrub. Dig the hole twice as wide as the root ball and as deep. Leave the soil to one side; the hole needs to be clear for adding the root ball.

, Using a sharp spade, dig a circular trench around the shrub in its existing position, about 30cm/12"" deep––larger shrubs may need to be twice as deep. This will create a perimeter that includes what is going be the root ball of the existing shrub.


Clean the spade before digging, to avoid transferring any germs.

, The tool that you'll use to cut the roots will depend on the strength and size of the roots. Smaller roots can probably be severed using a spade or secateurs; for bigger, thicker roots, chop with an ax. Keep as much of the roots on as will form as root ball of about 60-90cm (23-35 inches) diameter.

, It helps to rock it gently to free it from the roots left behind after cutting. Once it is lifted a little, slip a piece of black garden plastic or a piece of burlap under the root ball. This will help you to lift the root ball out completely and either carry or drag it to its new hole.


At this stage, get help with lifting if the shrub is too heavy to lift alone.

, This is available from a garden center or nursery. Follow the instructions on the root-rot package.

, Slide it carefully off the black plastic or burlap and gently into the new hole. Using the soil piled up next to the new hole, backfill around the root ball. Only fill to the same height as where the shrub sat before––avoid filling over the shrub's stem or leaves.

, Finish with a decent layer of mulch to maintain moisture. Don't touch the stem with the mulch though––keep a clear space.

, However, don't over-water––simply ensure that the soil does not dry out. And keep an eye on the shrub's progress in general. When you see new growth appearing in spring, the shrub can finally be fertilized.

Choose the right time.,
Sharpen your tools.,
Complete corrective pruning.,
Trim other branches.,
Consider the age of your tree.",How to Prune Persimmons1," A persimmon is a wonderful tree to have in your yard or orchard. They are visually pleasing and bear a delicious fruit. Take care to pick the right time to prune your persimmon.Prune your tree in late winter or early spring. February and March are good choices.
You should prune your persimmon when the tree is dormant. This will ensure you don't interfere with the bearing of fruit.
Prune your tree once a year. This will help improve the structure and limit the chance of alternate bearing.;
, When you are preparing to prune your tree, you'll need to gather the right tools. It is best to use bypass shears and pruning loppers. You can purchase both at gardening supply stores.Make sure that your tools are sharp. You should sharpen your implements each winter.
Ask the local nursery if they offer a sharpening service. If you want to do it yourself, use caution and watch a video tutorial.It is also important to use clean tools. Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a clean rag and wipe your tools in between each tree or shrub that you are pruning.

, In order for your tree to remain healthy, you need to remove the dead weight. Corrective pruning is the process of removing dead or dying branches. You should also remove any diseased branches.Use your bypass shears for any twigs smaller than 1/4 inch. Use pruning loppers for larger dead branches.
You can also cut off any backward bending branches. Those branches do not bear fruit.
Use caution when using sharp tools. Make sure that if you are standing on a ladder, it is steady, not wobbly.

, After you get rid of the dead branches, turn your attention to the rest of the tree. Cut the length of each branch by 1/3. This encourages growth.Cut the branches to a point near a bud. Choose a bud that is facing the direction that you want the tree to grow.
Cut at an angle within 1/2 inch of the bud. The buds look like large lumps, which makes them easy to identify.
Remove the crossed and crowded branches from the center of the tree. This will allow your tree to grow in an open, pleasing shape.

, The younger your tree, the more you will need to prune it. If your persimmon is between 1-3 years of age, you should aggressively prune it. Make sure that you do leave the small, low horizontal branches in tact for future fruit growing.If you have a new tree, cut it to a very short length. Make sure that it is no more than 24-30 inches tall.
Your persimmon tree will require less attention as it grows older. Just remove approximately 20% of the growth during each year's pruning.

Prune conifers in late winter or early spring.,
Choose sharp, correctly-sized tools.,
Disinfect the pruning tools before using.,
Identify which branches can and should be cut.,
Cut the branches at a 45° to 60° angle, in the correct location.,
Make two cuts into each branch.,
Familiarize yourself with the pruning requirements of specific species.,
Be sure to remove any diseased portions of the tree.,
Consider hiring a professional company to prune the trees for you.,
Be aware that most conifer species will not survive a severe pruning.,
Refrain from pruning into the empty, central area of the tree.,
Only remove the bottom branches of trees when absolutely necessary.,
Avoid topping evergreen trees.,
Do not prune conifer trees too late in the year.",How to Prune Conifers," In general, conifers should be pruned in late winter or early spring to encourage lush, healthy new branches and foliage in the spring. There is also less risk of fungal infections at this time of the year because the bark is more easily damaged while the trees are growing.;
, The tools used for pruning conifers should always be sharp, as this is safer and more effective. You can determine which type of tool to use based on the size of the branches being pruned.


If the branches are less than ½-inch thick, use hand or bypass pruners that cut with a scissor action. If the branches are larger than ½-inch thick but less than 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter, use loppers or lopping shears.
When the branches are more than 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter, use a pruning saw. Hedge clippers or shears can be used to shape conifers that are grown as a hedge or maintained in a particular shape., It’s recommended that gardeners disinfect any tools they are going to be using with either alcohol or regular bleach before they begin pruning their trees. This helps to prevent any lingering contaminants from being unintentionally spread throughout one’s yard.

, The main leader of a conifer tree should not usually be pruned. However, if the tree grows a second leader, you can prune off the weaker of the two. You can also trim the branches back to neaten the conifer up, if necessary.


Remove entire branches to thin out overly-thick growth, if necessary, and open the interior of the conifer up for better sun exposure and air circulation. Branches that are growing at angles will also need to be removed.
Choose the branches carefully, though. Once an entire branch is removed from either a tree or shrub conifer, it will not grow back.

, Prune off entire branches at a 45° to 60° angle just outside of the branch collar.


Be very careful not to damage the branch collar, which is the raised area of bark at the base of the branch.
Larger branches should be cut off 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) away from the branch collar.

, Cut about halfway through the branch from underneath then cut halfway through from the top, about one inch beyond where the cut made on the underside of the branch.


The weight of the branch will cause it to snap off. This will eliminate the main weight of the branch and protect the branch collar from damage. Prune the rest of the branch back to the branch collar.
When only part of a branch is pruned off, the cut should be made about ¼ inch beyond a new leaf bud.

, Certain coniferous tree species have specific requirements when it comes to pruning, so it's important that you take these into account.


For instance, pine trees have a leader, or main stem, that can be reduced to a 10 inch (25.4 cm) stub in order to produce a stockier, more compact tree. The side branches at top should be trimmed until they are about 5 inches (12.7 cm) shorter than the top branch. The downward limbs can be pruned in decreasing increments to form a pyramid-like overall shape.
Branches on Douglas fir trees that are over 5 inches (12.7 cm) around should not be pruned, because this puts the plants at a great risk for fungal infections.

, Coniferous trees with a disease problem should have their branches pruned about 5 inches (12.7 cm) away from the infected portions, taking care to only cut live wood.


Gardeners should wait for a period of dry weather to trim ailing trees because this will reduce the spread of pathogens. It's also important to clean and sterilize the pruners with a household disinfectant before and after each use to help reduce the spread of disease. Use a rag to wipe the disinfectant off the pruners before using them again, as disinfectant can cause damage to the tree.
The diseased portions of the tree should either be burned or left for the local waste disposal crews to pick up. These limbs should not go into the compost bin.

, If the evergreens in question are located near power lines, it is best to hire a reputable tree surgeon rather than tackle the problem on one’s own.It is recommended that estate owners shop around and get several opinions on the work they need done before selecting a company to perform the task for them.
In this way, one will find the best bargains and avoid the needless expense of unnecessary procedures.

, Gardeners should keep in mind that most conifer species, with the exception of yew, cannot survive a severe pruning.


Although the green foliage can be trimmed, the brown areas of old growth should be left alone because these places will not regenerate if cut.

, Some conifers have an area in the center where no foliage grows, but this is normal and not indicative of any problems.


In trees where this is the case, gardeners should avoid pruning into this area because doing so will result in a lopsided tree. The plants will not grow back to cover up the hole.Therefore, tree trimmers should check the foliage areas before making decisions about which branches to lop off

, Although wanting to remove the lower branches of a tree is understandable, gardeners who do so may end up with an unsightly specimen when the tree gets taller. Therefore, tree trimmers should exercise restraint and only remove the bottom branches when it becomes absolutely necessary.

, Evergreens should not be topped, or cut off at a certain height, because this will produce trees that are anything but attractive. Trees that are topped are also at a greater risk for disease and other ailments.

, Conifers should not be pruned later in the summer or in the fall. Late season pruning can result in new, lush growth that will not have a chance to mature before the cold, damaging winter weather.

Learn about growth systems.,
Use a trellis.,
Use a central leader.",How to Prune Persimmons2," You can train your tree to grow into a distinct shape. You can also dictate the direction of growth. Before you begin pruning your persimmon, take some time to learn about growth systems.Growth systems offer many benefits. For example, choosing a uniform system will allow more sunlight to filter through the canopy and reach the trees in your orchard.
If all of your trees are growing in a uniform system, it will simplify your operations. It will be easier to prune and harvest.
A central growing system can also reduce limb breakage. This will help your tree to bear more fruit.

, One common training system requires the use of a trellis. You will need a frame trellis. You can either build or purchase one at a garden supply center.If you are attempting to grow espalier fruit trees, this is a good system for you. Espalier is when trees and branches are all pruned to be on one level. This is commonly done against a wall or fence.
Plant your persimmon tree approximately 6-10 inches from the fence. If your tree borders a walkway, you will need the frame trellis to support and train the branches.
With a young tree, you can also train by movement. This means you should bend the branches in the direction you want them to grow. You don't always have to prune each branch of a young tree.

, The central leader system is one of the most common ways to train a persimmon tree. It is an inexpensive and basic system. One disadvantage is that your tree might grow taller than you wish, since it is not trellised.After planting, choose a healthy shoot near the center of your tree. This will be your central leader.
During pruning, remove shoots near the central leader. You do not want other branches to compete with it.
In the winter, prune your leader by 1/3. Tie down competing branches.
Repeat this process for two years. This will keep any side branches from becoming strong enough to compete with the central leader.

"

Choose the right environment.,
Fertilize the tree.,
Harvest the fruit.",How to Prune Persimmons3," Persimmon trees are a great addition to your home orchard. They are aesthetically pleasing and produce nice fruit. Like any tree, persimmons flourish under certain conditions.Make sure that you live somewhere that is temperate enough for a persimmon tree. They flourish in areas with moderate winters and mild summers.
These trees do not perform well in high heats. They cannot thrive in desert climates, and the bark is especially susceptible to sunburn.
The first persimmon tree was grown in China. They have proven to be very adaptable to the climate in California.

, Persimmons can flourish with a minimum of fertilization. They will grow in a variety of soil types, but they will do best in a fertilizer that is well-drained. Try to plant your tree in a patch of earth that will be fully exposed to the sun.Purchase some organic fertilizer at your garden center. Take a few handfuls and spread it around the base of your tree.
Next, spread a layer of mulch around the tree. The mulch should be 4-6 inches deep.
Spread the mulch in an 18 inch radius around your tree. Then water the area thoroughly.

, Persimmons are orange or red-brown in color. They grow on trees like plums, but look similar to a small tomato. Persimmons taste pleasantly sweet, particularly when they are very ripe.Persimmon trees are very slow to bear fruit. It can take up to 8 years for your tree to fully produce a crop of persimmons.
Persimmon trees are sometimes alternate bearing. This means that a single tree may produce a large crop one year, and almost no fruit the next year.
Pick your persimmons in early fall. You can tell when they are ripe when they become more orange and reach the consistency of a soft-boiled egg.

Use pruning to shape mature trees.,
Prune in the summer or winter.,
Know how the branches of your Japanese maple should look.,
Remove dead wood.,
Cut away branches that cross or intertwine.,
Saw off weak branches that could interfere with strong branches.,
Remove branches growing in the wrong direction.,
Use a selective heading cut.,
Remove lower branches, if desired.,
Snip away buds to direct branch growth.,
Keep things balanced.,
Leave the largest limbs intact.,
Never remove more than 1/5 of the tree’s crown.",How to Prune Japanese Maple Trees," Some pruning is done for the health of the tree, but most pruning is done for the sake of appearance. You can remove dead, dying, or diseased wood from the tree regardless of its age. The removal of awkward or unappealing branches should be held back until the Japanese maple has a chance to grow into its natural shape, which usually does not happen until it reaches two to three years of age.;
, Technically, the only time of year when you cannot prune a Japanese maple is spring, since sap is developing during this time. Late summer and winter are the most favorable times, though.During winter, you can clearly see the branches and will be able to tell which ones interfere with the overall structure of the tree.
In summer, you can get a better idea for how the tree will look with certain branches removed. Pruning in the summer also stimulates less new growth, which can help prevent the tree from growing out of control.

, There are two main types of Japanese maple tree: upright and lace leaf.Upright Japanese maple trees have branches that point upward, as most trees do. The branches should resemble opened fans.
Weeping or laceleaf Japanese maple trees have branches that grow upward, to the sides, and downward. The top layer of the tree should create a veil or canopy over the rest of the tree.

, The first, most important thing to prune away are the diseased, dying, or dead stems growing on the tree. Deadwood appears most often on the inside bottom of the tree, where excess shade has caused the wood to rot. Dying or diseased wood can rot further, spreading disease to the rest of your otherwise healthy tree.

, Branches that overlap one another usually wreck the silhouette of the tree. Even if they do not, the two branches could eventually end up interfering with one another’s growth. Remove one or both of the overlapping branches, sawing them off at the base, nearest the trunk, rather than merely cutting them away where they start to overlap.

, Branches that hand down into the area occupied by another branch or branches that are too close to each other can make the tree’s foliage look clumpy. The goal is to make the Japanese maple tree look evenly thinned out. You can either prune or saw off the weaker of the two branches, or you can determine which branch is less important to the tree’s outline and remove that one.

, For an upright tree, a top branch that grows downward would be a good example. For a weeping or laceleaf Japanese maple, a common example would be a lower branch extending straight and upward. Saw the offending limb off at its base.


Note that many lace leaf version have twisted, curved branches that should not look straight. As long as these branches are not interfering with other branches, they should be kept.

, These trees have ""opposite buds"" or ""opposite branches,"" meaning that the smallest branches grow out of the larger branches two at a time. The resulting branch looks like a ""Y"" with an extra branch coming out from the center. Remove this center branch so that the branches look like a normal ""Y."" Cut as close to the point of intersection as possible, leaving as little of the center stem as possible., For upright varieties, the lower lateral branches can make it difficult to walk under the tree or may conflict with plants growing beneath it. For laceleaf varieties, you should expect branches to hang low. Branches that drag on the ground hang too low, though, and can be removed for the sake of appearance.

, When you see buds developing, you can manage them to direct the eventual growth of the tree. Buds point in the direction that the tree will grow in, and many buds grow into dominant branches. If a bud is placed in a location that you believe will be inconvenient, you can pluck it out by hand to redirect the tree's growth in a different direction.

, Light pruning is the best way to manage this because it limits regrowth, preventing excessive growth from forming on one side but not on another.


Another important part of keeping a balanced form is by avoiding dramatic diameter differences. If you prune a thick branch back to a small side branch, the shape of that section will look unbalanced and out of proportion.

, Never remove a limb with a diameter that is more than half the size of the tree’s trunk. For older trees, you should consider keeping any limb with a diameter that is more than 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the tree trunk’s diameter., Removing too much of the tree's growth can stimulate excessive growth or cause unnecessary stress to the Japanese maple. You should also avoid removing more than 1/4 of the foliage on any given branch. Otherwise, the branch may not be able to absorb enough nutrients.

Make a new cut to shape the bush.,
Look at this older cut.,
Finish shaping your Tecoma to the size/shape desired, and you will start to get new growth like that shown in this image below.,
Look at the finished trim job!,
Note the white/woody stalks and the newer/brown growth at the upper level.

,
If you are interested in propagating your cuttings, stay only to the top 60 cm (24"") of your pruning, cutting just below and just above each node, then trimming any excess leaves you might have.

",How to Prune Tecoma stans," Don't be mistaken by the size of the cut, you can whack off a much larger section to achieve any shape you want to. Remember that the larger or more ""woody"" the cut you make, the less chance you will have for new growth from the next lower node on the stem. Tecomas will send up new growth from the next node and even from the base (soil level) of the plant. On each stem at the point of any leaf are two leaves. It is at those leaves that new growth will appear (note the new growth in the next image).;
, This is how the plant should look in a few months. Notice how two stems have grown on two sides of the cut that was made. If you want to ""shape"" your bush to grow outward, just prune the inside growth. Do the opposite if you want a tighter plant. If you're trying to set a limit to height, prune it about 30-45 cm (12-18 inches) below the desired height. This will allow for new growth to the limit you wish to have.

, Many new growths come out of large woody sections after severe pruning and new growth or stocks develop from ground level. These are leggy plants, but if you're interested in using them as a small hedge - say to 1.5 m (4 or 5 foot), they can be trained to be full/thick bushes.

, This height is about 1 m (3 foot) tall. After it grows back, you can see, in another picture to show how it fills out. Remember it will still grow leggy as new growth appears, but it will also add new growth at the lower limbs.

Thin off any old or dead stems.,
Do hard pruning on the shrub.,
Switch to a regular pruning routine once the shrub recovers.",How to Prune Shrubs1," Shrubs that are old or overgrown may need to be pruned over several years. This is called renewal or renovation pruning. Start by using hand shears and lopping shears to remove any old stems on the shrub. Cut them off at a 45 degree angle.Remove any part of the stem or branch that is brown, dried out, or discolored. Get rid of stems that have no growth or buds on them.
This type of thinning is good for shrubs with multiple stems, such as lilac, viburnum, forsythia, and dogwood.;
, Hard pruning is a drastic way to prune an old shrub so it grows better the following season. Use lopping shears and a pruning saw to cut back all the stems on the shrub to within an inch of the ground. Do this during winter or fall. In the spring, the shrubs should produce new shoots and new growth.Hard pruning will stimulate new growth, but there won’t be much for you to look at while the shrub recovers in the winter. In the spring, it should bloom and appear more healthy.

, In the following season, as the overgrown or old shrub comes back to life, treat it like a young or newly planted shrub. You may head trim the shrub and pinch out any new buds. You can also start to shape the shrub to encourage it to grow evenly."

Locate the spot where you will be replanting the tree.,
Use a hose or watering can to moisten the soil around the tree thoroughly about 3 to 4 days prior to the move.

,
Identify the tree's roots.,
Mark 1 side of the tree before the move process.,
Use a sharp spade to dig a trench around the tree's base its roots.,
Dig out the tree with your spade, and leave the roots and surrounding dirt intact.,
Pull the tree out of the hole, and round out the bottom of the root ball using the spade.,
Tip the tree and root ball to 1 side.,
Tip or roll the root ball gently onto the burlap.,
Wrap the burlap around the root ball very tightly, and secure it around the base of the trunk with heavy twine.

,
Lift and carry the tree by the root ball, not the trunk.,
Dig a hole in the tree's new location.,
Lower the tree gently into the hole.,
Pack the dirt into the hole and around the root ball with your hands as you go.,
Cut and remove the twine holding the burlap to the trunk with your scissors once the hole is 2/3 full.,
Fill in the remainder of dirt you removed from the hole, creating a slight mound around the trunk base.

,
Water the newly replanted tree thoroughly.

,
Monitor the tree closely over the next month or so, and water it every 10 to 14 days if it has not rained.

",How to Replant a Tree," For best results, research the tree type to determine the amount of space and sunlight the tree needs.;
,, You will need to leave as much of the tree's root system in place as possible.

, When you replant the tree, place it in the hole with the mark in the same position the tree originally grew in.

, The trench needs to be approximately 1.5 to 2 feet (0.5 to 0.6 m) deep (.46 to .61 m).

, The appropriate ratio for the ""root ball,"" or clump of root and soil, is 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) for every 1 inch (2.54 cm) of trunk diameter.

, Cut beneath the roots as necessary to form a ball.

, Place a piece of burlap large enough to wrap around the root ball underneath the upended side.

, Try not to displace any dirt.

,, Transport it to the transplanted spot.

, The hole should be 2 to 3 times the size of your root ball. The depth of the hole should be approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) less than the height of the root ball, so the top of the burlap will still be showing once the tree is placed in the ground.

, Position it using the mark you created, and make sure it faces the sun in its original direction. Point the trunk and foliage straight up, and use your spade or shovel to begin filling the unearthed dirt back in to the hole.

, This will provide the tree with much needed stability.

, You will also need to cut away any burlap which is still exposed.

Head trim shrubs to encourage growth.,
Pinch off dead buds.,
Shape the shrub by shearing it.,
Thin out any old or wayward branches on the shrub.",How to Prune Shrubs2," Use hand shears to trim any long, unbranched stems. Cut just above the healthy buds on the branch. Do this at a 45 degree angle.This type of pruning will encourage the lower side branches to develop and flourish.

, Pinching is an easy way to prune shrubs without making a cut. Use your thumb and forefinger to pinch off any dead buds on the branches or stems of the shrub. This will encourage the shrub to grow bushy and even. You usually pinch small-leaved shrubs to help them maintain an even shape., Shearing helps to produce new growth on a young shrub. To shear the shrub, cut it so it forms a rectangular shape that is slightly wider at the top. Do this by cutting near the buds at a 45 degree angle.Shearing can be done using hand shears or a pruning saw. If you are shearing a tall shrub, use pole pruners.
This type of pruning will cut right through leaves on the shrub so it should be done on small-leaved shrubs, as the cuts will be less noticeable.

, Thinning helps to reduce the bulk of the plant to encourage growth. Start by cutting off any old or wayward branches at a 45 degree angle. Cut them back 1-2 inches. Use hand shears, loppers, or a pruning saw to thin out the shrub.Try to remove stems or branches that have grown beyond the rest of the branches or stems. This will help to open up the middle of the shrub to sunlight, which will keep it healthy.

Choose the right time of year to prune shrubs.,
Get hand shears for close cuts.,
Use lopping shears or a pruning saw for thicker branches.,
Get pole pruners for high branches.,
Use hedge shears to shape shrubs.,
Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands.",How to Prune Shrubs3," Shrubs can be pruned any time, but pruning shrubs in winter or fall can stunt their growth. If you have summer-flowering shrubs like gardenia, beautyberry, and privet, prune them in late winter or early spring. That way, they can bloom well in late spring and summer.If you have spring-flowering shrubs like azalea, lilac, and forsythia, you should prune them in late spring or early summer. This will help them bloom more fully the following season.

, Hand shears have scissor-like blades and should fit comfortably in your hand. They are good for branches that are up to ¼ inch (0.6 cm) in diameter. You can make tight, close cuts on shrubs with hand shears.You can find hand shears online or at your local hardware store.

, Lopping shears are good for branches that are 1 ½ inches (3.8 cm) in diameter or smaller. Look for a pair that is lightweight and has extendable handles, as this will allow you to reach higher branches.A pruning saw is also a good option for thicker branches, 1 ½ inches (3.8 cm) in diameter or smaller. Pruning saws have coarse teeth, making it easier for you to cut thick branches.

, Pole pruners are ideal for branches that are more than 1 inch thick (2.5 cm) and high up. This tool is handy if you’re pruning shrubs that are tall. Most pole pruners have a pruning shear head or saw that works using a rope or hook.You can find pole pruners online or at your local hardware store. Look for pruners that can be taken apart easily for storage.

, Hedge shears are a great tool for shaping shrubs. They can also be used to snip new growth on shrubs. Look for hedge shears online or at your local hardware store., Gardening gloves are a good option for protecting your hands from getting scratched while you prune. Look for gardening gloves that are thick and that fit your hands comfortably so you can hold shears and other tools.


You should also wear long sleeves and long pants when you prune to protect your arms and legs.
You can also wear protective eyewear to prevent eye injuries from fallen branches or sticks.

Assess which branches have grown out of the standard shape (ball shape).,
Cut back all of the branches on the standard by a half to two-thirds.,
Deal with the roots.,
Continue to trim the standard fig regularly.,
Compost the prunings or mulch them.

",How to Prune a Standard Fig Tree," A common problem is branching out, causing a fan or vase shape to form instead of the characteristic ball shape sought from a standard.;
, While this does count as severe pruning, the fig tree can cope with this and it will regenerate new, vigorous growth quickly.

, Roots should also be cut back periodically, especially with the larger fig trees., The aim is to reshape it into a ball and then to maintain this shape. If maintained, you will avoid having to put the fig through such a severe pruning again.

Orient your olive tree's growth.,
Assure that your tree grows correctly.,
Frequently check the secondary shoots.",How to Prune an Olive Tree1," Just like with a small child, it is important to mark out your tree's growth during the first 2 years of its life in order to determine its adult form.


After permanently planting your olive tree, the first pruning should be done in summer.
Using pruning shears, get rid of all secondary shoots less than 30 inches (76.2 cm) in length.;
, To do this, you should tie the main trunk in order to keep secondary shoots from growing.


Starting at the base, wrap a gardening rope or a normal rope around the olive tree's trunk until you reach a height of 40 inches (101.6 cm).
The ties should be firm, but not too tight, because this could strangulate the trunk and cause the upper branches to dry out.
To keep this from happening, change the rope out for a new one regularly.

, During the first year and a half, it is highly probably that secondary shoots will continue to appear, despite having correctly pruned the tree.


Check weekly for the growth of new secondary shoots.
If you happen to find one, cut it off with pruning shears while it is still green or it will become more difficult to remove it and multiple new shoots will appear around that spot in the following weeks.

"
"
Occasionally prune old branches.,
Cut off dry shoots.,
Ensure uniform distribution of sunlight.",How to Prune an Olive Tree2," In this phase, when the olive tree is about 4 years old, pruning is done in order to increase olive production.


With pruning shears, cut off any upper branches that are more than three years old in order to leave space for younger branches to grow, as they tend to be more productive.

, There is no restriction to the number of dry shoots that you can prune, but keep in mind that the less dry shoots you have, the more olives that will grow.


Make small, angular cuts, but only in the dry sections so that you don't damage the rest of the tree.
It is important to remove dry shoots from the branches; once you do this, it will only take a few days for you to see new, green shoots starting to grow.
You can also remove one or various whole branches that are completely dry. You will be able to tell that they are dry because they have dead-looking, coffee-colored leaves.

, You should remove several upper branches in order to establish this uniformity.


Prune upper branches until you see that sunlight gets to the majority of the tree.
Be careful to leave some shade for the trunk and a few main branches in order to maximize your productive season and keep your tree from aging too quickly.

"
"
Recognize the signs of an old olive tree.,
Partial elimination of the crown.,
Repeat this process every 3 years.",How to Prune an Olive Tree3," When it is between 20 and 40 years old, it is likely that you tree will start to show clear signs of aging.


Each branch has only a few leaves.
If viewed from above, the tree's crown will appear to have a gap in the center.

, Eliminate the mother branch, the one that blocks sunlight from coming through.


Search for the straightest branch; this will be the mother branch that should be eliminated. Remove it with a saw, using an angled cut.

, In doing this, you will guarantee that the mother branch is no more than 12 to 15 years old.


Keep in mind that after cutting off the mother branch, the first year's production will decrease by about 25%. However, the following year, you will see an increase in production, recuperating that 25% and more.
If you perform this cycle correctly, you will prolong the life of your olive tree.

Select a central leader and scaffold branches.Once the buds of the tree grow out to about 4 or 5 inches (10 to 12.7 cm), choose a branch to act as a central leader, as well as three to six scaffolds or side branches.,
Head back the central leader during the second year.,
Eliminate oversized branches during the second year.You can have more than six side branches during the second year, but branches that are too thick or large can compete with the central leader and should be removed.,
Remove other undesirable branches.,
Train prune for the first three years.,
Prune during the dormant season.,
Remove any branch that threatens the health of the tree.,
Open up the tree.,
Reduce any excessive height and spread.,
Shorten the previous year's growth overall.,
Focus on the spurs.,
Remove watersprouts and rootsuckers.,
Cut off diseased wood.,
Thin out the fruit.",How to Prune a Pear Tree," Remove the rest of the branches.


The central leader should come up from out of the trunk toward the center of the tree. It should come directly from the base of the tree and should not be growing out of another branch.
The scaffolds should be spaced apart at equal intervals around the trunk and should be spaced apart roughly 6 inches (15.25 cm) vertically.
When cutting away the rest of the branches, cut off the entire branch from the base of the trunk. The cut should be made just along the outside edge of the collar–where the branch meets the tree. If you only cut off a portion, the branch will grow back and create structural problems.;
, During the second dormant season, cut back the central leader by about one-third its current length to stimulate more vigorous growth.


The cut should be close to a bud growing at an angle greater than 45 degrees. Alternatively, you could also make the cut near a lateral branch you intend to keep.

,


Remove the branch at its base, where the branch meets the trunk of the tree.
Oversized branches include any branch with a diameter that exceeds one-half to one-third the diameter of the central leader.

, During the second year, you should also remove any damaged branches and any healthy branch that extends out from the trunk at a near vertical angle.


A near-vertical branch includes any branch extending out at an angle less than 45 degrees. Ideally, however, branches should extend out at between 60 and 75 degrees.

, The pruning you do should be kept to a minimum during the first three years so that the tree can produce enough fruiting wood.


Follow the same pruning suggestions made for the second year during the third year. Head back the central leader by one-half to one-third its current height, eliminate oversized branches, remove damaged branches, and cut off vertical branches.
After the first three years, you can prune the pear tree to produce a crop.

, You should do the majority of your heavy pruning during the dormant season, when the tree is not in a state of active growth.


If you live in an area prone to frost, pruning later in the dormant season might be better than pruning early on. Do the majority of your pruning during the late winter or early spring, before the first leaves and buds begin to form.

, This includes branches that are weak, diseased, dead, or otherwise damaged. It also includes branches growing out in an improper manner.Cut away branches that cross or rub against each other. Fruit production will be low on these branches, and bark injury is likely to occur, which could invite disease and various pests. Cut away whichever branch is less productive of the two.
Remove stubs and broken branches since diseases and insects are likely to attack these areas.
Remove downward growing branches. These do not yield much fruit and can cause problems with rubbing and shade.Cut off whorls, or branches that originate from the same place on the trunk or limb. The joints there are weak and prone to breaking. Select the strongest branch and remove the rest.
Prune away branches that grow out at an angle less than 45 degrees from the trunk of the tree.

, Use a sharp pruning saw to remove oversized branches that have grown at an excessively rapid pace. Pear trees have a low yield when they do not receive enough light, and oversized branches generally cause problems by creating too much shade.


As always, cut the branch off at its base, where it meets the trunk of the tree.
Generally, you can spot an oversized branch by comparing it to your original central leader. An oversized branch will usually be more than three-quarters the diameter of the central leader.
You only want to eliminate two to three interior branches a year. If you need to get rid of more, spread the work out over two to three winters.

, If any branch has grown too long, head them back by cutting the branch to the length of a vigorous lower branch.


The lower branch you choose should be directly below the branch you head off, and it should also be at least one-third of the diameter of the branch being cut back.

, Pruning the healthy branches will encourage more vigorous growth.


Shorten the previous year's growth on each main branch by cutting away roughly one-third of it. Make sure that the bud you cut the branch back to faces an appropriate direction.
Young lateral branches growing out of the main framework should be shortened to five or six buds.

, Pear trees bear fruit on short spurs that grow in between the main branches. Thin these spurs out every few years to encourage better yield.


Completely remove old spurs every two to three years so that they can be replaced by new ones.
If too many small branches grow from these spurs in a single year, thin them out to one or two branches so that the remaining branches will not have to compete for resources.

, These are vigorous shoots that appear at the base of the tree or at the location of a previous pruning cut. They drain nutrients from the tree and should be removed as you spot them.


Cut the shoot off at its base. If the shoot extends out from the wood of the tree, cut it off where the shoot meets the healthy wood. If the shoot extends from below the ground at the base of the trunk, cut the shoot off at ground level.

, You should cut off any wood damaged by fire blight or similar diseases as you spot it to prevent the infection from spreading to healthy branches.


Fire blight is especially common with pear trees. The leaves and twigs of a pear tree get fire blight when an infected insect enters fresh buds and growth during the spring. To save the rest of your tree after an infection occurs, you need to prune the affected shoots at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) below the damaged area.When pruning diseased wood, make sure that you sterilize your pruning shears in a chlorine solution in between cuts.

, While not strictly essential, you can prevent too much fruit from going to waste by thinning out the buds after the fruit has set.


Leave at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) of space in between pieces of fruit.
The process reduces the overall yield, but ultimately increases the health and quality of the remaining fruit.

Prune your peach trees to help them grow.,
Know when to prune.,
Choose your pruning tools.,
Know how much to prune.",How to Prune a Peach Tree1," Pruning may seem counterintuitive, but is actually incredibly beneficial in aiding new growth on peach trees.


Pruning your peach trees produces new growth, which in turn produces more fruit. Therefore, pruning yields a larger crop over time.
Peach trees need to be open to sunlight, as shaded branches won’t produce as much fruit. Pruning them opens up all branches to the sun.
Removing dead parts of the tree is necessary so that new branches can come in.
If you intend on spraying your tree with pesticides, pruning allows for an equal coverage over the entire plant.;
, The best time to prune your peach trees is early spring, after the last major cold snap of winter. Avoid pruning in very cold weather though, as this can reduce the trees’ cold-hardiness and total output of fruit.


The best month for pruning is typically February, but adjust this time based on your local weather.
Prune older trees before younger ones to allow time for the new growth.
Avoid pruning when the trees are blooming or shortly after blooming, because this can negatively affect the new growth.
Prune your peach trees at planting or at the next spring (if done in the fall).
It is better to prune a little late in the year than a little early., Use pruning shears for smaller, more manageable branches. Remove large limbs with loppers or a pruning saw.


Wound dressing is available to put on branches post-pruning, but has shown to have little to no effect in preventing fungal growth., When you are cutting back branches, it is best to follow the “cat tossing” rule. All the branches on your peach tree should be wide enough apart that a cat could be tossed between each of them without ever hitting a branch.


A total height of 8–9 feet (2.4–2.7 m) is preferred when the tree is at its maturation.
Prune the tree low to start, to encourage outward growth instead of upward.
For big, full fruit, remove up to 90% of all developing fruit. A healthy tree will produce much more than it is capable of carrying, and must have most of it removed for the best output."

Understand why you should prune spirea.,
Be prepared to prune some suckers.,
Know when to prune your specific variety of spirea.,
Understand why pruning after flowering can help your plant to grow.",How to Prune Spirea Shrubs1," There are several reasons to prune spirea. These reasons include:


Maintaining the height and spread of your Spirea Shrub, and to preserve an attractive shape.
Removing any diseased or damaged branches and any dead growth.
Encouraging a second flowering.
Removing suckers and prevent the plant spreading via suckering.;
, Some varieties of spirea produce suckers. Suckers are shoots that emerge from the roots of the plant. Suckers are eventually capable of producing independent plants of their own; suckering is one of the ways that spirea reproduces.


Pinch or prune these off if you don’t want your spirea to spread in your garden. The specifics of how to do this will be covered in the next section.

, Dead, diseased, and broken branches should be removed at any time of the year but you should only prune healthy plant growth at the right time. If you have Japanese or Bumald Spirea, prune them in early spring before the flowering season starts. Other varieties of Spirea should be pruned after the flowering has finished.


For varieties of Spirea that bloom in spring, that will usually be late spring.
For varieties of Spirea that bloom in summer, that will usually be late summer or fall.

, Pruning after flowering allows the maximum amount of time for the plant to grow fresh growth after pruning before the flowering season starts again the following year.


It isn’t a disaster if you delay pruning, and this won’t harm the plant, but your spirea will offer less of a display in the next flowering season.

Prune the magnolia once a year, in early spring.,
Always use sharp pruning tools when pruning a tulip magnolia.,
Prune the tree immediately after planting.,
Prune the tree again two years after planting.,
Use the correct pruning technique.,
Prune damaged branches throughout the year.,
Remove diseased branches.,
Disinfect the tools after removing diseased branches.",How to Prune a Tulip Magnolia," Tulip magnolias do not require extensive pruning, but some selective pruning while the tree is young and an annual tidying up will help the tree to develop stronger branches and a more pleasing shape.


Tulip magnolias should be pruned in late spring after they finish blooming. Never prune a tulip magnolia after July 1st as the new flower buds for the following spring have already been formed.;
, The type of tool to use depends on the thickness of the branches.


Small branches with a diameter up to ½ inch can be pruned with bypass hand pruners that cut with a scissor-type action.
Branches between ½ inch and 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick should be pruned with anvil-type lopping shears. A pruning saw should be used for branches thicker than 2 inches (5.1 cm).

, If the tulip magnolia is purchased as a bare-root tree and some of the roots are damaged, prune off about 1/3 of the canopy right after planting to help compensate for the reduction in healthy roots.


Do not cut the tip off of the top of the central leader or main trunk of the tree. Sharp hand pruners can be used to simply trim the branches back by about 1/3 of the branch length.
Let the tree grow un-pruned for the next two years.

, Two years after the tree is planted, some branches may need to be removed to improve the tree’s shape and structure.


Step back and look closely at the branch spacing along the trunk and the angle of the branches. They should be evenly spaced along the length of the trunk.
If a few branches need to be removed to even out the spacing, prune off branches that have a narrow crotch angle first. These tend to be weak and break off of the tree easily due to strong winds or ice build-up.
Ideally, the branches should grow out from the trunk at a 30- to 60-degree angle.

, Always make the cut just beyond the branch collar, which is the slightly raised area at the base of the branch. Do not nick or cut the branch collar.


Prune off branches that are growing at the proper angle only if necessary to even up the spacing.
Small, green sprouts may grow from where the branch has been removed. If they do appear, simply snap them off by hand or rub them off with your thumb if they are very small.

, Branches that are damaged or broken should be pruned off whenever they are noticed throughout the year. Remove the entire broken branch all the way back to the branch collar.


There is no need to seal the wound with anything. The tree will quickly form a natural barrier and paint or tree wound dressing can interfere with that process.

, While tulip magnolias are generally not bothered by common tree diseases, they can occasionally develop cankers.


When cankers or small patches of discolored or oozing bark are present on a branch, the entire branch should be pruned off all the way back to the branch collar.
Remove the branch when the weather is dry to help prevent spread of the disease.

, Disinfect the loppers with household disinfectant or a mixture of 10% bleach in water before and after using them on the diseased branch.


This will prevent the disease from spreading to other branches or even other parts of the the garden.
Always wipe the disinfectant or bleach water off the loppers before using them.

Prune at planting.,
Prune so that the lowest branch is 15 inches (38.1 cm) from the ground.,
Select scaffold limbs in the summer.,
Prune branches close to the trunk.",How to Prune a Peach Tree2," As aforementioned, it is important to start the growth of your peach tree in the right direction by pruning at planting. If you plant in the fall, wait a few months till the next spring to prune.

, You don’t want the branches to start much higher on the trunk, because as the tree matures it will grow too tall.


The tallest branch should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm) from the ground total. Trim branches that are too long to meet this number.
All branches should ideally grow at a 45 degree angle. If there are none near this measurement on your tree, prune all branches to a single bud and wait for more growth., Scaffold limbs are the largest branches on the tree, beginning at the trunk. To begin, choose 2-3 scaffold limbs, but this number may grow to 4-6 over time.


Scaffold limbs should form a radial pattern from the trunk, each facing away in a different direction.
Scaffold limbs will house the lateral (smaller outward growing) branches as the tree matures.

, You want to cut the branches near the trunk, offering only a small collar of growth to prevent decay in the branches.


Make thinning cuts, or cuts that start at the origin of the branch, on trees younger than one year old.
Heading cuts are used to remove parts of branches, rather than the entirety of the branch. Avoid doing this in a young tree though, to prevent unwanted suckers and water shoot growth near the top of the tree."
"
Remove all dead and unhealthy growth.,
Shape and train your peach tree.,
Prune your trees near the base of the branch.",How to Prune a Peach Tree3," You can remove the following growth at any time of year:


Dead or fungus-infected branches
Suckers: the shoots that come up near the roots of the tree.
Water shoots growing from the top branches
Dried fruit from the previous year’s harvest

, This is the most important step in pruning, as it is responsible for the ultimate growth pattern and fruit production of the tree. You want to choose 4-6 primary branches to work with, and cut off all the rest.


All the branches you cut should be growing up at a 45 degree angle. Any branches that grow vertically or horizontally need to be removed, as they are likely to break when the tree begins bearing fruit.
Prune your tree in a V-shaped pattern. All branches should have the appearance of the letter “V.”
Cut off any branches that cross over each other, since these block sunlight. The best shape for a peach tree is an open vase, with a clear center to maximize sun.Remove any branches on which the new growth is growing upwards above your head. This will make it difficult to pick the fruit.

, You want to cut the tree at the same angle of growth, about ¼ an inch from the lateral bud.


Avoid cutting the branch at too steep an angle or too close to the collar at the base, as this opens it up for infection.
For branches exceeding 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, use three cuts to aid in pruning. Make the first cut about halfway up the branch from the underside. Then, make a cut from the top down about one inch further. The weight of the branch will help the branch to break easily. Then, make your cut near the collar of the branch."
"
Don’t be afraid to really cut back your plant.,
Try to keep at least five buds on each stem.,
Thin out your plant.,
Remove any undesired suckers.,
Prune your old, woody spirea.,
Give your spirea some love after your prune it.",How to Prune Spirea Shrubs2," If you’re nervous about pruning, don’t worry—spireas can cope with a good pruning and it’s hard to be too brutal with them. A spirea will grow back from the most severe pruning.


Newly planted shrubs won’t need pruning as much; you may just give them a bit of a trim to reshape them in their first year.

, Try to cut each stem back so that it has around five buds on it. Use sharp gardening or pruning shears to do this. Remove all dead, diseased or decaying growth as well. At the same time, remove any weak-looking growth or stems that seem too spindly.


Any spindly or weak, dead, diseased or damaged stems should be cut right back to the base of the stem.

, To stop the bush from becoming too dense, thin out some branches in the middle of the plant to remove the congestion. This means cutting out some of the branches that are making your bush too thick.

, You may also like to remove any suckers, the shoots growing out of the plant’s rootstock, when you prune. This prevents the plant spreading via suckering. To do this:


Remove the sucker by getting as close as possible to the base of the root. Scrape away some soil around the root if necessary. Try to tear off the sucker, rather than cutting it away., If your spirea is old, dense and woody then you can renew it with a vigorous pruning. One third of all the woody old trunks should be pruned right back to ground level. If you do this for three years in a row, the plant will be reinvigorated with good, fresh growth.

, After pruning, give the plant a water, fertilize it and renew the mulch. A slow release fertilizer is best. A fertilizer of blood, fish and bone is a good-value option, though you can also purchase commercial fertilizers. Scatter the fertilizer under your spirea and rake it gently into the soil.


You should also add around two inches of compost, leaf mold or well-rotted manure around your spirea to act as a mulch.

"

Consider dividing your spirea.,
Divide your spirea in the late fall when the plant is dormant.,
Divide your spirea.,
Give the roots a prune after you have divided them.",How to Prune Spirea Shrubs3," In addition to pruning your spirea shrub, you might also consider dividing it. After a few years, shrubs like spirea can become a little lackluster. Dividing them at the root is one way to revive them and remove old growth.


You’ll also get more plants by doing this.

, A cloudy overcast day is a good time for dividing plants as the roots dry out too much in sunny hot weather once they are exposed above ground.


Give your plant a good watering the day before you plan to divide it.

, The day after watering, dig out the plant and remove as much soil as possible from the roots without damaging them. A hosepipe works well for this. To divide your plant:


Using something like a spade or saw, cut the root crown into quarters.
Each piece should have a healthy bit of root and above-ground growth.

, Remove any old root sections at the narrow tip and get rid of any damaged roots or any parts of the plant that seem rotten. Give the parts of the plant above ground a prune when you do this, removing any damaged or dead growth and some of the thicker oldest wood stems.


Replant the root sections and you’ll have new, vigorous growth when the plant re-emerges in the spring.

Lay down mulch around your spirea.,
Water your spirea more often during hotter months.,
Keep your plant safe from aphids.,
Watch out for fire blight.",How to Prune Spirea Shrubs4," Spirea will benefit from a good mulch in the springtime. To do this, spread a layer of compost or well-rotted manure about two inches thick across the area of ground covered by the bush’s branches.


This will help retain moisture in the soil over the hotter months, keep the weeds down and, later, protect the roots from the cold as the cooler weather draws in.

, Over the summer your Spirea will be grateful for some water when the weather is particularly hot or dry. Keep in mind that established plants won’t need much watering most of the time apart from these hot months.

, Spirea tend not to have a lot of problems but can occasionally be troubled by aphid infestation. Look out for curled leaves as a sign that aphids are taking over.


A blast of water from the garden hose usually works to dislodge aphids. You can also use a commercial aphid spray.

, Look for blackened stem tips that curl away from the plant; this is a sign of fire blight. Try to aggressively prune away the affected areas and then burn the trimmings.

Gather pruning equipment.,
Wait until the appropriate season to prune your crepe myrtle.,
Determine what shape and size you want the crepe myrtle to be.",How to Prune a Crepe Myrtle1," To prune a mature crepe myrtle, you're going to need a few different types of pruning tools. Gather the following supplies from your garage or a hardware store before you get started:


A hand pruner, for pruning small twigs and thin branches.
Loppers, which are used to cut thicker branches that are higher up.
Pole pruners, which cut even thicker branches.
A pruning saw, for the thickest branches you need to cut.;
, Plan to prune in late winter or early spring for the best summer blooms. Pruning before leaves sprout on the tree is also helpful because you get a clearer view of which branches to cut. You can remove flowers when they fade in the summer to encourage a second bloom.

, To keep a crepe myrtle healthy and beautiful, you want to prune with an eye toward opening up the middle of the tree to allow air to flow through more easily. Don't over-prune by lopping the trunks close to the ground. Aside from those guidelines, you can prune your crepe myrtle to a shape and size that works for your yard.


Crepe myrtles can grow about 1 to 2 feet (30-40 cm) per season, so prune based on your desired tree height. For example, if you want your tree to be about 6 feet (2 m) tall, you will want to prune back to 4 to 5 feet (121 cm to 166 cm).
Keep in mind that new growth will sprout from the pruned areas.

Get some bypass garden pruning shears to prune a ficus.,
Choose the right time to prune.,
Examine the tree to see where it needs to be controlled.,
Look along the branches in the area you want to prune until you find a node.,
Cut the branch on a slight downward slant just before a node.",How to Prune a Ficus Tree,";
,


Prune your ficus tree after new growth stops for the best results. Most ficus trees put out new growth in spring and early summer. Late summer and early fall are good times to prune.
Prune right before bringing a ficus back indoors if it was summered outside.
Pruning can be done anytime if it’s necessary to make the plant fit into a certain area.
Prune off dead or broken branches at any time.







,


Decide whether you need to limit the height or the width or both.






Look at the form of the tree and try to prune so that the tree has a natural looking form.

, This is where a leaf or a twig joins the stem.

,


Cut as close to the node as you can without cutting into it.
Always leave at least 1 node on a branch if you want new growth in that area.
If you want to eliminate a branch so that no new growth occurs there, cut it back to just before the trunk or main limb and don’t leave a node.

Stand back and observe how the crepe myrtle is growing.,
Prune small sprouts at bottom of tree first.,
Cut side branches.,
Prune out dead and crossing branches.,
Cut long or arching branches back to where they are no more than 1/2-inch in diameter.",How to Prune a Crepe Myrtle2," Brutal knobbing (the method above) can produce a lot of blooms but it comes at the expense of the shape of the tree. This is because crepe myrtles will skin over and repair any place where a branch has been removed. Therefore, imagine that after you've pruned, whatever you leave behind will grow larger in both circumference and length each year.


Look at images of crepe myrtles from a hundred years ago and you'll see how beautiful the tree looked when pruned more gently.

, These are called ""suckers."" Left untrimmed, these will give your crepe myrtle a bushy appearance, and may compete with your main trunks for resources. Suckers can be pulled out when they first sprout or trimmed with a hand pruner. Leave the large, healthy, thick trunks to keep growing taller and stronger., Prune any branches coming out of side of the trunk up to about halfway up the trunk. This is called limbing-up, and helps the tree retain an attractive shape.


For younger trees that you are starting to shape, prune the small limbs from the ground up, leaving only the 3-5 strongest limbs.
Remove smaller branches that are growing horizontally or toward the inside of the tree.

, You can use hand pruners for small, thin branches that you can reach, loppers for branches that are more than 1/2 inch (12 mm) thick, or a pole pruner for thicker or taller branches. Cut branches that are growing at an angle or that detract from the shape you are trying to achieve.

, Branches that are too thin will still bloom, but they will not be able to bear the weight of the blooms and will droop or break.If you're cutting a branch back to the trunk, cut flush with the trunk instead of leaving a stub.
Use loppers for lower branches or pole pruners for the tall ones out of reach.
It is not necessary to cut off seed pods. It won't affect blooming.

"
Look at the flower color.,
Check the bark color.,
Evaluate the growing pattern.",How to Prune a Crepe Myrtle3," There are dozens of varieties of crepe myrtle, and each has a different growing pattern that may impact how you want to prune it. One way to narrow down the type of crepe myrtle you are growing is to look at the color of the blossoms. This alone will not tell you what type of plant you have, but it can assist you in narrowing down your search.Popular varieties of crepe myrtle include Catawba, which has purple blooms, Osage, which has light pink blossoms, Natchez, which has white blooms, and Miami, which has bright pink flowers.The length of the bloom may also help you figure out your variety. Some crepe myrtle plants, such as Natchez and Osage, have longer blooming periods than the average plant.

, Along with blossom color, the bark color of your crepe myrtle can help you figure out which variety you have. Bark may range in color from gray to brown, and may be muted or vibrant. Compare both bark and flower color to help you determine which crepe myrtle plant you are working with.Catawba has a light gray-brown bark, while Osage and Miami have a deep chestnut brown color. Natchez has cinnamon-colored bark.

, Crepe myrtles can grow in number of ways, and the nature of their growth will impact you you trim them. Some varieties grow like small trees, while others as small, compact shrubs, and others still grow as broad, spreading shrubs. Look at how your crepe myrtle grows to determine how you want to prune it.Catawba grow as a small shrub where Osage grows as a large shrub or small tree. Both Miami and Natchez grow as trees, though Natchez varieties tend to arch where Miami varieties grow upright.

Remove branches during the winter or early spring.,
Remove deadwood.,
Cut off diseased or insect-infested branches.,
Prune away old, twiggy stems.Some dogwood varieties, particularly the shrubby types, are valued mostly for the colorful bark that grows on new stems.,
Thin out crowded areas.,
Remove shoots that grow below the graft point.Some hybrid or variegated dogwood varieties are created by grafting together two separate dogwood trees.,
Determine whether or not you need to remove lower branches.",How to Prune a Dogwood1," The dogwood should still be in a dormant state when you remove branches. Sawing or otherwise removing branches during the late spring or summer, after the tree begins to actively grow, can create fresh, appealing entry spots for insects that like to bore into the wood of the tree.;
, Wood that is dying or dead will do nothing good for your tree. In fact, leaving it on the tree may actually cause problems. Deadwood is more likely to grow mold or other fungi, which can then spread to healthy parts of the dogwood.

, Like dead branches, diseased branches will only invite further infection to the rest of your dogwood. When cutting off noticeably diseased branches, you should dip the shears or saw into a solution made of one part bleach and three parts water to sterilize them. Otherwise, you may accidentally spread the disease to other parts of the tree.

, You can either cut back the old stems on these dogwoods or cut them down completely. For shrubby dogwoods, you can actually cut the dogwood down to the ground every few years to remove old stems and encourage the growth of new twigs.

, If a particular section of your dogwood tree seems abnormally thick or crowded, select the weakest branches from that spot and cut them back to their point of origin.

, A branch that grows beneath the grafting point will have characteristics of one of the original trees used for the hybrid, rather than the hybrid dogwood itself. To keep the foliage and appearance of the tree consistent, you should remove these unexpected branches by sawing or pruning them off at the point of origin.

, Sometimes, the lowest branches of the dogwood can interfere with walking or other gardening activities. Other times, the branches hang so low that the underside of the tree does not receive enough air. In either case, the lowest branches can be sawed off or cut away with heavy-duty shears.

"
"
Snip away the flower buds.,
Prune your dogwood to encourage flowering in early summer.",How to Prune a Dogwood2," Cut off the buds at the tip of each branch to redirect energy to buds on the side of the branch. By removing a singe bud, you encourage the development of multiple buds, leading to a fuller setting of flowers. These buds can either be snipped off with shears or pinched off by hand.

, June is generally considered the best month for this type of pruning, but any time in the early summer will work. You should not snip buds off during the dormant season since doing so will cut the flowers off before they have the chance to open, rather than simply redirecting the energy. Do not wait too late into the summer, though, because doing so will not allow the buds to build up enough energy for new shoots and buds for the next year."

Perform major pruning during the dormant season.,
Remove suckers.,
Remove water sprouts.,
Cut off dead or dying wood.,
Saw off inward growing branches.,
Prune away branches that cross or come too close.,
Saw off lower branches, if desired.,
Keep aesthetic pruning to a minimum.,
Watch for fire blight.,
Trim away fresh vertical water sprouts and suckers in the summer.",How to Prune a Crabapple Tree," The ideal time to prune a crabapple tree is late winter or in the cold days of early spring, before leaves appear.You can prune in early winter, but it may make the tree vulnerable to cold injury.Always wait until after the first killing frost to ensure that the tree has gone dormant.
In a pinch, you can prune the tree in early summer after it is done blooming, but the risk of ""fire blight"" or other disease is higher.Finish all pruning before June (December in the Southern Hemisphere).;
, Suckers are additional branches that begin growing underground and sprout near the base of the tree. Young suckers are thin and weak enough to cut away with sharp shears. Cut the suckers off at the base, at the exact point where they emerge from the ground.


Suckers usually come from the rootstock the crabapple was grafted onto. If left alone, these branches can develop into new trunks with a different flower and fruit.Unfortunately, this process can leave the tree weak or vulnerable to disease, and the new trunk may not have desirable fruit.
Excessive sucker growth can be a sign that the tree was planted too deep, or that the tree's health is declining., Water sprouts are thin, straight shoots that grow vertically or at a vertical slant from the main branches of the tree. These shoots do not fruit and can crowd out other branches, leading to disease and insect problems from reduced air flow.Cut them away at the base with sharp shears.

, Clearing dead wood is a good idea at any time of year, since it can introduce disease. Remove the entire dead or dying branch at its base, using a saw if needed. A branch that appears weak or isn't budding with the rest of the tree may be dying off. To verify this, scratch the branch to remove a portion of the bark and reveal the flesh underneath. If the flesh is white-green, the branch is living. If it is brown or black, the branch is dead.

, Occasionally, a branch will begin to twist inward as it grows, heading back toward the center of the tree instead of out away from the center. Remove these branches to maintain the shape of the tree. Saw them off at the base, as near to the trunk as you can get without accidentally cutting into the trunk or other branches., Along with inward growing branches, some branches become distorted by crossing over one another or intertwining. Similarly, some branches originate too close to one another on the trunk of the tree, which increases the likelihood of the branches eventually crossing.


For branches that are already crossing, you will likely need to saw off both branches at the base of the branches, nearest the trunk of the tree.






For branches that are growing near each other but are not yet crossing, you can get away with only removing one branch. Saw off the weakest or most awkwardly placed branch at its base.







, Branches that hang low can interfere with walking, mowing, or other activities that require you to pass beneath the tree. If this is the case, you can cut away these lower branches by sawing them off close to the trunk. If this is not a problem, the lower branches can stay., Many arborists are tempted by additional live branch pruning to shape the crabapple's growth. This is risky with this genus, since over-pruning can trigger an explosion of water spout growth in future years.If you want to take the chance, restrict yourself to a few scattered thinning cuts, removing small branches all the way back to the parent stem instead of just to a bud.

The upper crown of the tree is especially likely to respond with water sprouts if pruned back.Even an experienced arborist should not remove more than 25% of a crabtree's total live canopy in one year.This includes all the higher-priority tasks above before aesthetic pruning begins.

, Fire blight infection is a common problem in crabapples, especially after pruning. If a branch is blackened or grows ""mummified"" fruit, cut off that branch as well as the branch it grew from, then discard it away from the trees.Disinfect all tools.

If one of these branches is a major limb, you may be able to save it (especially in winter). Scrape off the outer and inner layers of bark, down to living tissue. Remove all discolored areas revealed by this process, plus 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) of wood beyond them.

, You may notice new small water sprouts or sucker shoots throughout the active growing season. You can cut these extra branches away as you notice them instead of waiting for the primary pruning season. Cutting them away redirects energy to the parts of the crabapple tree you want to preserve, and cutting them away early is often easier to do than pruning them later.


To prevent disease, take special care to use clean tools when pruning during the growing season.
Try to catch the water sprouts when they are less than 12 inches (30 cm) long, and when the base is still green. At this stage you can pull off the sprout by hand. This makes it harder for a new one to grow in its place."

Use a kaolin clay-based repellent.,
Use a chemical or organic repellent.,
Purchase an animal-based repellent.,
Get fake animals to scare away real ones.,
Play sounds or noise to ward off animals.",How to Protect Fruit Trees from Animals1," A kaolin clay-based repellent is made of naturally occurring ingredients and can help repel animals and insects from eating the fruit off your tree. You can purchase the repellent at some nurseries or find it online. This repellent will leave a white film on your fruit and tastes bad to most animals and insects. Kaolin clay repellents are not useful for fuzzy fruits like peaches or apricots or smaller fruits like cherries or plums.Kaolin clay repellents are hard to get off, so make sure that you wash your fruit thoroughly before consuming it.;
, Some chemical repellents are not healthy for human consumption. Make sure to find a chemical based critter repellent that is safe for your fruits. Before spraying the area with the solution, make sure to read the label for any special details or instructions that you should know.Some fruit-friendly natural repellents will include ingredients like pepper, peppermint, tarragon, garlic, castor oil, and putrescent egg solids.

, Animal repellents like predator urine or musk may ward animals off of your fruit trees. Read the instructions on the bottle of the repellent before using it. In general, you can usually spray these repellents two feet away from the trunk of your trees to discourage animals from eating your fruit.

, Fake animals like hawks, owls, and snakes can act as scarecrows to the critters infesting your fruit garden. Place these props around your garden to ward off animals.You can also attract real predators by making roosting spots for real hawks and owls by placing crossbeams six to eight feet off the ground., Playing a radio is a great way to scare away potential predators from your garden. You can also opt to buy a more specialized ultrasonic repellent that sends ultrasonic sound waves to ward off rodents and other garden critters.It's important to note that eventually the animals may become accustomed to the noise, and ignore the source of the sound.If your radio has an alarm or timer, playing the noise intermittently may work better to ward off critters.

Set the trap in a known animal route.,
Mask your scent on the trap.,
Determine what animal is eating your fruit.,
Lay the appropriate bait in your trap.,
Set the trap up so it stands upright.,
Release the animal in a forest or park.",How to Protect Fruit Trees from Animals2," If your fruit trees have been disturbed by an animal in the past, there is likely a route that the animal habitually takes to gorge on your plants. Places like a hole in your fence, a well-worn path leading from the garden, or entrances leading to a burrow are obvious signs of a known route. Set your trap up on these routes to maximize the chance that you'll catch it.You can maximize your chances of catching a burrowing animal by setting the trap up directly at the entrance of the hole.

, A human scent on a trap can act as a deterrent for most animals and can prevent you from successfully trapping your animal. There are two main ways that you can mask your scent on the trap that you plan on using. One way is to wash the trap with a mild soap, then immerse it in boiling water to remove your scent. Another way to mask your scent is by leaving the trap outdoors in the sunshine for several days. Moving your trap outdoors will make the trap smell like the surrounding environment., Animals like chipmunks, squirrels, and rabbits will usually exhibit signs such as biting off large parts of the plant, eating an entire plant to the ground, or the removing and damaging individual fruit. Look for these signs to verify that your plants are being eaten by a mammal and not insects. Knowing which animal is eating your plant will help you get the right bait and appropriately sized trap. Monitor your plants and see which animals are pestering them.If you can't determine what animal is eating your fruit plants, you can set up hidden cameras to catch the animals in the act.
If your plants are slowly being eaten away and there are small holes all over your fruit, chances are that insects have been eating it.

, Different animals prefer different foods and will be attracted to different baits. For example, rabbits prefer foods like apples, carrots, pea pods, peppermint, or cider sprayed over the trap while raccoons enjoy sugar filled foods like marshmallows as well as different kinds of fish. Use the right bait for the animal that is eating your fruit plants. Opossums eat marshmallows, apples, melons, other fruit.
Skunks prefer chicken, fish, and bacon.
Squirrels enjoy nuts, seeds, and peanut butter.

, A loose cage on the ground can be tipped over or manipulated by the animal in your yard. The doors on most live traps will only stay closed when the trap is sitting upright. To keep your trap standing upright, shove a metal rod through the trap into the ground to hold it in place. Alternatively, you could strap the trap to a tree or pile of rocks to secure it. Make sure that the trap is secure and won't fall over if an animal gets caught in it., Since all of these traps are no-kill traps, the final step in your animal trapping journey is to release them into the wild. Take the animal to a park or forest and carefully tip the trap to release it. Wild animals, even smaller mammals can be dangerous or carry disease, so be incredibly careful when releasing the critter. Confirm with your local park department if it's okay to release the animal you've trapped before you release it. If it's not authorized, then call animal control to come to your house to remove the animal.Wear thick construction gloves to protect your fingers from animal bites when handling the trap.

Drive a 4-foot (1.2 meters) wooden stake into the ground.,
Roll your mesh sleeve up.,
Slide the mesh sleeve around the post.,
Staple the mesh around the post.,
Cut off any remaining mesh on the top of your post.",How to Protect Fruit Trees from Animals3," Use a hammer to tap the top of the stake into the ground a half inch (12.7 mm) into the ground. The post should be one or two inches away from the tree or plant that you want to protect.If you are trying to protect a larger fruit tree, make sure that you get a long enough post so that animals won't be able to reach your fruit.

, Press down on the edges of the sleeve and roll the sleeve lengthwise. This will help open up the wire mesh so that you can slide it over your fruit tree. Once it's rolled, unroll it and open up the mesh so it looks like a tube.

, The wire mesh sleeve should fit over the stake that you put into the ground as well as your fruit tree. If the trunk of your fruit tree is larger, you may have to wrap the wire mesh around the tree.

, Overlap the wire mesh on top of the post in the ground and carefully staple it one inch from the top and bottom of the post. Continue to add staples with a staple gun every inch apart until the mesh sleeve is securely fastened to the post in the ground.

, If there is leftover mesh on the top of your tree guard, it could prevent the tree from growing. Use wire cutters to cut off any remaining mesh at the top and allow there to be a hole so that your tree can continue growing.

",How to Protect Trees from Lightning,";
,


The down lead cable is the part of the rod that runs down along the tree's trunk. For trees with a diameter of less than 3 ft. (or 1 meter), use 1 down lead; for larger trees, use 2 down leads placed on opposite sides of the trunk. If you are using 2 down leads, repeat the following steps for each one.

,,


The air terminal collects the positive charge from the ground and forces the lightning bolt to strike a concentrated point. The air terminal must be as high as possible to reduce the risk of damaging any part of the tree above it.

,, Continue until you hit the ground.

,


The drip line is the area within which the three has roots. You want to guide the lightning bolt outside this area so as to prevent damage to the root structure.
To find the drip line, measure the circumference of the tree and divide by 2. Mark this distance from the base of the trunk in all directions.

Wait for the right time of year to prune.,
Look for any dieback.,
Prune your butterfly bush with a hard cut.,
Dead-head the spent blooms while the plant is flowering.,
Remove spent blooms at the end of the season.",How to Prune a Butterfly Bush," There are two types of butterfly bushes: Buddleia davidii and Buddleia alternifolia.Prune your Buddleia davidii in early spring. If you had a particularly mild winter, or live in a warmer climate, you could also choose to prune your butterfly bush in late winter. To tell when to prune, look for signs of new growth on the lower stems near the ground.
Buddleia alternifolia should be pruned in mid to late summer, right after it has bloomed. This kind of butterfly bush blooms on stems from the previous year. It blooms in spring.;
, Dieback is caused by harsh winters or disease. In this case, a particularly cold winter could cause dieback in your butterfly bush. When a plant dies back, the tips of the leaves or roots begin to die, slowly leading to a reverse death that ends in the death of the whole plant. Dieback is common in butterfly bushes in colder climates--butterfly bushes often dieback all the way to their roots in very cold winters. However, this does not mean that they cannot be saved--that’s what pruning is for.Butterfly bushes are late to break dormancy, meaning that you don’t need to check for any winter damage as the plant may still just be dormant.

, Because they do often dieback in the winter, butterfly bushes can handle intense pruning--and often require it. You should prune your butterfly bushes to about a foot from ground level. Use pruning shears to cut the bush back to about one-third of its size.If your butterfly bush is in the back of a garden up against a fence and you want it to grow tall, cut it back to about two feet so that the plant will produce higher growing (and thus flowering) stems. You will then be able to plant lower growing plants near the butterfly bush while still being able to see the flowers of the butterfly bush.

, This means that you should pick or cut the flowers that have died while the bush continues to bloom. Spent blooms will start to turn brown and will look very wilted. Cut the dead blooms back to where they attach to the stem. Doing this will ensure that your bush produce new flower buds longer into the blooming season than they would if the bush was left unattended., At the end of the season, you should dead-head all of the now finished blooms. This will help the plant along when creating buds for the next year. It will also limit the butterfly bush’s chances of self-seeding and thus taking over your entire garden."

Dry the eucalyptus plant.",How to Preserve Eucalyptus," To ensure you preserve only the finest eucalyptus, harvest the branches when they are at their healthiest. This will reduce the time and effort you need to spend pruning the branches later.There are over 700 species of eucalyptus trees and plants, so it can be difficult to know what branches in peak condition look like. Generalizing about their properties at their peak is impossible.
For instance, one species (E. dundasii) has shiny green leaves throughout its life.Another species (E. caesia) has shiny green leaves only when young.Identify the species of eucalyptus you wish to preserve and check a botanical reference guide to find out what the species you're dealing with looks like during its peak.;
, Avoid collecting plants right after it rains, or early in the morning when they might have dew on them. If possible, collect your eucalyptus after several days of dry weather.Collecting damp plants could encourage mold growth and will make it harder for the plant to circulate glycerin, the preserving agent that you will use later.

, Stay away from eucalyptus plants whose flowers are brown or drooping. Healthy eucalyptus flowers are generally white, pink, or red. Healthy eucalyptus leaves should be free of holes and have an even green color., To preserve eucalyptus, mix a solution of one part glycerin with two parts water. Heat the mixture to boiling or near-boiling.You can obtain glycerin at your local arts and crafts shop or big box store.

, Once your glycerin and water solution is ready, pour the mixture into a stable, wide-bottomed vase. Place the eucalyptus branches in the vase with the cut end of the stem in the liquid. The liquid should reach about three inches (eight centimeters) up the length of the eucalyptus stem.To help your eucalyptus branches absorb the preservation solution more quickly, slice the bases of the stems a bit, or smash them once or twice with a hammer., Put the vase containing the eucalyptus somewhere with moderate humidity and a temperature of 60 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 24 degrees Celsius).Keep the branches out of direct sunlight as they absorb the preservation solution.Refill the liquid in the vase as need, since some will evaporate over time.

, Your eucalyptus branches will probably need to be in the preservation solution for about four weeks. However, the exact amount of time necessary for the eucalyptus branches to fully absorb the glycerin ranges from about three days to six weeks, depending on the size of your branches.Larger branches will take longer to absorb the glycerin than the shorter branches.

, Once you’ve placed the eucalyptus in a proper location, it will take time for the branches to absorb the solution. Plants that are ready to be removed from the glycerin solution will change color to black or gold, depending on the species. When all the leaves have changed color, the plant is ready to be removed., Cut the stems of the branches up to the point where they were covered by the preservation solution. Wipe away any excess liquid that might remain on the stems.If you plan on preserving more eucalyptus or other plants in the near future, refrigerate the preservation solution and use it again. Otherwise, discard it.

, Lay the eucalyptus branches in a warm, sunny, dry location with good air circulation. After three to five days, hang the eucalyptus branches upside down by their stems in a warm, dry, dark room. After two to three weeks, your eucalyptus plants should be ready to use.If you don’t intend to use your eucalyptus branches immediately, store them in a dry, cool, dark area.

Plant out.,
Try to avoid planting larger trees.,
Make cuttings.",How to Propagate Pinus Radiata," The plant prefers light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, requires well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. The plant prefers acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It requires dry or moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.;
, Otherwise, sow it in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4 °C (39 °F) can improve the germination of stored seed.

, Protect them for their first winter or two. Pinus radiata plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions, the better they will grow.

, The trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm. It is common enough to plant them out when they are about 5–10 centimeter (2.0–3.9 in) tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch, they establish very well.

, Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and reduces their wind resistance ability.

, This method only works when taken from very young trees that are less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away.

Plant smaller trees closer together.,
Watch out for sterile cultivars.,
Thin the fruits (optional).",How to Pollinate Fruit Trees," Some fruit trees can pollinate themselves. Others need a second fruit tree of a different cultivar. If you don't know what cultivar your tree is, you can try looking it up in a fruit tree guide or contacting an agricultural extension. Here are the most typical situations, although there are exceptions:Most apricot, peach, nectarine, citrus, fig, persimmon, quince, and sour cherry trees can pollinate themselves (they are ""self-fruiful""), although additional trees can improve yield.Skip ahead to the section on pollination.
Most apple, plum, pear, and sweet cherry trees require a second cultivar (they are ""self-unfruitful""). Some cultivars will produce a smaller amount of fruit on their own (""partially self-fruitful""), in certain climates.;
, Assuming you or your neighbor does not already have a fruit tree that fits the bill, you'll need to plant or graft the pollination partner. Before you buy the tree, make sure the cross-pollination will succeed:


If you know the specific cultivar of your fruit tree, look up recommended combinations in a gardening book or local agricultural extension website.
If you do not know the cultivar, choose a ""universal pollinator."" Local fruit growers may be able to recommend one that grows well in your climate.
See the tips section below for a little species-specific advice.

, In order to cross-pollinate each other, the two trees must have flowers at the same time. If possible, find the specific months the new cultivar blooms, and confirm that these overlap with your existing tree. Otherwise, check for ""early-/mid-/late-season"" labels and compare this to your own tree.


The growing season typically lasts between the last spring frost and the first autumn frost, but the exact time period depends on your climate and latitude.
In an orchard, the pollinator should open its flowers slightly earlier, so the pollen is already available when the main crop begins to bloom.While the blooming time should overlap, try to find a species with a different fruiting time. This allows for a longer harvest season.

, Now that you've chosen your cultivar, you'll need to provide its pollen to the tree. There are three ways to do so:



Plant a new fruit tree within 100 ft (30m), and preferably within 50 ft (15m).This option is recommended for most home gardeners.

Graft a branch onto the existing tree. This option requires more expertise, but may be necessary in small gardens or crowded orchards.
Hang a bouquet of flowers from the branches of the tree. Do so in the cool early morning, during periods of bee activity., If you are growing a large number of trees, plan the placement of your pollinating tree. Each main crop tree should be within 100 feet (30.5m) of a pollinator, and preferably within 50–75 ft (15–23m). The optimal placement can rely on many complex factors, including climate and crop management practices. Seek advice from experienced growers, or begin by considering these options:Plant one row of the pollinator between every one to four rows of the main crop. This makes crop management easier, but you may need large numbers of pollinating trees.
In every second or third row, replace every second or third tree with a pollinator. This is a more efficient system, as long as you use enough trees for your orchard setup. This may be inconvenient if you practice crop management techniques along an entire row at once, as the two cultivars may have different requirements.

, Almost all fruit trees require bees to spread their pollen, even self-fruitful trees. You can plant additional flowers to encourage wild bees and other pollinating insects to visit your garden:Plant flowers that bloom at the same time as your fruit trees.
Plant flowers of different colors, sizes, and heights to attract a diverse array of pollinators. Blue, purple, and yellow flowers tend to be more effective.
Grow flowering plants native to your area, which are more likely to attract native bees.
Focus on flowers with one ring of petals, which have more accessible nectar than flowers with multiple layers of petals.

, Honeybees are not the only type of pollinating bee. Many other bee species live alone or in small groups, and can move in to your yard without an elaborate hive setup. Make your yard bee-friendly with these alterations:Leave patches of bare, undisturbed soil for burrowing bees. Ideally, choose a sunny slope.
Mix dirt and sand together and form a mound. Surround with a low, wooden frame, and top with rotting logs or old firewood. Keep the mound clear of all plants besides clumping grasses.
Drill deep holes into the side of fence posts or stumps. Use a variety of drill bits to attract different species. Drill at a slight upward angle to protect against rain.

, If bee populations are low in your area, or if you are growing an entire orchard, hire a beekeeper. Research your cultivar first to determine the most effective pollinating species. The beekeeper will bring her hives to your fruit trees once they bloom, and remove them as the flowers start to fall.


Write a contract in advance that includes the size of the colony (number of frames).If the bees are sluggish or there are not many pollinator trees in your orchard, consider beehive inserts. Place the insert at the hive entrance, and fill it with commercial pollen from the correct variety. Keep pollen cool and away from sun when not in the insert, and add another teaspoon (5mL) every few hours., While bees are by far the most common pollinator, many species can be pollinated by ladybugs or other insects instead. These may be available for purchase at gardening or farming supply stores. Other species may be pollinated by hummingbirds or bats, which require different methods to attract them. Before investing in these species, research your fruit tree cultivar to ensure this is effective.

, Do not spray pesticides on or near blooming trees. Even if directed at other insects, most pesticides have the potential to harm bees and other pollinators., Dandelions and other flowering weeds will waste the effort of your bees. Clear the area around your trees before the blossoms appear., Another option is to transfer the pollen by hand. This is tedious work, so it's mostly used when bees are not available, or when you are selectively breeding trees and want to avoid accidental combinations. Here's one way to try this out:


Fluff up a cotton swab by pinching the end and pulling. (A small paintbrush can work as well.)
Dip the swab onto the pollen of a flower. This yellow dust sits at the end of long stalks (stamens) in the flower center.
Carry the pollen to a second flower and brush it onto a stigma, or sticky female area. This is usually the middle stem, but you may need to look up the location for your species.
Remember to transfer pollen between two different, compatible cultivars. If you only have one, self-fruiting cultivar, you may transfer between flowers on the same tree.

, Lack of pollination is not the only reason a fruit tree can fail to bear fruit. Make sure your tree is protected from frost damage, and avoid excessive amounts of fertilizer.Many fruit trees go through cycles of production. If your fruit tree yields much less fruit this year than last year, don't worry. Most likely, it will continue to produce a large harvest every other year.
Fruit trees also have a minimum age before they blossom profusely and produce fruit. A newly purchased nursery tree is usually one or two years old, and may take anywhere from zero to six years to start fruiting., Because dwarf fruit trees are shorter and smaller than larger varieties, bees are less likely to encounter them. Dwarf fruit trees should be planted within 20 feet (6m) of each other to cros-pollinate., Some fruit trees, mostly certain apple cultivars, have sterile pollen. If you started with a sterile cultivar, the new companion tree will pollinate the sterile tree, but will not bear fruit itself. Plant a third tree if you want the second tree to fruit as well., If you desire a smaller crop with larger individual fruits, remove immature fruit early in the growing season. Always leave the largest fruits on the tree. Where fruits are comparable size, remove fruits until they are spaced evenly along the branch, or until there is only one per spur.This will affect future yields as well. After two or three years of thinning, you may not need to make further adjustments.
Orchard growers may aim for a specific leaf to fruit ratio depending on the cultivar. If you use this approach, make sure not to undermine your efforts while pruning the tree.

Select the right cultivar.,
Plan to plant in autumn or spring.,
Choose a spot that receives full sun.,
Look for areas of well-drained soil.,
Consider training the plant against a wall or fence.,
Dig a hole twice as large as the root ball.Use a shovel to dig a hole twice as wide as the container currently holding the pyracantha plant.,
Carefully remove the plant from its container.,
Transfer the plant into the planting hole.,
Add as small amount of organic fertilizer.,
Space separate plants far enough apart.,
Water consistently as the plants establish themselves.,
Provide moderate water.,
Train the plant if desired.,

Watch out for fire blight and scab.",How to Plant Pyracantha," Different cultivars have slightly different appearances. Choose one that best meets your personal taste.


A few disease-resistant options include Apache, Fiery Cascade, Mohave, Navaho, Pueblo, Rutgers, Shawnee, and Teton.Apache grows 5 feet (1.5 m) high and 6 feet (1.8 m) wide. It produces bright red berries.
Fiery Cascade grows 8 feet (2.4 m) high and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. It produces orange berries that gradually turn red.
Mohave can reach heights and widths of 12 feet (3.7 m) and produces orange-red berries.
Teton survives well in cold climates and can grow as tall as 12 feet (3.7 m) and as wide as 4 feet (1.2 m). The berries are golden yellow.
Gnome is resistant to cold weather and produces orange berries, but it tends to be more susceptible to disease. It grows 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and 8 feet (2.4 m) wide.
Lowboy grows 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) tall but spreads out much further. It produces orange berries and is very weak against disease.;
, Early to mid autumn is the best time to plant pyracantha, but if this season passes you by, the next best time to plant is early spring.

, All pyracantha varieties do best when planted in areas that receive full sun, but most can also survive well enough in areas of partial shade, too.


Avoid areas that receive full western sun exposure since the sunlight can be too intense.

, Pyracantha can tolerate different soils, but the plants generally do best in soils that drain well.


This plant is actually a great choice for soils that aren't very fertile. Nutrient-dense soils can cause the shrub to become very bushy. As a result, it becomes weaker against diseases like fire blight and may yield less fruit.
Note that the ideal soil pH for pyracantha is between 5.5 and 7.5. In other words, it does well in neutral to slightly acidic soils., Most cultivars have a tendency to spread out if they are not trained to grow against a tall surface. Planting the shrub near a bare wall or fence can encourage upward growth.


Pyracantha has dangerous thorns. When the plant grows tall instead of wide, these thorns are kept out of reach.
When planting pyracantha against a wall, choose a planting site 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) away from the wall itself. Soils directly next to the wall can be too dry.
Avoid planting the shrub next to a painted wall, doorway, or gate since the thorns and prickly leaves can scrape away the paint.
It is also recommended that you do not train the plant against the foundation of single-story buildings since it can grow too large and cause problems., The hole should be approximately the same depth as the container.

, Tip the container holding the pyracantha on its side. Glide a shovel or trowel around the perimeter of the container to loosen root mass and soil, then gently wedge the plant out by applying pressure from the bottom.


When removing a plant from a disposable plastic container, you can usually press on the sides of the container to ease the plant out.
If removing the plant from a firmer container, slide the trowel down along one side of the container. Once it is as deep as possible, tilt the handle of the trowel back. The leverage should help pry the root ball out.

, Place the pyracantha in the center of the planting hole. Fill the rest of the hole in with soil.


Make sure that the shrub is planted to the same depth as it was in its previous container. If you surround the stem with too much soil, it can weaken or kill the plant.

, Sprinkle a handful of bone meal onto the soil around the base of the plant. Use your hands or a small garden fork to gently work it into the soil.Bone meal is an organic fertilizer that adds phosphorus to the soil. It can encourage root development and make it easier for the plant to establish itself. If you want to use another fertilizer, make sure that you choose one that provides a high dosage of phosphorus.

, If you choose to plant multiple pyracantha shrubs, you should space each shrub 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm ) apart.Note that if you choose to plant multiple rows to create a thicker hedge, each row should be 28 to 40 inches (70 to 100 cm) apart.

, Water the pyracantha regularly for the first month after transplanting it. It will need more water than usual as it establishes itself in the garden soil.


The soil should receive a little water each day. If the weather forecast does not predict any rain for the day, lightly water the soil in the morning.
The soil shouldn't be so soaked that puddles begin to form, but it is important that you do not allow the soil to completely dry out during this time. The plants will become too stressed and may begin dropping leaves.

, Established pyracantha can survive mild to moderate droughts, but if the area has not received any rainwater in over a week, you should soak the soil around the base of the plant using a garden hose. Provide enough water to thoroughly saturate the soil.


If the plant begins to drop leaves, it probably isn't getting enough water.
If the leaves begin to turn yellow or if the wood of the plant becomes soft, it might be receiving too much water.

, If you planted the pyracantha against a wall or fence, you can encourage it to grow upward and against this structure instead of growing outward.


Most pyracantha cultivars are strong enough to hold themselves against a wall or fence without any assistance, but they will still benefit from being tied down.
Run wires along your wall next to the pyracantha and tie the branches of the shrub to these wires with string or cable ties.
If you are training the pyracantha against a fence or trellis, you can tie the branches directly to the structure using string or cable ties.

, Spread a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of organic mulch around the base of each pyracantha shrub. Mulch can hold in moisture, thereby preventing the roots of the plant from weakening due to intense dry weather.


Mulch also protects the plant from ground frost during cold winters

, Fertilizer is usually unnecessary when you're dealing with pyracantha. If anything, nitrogen-rich fertilizers can do more harm than good.


Nitrogen causes the plant to grow too many leaves. As a result, fruit yield suffers and the plant can be more susceptible to disease.
If you do choose to fertilize the plant, use a balanced fertilizer containing equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium or one containing more phosphorus and potassium than nitrogen. Apply it once during early spring and a second time during late summer.

, You can technically prune pyracantha during any time of the year, but many gardeners choose to prune these shrubs once in mid spring, once in early to mid fall, and once more in late fall to early winter.


Wait until the plant finishes flowering in mid spring to remove new growth. Prune the new growth at your own discretion, leaving at least a few flowers so that fruit will develop in the fall. Note that fruit will only develop on growth that is at least one year in age.
Prune the leaves of the plant when the fruits develop in early to mid fall. Remove just enough growth to expose the fruit to air and prevent it from rotting.
Remove leaves and branches selectively in the late fall to early winter to accentuate the best of the brightly colored berries.
No matter when you prune the plant, you should never remove more than one-third of the growth.

, Aphids, scales, lace bugs, and spider mites are the four pests most likely to appear. If an infestation of either one occurs, treat the shrub with an appropriate pesticide following the label instructions.


If you plan to consume the fruit produced by the pyracantha, it is strongly recommended that you rely on organic pesticides rather than chemical options.

, Fire blight is a bacterial disease that will kill the plant. Scab is a fungal disease that causes the plant to lose leaves and changes the fruit to a dark, sooty color, making them inedible in the process.


Prevention is more successful than treatment when disease is concerned. Choose disease-resistant cultivars and maintain proper moisture and airflow conditions.
There is no known cure to stop the spread of fire blight once it develops.
If scab develops, you can attempt to treat the disease with a fungicide. This treatment may or may not be successful, though.

Pick the right spot to plant the sapling.,
Remove grass and weeds from the spot.,
Dig a small hole for the bulb.,
Place the bulb of the sapling into the hole.,
Fill the hole up with soil.,
Spread 4 inches of mulch around the tree.",How to Grow Snowball Trees1," Snowball trees are generally hardy plants that can withstand most climates. However, if you live in a particularly hot climate, choose a spot in your garden where the plant is shaded for at least part of the day. Snowball trees grow best in well-drained, slightly acidic soil.Fully grown snowball trees can grow from 12-20 feet tall and wide. Plan your garden accordingly so that your tree doesn’t end up infringing on other plants!
Buy a snowball tree sapling at a local gardening store or at an online gardening retail site.;
, After you have decided on a spot to plant your tree, remove any weeds, rock or debris from the area. This gives the tree a more hospitable environment so that it can grow without interference. Removing weeds also eliminates the competition for nutrients and water in the soil., Dig a small hole about three times the diameter and just deep enough for the root ball. Use your hands or a small shovel to dig the hole. Discard any rocks or stones you may find while digging., Carefully take the snowball sapling out of its container. Use your fingers to gently loosen the visible roots of the bulb away from the sides so that they stick out from the bulb. Then lower the bulb into the hole.Make sure that the point of the sapling where the trunk meets the roots is 1 ½ to 2 inches above ground level.

, Take the soil that you discarded when you were digging and backfill the hole. Pat the soil around the bulb to eliminate any space between the bulb and the surrounding earth to ensure that the bulb is protected from the elements., Transplanting can be shocking to a sapling, and the tree will need extra nutrients to ensure it can flourish in its new location. Spread a 4-inch deep layer of mulch over the whole planting area. Mulch enriches the soil and also helps to retain moisture and discourage weed growth."

Find softwood branches on the parent tree.,
Cut the branch 6 inches from its end.,
Remove blossoms and leaves.,
Dip the branch into rooting hormone powder.,
Prepare a seedling flat with potting mix.,
Plant the cuttings in the flat.,
Cover the cuttings with a plastic bag.,
Remove the plastic bag when the cuttings starts to root.,
Transplant the cuttings into pots.",How to Grow Snowball Trees2," Another way to grow a snowball tree is to grow new plants from cuttings taken from the stems of a fully grown snowball tree, or parent plant. To test if a branch has reached the ideal softwood stage, bend the branch. If the branch bends, then breaks into two pieces, it is at the softwood stage.If the branch bends but doesn’t break, it is too immature and likely won’t develop into a new tree.
Take cuttings from the parent tree between March and July.

, Use a sharp pair of gardening shears to cleanly cut a 6-inch length of branch. Make sure that the branch has at least two sets of leaves along its length. Try to make the cutting in the morning before the sun comes up to ensure that the shoots are well hydrated.Even if you only want to end up with one snowball tree, make several cuttings. Because cuttings don’t have a 100% success rate of blooming into plants, it’s better to use two or three cuttings than to put all of your hopes on just one.

, Use your fingers or a small pair of clippers to remove blossoms from the stem of the tree, making the cut close to the stem. Also peel off the leaves on the lower half of the branch, peeling close to the branch. This is the area of the branch from which roots will eventually grow when you plant the cutting., Rooting hormone powder betters the chances that the cutting will bloom into a plant. Pour the powder into a small bowl, and then dip the branch into the bowl, making sure that the powder covers the leaf nodes where you peeled away the leaves., Purchase a seedling flat with drainage holes in the bottom to plant your cuttings. Fill the flat with a well-drained potting mix that contains around 60% sand or perlite and 40% sphagnum peat., Poke your finger into the potting mix to make a hole that is about 2 inches deep. Then insert a cutting into the hole you made, making sure that the end of the branch with the leaf nodes you trimmed is going into the soil and that the leaf nodes are completely covered.Press the potting soil around the trimming so that it can stand upright in the container without falling over.
Water the potting mixture so that the soil is evenly moist., Place the tray into a large plastic bag, tenting the top so that the bag doesn’t touch the top of the cuttings. The plastic bag will ensure that water doesn’t evaporate away from the cuttings as they start to take root.If you are having trouble keeping the plastic bag from touching the tops of the cuttings, tape tall straws onto the corners of the seeding tray and settle the bag on top of the straws.
Check the tray every now and then and water the soil when it is dry.

, After about four to six weeks, the cuttings should start to grow roots. To check for roots, gently brush away the potting soil from the base of the plant, or very gently tug at the plant to see if there is some resistance from the roots. When you notice roots, remove the plastic bag and water regularly to keep the soil moist.

, After about one week from time you removed the plastic bag, transplant the cuttings into small pots filled with potting soil. Do this by gently lifting the plants from the tray, making sure not to break any of the roots. Place the plants into a small hole in the potting soil, then press soil around the base of the cuttings. Water evenly to keep the soil moist.If more than one cutting took root, transplant them into separate pots.
If you wish, you can transplant the snowball trees into the garden two to three weeks after you transplant them into the pots. Make sure not to forgo the potting step before transplanting into a garden.

Use slow-acting fertilizer about four weeks after planting.,
Remove dead or damaged branches.,
Remove suckers close to the base of the tree.,
Water when the soil is dry.",How to Grow Snowball Trees3," Reinvigorate the soil by sprinkling a slow-acting fertilizer around the snowball tree a month after you’ve put it in the ground. Slow-acting fertilizer delivers nutrients over a long period of time to keep your plant healthy., Cut off dead blooms or branches during blooming season, which takes place from March to July. Trimming dead growths from the plant will make the branches grow back healthier and bushier.


Use a sharp pair of gardening shears to cut off the damaged section., Suckers are offshoots of the snowball tree that look like thick branches growing on ground level. Because suckers are offshoots of the tree, they cause the tree to divide its nutrients and resources between the main part of the tree and the suckers. Use pruning shears to cut the sucker cleanly close to where its base meets the tree.Removing suckers allows the tree to retain all of its nutrients, making it much healthier.

, Check on your plant every week or so. If your area is experiencing a drought or has had very little rain, water your snowball tree. This is especially important when your tree is young and delicate.


Be sure to water at the base of the plant instead of over the top of the plant. Watering at the base ensures that the roots absorb the water.

Ask your employer about living conditions:


How much are daily camp costs?,
Buy or borrow all the necessary gear.,
Keep Fit.,
Pack your gear, find a way up to your meeting place, and good luck!

",How to Prepare for Tree Planting," For example, in Canada, tree-planting mainly occurs in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario, which all have unique conditions that must be considered. Research where in your region is best to plant your tree.


You can also search globally for potential employment.;
, This is done primarily online, through online applications. You will hear back from them either by email or phone.

,
Will you be living in hotels or in a bush camp, in which case you will need to provide your own tent.
Will you be able to purchase your planting equipment, shovel, planting bags, hardhat, and high-vis, through them?
Will meals be provided, and do you have to bring your own dinnerware and cutlery?

, Second-hand gear is great, since it will get very, very dirty anyway.


If you will be in a bush-camp, opt for a small to medium-sized tent, which will provide you enough room to live in, but be sturdier against wind. You don't want to come home at the end of a long day to a blown-over or rained-out tent. Furthermore, bring a pillow, warm sleeping bag or two, and ground pad; nights can be cold and you'll appreciate a comfortable sleep.
Bring some clothing made of synthetic material to work in on rainy days. You won't stay dry, so it is important to stay warm (in some areas, you might get snow in the first few weeks). Otherwise, you don't need lots of expensive high-tech apparel.
Employers often require steel-toed boots. Buy them slightly larger, since you'll often wear thick socks, and your feet will probably swell after walking all day.
Wool socks are excellent in reducing the number of blisters you'll get. Your feet will probably be wet or damp way more often than you think.
Black flies love dark colours, so opt for light-coloured shirts.
If you are buying your shovel second-hand and one of the kick-blades is removed, make sure the seller has the same dominant hand as you.
You'll drink a lot of water on the job. Bring a jug large enough to hold at least 135oz (4 L).

, You will be doing hard manual labour out-doors up to 10 hours almost every day. Increasing your endurance and strength in your upper and lower body, and core before the season starts will help you succeed.

Prepare the planting area with good drainage and compost.,
Avoid damaging the roots when planting.,
Feed the tree.",How to Prepare Trees to Avoid Root Rot," Avoid soggy areas unless you are specifically planting a tree that is able to cope with poor drainage, such as a mangrove or willow. Always prefer areas that drain well over areas that are water heavy and stay waterlogged for a long period of time.;
, prior to planting. It is important to keep new trees well away from diseased areas for some time. Treatments can be added to speed up the ""sterilization"" process but they are chemicals and can present a health hazard for both your garden and your own health., This will ensure a good and healthy start to your tree's life.

, It is also important to avoid damaging the trees by digging or obstructing the roots in any way.

, A well-fed tree will always be more resistant to disease than a poorly fed one. Try a solution using seaweed as a base for an eco-friendly and nutrient-rich feed. This stimulates the soil microbes to keep the soil healthy and ensures good plant growth.

Choose a good location.,
Amend the soil only if desired.,
Obtain a young redbud in a container from a local garden store or nursery.,
Dig a hole that is four times as wide as the root ball.,
Remove the redbud tree from its container.,
Place the tree in the hole.,
Fill the hole with water and the remainder of the soil.,
Add mulch to the area.",How to Plant Redbud Trees1," Redbud trees prefer light shade, especially in the summer. The tree is fairly adaptable, however, and can also tolerate full sun. In fact, the more sun it receives during the cold months of winter, the better. The only locations that need to be avoided are those with heavy shade., Redbud trees prefer loose, well-drained soil, but they are very sturdy and can thrive in the majority of soil types. If you do decide to amend the soil, though, you can do so simply by chopping the soil up with a rake or shovel to loosen it. If it is extremely dense or clay-like, you could even mix in some coarse grain garden sand to improve its ability to drain. You do not need to add fertilizer, however, since redbud trees are capable of absorbing nitrogen in through the air.

, Local stores are more likely to have stock that can withstand the climate you live in. The tree can be difficult to transplant as it gets older, so you should get as immature a tree as possible., The roots need plenty of room to spread out inside the hole. The hole should also be about equal in depth to the height of the roots.

, Place the tree on its side and gently twist the container off.

, Keep it as vertical as possible, enlisting the help of another person if necessary. Add a little soil back in to help keep the plant standing straight.

, Use a garden hose to fill the hole with water. Wait until the roots and the surrounding soil absorb the water before filling the hole with the rest of the soil, covering the roots completely. Give the soil another thorough watering to help the soil settle.

, Use bark chips or another type of moisture-retaining mulch. Spread the mulch in a thin layer around the base of the tree, above the root area.

"
"
Make sure the tree receives moderate amounts of water.,
Keep the branches pruned.,
Skip the fertilizer.,
Watch out for pests and disease.Leaf anthracnose, botryosphaeria canker, and verticillium wilt are the three diseases that affect redbud trees most often.",How to Plant Redbud Trees2," Once established, the tree can withstand short periods of drought, but it always prefers to be kept moist. When it is still young, within the first one or two seasons after being planted, you should give the tree a thorough watering if you experience a drought that lasts for two weeks or more.

, You can prune during the late fall or on a mildly cold day in winter, while temperatures are above the freezing point. You can also prune during the late spring, after the blooms have fallen from the tree. Remove diseased wood first. Then, cut away old lower branches close to the trunk, as well as any branches that are intertwined or growing in the wrong direction. Never remove more than 1/4 of the tree at once.

, Redbud trees grow well enough on their own without the use of fertilizer. Moreover, since the trees have the ability to absorb nitrogen on their own, adding a nitrogen-rich fertilizer will only overdose the tree. If you do feel inclined to add fertilizer, select a slow-release fertilizer with higher concentrations of phosphorus and potassium than of nitrogen, and only apply it once, toward the beginning of the growing season.

, Wood-boring bugs have been known to attack the soft wood of these trees, and insects like the redbud leaffolder, grape leaffolder, and Japanese weevil are known to eat the leaves. A healthy tree is less likely to succumb to these threats than a damaged tree, so prevention is the best remedy. An infected tree should first be made healthy before you consider applying an appropriate pesticide or fungicide.

Whether you're looking for a tall shade tree that will grow to over 100 feet (30.5 m) or a tree that produces reliably plump and flavorful nuts, there's bound to be a variety that meets your needs. Try to choose one that's known to grow well in your region, taking winter hardiness and disease resistance into account. Here are just a few popular choices:Elliot: Has a high quality but small nut and bears fruit every other year. It should not be planted in northern areas since it can get damaged by spring freezes; does well in Georgia.

Gloria Grande: Produces large, thick-shelled nuts almost every year, and is resistant to scab, which commonly damages pecan trees. Susceptible to black aphids.

Amling: Scab-resistant and early to harvest. Produces small, good-quality nuts.

Sumner: Easily damaged, but produces regularly.

Gafford: Highly insect resistant and popular in Alabama; produces excellent nuts.

McMillan: Very productive and relatively low maintenance; popular in Alabama.;
, Pecan trees can grow over 100 feet (30.5 m) tall, and they have root systems that stretch deep and wide. They need plenty of space, whether you're planting them in your yard or in an orchard. When you're choosing a spot, take the following into consideration:


Make sure there are no buildings or other trees nearby. A pecan tree could damage buildings or smaller trees with falling branches as it grows bigger.
In an orchard, plant the trees at least 60 feet (18.3 m) apart. Allow for approximately 65 to 80 feet (19.81 to 24.38 m) spacing between each pecan tree that you plant. If trees are crowded, the faster growing tree will over-shadow the slower tree, stunt it, and kill it eventually, hampering both trees' crops.
Pecan trees take 20 to 25 years to mature. Some growers will plant trees 30 feet apart, and remove half the trees at around 15 years, when they begin to crowd each other., This type of soil is the healthiest for pecans, which are native to river valley soils. They prefer sandy loam but can be planted in heavier soil as well, as long as it's well-draining. Rocky or light soil is a more difficult environment for pecans.


Avoid planting in very dry or light soil, unless you plan to irrigate, since pecans need a lot of water.
Avoid frost pockets where cold air settles, since they get damaged by frost. Plant at slightly higher elevation (but lower latitude).

, Pecans are most commonly sold as bare-root trees, which are baby trees no more than a few feet tall. Container trees are also available; trees grown this way are usually a few years older.


A bare-root is cheaper but more fragile, and must be planted between December and March.
A container tree is more expensive but sturdier, and can be planted between October and May.

, Exposing them to heat and dry air will cause the roots to dry out. Remember that pecan trees, above all, need to be kept moist. They die quickly when they dry out.


If you have a container tree ready to be planted, you can keep it above ground for a day or two longer if you make sure to water it.
Revive a dry tree by soaking the roots before planting.

, Remove any dead branches and badly broken roots, since these will be impediments to healthy growth.

, Pecans have a long, fragile taproot that must be allowed to stretch out into the ground. Dig a hole as deep as the taproot and just wide enough to accommodate the spread of the rest of the roots. This will be about three feet deep and a few feet wide.


If the hole isn't deep enough, the taproot will not grow properly. Don't attempt to plant it in a shallow hole.
However, gauge the depth to be no more than what is enough to cover the roots. If the holes are too deep, the pecan trees will settle, which could result in root rot or damage, poor growth, and the pecan trees could prematurely die.
A special long-headed shovel is the best tool for the job if you're planting just a few trees.

, Arrange the roots in a natural position, and keep the taproot intact as you lower it into the hole. Be very careful not to damage any of the roots, and especially the taproot, since this will cause problems as the tree starts to grow.


Do not plant it too deep in the ground. The roots and taproot should be in the hole, but make sure the trunk of the tree is above ground. Look for the place where the bark changes color just above the roots (this marks depth at which it was growing at the nursery). If you plant it too deep, the tree will have trouble growing in the right shape.
Make sure the taproot is straightened if it’s a potted tree. They tend to curl up in the pot. Carefully straighten it out and lower it into the hole.

, After the tree is set in the hole, fill it 3/4 way full with water. Begin adding soil as the water is running, and continue adding soil and water at the same time until the hole is full. Top it off with more soil.


Don't pack the soil tightly; just fill up the hole until it's level with the ground.
Filling it with water ensures that the tree gets the moisture it needs, while also preventing air pockets from forming., Prune the top 1/2 to 1/3 of the tree, a procedure called topping. This encourages the tree to grow healthy roots, rather than putting its energy into keeping the top alive. For now, a healthy root system is what you want to encourage.

, This protects it from sun damage. Use white latex paint and paint from where the trunk exits the ground up to the first set of branches. Keep it painted for the first three years. If you don't want to use paint, you can also use a sleeve or growing tube, available from gardening centers.

, Use 6 inches of pine straw or leaves. Pack the mulch around the base of the tree and over the root system. Mulching the tree protects it from weeds and keeps it safe from frost in its early years.

, Water your pecan tree thoroughly immediately after planting it. For the first six months, water about 10 to 15 gallons (37.9 to 56.8 L) once a week. Do not water too much or too often, though, since you don't want to create a harmful soggy condition.


Keep in mind that part or all of the water supply can come from rainfall.
After the tree has matured, watering is essential during the nut filling stage at the end of summer. In a dry area, up to 350 gallons (1,324.9 L) of water per day is needed to ensure the nuts don’t end up small and mealy.

, Your tree should be trained to a central leader system, which is based on the natural growth structure of the tree. The central leader is the dominant upright branch, and the surrounding branches (or scaffold) spiral up around the central leader.When choosing scaffolding branches, look for those that are at a wide angle to the trunk, around 45 degrees. Remove branches growing at more than a 60 degree angle to the trunk, as these are more likely to break later.Training your tree maximizes the tree's nut production., In the first three years, fertilize in early summer. Use a pound of 5-10-5 for every inch of trunk diameter. For a mature tree, use four pounds of 10-10-10 for every inch of trunk diameter, up to 25 pounds. Never fertilize directly over the roots; spread the fertilizer evenly over the surrounding area.


If you want to make sure your pecan tree produces an excellent crop, you might consider spraying with zinc fertilizer to help nut meat to fill-in. Do this only after you notice that the nuts aren't filled with meat in previous years.
Use ammonium nitrate to spur growth when necessary.

, Monitor your pecan trees on a regular basis to look for possible damage from insects, disease and wildlife.Consider using sprays as recommended by the product manufacturers to remove and control insects and disease. It will be difficult to reach high enough to treat giant, mature trees without tall ladders or special equipment. Common pests and diseases include:


Aphids
Pecan scab
Birds and squirrels

, Remove excess branches, dead wood, low or low-hanging mature limbs during the dormant season, ideally late winter or early spring, or before new growth begins. Pruning helps the pecan trees to thrive without becoming overgrown. You should also manage any bushy undergrowth problems that could develop under the pecan tree. Weeds hinder the growth of very young trees and absorb some of the water needed to keep unestablished pecan trees healthy.

, One method for retrieving the pecans is to carefully shake the tree branches so that the nuts fall to the ground. Then you can immediately pick them up. Do not leave them on moist ground or in wet leaves; they'll get water-logged and split or even sprout.


Using a slender fishing pole to shake off the nuts helps to lightly flick pecans out of the open hulls within your reach without much damage to next year's crop, which occurs only on the new year's growth.
Know that you have the option of waiting until the nuts fall to the ground, such as after a windy night. Squirrels will get them while still up in the tree, so just pick them up pretty early each day to beat local squirrels to them. (Commercial orchards often use special tree vibrator-shakers to work the pecans loose from the open hulls and also use machinery to pick up fallen nuts.), Pecans will keep longer if they're dried to a low level of water moisture. They'll store best when their shells are solidly filled-in and their oil content is high.


To dry them, spread your pecans indoors on a dry floor or on screens that have been set high off the ground under a shelter, safe from precipitation and ground moisture. It should take about two weeks for the pecans to thoroughly dry. A good indication is that a pecan nut meat will snap when it has been properly dried.
Store your pecans in the refrigerator for up to six months in airtight storage containers that prevent absorbing odors from meats, vegetables or fruits.
To keep the pecans even longer, store them in your freezer.

Plant rhododendrons in the late spring or early fall.,
Choose the right location.,
Amend the soil.,
Test the drainage.The site you choose needs to have adequate drainage since rhododendron die quickly if the roots remain waterlogged.,
Pick out healthy plants.,
Plan in advance based on your climate.,
Dig out a plant bed.,
Dig shallow holes for the rhododendron plants.,
Water after planting.,
Provide enough water during the summer.,
Mulch annually.,
Fertilize sparingly.,
Prune dead flowers.,
Watch out for pests and disease.",How to Grow Rhododendron," These plants can be somewhat particular and can die off if planted while the weather is too hot or too cold. As such, you should plan on transplanting established rhododendrons before the temperatures begin to shift.


These plants also need to be chilled for a few weeks in order to grow strong, healthy flowers. As such, planting these shrubs while the weather is a little chilly can actually improve your first season's yield of flowers.;
, Rhododendrons thrive in areas with spotted shade, so you should look for a sunny spot that receives at least a few hours of shade during the day. Do not choose a location that gets full sun or one that gets full shade.


Also keep in mind matters of slope and wind. A location that slopes to the north or east works well because the shrub can be shielded against dry southern and western winds. As a general rule, you should look for an area that protects against the wind. Hiding them behind building walls can help shield the plants, as well.

, The root system of a rhododendron does poorly in heavy, dense soils. If the soil is too heavy, you will need to amend it by mixing in light organic material that can make the overall density much less compact.


Amend the quality of the soil with organic matter. Dig in a mixture containing two parts ground pine bark, one part coarse sand, and one part topsoil if your initial soil is clay-like. For sandy soils, mix in equal parts topsoil with organic material, like compost.
Avoid using peat since it can trap too much moisture.
Rhododendrons need acidic soil with a pH between 5.0 and 5.5. Test the soil using a pH testing kit or by taking it to an agricultural center for testing. If the soil is too much of an alkaline, amend it by mixing in mortar, agricultural sulfur, or ferrous sulfate. If the soil has a pH below 4.5, though, you will need to raise it by mixing in ground agricultural limestone.

, If the drainage is poor, you will need to take measurements to improve it before planting.


Test the drainage of your chosen location by digging a 6-inch (15.24 cm) deep hole and filling it with water. The water should drain within four hours. If it has not, you should consider installing a drainage tile to carry away excess water away from the roots.
Alternatively, if the drainage of a site is not adequate, you could also plant the rhododendrons in raised beds.

, Rhododendron are almost always planted via transplant and not by seed. Choose plants with dark green, healthy leaves for your garden.


The plants should be a deep green with little to no trace of yellow. Avoid plants with wilted leaves.
Check the soil in the containers. It should be somewhat moist. If the soil is completely dry, the plant might be in poor shape, even if the leaves have not yet begun to yellow.

, In general, rhododendron prefer climates in Zones 5 through 8. If your climate is on the cooler side or on the warmer side, you need to keep a few things in mind before you plant these shrubs in your yard.


If you live in hot Zones 7 through 11, make sure that the site receives afternoon shade and opt for larger plants rather than smaller ones.If you live in cold Zones 3 through 6, consider planting the shrubs in full sun. They will need at least 6 hours of sun daily to avoid problems with mildew. You should also be even more prepared against the wind.
Note that if you get killing frosts during winter, you will also need to shield the shrubs against the winter winds. These plants suffer in extreme cold, so if you want them to last until spring, you will need to protect them by wrapping burlap around them in the late fall.

, Rhododendrons do well when planted in groups. Dig out a plant bed roughly 18 inches (45.72 cm) deep by 30 inches (76.2 cm) wide. Keep in mind that each plant in the group should be spaced roughly 3 to 4 feet (91.44 to 121.92 cm) apart from the others and 18 inches (45.72 cm) from the side of the bed.


Planting these shrubs in groups also makes it easier to prepare an adequate batch of soil.
Do not place the bed too close to tree with shallow roots, like a maple, ash, or elm tree. Feeder roots can move into the soil and steal away the water and food from the rhododendron.

, The hole you dig for each rhododendron plant within the plant bed must be slightly larger than the root ball but no deeper. The top roots should be at soil level.


The root ball should be 2 inches (5 cm) higher than the surrounding soil when you place the plant in the hole.
As a general rule, it is better to plant the rhododendron too shallow than it is to plant it too deep.

, Soak the soil thoroughly after you plant the rhododendron. Pack the moist soil around the root ball to keep it secure and steady in place.

, When the temperatures become hot and dry, you need to make sure that your rhododendron plants get 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water on a weekly basis.


Allow the plants to stay fairly dry from September on. Doing so will help the plants survive the winter, but you should also water once after the first major frost.
You only need to water the shrubs during the summer if you receive less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of rain per week.

, Apply fresh mulch each year during the fall. Mulch can keep the roots moist and protect them against cold winter weather.


The best types of mulch to use include partially decomposed oak leaves or pine needles. Other decent options include oak shavings, hardwood chips, aged sawdust, and peat moss.
Wood mulch should be arranged so that it is 2 inches (5 cm) deep. Leaves, pine needles, and moss should be 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15.24 cm) deep.
The mulch should remain there all year. During the summer and fall, try to keep it off the plant stems. During the winter, pile it higher to protect the stems against the cold.

, Use a light amount of fertilizer during the early spring, once flower buds begin to swell. Resist the temptation to fertilize any more than that since fertilizer has been known to burn rhododendron roots.


Look for a fertilizer labeled for use with plants that require high acidity. Typically, this will be a fertilizer that supplies nitrogen in the form of ammonium.
If you are looking for an organic fertilizer, try cottonseed meal.
When you do fertilizer the plants, do so in May. Do not apply any fertilizer after the end of June.

, Rhododendron shrubs do not need to be pruned for the purpose of encouraging growth. You should, however, deadhead old flowers throughout the growing season and in fall.


If the plants start to get too large, prune them lightly by cutting back one or two branches a year. Wait until after the shrub flowers.
You can technically prune rhododendron plants by cutting them within 12 inches (30.48 cm) of the ground, but doing so will likely delay flowering for a few years afterward since these plants grow so slowly.When removing dead flowers, only clip off the dead growth. The buds for the following year lie just beyond the dead flowers, and if you trim away too much, you could end up cutting these buds off, as well.
Snap off spent flower stalks by hand. Simply bend them over until they break.

, While rhododendrons are not especially prone to pests and diseases, they are not immune to problems, either. Apply pesticide and fungicide only as needed.


Caterpillars and fall webworms can be the biggest problems as far as insects are concerned. While they rarely destroy the plant completely, they can chew holes in the leaves.
Root diseases can strike rhododendrons, as well. If a rhododendron has died from a root disease, move other rhododendron shrubs to a new location.
Other potential pests include vine weevil, white flies, grasshoppers, lace bugs, scale insects, aphids, powdery mildew, bud blast, rust, leafy gall, and petal blight.

Choose your plant carefully.,
Dig a hole slightly larger than the pot the plant came in or slightly bigger than the root ball.,
Amend the soil with a high quality and ecologically responsible soil amendment such as Big Frog.,
Remove some of the mixed soil-- enough to put the plants roots into the hole.,
Water in the roots.,
Put compost around the top of the new plant being sure to cover the soil you just dug.,
Step around the hole to ensure the soil has settled around the roots.,
Check the progress every couple of days.",How to Plant in Poor Soils," Pick a plant with environmental concerns and easy care. Using a perennial plant will provide an ecological repair process for your soils. Native grasses have been shown to repair depleted soils faster than any other technique. Native plants are usually more capable of adapting to extremes of weather, provide good root structures for the soil,and are endangered of disappearing.;
, If the plant is from a small 4 inch (10.2 cm) pot dig a hole the size of you shovel. Do not worry and enjoy the moment. (Worms are sensitive to negative thoughts and will stay away.)

, Fill the hole with a shovel full of the soil amendment. Mix with some of the soil you have dug out. Break up heavy clay chunks. The content of the hole should be well mixed but do not worry .

, Hold the plant level to the surrounding soil and fill in with the mixed soil. Be sure to cover the entire root structure with soil. If the root dries out the plant will die. The roots are the heart of the plant and the soil it's skin. You are the surgeon.....close the patient! (Do not worry. The energy associated with worry attracts destructive insects.)

, A gallon or two of water is enough. It is usually best to use a can or bucket and not a hose because the hose lacks a measuring mechanism creating a tendency to overdo the watering, drowning the roots. (Yes roots like people can drown. They need to breathe.)

, Compost is free and available. It is also the environmentally responsible thing to do.

, There can be air pockets which will cause the roots to dry out and die. Visualize a beautiful and healthy plant. The plant will get the message and begin to shoot for that goal.

, Do not water unless the soil is dry. To determine this put your fingers in the soil. This may take some practice! We have been told to keep our hands clean. The instruction is not helpful when it comes testing the water needs of soil. Add water using your water bucket, not the hose, so you do not drown the roots.

Get your soil tested.,
Add the suggested amendments to your soil.,
Clay soil may also need some secondary macronutrients, such as calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), and magnesium (Mg).,
Consider using a winter cover crop such as annual rye or any legume.,
When starting new beds, consider using the ""lasagna"" method to prepare the soil.",How to Turn Clay Into Growing Soil," Check with your local extension office (listed under government in the phone book) for a soil testing kit. Follow the directions on the kit, and ship it to the state lab. This is a low-cost method to give you detailed information on what components are needed to improve your soil.;
, Those amendments are normally found in fertilizer. The side of the bag lists a ratio such as ""10-10-10"" that identifies the relative amounts of NPK found in the bag (that's nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)). If you are an organic gardener, use organic fertilizers in your garden, as well as compost.

, These nutrients can be side dressed on your plants as needed.


Purchase sulfur at your local nursery.
Calcium can be found in eggshells. Just crush them up and sprinkle them around your plants.
Epsom salts contains magnesium. Make a mixture of 1 tablespoon of Epsom salts to 1 quart of warm water, mix well and spray your plants with the mixture. Tomatoes and peppers especially like the mixture. It will encourage those plants to set blossom more quickly.

, For particularly heavy clay soil, hairy vetch is an excellent choice. It has an extensive root system which helps to break up the clay and provides valuable nutrients when turned under.

, Lasagna gardening is a no-till method for preparing soil and it helps to break down clay soil. This method uses layers of material, such as shredded black-and-white newspaper, compost, and coir. You build multiple layers as deep as possible and allow them to break down over time. There is detailed information on this subject to be found online. Some additional items you can add to your lasagna beds:


Grass clippings
Leaves
Fruit and vegetable scraps
Coffee grounds
Tea leaves and tea bags
Weeds (if they haven't gone to seed)

Find out which USDA Plant Hardiness Zone you live in.,
Choose a spot with at least six hours of direct sunlight per day.",How to Start a Vegetable Garden1," Hardiness zones are based on the average minimum winter temperature in a given area and are divided into categories separated by 10-degrees Fahrenheit. They can tell you which plants will thrive in your area and which plants will not do well in the climate of your area. Additionally, you can find out when the best time of year to plant is based on your hardiness zone. Visit http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/ to find out which zone you live in. The interactive map will even display information about microclimates in your yard., Most vegetables require a lot of sunlight to grow into healthy producers, but you may want to vary the sun to shade ratio of your garden to allow for some shade growing plants as well. However, if your vegetables don't get enough sun, they won't produce as much and will be more susceptible to pests. It's best to have an idea about what plants you want to grow before choosing a site.You can grow dark, leafy vegetables like broccoli and spinach in places in your garden that do not get full sun. If you live in an area with little sun, don't be discouraged. You can still plant a magnificent garden, though you'll probably have to leave tomatoes out of the equation.
Alternately, if you live in an extremely hot climate, you may want to choose partial shade for some of your vegetable varieties in order to protect them from extreme heat. For example, cool-season peas may benefit from growing in partial shade."

Know when to plant.,
Know how much to plant.,
Ask your family which vegetables they love to eat.,
Consider growing vegetables that are hard to find.,
Avoid plants that animals and pests in your area will eat.,
Decide whether to grow from seed or transplant seedlings.,
Space your plants adequately.,
Learn how to care for your specific plants.",How to Start a Vegetable Garden2," Most vegetables are planted outside around the last spring frost and are harvested anywhere between mid-summer and late-fall. Consult the specific growing instructions for each type of vegetable that you grow. To enjoy a wide variety of vegetables for the entire growing season, plant vegetables that are ready for harvest at different times of the year. That way, you won't be without fresh vegetables for long.


You can also space out plantings of your vegetables. For example, to get a continuous harvest of lettuce, sow new lettuce seeds each week during the planting season.

, Often, new gardeners get over-excited about their new hobby and end up planting more than they can eat or care for. Be aware that some plants, like tomatoes, peppers, and squash produce throughout an entire growing season, and others like carrots, radishes, and corn, produce only once.For best results, plant a mixture of continual producing and single producing vegetables in your garden. Generally, you can plant less of the continual producing vegetables and more of the single producing vegetables in order to achieve a good balance in your garden.
Make sure you give each plant enough space to develop and thrive in your garden. You may have to thin plants out as they begin to grow in order to avoid crowding.

, Keep your family's favorite vegetables in mind when planting your vegetable garden. By growing the produce you buy the most of, you can greatly reduce your grocery store costs, as well as reduce waste when it comes time to harvest.

, Many grocery stores only carry the produce basics. Often grocery stores simply carry one variety of a tomato or a pepper, making it hard to find interesting heirloom or exotic varieties. If your climate permits, consider planting vegetables that are difficult to locate for purchase in your area. Not only will doing so allow you to cook with special vegetables, it also provides you with a great gift to give to your friends, family, and neighbors.

, Be aware of the different vegetables that your local fauna will love to devour. To protect your vegetables from birds or deer, you may have to put up some sort of fence covering around your vegetable garden to prevent it from getting attacked by veggie-seeking predators.

, Most vegetables can be grown from seeds or bought as seedlings and transferred directly into the ground or a planter box.


While some vegetables like carrots are very easy to grow from seed, others like tomatoes can be a bit more difficult. Research the process for planting each type of vegetable from seed before choosing a planting method.
You may also want to start seeds indoors in peat pots before transplanting seedlings in the garden. Consult a growing guide for each vegetable in order to figure out planting times and the temperature that most vegetables can withstand.
Look for plant sales in the spring. Many farmers markets and master gardener programs host annual plant sales. This will also give you a chance to get expert information from the person who started the plants.

, While some gardening guides suggest planting in rows, others suggest that planting each vegetable type in a triangular shape actually allows you to preserve space in the garden. The important thing, though, is that your plants are not planted too tightly together to prevent them having to compete with neighboring plants for space.Look at the seed packet or the label on the plant's pot to see the provided spacing recommendations.

, Each type of vegetable plant requires a slightly, if not drastically, different care routine. Do a bit of research to find out how much water your plants need, whether or not they require trimming or thinning, how often they need to be fertilized, and when they are ready for harvest.


Most plants benefit from a layer of mulch on top of the soil. This helps regulate temperature, retains moisture, and encourages beneficial earthworms.

Choose your garden foundation.,
Till the soil.,
Test the pH of the soil.,
Fertilize the soil.,
Water the soil thoroughly.",How to Start a Vegetable Garden3," Decide whether you want to plant your vegetable garden directly in the ground or build a planter box to raise your vegetables a few feet above the ground. Alternately, you may want to plant different vegetable varieties each in their own pot. Your decision should depend on the quality of your soil and the tendency of your planting area to flood. If you have poor soil quality and poor drainage, you probably want to build a raised vegetable garden bed.


Think about how big you want your planting bed to be. Depending on the type of vegetables you plant, you'll need to make sure that the box is wide and deep enough. Conduct a bit of research on the types of vegetables you are planting to see how much space they need to grow. Broccoli, for example, utilizes a wide area to grow, while carrots simply need space to grow down.
To build a raised planting bed, you can use lumber, plastic, synthetic wood, bricks, or rocks. However, cedar planks are generally recommended because they do not rot when exposed to water. Keep in mind that your vegetable plants will have to be watered regularly, and some weak woods like simple plywood may not last very long when constantly drenched.






Round the top of your planting bed to achieve the maximum surface area for planting. This means that the tops are rounded to form an arc rather than a flat surface.Lay a barrier between the bed and the ground in order to prevent weeds from growing. You can use gardening plastic, a mat of some sort, or several layers of newspaper and/or cardboard to reduce the chance that weeds will grow.

, Most vegetables require a rich, fertile, fluffy soil to grow well. Use a quality garden hoe and/or a shovel to intensely break up the soil and prepare it for planting. You can avoid this labor altogether if you choose to build a raised vegetable garden box and fill it with pre-mixed, store-bought soil.


Make sure your planting area is free of any rocks or clumps of thick soil to allow the roots to expand and your seedlings to grow into healthy, productive plants.
Be sure to remove any weeds or unwanted voluntary plants from your growing space. These will just compete with your plants for space and can potentially bring in harmful pests.

, Soil pH is based on a scale of 1 to 14, with a pH of 7.0 being neutral, any values below 7.0 being acidic, and any values above 7.0 being alkaline. Most vegetables like a slightly acidic soil between 6.0 and 6.5. Soil that is too acidic will damage plant roots and cause your vegetables to under produce. Test your soil's pH by visiting your county's agricultural extension office and obtaining the necessary testing supplies and instructions. You can also pay to have your soil tested.


The pH of the soil tells you if the soil needs limestone added in order to bring it to the desired pH value. Limestone is cheap and effective when it comes to improving soil.
Evaluate the soil's calcium and magnesium levels in order to determine what type of limestone to add to your soil. If the soil is low in magnesium, add dolomitic limestone. If it is high in magnesium, add calcitic limestone.
Add the limestone two to three months before planting to allow the soil to absorb it. After adding, check the pH again. You will probably need to add limestone to the soil every year or two to maintain a proper pH level., Most vegetables like soil that is rich in organic matter. You can increase the fertility of your soil by adding peat moss, mature compost, blood meal, fish emulsion, etc. The most common fertilizers recommended for vegetable gardens specifically are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.


Use soil test results to let you know what you need to add. Do-it-yourself soil tests are readily available from most home improvement and garden stores.
Try one of these common fertilizer compositions in your vegetable garden: one pound of a 10-10-10 fertilizer or two pounds of a 5-10-5 fertilizer per 100 feet (30.5 m) of garden. The first number refers to the percentage by weight of nitrogen, the second number explains the percentage by weight of phosphorus, and the third number denotes the percentage by weight of potassium.
Alternatively, you can use a longer lasting, more sustainable fertilizer such as manure compost or aged animal manure. Add it to your garden before tilling and it can feed your plant for months.
Too much nitrogen can damage the plants, however, causing a reduction in production yield. Alternately, too much phosphorus can increase the chances of chlorosis.
You can also add iron, copper, manganese, and zinc in small amounts to nourish the soil., Most vegetables do not fare very well in times of drought. Make sure to water the soil before planting your vegetables seeds or seedlings and keep the bed moist throughout the growing process.

Choose a spot that gets six hours of direct sunlight each day.",How to Plant Sycamore Tree Seeds," Sycamore seeds are grown best when you start them in a tray and then transfer them to a pot. Choose a shallow growing tray, but one that’s deep enough to let the seed take root. The plant will grow to about four inches in the first two months., With the shallow tray filled with good, seed-starting soil, make a hole that’s no deeper than ⅛ of an inch. This isn’t much, so if you have a ruler handy, it will be easier to tell. It may be easier to just push the seed slightly into the soil rather than making a hole first.Potting soil works well, but also look at the garden store for soil that specifically says it is for starting seeds.

, With the seed pushed into the soil, it will grow best if it’s covered with something richer than soil. Peat moss and leaf mold both have great nutrients for a sycamore seed. Make sure you don’t put it too thick or it will choke out the seed., Sycamore seeds soak up a lot of sunlight when they are beginning to sprout. Place the tray somewhere that stays between 70℉-85℉ (21℃-29℃). Makes sure there is sunlight but that the tray is not in direct sunlight for very long.It’s best to keep the seed tray inside so that it doesn’t drown during heavy rains.

, You don’t necessarily have to water the seedlings every single day. Check the soil each day and it if seems to have lost moisture, water it. Water the soil just enough to moisten it, not to make it soaked through.

A simple soil test is to stick your fingers into the soil. If you can press your fingers into the soil up to your knuckle, there’s enough water in the soil.

, After a couple of months, give or take, the sycamore should be at about four inches (10cm) in height. It should have a solid root system and leaves by this point. Transfer it from the shallow tray into a deeper pot with good drainage., Sycamores are fast growing trees, but they take about a year to reach two feet tall. It’s best to keep the sycamore in a pot for that much time. You may need to transfer it to bigger pot if it seems to become rootbound.Rootbound means that the roots have grown so much that they’ve filled the pot. Gently pull the sapling, along with its roots, out of the pot every two months to check that there is plenty of soil left in the pot.

, Sycamores grow tall, have a wide canopy, and an grow an extensive root system. Because of this, you want to plant them plenty far away from your house and other structures. 15 feet (4.6 m) is a good distance, but if you have the room, plant it even farther away.Consider sidewalks, sheds, barns, or other structures that the roots could grow under and harm.

, Sycamore trees want to soak up the sun, so make sure you pick a wide open spot. If you already have a lot of trees, try hard to place the sycamore away from the rest.Spend a week to so watching your yard to see what parts get the most sun. Sycamore trees grow for decades, so you want to make sure it will continue to get sun as it grows tall.

, Carefully drain the excess water from the sprouter or bowl over the sink. The quinoa should remain in the bowl or the sprouter. One good way to do this is by playing the edge of a spatula in front of the quinoa seeds. The water will still pour around the edges but the quinoa will remain in place inside the bowl. If necessary, use a strainer. However, it’s simpler just to keep the quinoa in the bowl. It’s okay if a little extra water is left behind as long as it isn’t too much.

, Remember to use cool water with a temperature between 60 and 70 degrees F (or 15 and 21 degrees C). Repeat the rinsing and draining process every 8 to 12 hours. http://www.sproutpeople.com/seed/quinoa.html </ref>

Move the quinoa to a dark place.,
Continue the rinse cycle.,
Move the quinoa back to the plate or tray.",How to Sprout Quinoa3," Transfer the quinoa from the bowl or sprouter to a large tray or plate. Move the quinoa away from direct sunlight to a darker area at room temperature. Cover the quinoa with a cloth to keep away dust or bugs.

, Once the quinoa is in a dark area you still have to continue to rinse it. Place the quinoa into a sprouter or a bowl again to repeat the rinse and drain cycle. As mentioned previously, continue to rinse and drain the quinoa every 8 to 12 hours over a period of 2 days. Allow time for the quinoa sprouts to dry out for future use after the final rinse and dry cycle.

, Put the tray of quinoa back into a dark room to continue the sprouting process. Place the cloth back over the quinoa for protection. The quinoa should eventually sprout into a plate full of spiral-shaped roots that are at least one-quarter inch in length. Let the quinoa sprouts dry out for up to 12 hours, since excess moisture damages the quinoa crop.

, You can’t let them sit in a container forever. For best results, eat the quinoa sprouts or use them in a salad or casserole as soon as possible. Quinoa stays fresh for up to two weeks after sprouting. , You can remove the quinoa sprouts with your hands and you don’t need to follow any special procedure. Since the grains are small it may take a bit of time, and you should place a pan or plate under the sprout so that you don’t lose any excess sprouts.

Cut off the celery to eat it.",How to Regrow Vegetables2," Cut off the bottom of the celery and do the same to the onion.


Make sure that the onion bottom is round and big and not a thin small circle, about a half inch thick.
For the celery, get a container and fill with water. Place the celery in water. Again, the water should not be over the top of the celery.
For the onion, make a shallow hole by scooping up some dirt. Put the onion bottom in hole, or place above soil and push down gently.

, Once the celery is 1 inch tall and has lots of fluffy green foliage (leaves), plant the whole base in soil, but exposing the stalks.


If you want more onions, as soon as green stems emerge on your onion, separate the stems. For example, if you have 2 stems, separate them by cutting the onion in half and plant them separately.

, Wait until the are long enough and then cut them. When the onion's stem falls over and turns brown, dig it up to eat.

, When the ginger buds have turned a dark, healthy shade of green, cut them from the root. Cut the sweet potatoes pieces with sprouts into chunks. Take the yam and cut off the half that has the most buds/sprouts. Put in toothpicks at right angles so the vegetable suspends over water (half in water).

, Plant the ginger in soil but make sure that half the top part of ginger is visible. Plant the yam in soil up to the sprout but not covering any of them.

, Ginger is ready to harvest when the plant is starting to wilt and die. After harvesting, let the ginger dry. Yams and sweet potatoes can all be harvested when the plants wilts, turns yellow, and dies.

,


Raised beds can be made from materials such as cedar, which is a natural insect repellent.
In-ground beds may require additional tilling work and, depending on where you live, you may need to locate utility wires before digging.

,


Decide on the size and shape of the garden bed and dig out the area using a shovel or spade. Use a hand tiller to loosen the dirt and break apart clumps.
Research the recommended planting depth for the types of vegetables you are planting to determine how deep to dig.
Add compost, which can be purchased in bulk and delivered to your home. Compost can be found in bags at your local gardening center or you can make it.
You may prefer to use organic garden soil. Mix the organic soil in with the existing dirt or add it to the raised bed.

Organic plants can be difficult to find locally. Many nurseries use fertilizers and pesticides, so be sure to ask.
You can purchase organic seeds at online gardening stores.
Choose plants that can grow well in your region and soil type.
Inspect plants carefully for signs of disease or insect damage. Make sure the plants are healthy and not root-bound. Loosen it from the pot to see if the roots are wrapped around inside the pot. If it is root-bound, you can still use it, but you will have to cut it before planting.

,


Water your plants before planting to moisten the root ball and lessen the shock of transplanting.
Dig holes with a hand spade at the appropriate distance apart as indicated by the type of plant. Make the holes as deep as the root ball and 2 times as wide. Fill in dirt around the plants and pack slightly.
Add a protective layer of mulch, grass clippings or hay to keep in moisture and keep weeds down. Gently spread the mulch evenly with a garden rake and hand rake.
Water your plants immediately after planting.

You will want to label the vegetables in your garden so you will remember what they are as they begin to grow. This is important if you have several varieties of the same vegetable or if it is perennial (will live for another growing season). It will also help you to determine which plants do well for future gardening plans.

Care for your veggies after planting.",How to Plant Vegetables," Research vegetables that grow successfully in your area. Your location is one of the largest factors in whether you will successfully grow vegetables. You need to do a bit of research about your region and only decide on vegetables that are compatible with the climate where you live. Looking up the United States Department of Agriculture’s growing zones can give you a start in learning about what plants grow well in your area.Start out small. You may want to plant a ton of different vegetables but if you are just starting out gardening you should really focus your energy on just a few.Growing vegetables can be more of a time commitment than people expect, so begin gradually so you don't get overwhelmed.
Once you are an experienced gardener, you may be able to replicate the climate of other regions in order to grow any vegetables you like. However, when you are just starting out, planting vegetables that are difficult to grow in your region will most likely just be frustrating and unfruitful.;
, In general, choose a spot to plant your vegetables where sun shines at least 6 hours a day.This amount of sun is considered ""full sun."" If you want to plant a vegetable that does not require full sun all day, then you will need to locate an area of your yard that gets a significant amount of shade.


You do not necessarily have to plant vegetables directly in the ground. Planting veggies in pots can be very successful for a wide variety of plants and it does not require a lot of space.There are benefits to container gardening, for instance you can easily move the plants to a new location if they are not happy where you initially place them and the soil in the pot usually develops fewer weeds. On the downside, however, plants in containers usually need to be watered more often and are more vulnerable to cold and hot temperatures, as a pot changes temperature much more easily than the ground.

, Seeds will generally need to start earlier but may have to be started inside, to protect them from frost.Vegetable starts, young plants that have been grown from seed in a greenhouse by a professional, will cost you significantly more to buy, but they will establish easier and can be planted later in the growing season.


Some plants are difficult to grow from seed. Plants with long germination periods, such as cilantro, can be difficult for home gardeners to cultivate. Consider investing in the added cost of vegetable starts for plants such as this.
Many plants, including lettuce, are actually easier to grow from seed. This is especially the case for plants, such as carrots, that don't do well with being transplanted. For plants like this, it makes sense to sew the seeds directly into the ground or in biodegradable seed starting pots that can go right into the ground once the plant sprouts., Part of deciding when to plant your veggies will be dictated by whether you are planting seeds or starts. In addition, different vegetables need to be planted at different times of the year. There are many vegetables that thrive in the summer sun, but you can also grow a surprising amount of vegetables over the winter months, depending on your location., If purchasing seeds, pick a brand that seems dependable and pick vegetable strains that seem reliable. You may want to do some research before you go to the garden center to decide exactly which type of each vegetable you want. If you are purchasing vegetable starts, pick plants that seem healthy and do not have discoloration or spots.


Consider whether you want organic or non-GMO veggie starts or seeds. While some people do not have a problem with genetic modification or pesticides, others do not what these kind of processes involved in the propagation of their food. It's up to you.
You can also get good quality seeds and plants from springtime farmer’s markets, seed swaps hosted by local organizations, and online seed catalog companies.

, These amendments will depend on the current status of your soil and the needs of the vegetables you want to plant. If you have never planted before in the location you are using, take a soil sample and conduct a soil test.There are tests available at any garden center that will tell you the ph of your soil. Soil can go from very acidic all the way to very alkaline, as well as going from very sandy to very clay like. Figure out what kind of soil you have and try to move it more toward neutral by adding amendments.


After assessing the soil, add some compost to it. Compost adds organic matter that breaks down and basically becomes food for your plant.

, Take the time to weed before you plant your veggies. Weeds will compete for nutrients with your new plants, making their success less likely. Get all the weeds from their roots, as many weeds can regenerate if even a bit of their roots are left intact.

, You will want to cultivate, or break up, the soil in an area a bit larger than where your plants will actually be. The root systems of many plants will grow to be quite large, moving outward from where the plant is initially planted. You can break the soil up by digging with a shovel or using a roto-tiller. As you mix the soil, add in any amendments you need to add based on the results from your soil test.

, Be sure to follow any directions on seed packets about how deep and how far apart you should plant seeds. Some seeds can easily grow from a depth of 6 inches, while others need to basically be on the surface of the soil. Vegetable starts, on the other hand, should be planted so that their existing soil is level with the surface.


Remember that some plants can only grow in one direction, meaning that a certain part of the seed or clove needs to be facing up in order for it to grow properly. For instance, garlic cloves have a top and bottom. When planting garlic you need to face the pointy side up in order for it to grow., If you are using seeds, pack the soil back in the hole, making sure that it is firm but not totally compacted. If you are planting vegetable starts, push soil in all around the start, pressing the soil firmly so that the start stands firmly upright.

, The first time you water, you will want to soak the entire area. After that, keep the soil moist but don't drown the plants. Keeping up on watering is one of the most important things you can do to make your vegetables thrive. Monitor your plants and soil and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.


If you are starting plants from seeds outdoors, keep the water consistently moist until the plants come up. As they grow, you can reduce the watering frequency to once or twice per week.

, Don't just forget about them, or they won't grow very well. Remove any weeds that pop up, fertilize if necessary, and keep on watering.You will need to keep tending to your veggies but once they are planted properly, much of your work is done!


To deter weeds from growing, consider mulching around your veggies.The little bit of effort it takes to mulch will pay off when you are not repeatedly weeding around your plants.
Some vegetable plants need to be fertilized during the growing season to ensure harvest because they absorb large amounts of nutrients from the soil. Make sure that you’re aware of your plants’ specific feeding requirements.

"
"
Avoid adding any fertilisers with a high nitrogen content.,
Apply a fertiliser that is rich in phosphorous and potassium and low in nitrogen.,
Prefer carbon-rich mulch.,
Plant squash as a plant balance.",How to Prevent Too Much Leaf Growth on Vegetables," This includes avoiding use of high-nitrogen mulch such as animal manure and grass clippings.;
, Try bone meal as one option.

, Good choices include crushed bark, sawdust, straw, or newspaper. In breaking down, these mulch sources will help the growth of soil microorganisms that feed on nitrogen and will consume it until the decomposition of the mulch ends.

, Squash has an ability to mop up high levels of nitrogen in the soil, over a few weeks.

, (15-30 mL) of small seeds, or 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60-120 mL) of legumes (beans or lentils) in a quart-size sprouting jar. If you're using a half-gallon jar, use 2 to 4 tbsp. (30-60 mL) of small seeds or 1/2 to 1 cup (120-240 mL) of legumes.

, Set the jar upright and leave the seeds to soak.


Optional: Add 1 tsp. (5 mL) of citric acid per quart (950 mL) of soak water. Although this isn't strictly necessary, it will help reduce spoilage.
Soak small seeds for 5 or 6 hours.
If you're sprouting seeds or beans with a very hard coating, let them soak for as long as 36 hours.

,


Sprouting lids are a hollow ring with a wire- or plastic-mesh insert. When you upend the jar, the water will flow out but the mesh will retain the seeds.
Sprouting lids come in various sizes. For now, select a mesh size that your unsprouted seeds will not fit through.

, Fill the jar with lukewarm water again, swirl the water and seeds together again, then pour the rinse water out.

, This allows any remaining water to drain out of the jar, and air to circulate freely.

,


Always prop the jar at an angle, lid down, so moisture drains out and air circulates to help prevent spoilage.
If you live in an arid climate, rinse the seeds 3 times a day. Mung beans also need more frequent rinsing--3 or 4 times a day--no matter the climate.
As the seeds sprout, switch to a larger-mesh sprouting lid for better water and airflow.

, This generally takes between 1 and 5 days, depending on the seeds. The sprouts will quickly produce enough chlorophyll to turn green, further enhancing their nutritional value.


The sprouts are ready to eat once the 2 baby leaves are free of the seed hull. Try to eat your sprouts while the root is still one thin thread; once sub-roots begin to appear, the sprouts are much less palatable.
Average sprouting/growth times include: sunflower seeds, 1 to 2 days; clover, 4 days; broccoli, 3 days; alfalfa, 1 to 5 days; mung beans, 3 to 4 days.

",How to Plant Vegetable Seeds Outdoors,"


This will allow you to become familiar with how to plant vegetable seeds outdoors and enjoy the varieties you select once harvest time arrives.;
,


Each seed variety requires specific conditions needed for germination, including proper temperature, moisture levels and sunlight.
Too much or too little of any of these necessary elements will result in the delicate seed or seedling failing to grow.

,


Separated by temperature variation, areas are divided into International or United States Department of Agriculture Hardiness Zones.
Each zone helps gardeners understand their particular climate, and teaches gardeners how to plant vegetable seeds outdoors during the proper time of year for the best results. Zones determine lowest and highest temperatures, and the expected annual rainfall, which are vital to seed germination.

,


The depth each seed needs to be placed in the ground generally depends on its size, with larger seeds needing to be placed deeper in the soil.
The proximity of each seed also usually depends on size, with larger seeds requiring more space between each one.

, Now is also a good time to add a small amount of fertilizer mixed with the water to give the seeds extra nourishment.

Plan early.,
Research when to expect your first frost.,
Choose cool-weather vegetables.,
Determine how much time each one needs to grow.,
Plan a calendar around your frost date.",How to Plant a Fall Vegetable Garden1," Keep in mind that the “fall” in “fall vegetables” usually refers to when they are harvested, not planted. Expect most of these veggies to require planting between the middle and end of summer in order to grow to full maturity before winter.Give your garden the best chance at success by forming a plan well before then.


Two exceptions to the rule are onions and garlic. These are planted shortly after the summer months and then grow over the winter for a spring or summer harvest.;
, Expect your garden to stop growing once nighttime temperatures fall below freezing. Find out when your area typically experiences its first frost of the season. Gain a firmer idea of how long your growing season will last.Helpful resources include online almanacs, such as http://www.almanac.com/. Additionally, you could ask staff at local co-ops, nurseries, and farmers markets.

, Understand that some vegetables require more heat than others in order to grow into a healthy harvest. Ensure your fall garden’s success by sticking to vegetables that thrive in cooler temperatures. Pick crops that only require average daytime temperatures between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 29 degrees Celsius).Such crops include arugula, beets, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, chard, kale, kohlrabi, lettuce, mizuna, mustard, radishes, rutabagas, spinach, tatsoi, and turnips.

, Expect some vegetables to take longer to mature than others. Once you decide on which to grow, find out how long each one takes before they are ready to harvest. Know which to plant right away so they have ample time, and which to delay so they don’t suffer from too much summer heat in the beginning. From longest to shortest, the estimated number of days needed for each vegetable are:Cabbage: 95
Brussels sprouts: 90
Broccoli and carrots: 80
Cauliflower and rutabagas: 75
Beets, kale, and kohlrabi: 60
Chard: 55
Lettuce and turnips: 50
Spinach, mizuna, and tatsoi: 45
Arugula and mustard greens: 40
Radishes: 30

, For each vegetable, choose a planting date that will allow enough time for it to grow before your first expected frost. To play it safe, allow for the possibility of an early frost. Add an extra week or two to each vegetable’s growing time just in case colder weather comes early this year.You can also use the frost date and growing times to determine which vegetables to grow. For instance, if you want to grow as many veggies as you possibly can in a limited space, consider growing multiple harvests of crops that need less time, one after the other.

Sow your seeds in a “flat” or “tray.” Keep things organized by using one tray per type of seed.,
Make room in your garden.,
Dig a hole in your garden for each seedling.",How to Plant a Fall Vegetable Garden2," Fill the tray with compost or planting soil until it’s as deep as the seed is wide. Water the soil until it is thoroughly moist, but not oversaturated. Plant the seed, layering just enough soil over it to cover it without burying it too deep.Continue to water as needed to keep all of the soil uniformly moist.Starting your seeds off in a tray will allow you to move them as needed to keep them in the shade and/or ideal temperatures.
To prevent the soil from drying out so quickly, set a sheet of glass over the tray to trap moisture.
Gardening “flats” and “trays” are the same thing, but may be labeled as one or the other depending on region.

, Watch for the seeds in your tray to grow into seedlings. Wait for them to grow at least two leaves that resemble your vegetable’s leaves once it is fully grown. Once they do, clear out any diseased summer vegetables currently in your garden. Then break up the soil with a trowel to a depth of four or five inches (10 to 13 cm) for better circulation.Since temperatures may still be high, utilize the shade cast by any summer vegetables that are still growing. Plan to transfer your seedlings at their base to keep your fall veggies out of the summer sun.
The roots of your remaining summer vegetables should be strong enough by now to be unfazed when you rake up the soil close to their base.
If you didn’t grow any summer vegetables, till the soil to remove weeds and other unwanted vegetation.

, Once you’re ready to transfer the seedlings to your garden, check the garden’s soil for dryness. If necessary, water the soil to moisten it (not soak it). Then, with a trowel, dig a hole of equal depth to the seedling’s roots in the tray. Make it twice as wide as the root itself so the root isn’t damaged from contact with the hole’s sides.If you grew summer vegetables, there should still be plenty of nutrients in the ground to feed your seedlings.
If not, layer a bed of compost and soil amendments over the existing soil. Dig your holes here instead of in the ground underneath.

"
"
Delay if necessary.,
Prep the patient.,
Remove your seedlings from the tray.,
Inspect the root ball.,
Plant each seedling.,
Consider covering your garden.",How to Plant a Fall Vegetable Garden3," Understand that transferring seedlings into new soil can be a shock to their system. Check the forecast beforehand. If light rain and/or cloudy skies is due in a few days, wait for them to arrive, since these conditions will help them recuperate.If a heat wave is on the way, wait even longer.

, Once you decide when you will transplant, spend the day or two beforehand strengthening the seedlings. Water the food tray enough to keep the soil consistently moist. Feed them liquid fertilizer to boost their nutrient levels. Ensure that they are as healthy as can be before disrupting their growth.Also check the garden’s soil for dryness. Keep it moist (not soaking wet) so it’s ready to receive the seedlings., Wait until the late afternoon before transplanting. Allow your seedlings to recuperate overnight before having to face a full day of sun. With a gardening trowel, dig a hole of equal depth to the seedling’s roots in the tray. Make it twice as wide as the root itself so the root isn’t damaged from contact with the hole’s sides. Then:If each seedling is currently in a small tray of its own, spread your fingers around the stem, slowly turn the pot or tray over, and gently catch the soil and root as it falls loose. Pat the bottom of the tray lightly to nudge the seedling out if it doesn’t budge at first.
If each tray has multiple seedlings, don’t turn it over. Use a knife to cut through the soil well around each root. Then use a spoon to scoop the root out.In both cases, avoid handling the stem once the root is clear. Gently cup the root in your palm instead or use a large spoon.

, Although this sounds counterintuitive, don’t shake off any soil clinging to the root. Instead, be on the lookout for soil that falls away on its own, revealing roots that have tangled themselves into a solid ball.


If no soil falls away, treat this as a good sign. This means that the roots are growing outward into the soil, where they will reach the most nutrients.
If the roots have tangled into a dense ball, gently work a few loose with a finger, fork, or similar tool.

, Gently insert each one into its designated hole in your garden’s soil. Fill the hole with soil. Cover the roots all the way up to the base of the stem, but keep the soil on top loose and breathable. Don’t suffocate the roots by packing soil in too densely. If you planted a summer garden with compost and soil nutrients, the soil should still be healthy enough to support your fall garden. For added insurance, feel free to layer more compost over the soil.
Once planted, check the soil for dryness frequently, especially toward the beginning, when the weather may still be hot. Water immediately if the top inch of soil feels dry and crumbly.

, Depending on your climate, protect your fall garden by shielding it from the elements. Purchase floating row covers to drape over your vegetables. Shield young seedlings from the sun in the late summer. Insulate them from the cold at night once fall weather settles in.The fabric for covers comes in a variety of thicknesses. Consult local nurseries and farms to find out which is best suited for both your climate and the particular vegetables you’re growing.
Although you can simply drape these directly over the plants, they may weigh down on your plants, especially when wet from dew or rain. To keep the cover off your plants, build a simple loop house to support the fabric."

Find out if asparagus grows well in your region.,
Decide whether to start your plants from seeds or crowns.,
Asparagus seeds have a low germination rate, so it's more difficult to know exactly how many plants you'll end up with.,
Choose a planting spot for your asparagus.,
Buy asparagus seeds or crowns.",How to Plant Asparagus1," Asparagus does best in areas that have either cold winters, during which the ground freezes, or very dry summers. It's a hardy and adaptable plant, but it's much harder to grow in areas with mild winters and wet summers, such as the Gulf Coast of the United States.;
, Asparagus seeds require three years to grow before they are ready to be harvested. During their first season the seeds germinate and sprout, and after that they need two years to establish their long, spongy roots deep into the soil. When you plant crowns, you skip the first season and go straight to the rooting stage. This means you can lightly harvest your asparagus in the second year, in addition to a full harvest in year three.

, However, the seeds that do get established tend to turn into hardy plants that last longer and produce more spears than plants that came from crowns.


Asparagus crowns that are marked ""2-year crowns"" supposedly allow you to harvest spears just one year after planting. However, the process of transplanting asparagus plants after they've already established their roots can damage them, and they typically still need two full years in the same soil before they reach full production.

, Since asparagus can keep producing spears for up to 25 years, choose a spot you're ready to devote to asparagus for a very long time. The area should have the following characteristics:


Full sun. Asparagus does best in sunny conditions. Since it comes up early in the spring, it's ok to choose a place near trees that don't yet have leaves. Just make sure the asparagus bed isn't shadowed by a group of trees or a building.
Well-drained soil. The soil should be loose and have excellent drainage. Asparagus planted in waterlogged soil will rot.
Space for a raised bed. This is optional, since asparagus do fine in the ground, but it's easier to keep their bed free of weeds and completely drained when it's raised.

, Asparagus seeds and crowns can be purchased at home and garden stores, nurseries or online. Seeds are available all year round, but crowns are usually for sale very early in the spring, right before they should be planted.


Asparagus plants are monoecious, meaning that each plant is either male or female. The female plants put energy into producing seeds, so they don't produce as many spears as the males. Some varieties of asparagus have been engineered to produce only male plants. You only need to plant half as many crowns of a male-only variety to get the same yield, since you won't need to weed out the female plants.
Asparagus seeds aren't usually separated by sex, so the female plants are weeded out once they sprout.
Choose a rust-resistant variety, such as one of the many ""Jersey"" varieties or a ""Mary Washington.""
If you're buying crowns, pick healthy-looking crowns that are a grayish-brown color, large and plump. Buy them just a day or so before planting them.
Purple asparagus and other heirloom varieties are available at nurseries. You can create white asparagus by shielding the spears from the sun with soil.

Transplant the male plants to the permanent bed.",How to Plant Asparagus2," Early in the spring, sow single seeds in small pots meant for starting seedlings. Place the pots in full sunlight, moisten the soil daily, and keep them at a temperature of 77 °F (25 °C).

, Once they have sprouted, they do not need to be kept as warm. Lower the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C).

, When the seedlings are about a foot tall, and the weather outside has warmed to spring, it's time to plant them outside in a nursery bed. Dig a hole about 3 inches deep to allow them to continue growing.

, When the plants begin producing flowers, you'll be able to tell which are male and which are female. The male plants have large, long flowers, and the females have smaller flowers. Pull up the female plants and compost them.

, Let the male plants complete their growing cycle and overwinter in the nursery bed. The following spring, one year from germination, they have reached the same maturity as one-year crowns, and are ready to be transplanted to the permanent bed. Follow the steps below to continue growing the plants.


Be sure to dig the plants up while they are still dormant. Don't wait until they start their second growing season, or they will suffer from transplant shock.

"
"
Prepare the bed.,
Soak the crowns.,
Plant the crowns.,
Back fill the soil.,
Mulch the plants.",How to Plant Asparagus3," Prepare a bed 4 feet (1.2 m) wide. Remove all traces of weeds and grass from the bed, making sure there are no roots left behind in the soil. Till the soil and rake in manure, compost, blood or bone meal at a depth of 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm).


Dig trenches for planting. Trenches should be 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) deep and around 12 inches (30 cm) wide. If you are planting multiple rows, space the trenches 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart.






Make ridges in the trenches. Mix the soil that you removed from the trenches with organic compost, and spread 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) of the enriched soil into the bottom center of each trench to form a center ridge.






You can also mix in rock phosphate, a mineral powder that encourages root growth.

, Place the crowns in a bucket of either warm water or a compost tea (fortified with plant nutrients) for about 15 minutes before planting.

, Place the crowns in the trenches, spacing them 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) apart. Drape the roots over the sides of the ridges.


Cover the roots and crowns with soil. Place soil over the roots and over the crowns by 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm).
Water the area thoroughly after you are done planting.

, As the asparagus plants begin to grow and the soil settles, add more soil over the crowns. Place 1 to 3 inches (2 to 7 cm) of soil over the crowns every 2 to 3 weeks until the trenches are filled to ground level.

, Spread 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) of mulch around the plants after the trench has been filled. Mulching the plants helps to keep weeds down and helps retain soil moisture.

"
"
Water the plants regularly.,
Weed the soil.,
Fertilize and mulch the plants.,
Watch out for pests and diseases.",How to Plant Asparagus4," Asparagus plants will reach maturity after two full growing seasons. In the meantime, keep the soil moist at all times.

, Asparagus plants will die if they have to compete for nutrients with weeds, grasses, and any other plants. Take good care of the soil while the plants reach maturity. When they're older, their deep roots will naturally crowd out weeds.

, In spring, fertilize the asparagus plants with a liquid fertilizer meant to stimulate growth. During the winter, protect the plants from the cold by covering them with straw or another mulch.

, Asparagus plants are susceptible to asparagus beetles, which feed on the fern-like asparagus foliage during summer and spring. They lay eggs on the asparagus leaves. If you see the beetles or their eggs, pick them off.

"
"
Pick the spears.,
Prepare the plants for next year.",How to Plant Asparagus5," After three years, or two if you started the asparagus from crowns, it's time to enjoy your harvest. Cut the spears every few days using a sharp knife or scissors. As your plants produce more spears, you may have to harvest them more often.


Spears are ready to be harvested when they are about 6 inches (15 cm) high, and the tips begin to loosen.
Limit the first harvest to two or three weeks, picking spears every few days, and taking care not to pick too many from the same plant. Spears will come up thinner the longer you harvest. A good rule of thumb is to stop harvesting once the spears are about the size of a pencil, allowing the plant to devote energy to its root systems from then on.
The following year, extend your harvest time to four or five weeks. In the succeeding years, you can extend it to six.

, At the end of the growing season, stop picking the spears and allow them to grow to their natural height. Keep the asparagus bed weeded, watered, and free of pests throughout the summer. In the fall, cut the fronds down and remove them from the area so no pests will overwinter in the asparagus bed.

Prepare the site.,
Lay a piece of string on the soil as a guide to make sure you dig the row in a straight line.,
Use a cane, or other tool, to dig a narrow hole that you will place the seeds in.,
Using a hoe, gently cover the seeds with soil.,
If the soil is dry, water the seeds in.,
To protect your plants from late frosts in Spring, build a frame to cover the drills.",How to Plant Parsnips," Loosen the soil with a fork and remove any weeds or large stones. Use a rake to create a level surface. Use the head of the rake to lightly press down the soil and lightly rake the surface once more.;
, You will also want to lay a plank of wood next to the line that you just made. Line the plank of wood up right next to the line that was formed by laying the string out as a guide.

, The narrow hole that you are digging should ideally be about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) deep in length.

, Then, using the head of the metal rake, lightly firm the soil.

, The soil should be kept moist and free of weeds throughout the growing season.

, Push the sides of the fabric into the soil, or fix it in place with canes. Remove the barrier when the seeds germinate and the plants are visible through the soil.

Put Chinese cabbage near companion plants.,
Choose an area where the soil drains well.,
Turn the soil over to eight inches (20.3 cm) deep.,
Add compost to the soil.,
Flatten the soil out with a rake.,
Sow the seeds ¼-½ inch (6.35cm-12.7cm) deep.,
Space seeds 12 to 18 inches (30.5cm-45.7cm) apart in the row.,
Make rows 18 to 30 inches (45.7 to 76.2 cm) apart.,
Water the cabbage plants every day.,
Watch out for insects and disease.,
Harvest the cabbage when the heads reach the size you want.",How to Plant Chinese Cabbage," Chinese cabbage grows best in cool weather, not in the long, hot days of summer. Plant it early in the year for harvest before the summer heat wave, or after the hottest days of summer are past. Your area’s climate will dictate whether or not you can grow Chinese cabbage.Grow it during periods where the temperature stays between 45°F and 75°F( 7℃ and 24℃). Whether you have a better chance in the spring or autumn depends on the area you live in.
Research the average date of the last frost in your area and plan to plant after that date.;
, If you live in a cool climate, your cabbage can be placed in full sunlight. If you live in a warmer climate, the cabbage needs to be planted where it will be in the shade for part of the day. Cabbage should never get more than eight hours of sunlight in a day.If your garden is in full sunlight for the entire day, you may need to build a shelter that will cover the cabbage for part of the day.

, Your garden plants have a way of working together to promote solid growth. If you plant basil, celery, garlic, potatoes, rosemary, onions, or beans, put your cabbage near them in the garden. These plants repel bugs and share nutrients.Put companion plants, and other Chinese cabbage, at least 12 to 18 inches (30.5cm-45.7cm) away from your Chinese cabbage seeds.

, Chinese cabbage needs moisture-retentive soil, but soil that isn’t soggy or waterlogged. Make sure your garden has good drainage, or consider making some adjustments that will help the soil drain better., With a shovel, hoe, or tiller, chop up the garden soil before planting seeds. Make sure that at least the top eight inches (20.3 cm) of the soil are loosened and turned over. It’s best to do this for the whole garden, but it’s especially important for Chinese cabbage seeds.At the beginning of the season, you may need to water the soil a few times over the course of a week to make it easier to till up.
Cabbage grows well in sandy loam soil. It will grow if there is clay in the soil, as well, as long as the soil isn’t all clay. If it is all clay, it probably won’t drain well, which is important.

, Mix a good amount of decomposed material from your compost pile into the soil in the areas you’re putting the cabbage. This vegetable needs soil high in organic matter, so the more compost the better. If you don’t have a compost pile, find a garden store that sells composted organic material.Mix the compost into the soil after you turn the soil over. Make the mixture about 1:1 of garden soil and compost, at least in the areas where you’re planting the cabbage.

, Tilling the soil up tends to leave ruts, lumps, and a generally uneven soil surface. To aid your planting, and give the seeds a good chance at growing, rake the garden bed so it is flat and leveled out across the whole surface., When the bed has been flattened, it’s time to sow the Chinese cabbage seeds. Press your finger into the soil ¼-½ in. (6.35cm-12.7cm) deep, forming a small divot. Place the seeds in the divot. Gently cover the seed, making sure you only add enough soil to fill the hole.Also place some compost on top of the soil once you put the seeds into the soil. Replenish the compost halfway through the growing season.

, Chinese cabbage spreads as it grows. For this reason, it’s important to plant the seeds far enough apart that they have room to widen. Plant Michihili types closer to 12 in. (30.5cm) apart and Napa types closer to 18 in. (45.7cm) apart., If you are going to plant multiple rows of Chinese cabbage, leave at least a foot and a half between the rows. Closer spacing produces smaller heads, which might be beneficial if you’re going to sell the cabbage at a market.Some varieties grow better with tighter or looser spacing. Check the seed packets for addition spacing information.

, Chinese Cabbage soaks up water, so you want to keep the soil constantly moist. Install a moisture meter around your cabbage plants to keep tabs on the moisture level. Generally, plan to water the plants every day, especially if they are getting a lot of sun., This plant is susceptible to slugs, aphids, flea beetles, and cabbage worms. Slugs and aphids can usually be picked off, or rinsed off with a hose. Install mesh screens over the plants to protect from these insects.If you notice that the cabbages are brown or withered, they may be diseased. It’s best to remove diseased plants from the garden and dispose of them.

, Chinese cabbage generally grows to maturity in about 90 days, but exactly when you harvest is up to you. Use a sharp knife to cut the head off at the base. Leave the outer leaves and the stem and roots of the plant in the garden.Smaller heads will regrow on the plant after you chop off the head.

Choose healthy plants to source the seeds from.,
Select the seeds from the first fruits produced on the bell pepper (capsicum) plant.,
Harvest the seeds from ripe fruits only.,
Remove the seeds from the flesh of the fruit.,
Sort out any flesh or other matter than isn't seeds.,
Check which seeds will germinate and which won't.,
Dry the viable bell pepper seeds.,
Dry well.,
Transfer the seeds to storage.,
Plant the harvested seeds next growing season.",How to Preserve Seeds from Bell Peppers," You'll want to pass on the best possible traits for the next bell pepper crop, so only select the plants that are growing well and are in good health.


Signs of a healthy plant include good growth; ability to cope with hot, cold, wet and cool climates; well-formed fruits; uniform growth; supple branches; thick walls on the fruits; good flavor.;
, The reason for this is that the germination rate for seeds from later fruits drops to around 60 percent., This is when the seeds are ready. The bell pepper is ripe when it has changed from green to red or yellow or from light yellow to dark yellow or orange.The seeds will appear a golden yellow color; if they are still white, then they're not ready for preserving.


If the fruit has dried on the stalk, the seeds can be harvested from this too.

, Do this either using your fingers to run along the flesh and pull the seeds away or by scooping them out with a small spoon.

, Place already removed seeds on a plate or tray as you work on removing more seeds from the flesh.


You will likely get around 200 seeds per bell pepper., There is a simple test using water that will enable you to remove the seeds that probably won't germinate:Place all of the seeds into a small container filled with water.
The seeds that won't germinate (non-viable) will float to the top. The seeds left at the bottom will likely germinate.
Pour the non-viable seeds off, carefully keeping the viable ones at the base of the container.

, Spread the seeds out onto a suitable surface for drying. A screen or mesh make ideal drying surfaces, as the air can flow both sides of the seed. Put the drying seeds somewhere warm, such as in the sun or on a sunny windowsill.

, You can check when the seeds are properly dry by breaking one or two open. If the seed makes a cracking sound when broken open, it is sufficiently dried., Place in an airtight bag and store in a cook, dark place. Label the bag so that you remember when the seeds were harvested.

, Repeat the process of saving the seeds for each consecutive crop, always focusing on the healthiest plants.

Grow hardy vegetables.,
Use compost as a moisture-retaining layer.,
Add mulch.,
Water the vegetables using minimal water-loss systems.,
Water at the right time of day.,
Plant vegetables so that they won't be sitting in the hottest sun of the middle of the day.",How to Help Vegetables Survive a Hot Summer," From the outset select vegetables that can tolerate less water and more heat. Examples include potatoes, sweetcorn and New Zealand spinach.;
, Add a lot of compost from the start and keep the compost layer well maintained throughout the growing season. This will help retain the moisture in the soil and also acts as a barrier against too much heat affecting the vegetables.

, As well as compost, a layer of mulch will help improve moisture retention abilities of the soil. Make sure to choose organic mulch; use your own if possible.

, For example, a drip watering system (tape or pipe) provides a regular, steady feed of water without using a lot of water. It is more directed and concentrated, going to where the plant is rather than spraying all over the garden.

, The benefits of watering are best when done early in the morning. Deep watering is more effective than surface spraying.

, Sunshine from mornings and late afternoons is much kinder to the plants and during summer they will still get plenty of light.

Decide where you will grow your winter salads.,
Select the winter salad plants that you will grow.,
Keep watered as usual and fertilize as needed.,
Harvest as needed.",How to Grow Winter Salads," If you live in a very cold climate, you will need to grow the plants indoors. This can be easily done provided you have a space near a window somewhere so that the plants can get sunlight each day. Choose pots that will fit in your home and make sure that you have non-leaking saucers under each pot. For those lucky enough to be able to keep growing during winter, plant your winter salad vegetables in the garden bed as usual.;
, There is a wide selection of plants suitable for growing at wintertime. These include:
Lamb's lettuce (Valerianella locusta) - this is also known as corn salad. It is a very popular salad green in Europe, where it is also known as mache.






Cos lettuces are a good choice - look for miniature varieties if you are growing indoors, as well as the heirloom varieties such as ""Rouge d'hiver"".






Chicory - this is a slightly bitter salad green that adds life to a winter salad.






Rocket/arugula - always a salad favourite at any time of year







, Cover against frost if you are growing outdoors and be sure not to let salad vegetables dry out if grown in a heated environment indoors.

, If you stagger your planting, you should be able to have a crop of winter salads continuously through winter and into spring. Freshly picked food is always the very best for our health.

Decide when to harvest your spinach.,
Choose an appropriate method.,
Harvest the spinach before any problems occur.,
Wash the spinach.,
Get rid of damaged leaves.,
Preserve the spinach.,
Cut the spinach up.",How to Harvest Spinach," Spinach can be harvested whenever you feel like it is ready. You can choose to harvest smaller, 'baby' leaves which tend to have a sweeter taste, or leave the spinach to grow bigger leaves.
, You can either chop the spinach at the base of the stem, or pull the stem right out from the soil. If you want the spinach to regrow again, chop it at the base whilst leaving a bit of stem for it to regrow. If you're lucky, you will have another batch of spinach to harvest.

Additionally, you can cut the bigger, outer leaves and leave the smaller spinach leaves to grow. This way you'll have yourself another harvest if the rest of the spinach leaves still need time to grow.

, The most common problems gardeners encounter is when the spinach leaves turn yellow or ""bolt"". Be sure to harvest the spinach before then.

Bolting is when the stems and leaves shoot straight up, failing to form the larger leaves required for culinary purposes. It usually occurs when the climate gets warmer early in the growing season. The spinach prepares to 'flower' and reproduce rather than focusing on leaf production.

, Bring the spinach inside and then rinse the leaves under the kitchen tap to get rid of any dirt. That way, you won't be using spinach with slug trails or soil all over it., Any damaged leaves or yellow-colored spinach need to be removed. These leaves are best not eaten and instead should go straight to the compost bin. Or, use broken leaves in a soup or stew where the damage won't be an issue., Place the leaves in a paper towel, in a sealed plastic bag. The leaves should be kept in the fridge and can last for up to two weeks. It's best to use the spinach up by then., Just before you use the spinach, cut the leaves from the stem. Cut the right amount you want to use and then leave the rest of the leaves attached to the stems. Spinach leaves should only be cut up when you want to use them, otherwise they won't preserve well."

Look for a plant with bright green leaves.,
Decide if you want to grow it hydroponically or with soil.,
Use the right container.,
Choose the right spot.,
Place the lucky bamboo in a warm spot where it will get indirect light.,
Change the water every week if you're growing it hydroponically.,
If you're growing your plant in soil, water it just enough so the soil is moist but not soggy.,
Fertilizer your plant every month or so.,
Prevent tip burn by using filtered or bottled water.,
Trim the plant.,
Pay attention to the color of the leaves.,
Cut the plant if you must.",How to Grow Lucky Bamboo," If the leaves or stems are yellow or brown, this means that the plant is unhealthy. The plant has likely been shipped from China or Taiwan, so it's been through quite a trek.Professional growers take the stalks and braid and curl them into intricate designs. Larger, more intricate designs result in some lucky bamboo plants costing hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
A plant kept in a pot can grow up to 3 feet (0.9 m) high. If it's grown in soil outside, it may reach a height of up to 5 feet (1.5 m).;
, It's probably easiest and a little cleaner to grow in water and stones, though it can also grow in soil. Ultimately, it's up to you and will likely be determined by the pot or vase you have available.


If you do go the stone route, the container should have enough stones or marbles in the bottom to stabilize it. The lucky bamboo will need at least 1 to 3 inches (3-8 cm) of water to thrive.
If you want to grow it in soil, well-drained, rich potting soil is best. It needs to stay moist but not soaking at all times. Use organic fertilizer when needed; salts and high phosphorus concentrations in synthetic fertilizers can cause deterioration.Also, you can be sure your soil drains well by simply adding some small rocks to the bottom of the pot.

, Put the lucky bamboo in a tall glass vase or ceramic container – no shallow bowls – or leave it in the container it comes in. A clear container is great if you just want to grow the plant hydroponically with some decorative stones; use a regular terra cotta pot if you want to grow it in soil.


Keep in mind that the plant needs to be stabilized at its peak height. Your container should be at least 1 foot (30 cm) in height.
Using soil? Fill the pot up most of the way with your rich soil and make sure it can drain well.

, Lucky bamboo do best in bright, filtered sunlight – think of the light that creeps through the top of a forest canopy. Direct sunlight will scorch the leaves. And as for temperature, keep it away from the air conditioning or vent. This plant prefers an air temperature between 65ºF and 90ºF.If you want to control the curl of your plant, use a three-sided box (a box with a side cut out). The plant will then bend toward the light. As it curves, change the side the sunlight faces, and the plant will curve back., Keep an eye on how much light the plant gets – if anything, too little light is better than too much.While you're gone, turn the air off, too. It'll be nicer for the plant if it's a little warmer.


As the seasons change, you may want to move the plant. Take it away from any windows if you're unsure. It'll still get plenty of light in the center of a room.

, And as for what water to use, this plant is very sensitive to chemicals like fluoride and chlorine – only use tap water if it's been sitting out for 24 hours (so the chemicals can evaporate. Otherwise, bottled water is best.


Once the plant has grown roots, the roots must be kept covered with water. Again, 1-3 inches is all it takes.

, Keep it this way every day. The plant can get dry-rot if the soil is too wet. You can also spray the leaves with water to keep it moist and humid. Again, use filtered or bottled water to avoid chemical damage.


Encourage more roots by increasing the amount of water in which the plant is growing. More roots mean lusher top foliage; the higher the water is up the stalk, the higher up the roots will grow.

, If you're using soil, use organic fertilizer every month or so so the plant gets enough nutrients (again, go organic as synthetic can cause deterioration). If you're growing it hydroponically, use liquid fertilizer in the water.


Add it at the same time as you add the rest of the water; it's best to add fertilizer when the water is clean.

, Tip burn is when the leaves start to become dry and dead. This often happens when there are chemicals in the water. Setting your tap water out may not be enough – you may need to switch to bottled water to get your plant to look healthy.


Once it gets tip burn, it may be hard to get rid of. Even if you do switch water, some chemicals may reside in the plant. You may just have to wait it out as it should go away eventually., Over time, most of these plants become top heavy. Because of this, trimming is very important for it to stay healthy. Don't cut off the main stalk – just the offshoots. Use sterile snippers to do so.


Trim them off within an inch or two (2.5 - 5 cm) of the base. New shoots will emerge and the plant will be bushier and healthier.

, If they're dry and dying, that's a water problem as discussed above. If they're yellowing, that's often a result of too much sunlight or too much fertilizer.If they're brown, try making the area more humid by spraying the plant with water.


As for mushy leaves, this plant could be beyond saving. Remove them immediately, change the water, and replant what you have left.

, If part of the plant is dying, you may have to cut it off. This could also happen if you don't like the shape the plant is taking on. Whatever you do, don't throw away the trimmings – they can be made into a new plant. New shoots will emerge from the bottom, older piece of the plant, and the top section can be potted to grow on its own.


If you have a dying plant, get rid of the decaying parts immediately. Take any alive stems or branches and immediately repot them. They may flourish on their own if you take swift action."

Obtain mistletoe berries.,
Choose a branch in a healthy host tree.,
Attach the mistletoe berries to the branch.,
Mark the spot.,
Monitor the mistletoe plant's progress.,
Ensure pollination.",How to Grow Mistletoe,"


Ripe mistletoe berries are pearly white and yield a glue-like pulp when crushed. Most ripen naturally in October and November and are harvested for Christmas arrangements. However, some don't ripen until the springtime, in March and April.
Berries that are green or yellow are unripe, and won't produce seeds that germinate as well as those from ripe berries.
You'll need at least 24 berries to enhance your chances of 1 taking root, because many will drop off the host tree, be eaten by birds, or simply not germinate.
If you can't obtain ripe berries in the wild or buy seeds, save a few sprigs with berries from the Holiday season. Keep them in water in a cold room until it's time to plant them.
The best time to plant mistletoe berries is in late February or early March, mimicking the natural propagation cycle of the plant in the wild.;
,


Usually, mistletoe can be found in apple, lime, hawthorn or poplar host trees.
Sycamore trees, crab apples, maples, willows, false acacias, oak, ash, plum, cotoneaster or rowan trees are also viable host trees.
Select a branch of approximately 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter. This is the correct thickness, as the bark on the branch will still be thin enough for the germinating mistletoe seeds to penetrate, and the branch itself will be sturdy enough to carry the weight of the growing plant and provide it with the necessary nutrients.
The branch should get plenty of sunlight, so make sure it's either high up in the tree or to the side but not in the shade of structures or other trees.

,


Smudge the berries against the branch so their own pulp makes them stick to the bark. The best spots to do this are the sides or the undersides of the branch.
If necessary, stand on a step stool or ladder to reach the branch.
You can repeat this process on a number of different trees to enhance the chances of seeds taking root and yielding in both male and female plants. Be careful to not overburden any single tree.

,


Tie a piece of wool or twine around the branch where you attached the berries. This will allow you to monitor the progress of any that take root.

,


Once a seed has taken root, it will grow slowly. Every year, 2 new twigs with a pair of dark green, oval leaves on the end will develop.
If none of the seeds germinate, start the process again the following year.

,


In its 4th or 5th year, mistletoe is ready to yield berries.
In order to get berries, you will need a male and female plant in close proximity.
Female plants can be recognized by their small, unobtrusive yellow flowers in late winter. Male flowers are larger and brighter yellow.
In late February or March, shake some male flowers over the female flowers (if you have them) to ensure pollination.
If the female plant is mature enough, it will yield berries in October or November.

In order to grow, nutmeg shouldn’t be planted in locations with a minimum temperature below 30°F (-1°C). Ideally, it requires an average temperature between 77°F and 95°F (25°C and 35°C).Nutmeg trees also grow best in climates that experience at least 60 inches (152-cm) of annual rainfall. You can usually find out your area's annual rainfall from your country's national weather or meteorology bureau website.
The roots don’t do well in soggy conditions, though, so it’s best to plant the tree on a slope to provide effective drainage.;
, Nutmeg grows best in soil that is neutral or slightly acidic. Ideally, your soil should have a pH between 6.0 and 7.0, though it can tolerate a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.Nutmeg is best suited for clay loam, sandy loam, and red laterite soils.
You can test your soil’s pH with a testing kit from your local garden supply store or nursery. They usually require digging a hole in the soil and filling it with distilled water. Next, you insert a test probe and wait for the results according to the kit’s instructions.
If your soil's pH is above 7.0, you can make it more acidic by about 1- to 2-inches (2.5 to 5-cm) of sphagnum peat into the soil when you plant the nutmeg.
If your soil's pH is below 5.5, you can make it a little less acidic by covering the planting area with a layer of limestone and mixing it into the soil.

, Nutmeg trees grow best in direct sun. Ideally, they should receive 12 hours of sunlight daily for healthy growth. It’s a good idea to plant nutmeg in spot where it will receive light shade between noon and 4pm, though, so it doesn’t become too dry., In order to plant nutmeg from seeds, you need to separate it from the mace producing aril that covers the seed. Find a small, sharp knife, and wipe the blade with a piece of paper towel dampened with rubbing alcohol to sterilize it.If you prefer, you can dip the knife’s blade in a pot of boiling water to sterilize it.

, Once your knife is sterilized, use it to slice into the aril at the base where it connects to the seed. Carefully peel the aril away, making sure that you don’t damage the nut.The aril is the red, lace-like substance that covers the seed.
The aril from a nutmeg is used to make mace. You can discard the aril, or set it out in a dry, sunny area for about 15 days until it dries out and turns brown. You can then grind it into mace.

, Nutmeg seeds germinate best when they’re fresh and moist. Place your seeds in a small bowl, and cover them with clean water. Allow them to soak for 24 hours before planting them.If you don’t want to plant the nutmeg right away, store the seeds in a sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator. Plant them within 6 weeks.

, To plant the nutmeg, add a free-draining soil to a 5-inch (13-cm) pot. The pot should have drainage holes in the bottom to ensure that the roots don’t become soggy.Clay loam, sandy loam, or red laterite soil is the best option for planting nutmeg.

, When your pot is filled with soil, create a 1-inch (2.5-cm) deep hole in the center. Set the nutmeg seed in the hole, and cover it with soil., When the seed is planted beneath the surface, pour some clean water over the pot. Continue watering the pot until the water appears through the drainage holes and allow it to drain fully in the sink.Tap water works well for watering the nutmeg, but make sure that it’s not softened water, which often contains salt.

, Once the nutmeg seed is planted and watered, place it in an indoor or outdoor location where the temperature is between 77°F and 86°F (25°C and 30°C). Watch the pot closely as you wait for the nutmeg to sprout, which usually takes a month or longer.Be sure to water the pot regularly as you wait for the nutmeg to sprout. The soil should constantly be moist without puddles forming on the surface.

, A newly germinated nutmeg tree should be kept indoors. However, it requires a spot that receives four to six hours of sunlight a day for healthy growth.In front of a west-facing window is an ideal spot for a young nutmeg tree.

, In order to ensure that the tree gets enough water, you should mist it with clean water twice daily. Use a fine mist spray bottle and coat the leaves without allowing the water to drip onto the plant. Water the tree so the soil is consistently moist as well.Be sure that the tree’s pot drains thoroughly after watering before placing it back on its drip tray.

, If you leave the tree in the same spot all day, it may begin to lean into the light. Spin the tree 180 degrees once a day so it receives sunlight evenly., When the tree is young, it can outgrow its container(s) quickly. If its roots fill the base of the current pot, it’s time to move it to a large container. Increase the size of the pot by 2-inches (5-cm) to ensure that it’s large enough.You can usually tell that the roots have filled the base of the current pot when they start to protrude from the drainage holes in the bottom.
Fill the new container with the same type of soil that you used initially.
Set the tree in the new pot so the surface of the soil is 1-inch (2.5-cm) below the rim.
Water the tree thoroughly after moving it and allow it to drain.
You’ll know the tree is large enough to move outside when its roots take up a 5 gallon (19 liter) pot, which usually takes approximately 6 months. It’s best to plant it outdoors in late spring, though.

, Before planting the nutmeg tree, it’s important to make sure that the spot you’ve selected is ready. Remove any rocks, weeds, or other debris in the location. Spread 2- to 4-inches (5- to 10-cm) of rotted manure over the area, and rake it into place.It’s also a good idea to mix some manure into the first 8- to 10-inches (20- to 25-cm) of soil in the area where you plan to plant the tree.

, Lift the tree out of its container so you can see its root ball. Next, use a shovel to dig a hole that’s twice as wide and as deep as the root ball.If you are planting more than one nutmeg tree, dig the holes at least 30 to 40 feet (9- to 12-m) apart.

, After you’ve dug the hole, lift the tree out of its container again. Gently place it into the hole, making sure that the tree’s root crown is level with the surrounding soil.Be sure to cut through any circling roots with garden shears before setting in the hole.
Cut away any dead or mushy roots as well.
The root crown may be slightly above the soil if necessary.

, When the tree is place, add soil back to the hole to fill it in halfway. Next, fill the hole with water from a watering can or garden hose., After you’ve added water to the hole, give it time to drain down into the soil. Sprinkle some more soil over the area in case the drainage has caused holes or gaps to form.Avoid tamping the soil while it is moist.

, Adding mulch around a nutmeg tree can help the soil retain its moisture. However, be sure not to pack it around the trunk or the bark can become wet, making it vulnerable to insects and diseases.Fresh wood chips and compost make the best mulch for a nutmeg tree.

, Check on the soil surrounding your nutmeg tree regularly. When the top 2- to 3-inches (5-cm to 7.5-cm) feel dry, water the soil, making sure it drains completely., Pruning your nutmeg tree regularly can help manage disease and maintain healthy growth. Inspect the tree regularly and use gardening shears or clippers to remove dead branches, cut back lower branches, and snip off any discolored foliage.Pruning can also help increase flower, fruit, and seed production for a nutmeg tree.

, The nutmeg tree will begin to bear fruit when it reaches about 7 years of age. The fruit is ready for harvesting 9 months after the tree flowers and it's ripe. It will usually split in half and fall to the ground, but you can pull it off if it doesn't fall.The fruit is similar in size and color to an apricot. You can discard the outer flesh and save the shiny purple brown seed that's covered with a red avril.

, Nutmeg can suffer from fungal infections, such as fruit rot and thread blight. It is also prone to damage from insects such as black, white, and shield scale. Watch your trees carefully, and treat them as soon as you notice signs of a disease or pest.Symptoms of fruit rot include water-logged spots on the fruit and rotted seeds and avrils. You can treat the disease with a fungicide such as 1% Bordeaux mixture.Symptoms of thread blight include fine white or black threads on the underside of the leaves. You can treat the disease with a fungicide such as 1% Bordeaux mixture.
You can tell that your nutmeg tree is suffering black, white, or shield scale damage if you observe black, white, or brown fish scale-like pests in clusters on the stems and lower surfaces of the leaves. Treat the infestation with a pesticide such as dimethoate.

It tolerates cold winters and hot summers, often a feature of oceanic countryside in Pacific countries, such as New Zealand, where they are being grown in the hill country of the South Island.


The tree grows best at 35º to 45º latitude.The gevuina likes the cool temperate climate. It can tolerate temperatures to minus 10 degrees but only with protection, as it tends to be damaged from around minus 6 degrees.Grower experience has shown that too low a temperature will kill the tree.;
, The gevuina grows best in full sun but doesn't like wind exposure.


It can be grown in semi-shade but you'll find the fruit isn't as prolific.

, The soil should be fertile, moist, and well-drained. A little wetness is tolerated.


Stone filled or clay-like soils are okay. However, it seems that good quality soil is the best bet for crop gevuina growing.
Gevuinas like slightly acidic soil conditions, pH range 4.5-6.5 (not alkaline)., The less leaves and the larger the root system, the better, to prevent water stress.

, Autumn and early winter are the best planting seasons, although the tree may need frost protection as a young sapling. If frost is a problem where you are, plant in spring.Protect young trees individually from frost.


Space 2 to 3 meters (6.6 to 9.8 ft) apart if you have more than one tree.
If preferred, plant in a container or a large tub. They will grow well provided they are watered well.

, Gevuinas need constant moisture and will even tolerate some water-logging of their roots.Hot, dry weather can dry out the soil and cause the leaves to desiccate. This is a form of stress that can kill the tree.
Mulch really well and add a thick layer of well-rotted compost.

, Prune using the vase system rather than a single-leader.Remove the tip of the leader to allow laterals to form.


You may need to remove older leaves to expose new tips to the light that encourages them to grow.

, This can be touch and go. You may find that you can grow the seedlings to about 10 centimeter (3.9 in) high with no problems, only to have them keel over when planted.Cuttings seem to be the healthiest and most successful means for propagating the plant.


Seeds don't tend to do well; there appears to be a symbiotic fungus-root relationship needed to boost growth; if you do try seeds, also add some soil from the base of a mature gevuina., If you don't, it'll be hard to collect the gevuina nuts.

, Demand is exceeding supply – these nuts are nutritious and delicious. It will be about 7 years before you get a decent harvest from a single tree, with the first crop appearing after about 4 years.


The fruit changes colour from green, to deep red, and then to black as the fruit matures. The fruit sits in clusters.
The nut takes a year to ripen. Next year's flowers will appear as the nut is ripening.
A smooth shell forms around the nuts. It is much easier to remove than macadamia shells.
The flowers don't wilt, and so are beloved by florists. This makes them another possible harvest product if wished.

, The nuts are amazing - they can be eaten roasted, dipped in chocolate, made into an oil similar to olive oil, or used as a coffee substitute.

Some take the form of vines, while others are shrubs. Some are so tender that they must be grown indoors, while others are frost hardy. Buy the jasmine cultivar that's right for your needs. You'll find jasmine plants available in pots at the nursery, or you can order seeds online. These jasmines are the most commonly available in nurseries:

;
, Each jasmine cultivar has specific environmental needs, so do a little research to find out what conditions you need to provide for your plant. In order for your jasmine to thrive, it's necessary to provide the right level of sun and the proper temperature. When you're deciding where to plant your jasmine, take the following variables into account:


What level of sun does it need? Most jasmine plants require partial to full sun, although a few cultivars accept full shade.
Is it hardy in your climate? Determine whether the jasmine you have chosen will thrive outdoors or if it would be better off in a pot inside, where you can control the temperature and humidity. If you're planting outside, you'll want to choose the warmest spot you can find.
How much space does your jasmine plant need? Some cultivars are vines that grow up walls and fences, others grow along the ground and provide good groundcover, and still others grow as contained shrubs. Pick a planting spot that suits the type you have.

, Most jasmine cultivars do best in rich, well-draining soil. Whether you're planting your jasmine in the ground or in a pot, prepare the soil by working in in 2-inch layer of compost. This will ensure that the jasmine produces healthy flowers throughout the growing season.


If you're planting outside, check the spot you've chosen to make sure it drains well. Dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water quickly soaks into the hole and leaves it empty, the soil there drains well. If the water sits and drains slowly, choose a different planting spot.

, Slide the jasmine plant gently from its container and saturate the root ball. Dig a hole the size of the root ball and set the jasmine plant inside. Lightly pat soil around the base of the jasmine plant to hold it in place. Water the soil around the base well to help the plant settle. Add more soil if necessary to keep the jasmine erect.


While the most common way to plant jasmine is to buy a young jasmine plant, it is also possible to start jasmine from seed. Jasmine seeds have a low germination rate and require special care according to the cultivar. In most cases, you can start the seeds indoors in seed pots filled with seed starter mix, then harden off the seedlings and plant them outside once the last frost has passed.Another way to plant jasmine is to use semi-ripe cuttings taken from a mature jasmine plant. In mid-summer or fall, cut healthy 6-inch stems from a jasmine plant. Prepare a pot with a soil and compost mixture and push the stems into a pot. Overwinter the pot in a sunny window, keeping it well watered, and transplant it in the spring., Many varieties of jasmine require stakes to climb in order to grow strong and healthy. Place a tall stake or a trellis a few inches from the base of the jasmine, and gently wrap it around the stake as it grows. Eventually it will begin growing up the stake on its own. If you planted the jasmine next to a wall or fence, train it to grow upward until it begins growing on its own.To ensure that the jasmine establishes itself on the trellis or stake, you can use string or twine to loosely tie the talks to the support. Remove the ties when the vine is established., Water the soil around the jasmine throughout the growing season to keep it moist, but not soggy. A good rule of thumb for determining when the water jasmine is to water when the soil begins to look and feel a little dry. If your jasmine is in a pot, be sure it's draining adequately and water once a day.


Water jasmine from the bottom to keep from getting the leaves wet. The sun will burn the leaves if water droplets remain on them during the sunniest hours.For jasmine you're growing indoors, be mindful of the humidity level of the air as well as the moisture of the soil. Tender varieties of jasmine need a humidity level of between 30 and 45. Use a humidifier or mist spray the plant with mist frequently., During the growing season, fertilizing the jasmine once a month will keep it blooming. Sprinkle a balanced fertilizer that is water soluble around the base of the jasmine. Alternatively, you can side-dress the jasmine with compost by working an inch of compost into the soil around the base of the jasmine plant. Be careful not to disturb the roots.

, Throughout the growing season, remove dead leaves, flowers and stems by pinching them off or using hand pruners to make a cut flush with the main stem of the plant. Tidy the plants by pruning stray stems. By strategically removing stems here and here, you can control the shape of the vine. Shrub jasmine and varieties grown indoors will need less pruning to maintain their shape.


Don't prune before or during the blooming period, as this can inhibit blooming. Wait until the plant has finished blooming for the season.To improve the shape of shrub like jasmine, you can cut the stems back by a third after blooming. The shrub will come back next season with a fuller shape., In order to protect the jasmine plants over the winter, add a few inches of pine straw, manure or garden compost around their bases. This will ensure that the root systems don't freeze completely, and your jasmine should begin growing again when the weather warms.


If you have been growing your jasmine in a pot outside, you can bring it indoors for the winter rather than adding mulch.
Jasmine grown indoors year-round does not require mulching. However, it's important to keep them in a sunny room with a constant temperature of between 60 and 75 degrees., While jasmine generally isn't bothered by pests, it's still a good idea to watch out for certain insects that might affect its growth. If you see the following insects on your jasmine, pick them off by hand and place them in a jar of soapy water, or wash the leaves of the jasmine with a soapy water solution or a solution of water and neem oil:


Aphids
Mealybugs
Red spider mite
Soft scales

, A jasmine vine or shrub will produce many flowers throughout the season, and you may want to bring some indoors to display as part of an arrangement. Use a sharp pair of pruners to cut branches loaded with flowers and leaves. Place the stems in water right away to preserve their freshness., When your jasmine produces flowers in the spring and summer, you can make your very own jasmine tea from the flower buds. Jasmine tea is said to have restorative properties, especially when mixed with green tea leaves.To make your own, follow these steps:


In the early morning, gently pick flower buds from the plant. Their essence is strongest at this time of day.
Place them in a single layer on a baking tray.
Bake the buds using your oven's lowest setting - 200 °F (93 °C) or lower. You may also dry the buds by placing them in a sunny window in a dry room.
Let the buds completely dry. In the oven, it will take about 3 hours. Be sure not to overcook them.
Let the buds sit overnight on the tray before storing them.
Store the buds in an airtight jar. When you want to make tea, add a tablespoonful to boiling water. Let it the tea steep for 4 minutes, then strain out the buds and enjoy., If you want to harness the strong, sweet fragrance of jasmine to use as perfume, you can make your own infused oil with fresh buds. You'll need a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid and a base oil of your choice. Almond, jojoba, olive, or castor oil are all good options.Follow this process to make the infusion:


Harvest 1/4 cup of fresh buds in the morning.
Put the buds in a plastic bag and tap them gently with a hammer to release their oils.
Place the buds in the jar and pour 1/2 cup of base oil over them. Seal the jar and leave it in a cool, dark place for 24 hours.
Strain the buds and smell the oil. If you want a stronger oil, repeat the process with fresh buds. Continue steeping fresh buds in oil until the scent is as strong as you want it to be.
Transfer the oil to an amber or blue glass bottle for long-term storage. You can dab on the oil and use it as perfume, or use the fragrant oil as an ingredient in lotion, lip balm and other concoctions.

Prepare the ferns for winter.",How to Grow Ferns," During the late summer, look at the underside of the fronds, or leaves, of adult ferns. You should see brown spots or lines. These are the sporangia. Collect the spores from these sections of the fern using plain sheets of paper.Clip a full or partial frond off the plant and place it in between two clean sheets of plain white paper. Lay it in a warm, dry, and draft-free area for one to two weeks. Open the paper after this time to see the dried remains of the frond.
You will need to separate the spores from the debris by holding the bottom sheet of paper at an angle and gently tapping it. The debris should fall off, but the spores should stick to the paper.
After removing the debris, fold the paper in half and tap the folded edge against a surface using a little more strength. The spores should fall into the fold, and you can collect them from there.
Ideally, the spots or lines on the frond you collect will be the shade of rich cinnamon brown.
Even though this should be done in the late summer for ferns in temperate regions, ferns grown in tropical regions are different and can be collected from at any time of the year.;
, Use light, high quality soil. Moisten it with a little water.


Use a clear plastic container with a lid. These containers are your best option if you want an adequate amount of humidity to build inside.
The soil should not be soaking wet. Ideally, it should be just a little moist and springy to the touch.

, To quickly and easily destroy any harmful germs in the soil, microwave the containers of soil for three to five minutes on full power.


The soil should begin to steam. Make sure that the container does not start melting in the microwave, though.
You should allow the soil to cool for a full hour after microwaving it. Do not add the spores to hot soil.

, Gently disperse a few spores on top of the soil without pressing them in or covering them.


After spreading the spores onto the soil, you should be able to hold the container up to the light and see a few of the light, dusty spores floating around the top of the soil's surface.

, Place the containers in a sunny location and let the spores sit in the soil for six to eight weeks. Keep the soil slightly moist until you see small plants that spread 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) across.


If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, place the containers in a window that faces north and keep them close to the glass. If you end up using a window that faces south, keep the containers back from the glass by about 1 foot (30.5 cm).
The small plants that push through the soil are called ""prothallia.""
Note that any prothallia that grow too close together will need to be thinned out. Keep one or two for every 3-inch (7.6-cm) area of soil. If the plants are kept too close together, only male organs will grow, and the prothallia will not be able to fertilize each other.
Check the soil every week to make sure that it has not dried out.

, Moisten the leaves that have emerged on a regular basis. Doing so will make it easier for the male part of the plant to fertilize the female part.


The prothallia should grow male and female organs once they reach 3/8 inch (9.5 mm). The male organs will naturally fertilize the female organs, and a small fern called a ""Sporophyte"" should appear. None of this can happen, however, if the prothallia are not sprinkled or misted with water on a daily to bi-daily basis.

, Once actual ferns begin to pop up from the soil, thin them out until the plants are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart.


The first full frond will be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) tall. Once they reach this height, you need to thin them out as described.

, When spring starts, open the top of your fern containers for a few hours each day. Continue this over a span of two weeks or so. Doing this will allow the ferns to adjust to the harsh, dry outside air.


You need to give the ferns a full two weeks to adjust. Each time you open the containers, you should leave them open for a little longer than the last time.
If the ferns begin to weaken during this period of adjustment, close the containers again and let the ferns fully recover. Try again once the ferns are healthy again.

, You can transplant the ferns you started from spores or choose fully grown ferns from a nursery or garden supply store. Either way, the process will be the same from this point on.


The species you should consider buying will vary based on the region you live in, but if you buy from a local nursery or grow ferns from locally collected spores, you should not have much difficulty figuring out which species can grow in your climate.
Within the United States, southern coastal states can usually grow tropical ferns. Southwest states can handle species that can thrive in low humidity. States in the midwest, northeast, mid-atlantic, and upper southern regions usually support woodland varieties.
Check on any specific requirements your fern variety needs. Those listed here are only general requirements and do not necessarily cover all of your specific variety's needs.

, The best time to plant varies by region. For the most part, spring planting is preferable. If you live in a tropical climate or in a region that does not get any winter frosts, fall planting will actually be better.Ferns planted too late in the season could experience root rot, especially if you live in a region with cold winters. The freezing and thawing process can wear away at the roots and gradually break them apart.
In warm climates, planting ferns before the summer can result in plants that are stressed by the heat and drought of summer.

, While each species has its own requirements, in general, you should choose a location that receives plenty of shade.Ideally, you should avoid placing taller ferns in areas of strong wind, but shorter varieties might be able to handle these conditions. If you are concerned, however, you could also place the ferns by a building or other structure to help shield them from some of the winds.
You should also avoid planting ferns directly on top of tree roots.

, Most ferns prefer soil that is free draining and filled with plenty of nutrient-rich organic material. Chop these materials into the intended planting site a day to a week in advance.


Most ferns have fine roots, and these roots can struggle in heavy, compact soils. Ideally, your soil needs to be loose and should not get waterlogged easily.
Use materials like organic leaf mold, shredded bark chips, organic compost, well-rotted farm manure, or gravel. Do not use fresh manure, however, since the roots of your fern can be sensitive and may die if given too much fertilizer so soon.

, The hole you dig in the soil should be a little larger than the root ball of the fern. The depth should be the same, but the width should be a little larger.


You need to give the fern a generous root ball as you move it.
If you use a fern that has already been started in a large pot or container, carefully tip the container onto its side and knock the plant out. Slowly shake the roots out of the bottom of the pot.
You should remove excess potting soil used in other containers if that soil differs from that of your garden. These soils might be lighter and may dry out faster, and as a result, the newly planted fern may not get enough moisture after you move it into the soil of your garden unless this old soil has been knocked away first.

, Firmly pack soil around the edges to keep the fern in place. Water the soil well, and make sure that everything feels secure.


Carefully spread out the roots of the fern using your fingers. Mix some of the original potting soil into the root area and water it thoroughly before you place it into the hole you dug. This is especially important if the soil of the original container differs from the soil of your garden.

, If you receive plenty of rain, you may not need to water your ferns very often. If you are experiencing something of a drought, though, you should give the plants a drink regularly. Never let the soil dry out completely.Throughout the entire first growing season, you should water the ferns once or twice a week if the soil feels dry.
Stop your watering routine in the autumn to prevent the roots from getting waterlogged.
Note that after its first full year, you will usually need to water ferns very sparingly and only if your area has faced a notable drought.

, Pack composted leaves or pine needles around the base of the ferns. The layer should be about 2 inches (10 cm) thick.


Mulch can help hold in some of the moisture, thereby preventing the roots from drying out. Additionally, the extra shade provided from the mulch should also keep the soil cool even in very hot temperatures.

, As soon as new growth has developed on the ferns, you should apply a slow-release fertilizer to the soil. Most ferns are fairly sensitive to fertilizers, so you do not want to add too much too quickly.

, You will rarely run across pests with most ferns, but you might have to deal with a slug or two. Use an appropriate pesticide to fight back as soon as the problem gets out of hand.


For an organic solution, use diatomaceous earth or an organic slug bait. Dishes of beer sunk into the soil around the fern can also work as a slug killer.
You can scatter grapefruit shells around the ferns. Slugs will gather onto these peels, and once this happens, you can dispose of them by dipping the shells into denatured alcohol.
Ferns tend to be sensitive too chemical insecticides. If you do use a chemical, test it on a few plants before applying it to all of them. Stick with dusts and sprays made with wettable powders and reduce the recommended dosage by half. Avoid liquid emulsion sprays that contain oils.

, When you see dead or dying leaves on your fern, clip them off. Removing dead debris will keep the plant healthier and make it easier for the fern to dedicate more of its resources to expanding its foliage., After the first killing frost of fall or early winter comes, you should cut back the fronds. Apply a heavy winter mulch to keep the roots nice and warm, as well.


Good options for a winter mulch include salt marsh hay and evergreen boughs.

If you’re starting with a seedling, check the ball (of soil) for moisture and make sure there is sufficient moisture around the roots. Also checking it for damage and lesions will prevent failed or dying trees.Bare-root saplings are young trees that are harvested from field nursery beds and packaged with no soil. This aids easy planting and adaptation to soil.Check for damage by looking for sturdy, straight trunks and leaves without yellow or brown spots., If you choose to plant from seeds instead of seedlings, you need to pick them when they are mature. The seeds begin to turn red and mature in late summer, and they will be ready by fall.


Do not remove from ground. Remove them straight from the tree. If they don’t come off easily, then wait another one or two weeks.Let them sit for a week to two. Then, soak the seeds in a pail of water for one or two days to remove all pulp.
Fill the bucket with water. The good seeds will sink to the bottom of the pail.
Allow the seeds to dry and store them in a cool, dry place.

, You can try to plant your tree in the fall or summer, but spring is the best time of year for planting. The air is cool and, and the ground is moist in the spring., This tree needs partial or dappled shade. A little shade in the south and full sun in the north is a good position for the tree. The more shade, the more growth, and the poorer the flowering and autumn colors. Trees in the sun are stouter, more like bushes, and produce many more flowers., Root rot is a common problem with dogwood, so be sure to choose a location that drains well and will not waterlog.Dogwoods grow best in soil that is slightly acidic. You can test the soil’s acidity in several, simple ways.
Well-drained soil means that the water infiltrates at a medium rate. Meaning that it is somewhere between draining and running off. You can test this by digging a hole that is 12-18 inches deep and filling the hole with water.
Drainage within 10 minutes means fast drainage.
Drainage that takes an hour means slow drainage., Cut damaged roots off with a sharp knife. Allow the roots to soak for 3 to 4 hours. Your roots should be healthy if bought from a nursery, but some roots may become damaged before planting.Swollen, dark colored, or limp roots need to be cut., Add ¼” of soil over the top of the seeds.

, This is so that the roots have enough room to grow. Only dig deep enough so that the ball slightly protrudes from the hole Sprinkle the seedlings over the soil.Roots should be pointing straight down in the hole, not curled., Fill it with both topsoil and subsoil. Gently mound the soil around the ball. Make sure to not cover the top part of the ball., Three or four inches of mulch is recommended. Make sure to keep the mulch at least a couple of inches from the trunk.Pine straw mulch is good for suppressing weeds. This type of mulch is good for plants that thrive in slightly acidic soil, like the dogwood tree.
Hay mulch is very common and very cheap. Plants typically respond well to hay mulch.

, Water well but don't water log. Flowering dogwood is especially susceptible to drought stresses and having wet roots. Watering to a depth of six inches is recommended., This prevents your tree from being damaged by a lawn mower or anything else that comes too close to it.Place a wire-mesh guard around your tree if it is planted in an area where there are a lot of rodents or deer.

, Trees in full sun need regular irrigation. Those in partial or full shade will draw their own water once established.

, Dogwood blight can be stopped if caught early enough by the removal of diseased wood before dieback starts. These trees don’t need to be pruned often, but check for anything that could prevent growth and promote disease. Make sure to prune in Trees pruned in late winter bleed sap.
Prune and remove all dead twigs, dead limbs, and new shoots.
Rake up and remove fallen leaves.
Remove crowding vegetation and thin the canopy. This will promote air circulation.

, Spread the mulch 10 feet from the trunk. Leave 3 inches around the base to prevent rotting the trunk., If necessary, use an all-purpose fertilizer. You will need one cup of fertilizer for every inch of the trunk’s diameter. Spread the fertilizer around the root area, but don’t put too much around the trunk., Your tree will most likely not need any type of pesticide or pest control. The most common pest is the Dogwood borer. Your tree can be protected by avoiding nicking the bark when pruning."

Take a cutting from a mature forsythia plant.,
Fill a small to medium pot with soil.,
Firmly insert the cutting into the soil.,

Keep the cutting in a warm, sunny location.,
Watch for signs of a failed rooting.,
Keep the forsythia in its pot until ready to transplant.,
Choose a sunny spot in your garden.,
Amend the soil.,
Dig a hole that is roughly the same size as the pot.,
Gently remove the forsythia from its pot.,
Place the roots in the hole.",How to Grow Forsythia1," Most gardeners prefer growing forsythia from cuttings, rather than seed, because forsythia seed is much harder to work with. Look for new, pliable growth and snip off a section that is 3 to 6 inches (7.62 to 15.24 cm) long. This growth can be found easiest during late spring or early summer., Use a well-drained soil blend, like one made with equal parts sterilized garden soil, peat moss, and compost., The bottom inch (2.5 cm) or so should be covered, just enough to keep the cutting upright without support.

, The cutting will not take root if it is allowed to dry out. Keep the soil continually moistened by watering it with a watering can.

, A south-facing window will usually suffice. The plants do best in full sun to light shade.

, Forsythia cuttings are easy to root, but occasionally, something goes wrong to prevent the process from working. If the cutting appears to dry out or look rotted, you may have to start over. The bush should usually take root within a few weeks.

, The best time to transplant forsythia is usually around late autumn or winter, when the plant is dormant. If the shrub threatens to get too large for its container beforehand, though, you can transplant it earlier. You can technically transplant forsythia during any time of the year, even though it does do best when transplanted during the dormant stage.

, This shrub prefers full sun, but it can tolerate some light shade as long as it still receives more sun than shade.

, Loosen it by chopping it up with a trowel or garden fork. Mix a little peat moss and compost into the garden bed to improve its ability to drain and to enrich it.

, You do not want it to be much deeper than that, though, since planting the shrub deeper will cover up too much of the lower stems.

, Tip the pot over to its slide and glide a trowel in between the soil and the side of the pot. Gently pull the shrub out of the pot, moving slowly to keep its roots and the soil it is sitting in intact.

, Pack soil around the forsythia to fix it in place.

"
"
Water the forsythia during periods of drought.,
Fertilizer the plant every year in early spring.,
Prune the shrub aggressively.,
Watch out for pests and disease.",How to Grow Forsythia2," If you have gone a few days to a week without rain, your forsythia could use a drink. Spray it down with a garden hose until the soil feels and looks damp. The shrub does not like frequent drenching, but it can tolerate a little excess water better than it can tolerate a long period of dryness.


Note that extra watering may not be necessary during spring, autumn, and winter, when you are likely to receive precipitation regularly. If you have a particularly dry summer, though, extra watering will likely be needed.







, To promote all around strength, use a light fertilizer with a 10-10-10 formula, meaning that it has equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Alternatively, you can use a 10-20-10 fertilizer, which contains a higher dose of phosphorus, to encourage brighter, more vibrant flowers.

, Forsythia is fast growing, so even if you prune a lot at once, the foliage and blooms grow back quickly. New flowers grow on old growth, rather than new, so you should cut the branches down as soon as the flowers begin to wither. Cut at least 1/3 of the oldest branches down until they are about 4 inches (10 cm) from the ground. Try to prune according to the shrub's natural shape to keep the forsythia looking its best and fullest.

, Forsythia plants are not prone to many problems, but a wayward pest or fungal disease can strike if the conditions are right. Treat the plant with pesticides and fungicides only when needed, however, since you do not need to worry about taking preventative measures.

If you're growing it from seed from an existing plant, sow the seed in autumn provided you're in a cold to cool climate. If you're in a temperate climate, mix the seed with sand and place it into the fridge for two months to chill before planting out. The chilling process promotes germination. (This is also called stratification.);
, This plant spreads and flattens as it grows, so select a broad sized container, preferably with a rounded shape.


Line the base of the container with pebbles or broken pieces of terracotta. Alternatively, use whatever else you normally add to the base of a container for this purpose.

, Ideal potting soil is one that allows for good drainage and has moderate richness. Add a handful of slow-release all-purpose fertiliser.


Water the container thoroughly before planting and allow all of the water to drain through first.

, Be sure that the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil. Firm in with your palms or heels. Water well.

, Keep this up until the tree is well established. Continue to add the all-purpose fertilizer every spring.

, The fir should be re-potted every three to four years to ensure vigorous continued growth.

Plant the crepe myrtle during a dormant season.Early spring is generally considered best, but you can also plant the tree during fall or winter, as long as you live in a region where the winters are mild and the ground does not freeze.,
Choose a sunny location.,
Till the soil.,
Amend the soil.,
Test the pH of the soil.,
Dig a large hole and place the root ball inside.,
Fill the hole in with soil.",How to Grow Crepe Myrtle1,";
, Crepe myrtle needs full sun to thrive, so the location you choose should receive six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day on average.

, These trees grow best in loose, well-drained soil. Clear a spot that is about 3 feet by 3 feet (1 yard by 1 yard). Loosen the soil in that spot by chopping it up with a rake or shovel.

, If you have heavy soil, you may need to mix a little peat moss or garden sand into the soil to improve its drainage properties. You can also mix in compost or a slow-release fertilizer, but if you do, you should make sure to mix the additive thoroughly to the entire plant bed. Uneven pockets of nutrients in the soil can cause the roots to develop poorly.

, Crepe myrtle thrive in soil that is neutral to slightly acidic, about 6.0 to 7.3. If you need to decrease the pH, mix in additional organic matter like compost or manure. If you need to increase the pH, mix in agricultural lime.

, The hole should be twice as wide as the root ball, but it should be about the same depth as the nursery pot holding the plant. Avoid planting the root ball any deeper than that since the soil around the root ball needs to stay oxygenated. For best results, the root ball should be about level with the soil.

, Lightly pack the soil around the base of the tree. The soil should be heavy and packed enough to help hold the young tree in place, but it should still be fairly loose to allow the roots room to grow.

"
"
Add mulch around the trunk of the tree.,
Water as needed.,
Apply fertilizer once a year.,
Prune the tree during late winter.,
Watch out for common diseases.",How to Grow Crepe Myrtle2," Apply 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 12.7 cm) of wood mulch around the tree to help retain moisture and to discourage the growth of nutrient-robbing weeds. Keep a little space in between the trunk of the tree and the mulch, though, to prevent the trunk from rotting.


Reapply at least 2 inches (5 cm) of mulch each spring., The tree should be thoroughly drenched immediately after planting. Young crepe myrtle should be watered at least once a week during dormancy and five times a week during hot weather. This water regiment should continue for the first two months. Afterward, only water during periods of drought.

, Use a slow-release fertilizer that is high in nitrogen and apply it during the early spring, once leaves develop. A second fertilization is optional and can be done two months after the first, using the same type of fertilizer.

, Since the plant bloom on new growth, pruning the plant during winter, before new growth begins, will ensure that summer blooming will not be negatively impacted. Only light pruning is necessary.Remove basal shoots (buds that grow at the base of the tree), twiggy growth, intertwining branches, and branches growing inward toward the center of the plant.
Cut away side branches along the bottom 4 to 5 feet (1.22 to 1.52 meters) of the tree, exposing the trunk.
Snip off dead or dying flowers throughout the growing season to encourage a second blooming.

, Crepe myrtle is commonly affected by several diseases.Black mold appears as a sooty black coating on the leaves of the tree. It grows on the sticky dew left behind by aphids and similar pests. Get rid of the aphids with an insecticidal soap, and the mold should disappear.
Powdery mildew is a fungus that develops on leaves and flower buds. It can be prevented and treated by spraying the tree with a fungicide.
Leaf spot appears in the form of dark brown spots on the leaves of the tree. The affected leaves then yellow and drop. Leaf spot is another fungus and can be treated with a fungicide.

Prune damaged branches.",How to Grow Crabapple Trees," Place a handful of crabapple seeds in a pot or other gardening container. Add two to three handfuls of peat-free compost to the container, and combine the two fully.You can substitute leaf mold compost if you prefer.;
, Once the seeds and compost are mixed, add some water to the mixture to moisten it. You want to add just enough that when you squeeze a handful of the seed mixture, only a couple of drops of water emerge.








If you add too much water to the mixture, mix in a little more of the compost to help dry it out.

, When the seed mixture is properly moistened, transfer it from the pot to a plastic bag. Tie the top of the bag loosely in a knot to close it.







, Once the seed mixture is sealed in the plastic bag, set it in the refrigerator. The vegetable crisper drawer is an ideal spot to store the seed mixture. Don’t keep it in the freezer. Allow the mixture to chill for approximately 12 to 14 weeks, or until the seeds begin to sprout.Chilling the seed mixture in the refrigerator for several months helps expose them to cool and moist conditions so they can effectively germinate.
At the 10 week mark, check the seeds regularly for signs of growth. If they’ve begun to sprout, it’s time to plant them.
Ideally, you should time the seed preparation process so the seeds are sprouting and ready to plant in early spring or fall.

, When you’re planting crabapple trees, finding the right location is key. They require a site that provides full sun, so avoid shady spots. In addition, the area should have well-drained soil so the roots don’t become soggy.You can tell if soil is well-drained by digging a hole approximately 12- to 18-inches (30- to 46-cm) deep and wide and filling it with water. If the water drains in 10 minutes or less, you have soil that drains well. If it takes an hour or longer, the soil drains poorly.

, Once you’ve found the right spot to plant the crabapple trees, rake the area to create small furrows in the soil. Carefully sprinkle the prepared seeds in a thin layer over the area, so they fall into the furrows.







, After you’ve spread the seeds over the area, run an empty seed roller tool over the spot. That will press the seeds into the soil to increase the likelihood of effective germination.








You can usually rent a seed roller tool from your local home improvement center or garden supply center.
If you don’t have a roller tool, you can press the seeds into the soil with a board.

, After the seeds are pressed into the soil, sprinkle a layer of horticultural grit over them. Aim for ⅕- to ⅖-inch (5- to 10-mm) layer over the seeds.Horticultural grit is a sand-based soil amendment that helps improve soil structure and drainage by creating pockets that hold water and air. It is sometimes sold as soil cover or washed sand.

, When you’ve covered the seeds with grit, use a watering can to water the area. The soil should be moist, but without any standing puddles on the surface.







, A crabapple tree requires regular direct sunlight, so choose a location for it that doesn’t have much shade. Next, make sure that area has well-drained soil to keep the tree’s roots healthy.Check to see if your soil drains well by digging a hole that's between 12- to 18-inches (30- to 46-cm) deep and wide. Fill the hole with water, and observe how long it takes to drain. If it drains in 10 minutes or less, the soil drains well. If the water drains in an hour or longer, the soil doesn't drain well.

, Before you plant a young crabapple tree, it’s important to make sure that the spot is free of debris. Remove any rocks, weeds, or other items that might interfere with the tree’s growth.







, Examine the tree’s root ball before you plant it. Use a shovel to create a hole in your chosen location that’s as deep as the root ball but two to three times as wide.When you set the tree in the hole, the top of the root crown should be level with or just slightly above the soil.
If you are planting more than one crabapple tree, space them at least 10- to 20-feet (3- to 6-meters) apart.

, If the soil in your chosen area isn’t in very good condition, it’s a good idea to add some type of amendment to it. Add a small amount of compost to the soil that you’ve removed from the hole to create a healthy mixture for surrounding the tree.If the soil that you’re planting in is in good condition, there’s no need to add compost.

, Lift the tree out of its container and place it in the hole that you’ve dug. Fill in the hole approximately halfway with the soil, and then water the hole well to help settle the soil.







, Let the tree sit for several minutes until the water drains completely down into the soil. Next, fill the hole in the rest of the way with the soil so it completely surrounds the base of the tree.








Don’t compact the soil around the tree too tightly.

, To keep the tree growing healthy, spread a layer of compost beneath it each spring. Extend it out to the dipline, or the area under the tree’s outer branches. Next, apply a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of mulch to help the soil maintain its moisture and prevent weeds from growing.Keep the mulch 3- to 4-inch (7.5- to 10-cm) away from the tree trunk so the roots don’t become soggy.

, In warm weather, crab apple trees require regular watering if the rainfall is less than 1-inch (2.5-cm) a week. Provide 1- to 2-inches (2.5- to 5-cm) of water once a week during its first year. It’s best to avoid watering the tree later in the day when the temperature is cooler, though, because it may lead to mildew.








After the first year, a crabapple tree doesn't usually require watering unless you're experiencing drought conditions.
Check the soil beneath the tree regularly to ensure that it's moist. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water it.

, To prevent disease and other issues, you should remove dead, broken, or diseased branches in late winter. Use a pair of sharp garden shears to prune away the problem branches so your tree continues its healthy growth.








Thick branches may require a saw for pruning.

Plant the bougainvillea.",How to Grow Bougainvillea1," Bougainvillea thrives in places that are hot and relatively dry. If you want to keep bougainvillea outdoors all year long, it's best to be in hardiness zone 9 or higher. If you're in a colder, wetter zone, you can still grow bougainvillea if you plant it in a pot and bring it indoors for the winter.


Bougainvillea do best when night temperature don't drop below 60 °F (16 °C) and daytime temperatures don't exceed 100 °F (38 °C).
Bougainvillea can be wintered over in the basement or another low light area.;
, Bougainvillea is a sun-lover and it will grow best in a full sun position, in the open, facing due North (in the southern hemisphere) and due South (in the northern hemisphere). Bougainvillea needs at least 5 hours of full sun every day to thrive.








, Bougainvillea won't do well in soil that retains too much water, so make sure the soil drains quite well. They need rich soil that is slightly acidic, with pH between 5.5 and 6.0.









Add limestone to the soil to increase the pH or sulphur to decrease the pH as necessary.
If you're planting the bougainvillea in a pot, choose a soil mix with the appropriate pH level.

, Dig a hole as deep as the bougainvillea plant's root ball. Add a high-phosphate fertilizer to the hole to promote root growth and help the flowers bloom. Lift the bougainvillea plant from its container and wet the root ball into the hole. Lightly pat the soil around the base of the plant.


If you want the bougainvillea to climb a trellis or wall, be sure to plant it near the structure. As it grows, you'll need to ""train"" it to climb the structure by wrapping it gently around the base.
If you're planting the bougainvillea in a container, make sure to choose one with plenty of drainage holes, since bougainvillea hate to have ""wet feet.""

"
"
Water sparingly.,
Fertilize regularly.,
Bring bougainvillea indoors for the winter.,
Prune the bougainvillea.,
Train the bougainvillea.",How to Grow Bougainvillea2," Bougainvillea plants weaken with too much watering, ending up with all leaf growth in place of flowers. On the other hand, letting the soil dry out will cause the plant to get stressed out. Find a happy medium - water enough to keep the soil damp, but not so much that you leave the plant waterlogged.








, Feed the plant a fertilizer every few months to keep the flowers blooming. Fertilizing too frequently can cause the plant to grow quite vigorously, so if you find that it's getting too large, cut back on fertilizer.


Most bougainvillea gardeners go with a 1:1:1 or a 2:1:2 fertilizer for regular fertilizing, not the high-phosphate fertilizer used at planting. Organic or slow-release fertilizers work best.Be sure to fertilize at least once a year, at the beginning of spring, to help the season's growth get underway.

, If you live in a climate that gets cold in the winter, and you planted your bougainvillea in a pot, bring it inside for the winter. If you leave it outside it will not survive the harsh weather.







, Bougainvillea plants are prolific growers and need good pruning to force blooming and retain a pretty shape. After the bougainvillea has finished blooming for the season, cut it back by a few inches. This will promote healthy growth in the spring.








Wear gloves when pruning bougainvillea. Some people can get a skin rash from pruning bougainvillea, similar to that from poison ivy.

, Bougainvillea plants need support to cover a wall, fence, or other area. If you'd like the plant to grow in a certain vertical spot, you can hang rows of wire or string against the surface that you want covered. Tuck the bougainvillea branches behind these guidance supports at regular intervals. Keep a close eye on growth and adjust as necessary until the bougainvillea starts covering the wall or other surface.

Consult a gardening resource for a comprehensive list of acid-loving plants.",How to Lower Soil pH," Before adding anything to alter the soil pH, always make sure to test your soil to see how far it is from your goal pH. You can purchase a test at your local home/garden center or take a sample to your county extension office for professional testing.
, The pH of your garden soil is easy to determine with a commercial pH testing kit. These are usually sold at hardware stores or garden supply stores and are fairly inexpensive. To begin, you'll want to take a sample from the area you want to test. Dig five small holes (about six to eight inches deep). Select random locations within the plot — this way, you'll get a sense of the ""average"" pH of your soil.Don't keep any of the dirt from creating the holes.


Note that the instructions in this section are generalized — you should use the instructions included with your specific pH testing kit.

, Next, use your shovel or spade to take a narrow ""slice"" from the side of each hole. This slice should be crescent-shaped and about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. Try to make your sample about the same size for each hole. Add your samples to a single clean, dry bucket.


Try to gather enough dirt in each sample that you have about a pint (0.94 liters) or more in total. For most methods of testing, this is plenty.

, Allow your soil to dry until you can no longer detect moisture.


It's important to make sure your soil is completely dry before proceeding — moisture can cause an inaccurate pH reading., Depending on the type of kit you have, the method will vary. For many of the most common test kits, you'll put a small amount of your soil in an included test tube, add a few drops of liquid solution, mix by shaking, and allow the mixture to settle for a few hours.Eventually, the color of the solution should change — by comparing the color of the solution to a chart provided with the kit, you can determine the pH of your soil.


Other types of kits exist as well, so be sure to use the instructions provided with your kit. For instance, some modern electronic testing kits determine a soil pH almost instantaneously via a metal probe. You can also collect a sample and take it into your county extension office for a free soil test.

, Many types of organic matter, like compost, composted manure, and acidic mulches (e.g. pine needles) can gradually lower your soil pH over time.As organic matter decomposes, bacteria and other microbes grow and feed upon it, creating acidic by-products in the process. Because organic matter needs time to decompose to alter the soil, this option is great for long-term goals, but won't give you dramatic results in the short-term. Many gardeners opt to add organic matter to their soil annually for a gradual, mild pH-lowering effect. However, this will not work for heavy clay soils.


Organic matter can also give your soil other benefits — most noticeably, improving its drainage and aeration., For rapid pH-lowering, don't rely on the slow, gradual decay of organic matter. Instead, use one of the many acidic soil additives available at your local garden supply store. Of these additives, aluminum sulfate, is one of the quickest-acting options available. Aluminum sulfate produces acidity in the soil as soon as it dissolves, which, for gardening purposes, means that it basically works instantly.Because of this, aluminum sulfate is a great choice for urgent pH lowering.


Depending on the starting pH of your soil, the amount of aluminum sulfate you should use can vary significantly. In very general terms, you should expect to use about 1.2 pounds of aluminum sulfate to lower the pH of a 10-square foot patch of soil by one on the pH scale (e.g., from 7.0 to 6.0, from 6.0 to 5.0, etc.).However, using too much additive can be harmful to your plant, so consult an online resource (like the one here) for more precise usage information.
Do not use aluminum sulfate for large applications because it can lead to aluminum accumulation and aluminum toxicity in soil., Another useful pH-lowering soil additive is sublimed sulfur. Compared to aluminum sulfate, sulfur is generally cheaper, more powerful (in terms of the amount needed) and slower-acting. This is because sulfur needs to be metabolized by bacteria in the soil to be converted to sulfuric acid, which takes time.Depending on the moisture of the soil, the amount of bacteria present, and the temperature, sulfur can take up to several months to produce a noticeable effect in the soil.


As noted above, compared to aluminum sulfate, you will generally need a relatively small amount of pure, sublimed sulfur to produce an equivalent pH change. In general, you'll need about 0.2 pounds of sulfur to lower the pH of a 10-square foot patch of soil by one whole number on the pH scale.Consult an online resource (like the one here) for more precise usage information.

, Like sulfur and aluminum sulfate, soil additives containing sulfur-coated urea can increase the acidity of soil over time (lowering its pH). As an additive, urea is fairly quick-acting, producing some effects as soon as a week or two after being introduced to the soil.Sulfur-coated urea is a common ingredient in many fertilizers, so if you were already planning on fertilizing your plants, you may want to save yourself the trouble of finding a separate soil additive by simply picking a fertilizer containing this type of urea.


Sulfur-coated urea content will vary from fertilizer to fertilizer, so consult the instructions that come with your fertilizer to determine the right amount to use for your gardening needs.
Sulfur-coated urea is a slow-release fertilizer that doses nutrients out slowly as your plants need them, rather than distributing them all at once.

, Besides the additives listed above, many other substances can lower soil pH. Many of these substances are often included in certain fertilizer mixes, while others are sold on their own. The time and amount needed can vary greatly for each, so consult the additive packaging or talk to an experienced employee at the gardening supply store. Additives that can lower your soil pH:Diammonium phosphate
Ferric sulfate
Peat
Ammonium nitrate

, If your soil is too alkaline (basic) to grow plants which require acidic soil, raising alkaline-loving plants can gradually lower the pH of your soil over the life of the plant. As the plant grows, matures, and decays, the organic matter that returns to the soil will promote the growth of bacteria and gradually lower the pH level of the soil (similar to how adding organic matter in the form of mulch or manure). This method is generally one of the slowest ways to lower your soil pH, as the plant must grow to begin depositing organic matter in the soil. A few examples of alkaline-tolerant plants:Certain evergreen shrubs (e.g., boxwoods, California lilacs)
Certain deciduous shrubs (e.g., lilacs, mock oranges, Forsythia species)
Certain perennials (e.g., picks, hellebores)

, Certain types of flowering shrubs, like rhododendron and azalea plants, require fairly acidic soil to grow properly. These plants are often native to areas with a high amount of rainfall, like the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (frequent rainfall generally lowers soil pH).For these types of shrubs, a pH range of about 4.5 - 5.5 is optimal. However, pH levels as high as 6.0 are usually acceptable., Many brightly-colored flowers, like petunias and begonias, grow best in acidic soils. For some of these flowers, changing a soil acidity from slightly acidic to very acidic can produce a visible change in the bloom color. For instance, growing a hydrangea in soil with a pH level of about 6.0 - 6.2 will produce a plant with pink flowers, while lowering the pH level to about 5.2 - 5.5 will produce a plant with purple/blue flowers.The blue color of low-pH hydrangeas comes from the chemical aluminum. When the pH of the soil is low, it's easier for the hydrangea to absorb aluminum from the soil, which shows in the flower petals., Many needled evergreen trees grow in slightly acidic soil. For instance, spruces, firs, and pines all thrive in soils with a pH level of about 5.5 - 6.0. In addition, the needles of these types of trees can be introduced to neutral or alkaline soil as organic matter which lowers soil pH as the needles decay.

, Perhaps the most well-known acid-loving plant is the blueberry, which thrives in highly acidic soils (generally about 4.0 - 5.0 is ideal). However, several other species of berry also favor acidic soil. For instance, cranberries grow best at a level of about 4.2 - 5.0, while gooseberries, currants, and elderberries grow best at a level of about 5.5 - 6.5., Most varieties of garden ferns prefer soil pH levels below 7.0 — even those that prefer alkaline soils can usually tolerate slightly acidic soils. For instance, Maidenhair Ferns prefer soil pHs of about 7.0 - 8.0 but can grow even in soils with levels of about 6.0.Some ferns can even tolerate soils with a pH as low as 4.0., The number of plants that survive or thrive in low pH soils is too great to list in this article. For more information, you may want to consult a comprehensive botanical resource. You can usually find these at gardening stores or specialty book stores, though many are also available. For instance, the official site of The Old Farmer's Almanac contains a table listing the pH preferences of many different types of plants (you can access it here).

If possible, consider planting the tree at the top of a slight slope, as well. Doing so can help drain excess water and prevent the roots from getting soggy. Never plant chestnuts at the bottom of a slope.;
, The best soil for chestnut trees be well-draining and slightly acidic.


Chestnut trees thrive in deep, sandy loam soils. Soils that contain rocks and gravel are also acceptable.Avoid heavy clay soils. The only way a chestnut tree can survive in a clay soil is if it is planted at the top of a downward slope.
Ideally, the soil should have a pH between 4.5 and 6.5. Avoid limestone soils, since the pH is often too alkaline for a chestnut tree to survive.

, Make sure that each chestnut tree you plant has 40 feet (12.2 m) (12 m) of free soil space in all directions to allow for adequate growing room.


If you want to rush large harvests of chestnuts, you can plant multiple chestnut trees at half that distance, roughly 20 feet (6 m) (6 m) apart, so that they start to crowd each other out and pollinate quicker.

, A single chestnut tree on its own will never produce any chestnuts. If you want the tree to produce nuts, there needs to be a second tree within 200 feet (60 m).


Plant two different chestnut varieties to promote cross-pollination.
Check around with your neighbors. If a next-door neighbor has a chestnut tree growing in their yard, that might be sufficient for yours.

, Place the seed nut in a plastic bag packed with damp sphagnum moss, peat moss, or sawdust. Seal the bag, then place it in your refrigerator for several months.Chestnut seeds are actually just normal, untreated chestnuts.
Seed nuts need to undergo a period of chilling to germinate properly. Storing them in the refrigerator mimics the natural process while protecting them against the harsh freezes and animals found outdoors.
For best results, place the chestnuts in a vegetable crisper to prevent them from accidentally freezing.
The chestnuts should be stored in the refrigerator for several months, from harvest to planting.

, Once the weather has warmed, you can directly sow the chilled seed nuts outdoors.


The best time to plant is early spring, usually around mid-March. You can sow the seed as soon as the soil is soft and warm enough to work in.

, Chestnuts usually begin to develop roots in early to mid February. If you want to give the tree a head start, you can plant the seed early indoors once these roots poke through.


Poke a few drainage holes in the bottom of a half-gallon (2 L) cardboard milk carton. Cut the top off the carton, as well.
Fill the carton with soil-free potting mix. The ideal growing medium should contain large quantities of organic fibrous material. Mixes that contain composted bark are especially good.
After planting the seed, place the container in a sunny windowsill. Water the potting medium when it feels dry. A sturdy seedling should grow from the nut within two or three months.
Note that seeds germinated indoors should be treated as seedlings and, as such, transplanted outdoors during the spring according to the guidelines marked in the ""Starting from Seedlings"" section.

, Dig a hole roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. Place the chestnut seed in the hole and cover loosely with additional soil or planting mix.


Since most chestnuts will have sprouted before you plant them, make sure that the sprout is face-down when you plant the nut.
If the seed has not sprouted yet, place it in the soil with the flat side of the seed facing downward.

, After planting the seed outdoors, cover the area above it with a wire screen or basket. Doing so will protect the seed from most rodents.


Make sure that the top of the wire cage extends above the ground 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm). This will give the seedling a chance to grow and establish itself before the screen has to be removed.
Note that you do not need to cover the seed if you are starting it indoors.

, The hole should be deep enough so that the established roots can fit inside without being folded.


The hole should be at least two times as large as the root ball of the seedling you want to plant.
It is also recommended that you aerate the sides of the planting hole with a rake, garden fork, hand-held cultivator, or hand-held plow before placing the root ball inside.

, Carefully remove the seedling from its container and find the old nutshell clinging to the roots. Use your fingers to gently twist or break it off without damaging the roots.


Many animals will be attracted to the scent of the nutshell and may dig up you seedling trees looking for that shell. Removing the shell makes your tree less of a target.

, Center the root ball of the seedling inside the hole. Backfill the hole with garden soil or planting mix until the tree is secure and no longer able to move around.


Pack the soil in with your hands and feet to further secure the tree.
Water the soil well after you plant the tree. Water helps the soil settle and removes any air pockets that were otherwise trapped inside the packed growing medium.

, Protect seedlings from rodents by surrounding them with 1/4-inch (6-mm) hard-ward cloth.


Sink the hardware cloth 2 to 4 inches (4 to 10 cm) into the ground. Keep at least 18 inches (46 cm) above the ground.
If deer are a problem, this cylinder of hardware cloth may need to extend as high as 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m).

, During its first month or two, the chestnut tree will need 1 gallon (3.8 L) (4 L) of water each week.After the first month or two, you should still make sure that the tree receives 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water each week during the growing season. You do not need to water the tree when it loses its leaves and becomes dormant.

, Weeds and grasses should be kept at least 2 feet (0.61 m) (61 cm) away from new seedlings. For established trees, keep the ground bare all the way out to the ends of the tree's branches.


The best way to do this is by applying organic mulch around the tree. Mulch also helps the soil retain moisture.
An herbicide can be used to get rid of weeds, as well, but you need to protect the trunk of the tree before you apply an herbicide to the area.

, You can apply fertilizer to the tree on a yearly basis starting its second year outdoors.


Do not fertilize the seedling when you plant it. Doing so will encourage leaf production, but the tree needs to focus its efforts on root production during this time.
Use a standard fertilizer containing balanced amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (usually labeled as 10-10-10 fertilizer).

, During the tree's first two or three years, you should train it to follow a modified central leader form.Pick a sturdy central, upright stem. This will be the tree's central leader.
Pinch back, bend down, or cut off any other stems that compete with your chosen leader.
Major scaffold limbs growing off your main stem should be spaced 1 foot (0.30 m) (30.5 cm) apart along the central leader, growing in a spiral rotation.
After the tree establishes itself, trim the limbs so that the lowest still gives you enough room to mow under the tree.
When the central leader reaches 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) high, cut it down so that it is as short as a side branch. This will allow the tree to grow wider instead of higher.

, Chestnut blight is the only major disease you will need to worry about, but it can present a significant threat.


The fungus gathers around the trunk of the tree, fixating mostly on areas that are cracked or wounded. It eventually develops into a large canker. When the canker wraps all the way around the tree, the tree itself will die. You will need to completely remove the tree and plant any future chestnut trees in a different location.
Chestnut blight is almost impossible to treat once it infects a tree, even if you use a strong fungicide. Prevention is your best option. Plant blight-resistant chestnut tree varieties and make sure that the roots are never allowed to sit in soggy, overly-wet conditions.

, There are several different insect pests that may attack your tree, but the biggest problem is usually the chestnut weevil.Adult weevils lay eggs in developing nuts. When the eggs hatch, the larvae consumes the meat inside of the nut.
Get rid of the weevils before they become a problem by spraying the tree with an insecticide once nut burs begin to develop.
Alternatively, you can lay a sheet beneath the tree and give the branches a sturdy shake. Most of the weevils should fall off. You can then collect them in the sheet and dispose of it.
You need to kill the adult weevils before they can lay eggs. There is no way to remove the pests once they find their way into the nuts.

, Chestnut trees don't produce any nuts during their first few years. If there is at least one other chestnut tree nearby and the trees remain healthy during these years, they should eventually produce nuts.


Chinese chestnut trees usually produce nuts after five years.
American chestnut trees usually produce nuts after eight years.

, Chestnuts usually ripen around early October and drop off the burs they grow on once the weather cools.


You can usually harvest the nuts by simply collecting them off the ground as they fall.
If animals tend to grab the fallen nuts before you can, another option is to cut off the burs before the nuts drop. Carefully cut the unopened burs during early to mid October and keep them in a root cellar or similarly cool place. Once the burs naturally open, you can collect the nuts.
Wear heavy rubber gloves when handling the nuts and burs to prevent yourself from getting scratched or pricked.

, If you want to use the nuts for culinary purposes, keep them in their shells and store in the refrigerator for one month. You can also keep the nuts in a freezer for roughly six months.


Chestnuts have a high starch content and do not store as well or as long as many other nuts.
After cooking the chestnuts, you can only store them in the refrigerator for three or four days. If placed in an airtight container and stored in the freezer, however, cooked chestnuts remain edible for up to nine months.

, If you want to treat the nuts as seeds instead of food, you should let them dry in a cool, open space for several days before storing them in a refrigerator.


Place the chestnuts in a plastic bag filled with slightly damp sphagnum moss, peat moss, or sawdust. Seal the bag with a twist-tie and store it in your refrigerator.

Mist your succulents gently every 2-4 days.,
Create a schedule, then be sure to follow it.,
Soak the soil completely using a watering can.,
Wait until the soil is completely dry to soak the soil again.,
Skip watering periodically to encourage a robust root system.,
Identify the signs of underwatering.,
Gently mist your succulents for 1-5 days.,
Increase their water intake gradually.",How to Water Succulents," Although you should usually wait 2-4 days to mist them again, this may be different for each succulent. If you're not sure how often to mist yours, a good rule of thumb is to wait until the soil is dry to mist it again.
, When the succulents are young it is critical to stick to a strict misting schedule., This practice establishes a healthy root system., There is no standard answer to how often to water mature succulents. This will depend on the plant variety, the soil, the ambient humidity, and other factors. Generally, you should water more often in the summer when the plant is actively growing than in the winter when the plant goes into semi-dormancy with shorter days., Sometimes it is beneficial to skip watering for 1-2 days to allow even stronger roots to grow. Contrary to popular belief, you don't always have to stick to the same watering schedule for mature succulents. Still, it is good to have a general schedule., Your succulents are probably under-watered if:

the upper leaves are becoming dry and crispy
the entire plant has become shriveled (although it is difficult to revive it at this point)
many leaves are shriveling at the tips

, This will help transition them to a regular watering routine. Giving them a 'full dose' of water after a long period of time without water might damage the plants., After they have gotten used to the change, gradually return to their regular watering schedule. You can then water them with a watering can, and they should be back to normal in 1-3 weeks!"

Obtain the plant.",How to Grow Cape Plumbago1," Either ask for the cape plumbago from your local nursery or garden center, or get a cutting from someone you know is growing it.

If propagating the plant, use semi-ripe cuttings obtained during summer.;
"
"
Select a suitable place for growing the plant.,
Mulch the surface after planting.",How to Grow Cape Plumbago2," Cape plumbago likes moderately rich soil. It must be well-drained soil, as the plant does not like wet roots.

It is recommended that well-rotted manure is added to the soil to enhance it.

, Whether you're planting in a garden bed or in a container, mulch will help retain the moisture and reduce the growth of weeds."
"
Keep well watered during the warmer months.,
Fertilize.,
Expect flowering in late spring and well into summer.,
Prune.",How to Grow Cape Plumbago3," Do not allow the soil to dry out, as the plant cannot tolerate dry soil., Apply all-purpose, slow release fertilizer in early spring. This will encourage flowering., Provided the soil is right and the plant has adequate fertilizer, this plant will flower prolifically.

Flowering occurs for long periods.
Flowers appear in clusters. Many are blue, while others are white, depending on the variety planted.

, Early spring is the time to prune back cape plumbago. Remove the growth from the previous year, to encourage new growth in the next season.

If not pruned, the plant can get quite out of control. Expect a healthy bush to reach about 3 meters or 10 feet in height.
Container plants must be pruned regularly to keep a neat and pleasant shape.

Keep succulent seedlings well watered.,
Mist spray.,
Keep the ventilation a top priority.,
Move the seedlings once they are large enough to handle.,
Continue watering and tending.",How to Take Care of Succulent Seedlings," Their root system is close to the soil surface during the first months of growth, meaning that they dry out very quickly.;
, Do this in the evenings to replicate the environment that a succulent would be used to growing in outdoors. Mist spray is absorbed well by succulents.

, If there is too much moisture and inadequate ventilation, there is a risk of fungal growth.

, Transplant outdoors to fresh seedling trays or into large pots for continued growth, to encourage the setting of deeper roots. On transplanting, keep the plant in a warm place for 48 hours and withhold any watering during this time. The 48 hour break gives the rootstock a chance to recover from being moved.

, As the succulent grows larger, it will need less tending and less watering. Plant in the garden bed when it is larger, if wished.

, If the plants are already growing and have developed chlorosis or yellow foliage, the pH should be checked and adjusted immediately.

, Chlorosis can be caused by a variety of things including too little or too much direct sunlight, herbicides, insect infestation and unusually extreme temperatures but it is most often caused by a deficiency in iron.Even if the sufficient iron is present in the soil, which it usually is, if the pH is too high the plant is unable to absorb it.


Chlorosis is indicated by leaves that become pale green or yellow. When the pH is not adjusted immediately, the foliage dies, branches become stunted and flowering plants may not bloom.

, To determine if the soil is acidic, neutral or alkaline, a quick test can be done before purchasing a soil pH test kit.Take 1 tablespoon of soil from the garden and let it dry.


Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a pan with a lid. Put 2 cups of chopped red cabbage into the boiling water, cover the pan and let it continue to boil until the water changes to dark purple.

, Let the water cool. Measure 2 tablespoons of the purple water into a white saucer along with 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda.


Stir the baking soda into the water until it changes color.

, It should be blue or green, indicating that the water is alkaline. Use a dropper to add clear vinegar to the water one drop at a time until the water changes color again.


It should be red, indicating the water is acidic.

, Use the dropper to add enough purple cabbage water to thoroughly wet the soil. Tip the saucer from side to side for one minute. Hold the saucer at an angle so the water runs to the side of the soil and note the color of the water.


Blue or green, the same color as the test sample after baking soda was added, means the soil is too alkaline for most plants.
Red, the color of the test sample after adding vinegar, means the soil is too acidic.
If the color of the water drained from the soil is purple or purple-blue, it means the soil pH is neutral to slightly acidic which is ideal for most plants.

, The soil sample collected for testing with the pH test kit should not be taken from the top because the roots of most plants are at least 2 to 4 inches below the top of the soil. The pH may be slightly different at the top so the sample should be taken from where the roots of the plant will be absorbing moisture and nutrients.


Soil samples from areas where grass and annuals will grow should be collected from 2 to 3 inches deep.
Soil samples for shrubs, trees and perennial plants should be collected from 4 inches deep.

, Human hands can alter the soil sample pH. Use a hand trowel or dirt shovel to dig away the top 2 to 4 inches of soil.


Collect 1 to 2 tablespoons of test sample soil, remove any pebbles or debris and place the soil in a clean bowl to dry overnight.

, After the sample dries, crush it up by hand or with the back of a spoon until it is loose and fine-textured.

, If the pH needs to be checked in different gardens in the yard, take a sample from each garden. The pH can be different in one part of the yard than it is in another. This is especially true of soil along a house foundation where lime tends to leach into the soil from the concrete and raise the pH.

, Fill it only to the soil line indicated on the test chamber. Pour the test powder over the soil.

, Fill it only to the water fill line indicated on the test chamber. Place the cap on the test chamber. Make sure it is tightly sealed.


Shake the test chamber vigorously to thoroughly mix the soil, powder and water.

, Hold the pH chart provided in the kit up next to the test chamber to determine the soil pH.


Do the comparison in bright indirect light to get the most accurate reading. Direct sunlight can make the solution appear slightly lighter.

, However, you should collect 1 whole cup rather than a couple tablespoons. Allow the soil to dry and crush it up. Pour the soil into a large, clean container with a lid that seals tightly.

, Shake or stir it vigorously for a minimum of one minute. Let the soil and water mixture sit undisturbed for up to 24 hours until the soil settles to the bottom.

, Fill it only to the water fill line on the chamber.


Use only the water without disturbing the soil at the bottom of the container.

, There will be a different chemical for nitrogen, phosphorous and potash.


For example, the chemical used to test for nitrogen may be purple, the chemical for phosphorus may be blue and the chemical for potash may be orange.

, Let it sit for 10 minutes to allow the color to develop. Check it against the chart in bright indirect sunlight to determine nutrient levels.

, Thoroughly wash and rinse the test chamber between tests. If the test indicates that one of these nutrients is high or already at acceptable levels, use a fertilizer that does not contain that nutrient.

, Fertilizers list the ratio of nutrients as Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Potash or N-P-K. If nitrogen levels in the soil are at an acceptable level, use fertilizer with a ratio of 0-10-10 or something similar.


When plants get excessive amounts of nitrogen, they will either grow excessive amounts of stems and foliage or the roots could be burned.If it is a flowering plant, it will put on lush new foliage but may not bloom. If nitrogen levels are low but phosphorus and potash levels are acceptable or high, use fertilizer with a ratio of 10-0-0. Phosphorus helps plants bloom and potash helps them develop strong stems and improves their ability to absorb and utilize sunlight.

, Digital soil analyzers make testing your soil a little easier. They are available at garden centers and online.

, Loosen the next 5 inches of soil with a shovel and pick out any hard clumps of soil, stones, sticks or other debris.


Pour distilled water over the soil until it is muddy and pack it down by hand to remove any air pockets.

, Polish the analyzer probe with the polishing cloth provided the analyzer, running the cloth from the tip to the meter then wipe it again with a cotton ball to remove any dirt or residue.


Do not polish or wipe the tip of the probe.

, Use the arrow button on the analyzer to select “pH” or “Fertility,” depending on what you are testing. Insert the probe 4 to 5 inches deep into the wet soil. If it does not slide in easily, pull it out and insert it in a different spot.


Do not force it into the soil as this could damage the probe.

, Wait sixty seconds, pull the probe out of the soil and check the digital read-out on the meter.


If the read-out is 7 or above, wipe the soil off the probe with a cotton ball and repeat the test, inserting the probe in a different spot in the mud and leaving it in for 30 seconds.
If the initial read-out is below 7, wipe off the soil and repeat the test, leaving the probe in for 60 seconds. The digital read-out from the second test is the actual pH or fertility of the soil.

Young plants may need more phosphorus to focus on leaf growth, and plants typically need much less of these nutrients outside of the growing season. For best results, look up the specific plants you are growing to find out their needs. This is usually given as three ""NPK"" numbers, telling you the ratio or total amounts of these nutrients in that order.


If you want a detailed report on the nutrients already in your soil, send soil samples to your local extension office or soil-testing laboratory. This is not necessary for most home gardens, unless your plants are suffering from slow growth or color changes.;
, Plant and animal matter such as fish emulsion or fish hydrolysate provides the best type of fertilizer for long-term microbial growth, which keeps soil nutrient-rich and porous. Fertilizers synthesized in laboratories typically feed the plant without improving the soil, and in some cases may even have negative effects.


Always protect the hands and face when working with soil additives, as these can contain some bacteria and other health threats.

, Instead of a manufactured fertilizer, you may be able to find cheaper, unrefined options from a garden supply store or farm. Manure can add nutrients as well as organic matter that will break down and improve the condition of the soil. Here are a few common options:


Manure should be left to decompose for at least a month before use, to avoid damaging plants. Ask if the farmer is using herbicides on their pasture land. You want to avoid manure from that source, as the herbicide will be present in the manure. Chicken or turkey manure is cheap, but can cause runoff issues in large fields. Cow, sheep, goat, and rabbit manure are higher quality and have a less pungent smell.
Add bone meal for phosphorus, or blood meal for nitrogen.

, New compost typically takes four to eight months to mature, unless you speed up the process with special bacterial additions. This long term project will greatly benefit both soil texture and nutrients, if you're willing to keep up the process. Set aside a large outdoor container, tightly closed to protect it from animals, but with holes for air flow. Care for it with these techniques:


Begin with about 20% soil, manure, or mature compost; 10 to 30% raw, plant-derived food scraps; and 50 to 70% dry leaves, grass, and yard clippings. Mix these together thoroughly.
Keep the compost warm and wet, and throw in raw, non-meat food products from kitchen scraps.
Turn the compost with a pitchfork or shovel at least once every week or two, to introduce oxygen that encourages beneficial bacteria.
Search for worms in moist areas underneath rocks, and add them to the compost bin.
The compost is mature (ready to use) when it clumps together when squeezed, but can easily be broken apart. Plant fibers should still be visible, but the compost should be mostly homogeneous.
Try sifting your compost. Compost that falls through the sieve is ready to use. Return larger chunks back to the compost bin.

, Whether they use solid fertilizer, rotted manure, or compost, most gardeners mix the addition thoroughly into the soil. Many crops do well with a 30% compost, 70% soil mix, but vegetables and fruits often do better with lower amounts of compost. Fertilizer amounts vary greatly depending on the concentration; follow the instructions for your particular plant.


The ""no-till"" or ""no-dig"" gardening movement advocates adding the material to the surface, letting it decompose gradually into the soil. Practitioners consider this a more natural and less invasive way to improve soil, although full results may take years and plentiful organic matter.
Add in autumn for best results. Many plants benefit from a ""top up"" every month or two during the growing season, but this varies between species and varieties.
If you think the manure or compost may not be rotted enough, keep a circle of regular soil around plants to avoid burning them.

, There are many trace elements that have a less important or less direct effect, but can cause plant health issues or poor soil if they fall below required levels. If you want to be sure to include these, mix green sand, kelp meal, or Azomite © into the soil before planting. For small home gardens, you may not find this necessary unless your plants develop health issues.


The most important trace elements are iron, boron, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc.
The additives described here are natural and suitable for organic farming.

, If you plant the same type of plant in the same location year after year, it will deplete the soil nutrients more quickly. Some plants will use fewer nutrients or even add nitrogen to the soil, so a rotating schedule of plants each year will keep the nutrient levels more stable.


For home gardening, get started with this simple guide to crop rotation. For farming, consult an experienced local farmer or agricultural extension office, as the rotation plan varies depending on the available crops.
Farmers can also consider using overwinter ""cover crops"" grown to provide nutrients for the real crop. Plant a cold-hardy crop at least 30 days before the first expected frost, or 60 days if the crop is only marginally cold-hardy. Mow or cut the crop at least three or four weeks before the regular crop is planted, and leave the cover crop on the ground to decay.
You can also plant a quick growing summer cover crop, such as buckwheat. This will allow you to improve and prepare the soil without having to grow a large crop over the entirety of the summer. Till the crop 30 days after planting., If your soil is kept well-aerated and supplied with nutrients, microbe populations will grow on their own, breaking down dead plant matter into nutrients your plants can reuse. For additional soil health, you may be able to purchase bacterial or fungal additions from a garden supply store, if they are suitable for your plant species. Soil that already decomposes rapidly does not need these additions, although there is no hard and fast rule for how much to use or when to stop.One of the most common additions is a type of fungus called mycorrhizae. This attaches to plant roots and help them absorb more nutrients and water. All plants except members of the genus Brassica (including mustard and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and bok choy) benefit from this, unless the soil is already in excellent shape.
Bacteria called rhizobium are often already present in the soil, but you can purchase a rhizobium inoculant to be sure. These form a symbiotic relationship with legumes such as potatoes and beans, adding nitrogen to the soil.

, Soil scientists divide the particles that make up soil into three categories. Sand particles are the largest, silt is somewhat smaller, and clay particles are the smallest. The ratio of these three types determines the type of soil you have, described in a chart called the ""soil triangle."" For most plants, you'll want to aim for a ""loam,"" or approximately a 40-40-20 mix of sand, silt, and clay respectively.


Succulents and cacti often prefer a ""sandy loam"" with 60 or 70% sand instead.

, Pick up a small clump of soil, from beneath the top surface layer. Moisten it, then try to roll it into a ball and flatten it into a ribbon. This quick and dirty method can detect major problems, based on the following diagnosis:If your soil ribbon breaks before it reaches 2.5 cm (1 inch), you have loam or silt. (If it can't form a ball or ribbon at all, you have sandy soil.)
If your ribbon measures 2.5 to 5 cm (1–2 inches) before breaking, you have clay loam. Your soil could probably benefit from more sand and silt.
If your ribbon reaches more than 5 cm (2 inches), you have clay. Your soil will need major additives, as described at the end of this section.

, If you're still not sure about your soil, you can find out more accurate information with twenty minutes of work and a few days of waiting. To get started, discard the surface soil, then dig up a sample of your soil about 15 centimeters (6 in) deep. Spread it out on a newspaper to dry, and remove all trash, rocks, and other large debris. Break up clumps of soil, separating it as much as possible.

, Once the soil is dry, add it to a tall, large jar until the jar is ¼ full. Add water until the jar is ¾ full, then add 5 milliliters (1  tsp) of non-foaming dishwasher detergent.Seal the jar and shake it for at least five minutes to further break it into fragments.

, Let the jar stand for at least a couple days, marking the outside with a marker or tape at these intervals:After one minute, mark the jar at the top of the settled particles. These are sand, which settle first due to their larger size.
After two hours, mark the jar again. By now, most of the silt will have settled above the sand.
Once the water is clear, mark the jar a third time. Soil with heavy clay can take a week or two to settle, while more loamy soils may reach a clear jar after a couple days.
Measure the distance between marks to get the amount of each particle. Divide each measurement by the total height of the particles to get the percentage of that particle type. For example, if you have 5 cm (2 in) of sand and a total 10 cm (4 in) layer of particles, your soil is 5 ÷ 10 = 0.5 = 50% sand.

, If you discover you already have loam, there's no need to alter your soil. Clay soils greatly benefit from mature compost, as described in the soil nutrients section. Other natural additions such as dry leaves or grass clippings serve similar purposes.


Old, weathered wood chips, twigs, or bark will increase water and nutrient retention, both by creating soil pores and soaking up materials for slow release. Ramial wood chips or chips from small branches are the most nutrient dense when it comes to improving soil. Avoid new wood, which can reduce soil nitrogen levels.

, If you have clay-heavy soil (more than 20% clay) or extremely sandy or silty soil (more than 60% sand or 60% silt), you can mix in the other types of soil to achieve a roughly even mix of sand and silt, and no more than 20% clay. This can be labor-intensive, but is faster than creating your own compost. The goal is to create a porous soil that can hold plenty of water, air, and nutrients.


If you have a commercial composting operation nearby, you can purchase compost in bulk, typically by the truckload. You can use this compost instead of making your own.
Note that you should only use sand that is salt-free and very sharp.Perlite, available from garden supply stores, is useful for all soil types but especially for clay soils, essentially acting as extra-large particles.

, Keep foot traffic and vehicle traffic to a minimum to keep the soil aerated. If the soil looks dense or crusted on top, use a pitchfork to turn over the soil and break up large clumps. For seriously compacted soil, use a machine tiller, or plug holes with a lawn aerator. Even if water retention is not an issue, densely compacted soil can kill off beneficial bacteria and fungi, and encourage harmful anaerobic bacteria.


Mixing in organic material also helps, as described in the section on soil nutrients.
Daikon or tillage radishes, dandelions, and other plants with long tap roots can help prevent clumping and compaction.Alternatively, you can follow ""no-till"" or ""no-dig"" gardening techniques to leave soil undisturbed, allowing it to form as natural soil does over a few years. Minimizing traffic is still recommended for this method.

, For accurate results, discard the topsoil until you reach soil with a consistent color and texture, typically about 5 cm (2 in) down. Dig a hole 15 cm (6 in) deep. Repeat several times across your yard or field to get a representative set of samples.

, You can send these soil samples to a local extension office or soil-testing laboratory, and pay them to test the soil's pH, or acidity. However, pH testing kits are cheaply available at garden supply stores or nurseries, and easy to conduct at home.


Sending the samples to a professional is recommended for farmers, so you can receive an exact recommendation for how much additive to use. Home gardeners may wish to go with the cheaper, faster kit, and use trial and error with the additives.

, Many plants prefer a slightly acidic soil, so aim for a pH of 6.5 if you don't have any other information. Ideally, find your plant's preferences online or by talking to an experienced gardener.


If you can't find specific pH levels, assume that ""acidic soils"" mean a pH of 6.0 to 6.5, while ""alkaline soil"" means a pH of 7.5 to 8.

, If your soil pH is too low for your plant, raise the soil pH with these alkaline additions. Check a garden supply store for garden lime, crushed oyster shells, or other calcium supplements, or crush egg shells to a powder at home. Mix the additive into a large amount of soil one handful at a time, testing the soil pH each time. Keep in mind that these additives can take weeks or months to change the pH of the soil. Wait until you start noticing results before making any more additions.

, If you need to lower your soil pH level, you'll need an acidic addition instead. Mix in aluminum sulfate or sulfur from a gardening supply store, testing the pH again after each handful added.


There are no consistent home methods for raising soil pH. Scientific tests show that pine needles and coffee grounds do not have a reliable, significant effect on soil acidity, despite widespread advice to the contrary., Over time, your soil pH will gradually return to its usual levels, which is determined mostly by the type of minerals in your area. Unless you are having trouble adjusting the pH or your plants develop growth problems, testing your soil every three years should be fine."

Look into clay-tolerant plants.,
Test the pH of your soil.,
Test the pH of your water.,
Try a percolation test.A percolation test will help you determine whether and how well your soil drains.,
Till areas without topsoil.,
Do not work on clay soil when it is wet.,
Prepare to amend a wider section of soil than you'll actually need.,
Amend the soil depending on the results of the test.,
Start off by spreading one cubic yard of organic material on top of every 10-foot by 10-foot area.,
Next, spread one cubic yard of builder's sand over the same 10' x 10' area.,
Continue to monitor the pH of the soil frequently.,
Acidify the soil further, if necessary.,
Avoid automatic water systems for your plants.",How to Amend Clay Soil," Before you begin, consider using plants that tolerate clay soil, as this eliminates the need to amend the soil. Switchgrass, asters, Russian sage, and hostas are all good options.On the other hand, many plants will struggle to thrive in clay soil, regardless of how effectively you amend it. For example, choosing plants that like very dry or excessively acidic soil can be an uphill battle.;
, The first step in amending your soil is to diagnose your soil's pH. There are several ways to do this, ranging from DIY strip tests to commercial testing kits. If you're a serious grower, consider visiting your local county extension and get a soil testing kit straight from the source.


Find your local county extension office and get a soil testing kit. Directions for use it are included in the package. Mail directly to your state laboratory. It may take a little longer than normal to get the results back in the spring because of the volume of requests. Your results will provide a detailed analysis of your soil composition, the pH, and which amendments you may need to add to bring your soil up to optimum growing conditions.
pH is a scale of how acidic or alkaline a material is. The scale goes from 0 to 14, with 0 being very acidic, 7 being neutral, and 14 being very basic.

, Amending your soil to become more acidic, for example, won't do anything if your water is very alkaline and you're planning on using it to water your plants. Don't get lazy — test the pH of your water as well as your soil. Most water is slightly alkaline, which may or may not be good depending on what you are trying to grow.


If your water is basic, it is ""hard"" water. Hard water is generally what groundwater ends up being, mainly because it doesn't erode the pipes that contain it and transport it around. Acidic water is ""soft."" Soft water is achieved by removing calcium and magnesium from the water.
If you want to stay on the safe side, get pure, filtered water. Pure, filtered water is about as neutral as you'll get. This way, the introduction of water won't affect the pH of your soil, although it can quickly get expensive.

, Dig a hole that's 2 feet (0.61 m) (.6m) deep and 1 foot (0.30 m) (.3m) wide. Fill the hole with water and wait for it to drain completely. Now fill it a second time, keeping track of how long the second water hole drains:


If it takes less than 12 hours to drain, you can safely plant anything that requires well-drained soil.
If it takes between 12 and 24 hours for the hole to drain, you can safely grow plants that tolerate heavy soil or clay environments.
If it takes more than 24 hours for the hole to drain, you can pretty much only plant trees that can hold up to occasional flooding, like balsam fir or red maple.

, If you have no topsoil at all, tilling can break up the dense soil for an easier growing medium. Till down to at least 6 inches (15.2cm), and preferably about 8 inches (20.3cm). Extend out a little past the planting area. This will ensure that the roots have extra growing room if they need it.


If you don't have a tiller, you can use a broadfork, pitchfork, or shovel to loosen and aerate the soil. The advantage of the broadfork is that you're not disturbing the essential soil structure, which helps the microorganisms that call the soil their home. The downside to just aerating the soil instead of tilling it is that dense lumps of clay may still exist after soil loosening.
If you have topsoil with clay underneath, do not till. In this environment, tilling will make the problem worse by mixing clay in with your topsoil.

, Wait for a dry spell to start amending the clay soil. Clay that is wet is much easier compacted, making the amending a lot more difficult. You'll need all the help you can get amending clay, so be sure to keep this simple but profound trick in mind.

, Measure out the space that you'll be amending. Ideally choose a large space to amend. A small amended area might be a haven for your plants, but when their roots start expanding past the small area and hit the clay, they'll double back into the amended area quickly. This causes problems with root system development.

, Most clay soils are on the alkaline side, meaning that you'll probably want to lower the pH of the soil. There are several ways to do this. The most common substances to add to clay soil are builder's sand, gypsum, composted manure, compost or other coarse organic material.


Builder's sand and gypsum allow for better water drainage and increased air pockets, as they force the particles in the clay apart. It is very important to use coarse sand such as builder's sand, not fine-textured sand such as play sand, as this will make the situation worse.
Organic matter will help the plants get the proper nutrients and also help build increased humus (not to be confused with ""hummus"") with additional microbes that are the building blocks of good soil. Additionally, they will help lower the pH of the soil, acidifying it.Try shooting for an equal mix of coarse sand (builder's sand) and coarse organic material. Because you're going to be spreading this mix over a large area, you will need bulk quantities: Instead of thinking in terms of square feet, think in terms of cubic yards--one cubic yard of material will provide a three-inch layer on 100 square feet. Purchase in bulk at a landscape supply store or a feed store; buying by the bag is much, much more expensive.

, Start with organic material first. After being integrated with the clay soil, the material will begin to break down and become effectively invisible. Don't worry — it's still there doing its job.

, Mix it in thoroughly with the organic material and the clay by using a tilling machine. If you do not have one, you can rent one inexpensively at your local hardware renter store.


If good quality builder's sand is not readily available, you may want to chose to try either green sand or gypsum as an alternative to the sand. They are more expensive, but act in the same manner to force the clay particles apart allowing to addition of more water and air.
Gypsum has been found to be particularly effective in areas where the soil has a high salt concentration., Closely watch the change in pH. Most plants can't tolerate drastic changes in pH or soil conditions, so you'll want to be reasonably sure that the pH of your soil has stopped changing drastically before you plant.

, Clay is usually very alkaline to begin with.For this reason, you may find yourself wanting to alter the pH of the soil to make it more acidic. There are several ways you can do this:


By adding an ammonia-based fertilizer
By adding elemental sulfur or iron sulfate
By adding cottonseed meal, sphagnum moss, or other compost

, Because clay soil is so good at retaining moisture, automatic watering systems may drown your plants if not paid special attention to. Ditch the sprinklers, save some money, and look at the plants themselves to determine how much water they plants need.

"
Do your research.Truly organic soil can be hard to come by since the market for organic potting media has only begun increasing in the past few years.,
Check with organic resources.,
Look for certified brands and blends.,
Buy from local growers when possible.,
Head to a well-stocked garden center.,
Shop online.,
Take a close look at the ingredients list.,
Smell the soil.If buying the soil in person, take a good whiff before committing to the purchase.,
Take a closer look.",How to Buy Organic Soil," Moreover, organic standards have also become stricter as the demand for organic goods has grown, so a soil that was once deemed organic may no longer fulfill those requirements legally. Before shopping for an organic soil, inform yourself so that you know what to expect. Traces of chemicals can be common, especially in soils containing certain types of manure, but if the amount is low enough it could still qualify as organic.;
, A good way to locate an organic soil is to look for reviews and recommendations from other growers committed to organic practices. If you know any fellow organic farmers or gardeners, those contacts are the best place to start. If not, join an online community of organic growers. Browse organic message boards or check out organic growing websites.When going to a website dedicated to organic growing, though, it is best to find a website that is not affiliated with any specific brand or company, since these websites will likely be biased in their reviews.

, In the search for organic soil, it helps to buy from certified sources. Certification can come from a number of sources, including the USDA and third-party organizations. The latter can be just as meaningful as the former, so long as you are looking at certification from a trusted organization.


One of the best certifications to look for is from the Organic Materials Review Institute. This nonprofit organization judges products based on National Organic Standard requirements. Soils that are certified by this group will be labeled ""OMRI Listed.""

, Local farmers and municipalities will often sell organic soil blends, especially blends that are enhanced by compost. If buying from a local grower, go to one that runs an organic farm or that sells certifiably organic produce. In order for the produce to qualify as organic, it will need to have been grown using organic methods and products, including organic soil. As such, you can be certain that the soil used and purchased there is truly organic.

, Smaller garden centers and big box home improvement stores may not cater to the organic growing crowd, so the selection there may not be especially impressive. However, a garden center or home improvement store that is stocked well enough will almost always have some selection of organic soil, even if the selection is not especially large. Since these stores have standards they must uphold to avoid getting fined, the organic soils sold there are likely to be legitimate.

, The Internet will provide you with the greatest selection and variety of organic soil blends. Shopping on the Internet does come with the disadvantage of being unable to examine the soil in person before you buy it, but as long as you shop with trusted sources and take a careful look at the reviews and ingredients, you will likely be able to order a truly organic source. At the very least, the convenience and selection makes this an option worth exploring.

, When in doubt, the label on a package of organic soil can reveal just about everything you need to know. Check the ingredients list for organic components. If anything raises a red flag or seems questionable, go back and research that component before buying.


Some traditionally organic components are more controversial than others. Vermiculite can contain traces of asbestos, peat moss is occasionally treated with chemical wetting agents, and cottonseed meal is often contaminated with chemical pesticides.
In addition to checking the ingredients list for organic components, also check the list to determine if the soil offers your garden or farm the nutrients and density it needs.

, The soil should smell good and earthy, even if it contains manure or compost. If the soil smells rotten or sulfuric, there are probably some components that have not broken down properly. As such, the soil will probably be unable to offer your plants all that they need.

, The look of organic soil can vary, but there are some basics you should be aware of. Most organic soils, especially those containing compost, should be dark and fluffy. If, however, the soil contains a heavier component like clay, it will be significantly heavier and not as fluffy. Soils that contain moss or sand may seem even lighter in color and weight.


Feel the soil. If possible, run your fingers through the soil to get a better idea of its weight and texture. You can usually get a good idea just by looking at it, but feeling it in between your fingers will make the quality even more obvious. Good quality organic soil should have uniform texture.

Identify your soil type.,
Understand soil pH.,
Consider what you are planting.,
Test the soil’s pH.,
Have your water tested.",How to Adjust Soil pH1," Before you test your soil or add anything to it, you will need to determine what type of soil you have. Determine if your soil is clumpy, dry, loose or wet. This will give you some clues about what altering the soil may entail. Because of this, you should understand your soil type early.Well-drained and loose soil will be more easily altered. On the other hand, compacted soil that has a lot of clay in it will be difficult to change.
Determining your soil type will help you figure out the best method for applying any materials to it.;
, In order to adjust your soil’s pH, you will need to know what that is. A soil's pH represents how acidic or alkaline it is. Soil pH is determined on a scale from zero to 14, with seven being a neutral pH that is neither acidic nor alkaline. Anything over seven is alkaline and anything below seven is acidic. Most plants prefer a pH between six and seven and a half, as do earthworms and microorganisms, which help your plants., The type of plants you intend to grow will determine what your soil’s pH needs to be. Many plants prefer a more acidic soil, particularly flowers and some fruit plants like blueberries. Research what the recommended pH levels are for the plants you want to grow.Azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries and conifers like acidic soils (pH 5.0 to 5.5)
Vegetables, grasses and most ornamentals prefer slightly acidic soils (pH 5.8 to 6.5)

, Once you have an understanding of soil pH and the type of soil you are dealing with, you will want to get it tested. You can buy a commercial test at a local home and garden store or send a sample to a company that will test it for you. The easiest way to test your soil is to dig a hole, fill it with water and then insert a test probe into muddy water. However, sending a soil sample to be tested will give you a more accurate indication of your soil’s pHThere are also some DIY methods that include making your own pH test strips.

, Test your water to determine how it affects your soil. Groundwater, the water used in most homes and gardens, tends to be more alkaline. However, rainwater tends to be more acidic. If you live somewhere with lots of rainfall, your soil may be slightly more acidic. If you mostly water your garden or yard with water from a faucet, your soil may be more alkaline.You can use commercial pH test strips or an electronic pH meter.

Add compost with fruit and vegetable waste.,
Bury citrus rinds directly in the soil.If you do not have compost readily available or do not want to mix fruit waste into your compost pile, you can bury fruit waste directly into the soil at the base of your plants.,
Mix wood ash into the soil.,
Try kelp meal or seaweed.,
Use greensand.,
Mix in muriate of potash or sulfate of potash.Muriate of potash, or potassium chloride, is a natural mineral mined from very old stone deposits.,
Try Sul-Po-Mag.,
Add granite dust.,
Layer on the manure.Manure is nutrient-rich in general.",How to Add Potassium to an Organic Garden," Compost is rich in nutrients, and potassium is no exception. To create a compost with an even higher content of potassium than usual, throw fruit and vegetable waste into the compost pile. Produce that is naturally high in potassium makes the best choice. Think banana peels, orange rinds, lemon rinds, beets, spinach, and tomatoes.


Note that the unfortunate part about using compost to supply potassium is that potassium compounds found in compost are usually water soluble. While this makes the nutrient available to your plants, it also means that it is more likely to wash out of the compost pile during periods of heavy rainfall.;
, Lemon and orange rinds are especially high in potassium, and the potassium they contain is easily transferred over. While not a citrus fruit, you could also try using banana peels in the same manner.

, Ash from burnt hardwood is one of the most time-tested methods of adding potassium to an organic garden. You will need to add about 1 lb. (450 g) of wood ash to 10 square feet (1 square meters) of soil to enrich the soil with an adequate amount of potassium.


Keep in mind that wood ash raises soil pH. If you use wood ash to supply the garden with potassium, you will also need to regularly test the pH to make sure that the soil is balanced.

, Kelp and other types of seaweed are all rich in potassium, and the potassium is readily transferred to the soil of your garden. You can add kelp by either burying a few handfuls of dried kelp meal into the soil or by spraying the soil with a liquid seaweed spray.

, Deposits of greensand are mined from sedimentary rocks found in former sea beds. Greensand contains several minerals, and has a potassium content of about 6 percent. When dug into your soil, it also works as a long-term soil conditioner. The downside of greensand is that it provides potassium at a very slow rate. To ensure that your garden receives enough potassium when using greensand, you should use about 5 lbs (2250 g) per 10 square feet (1 square meters) of soil.


In addition to digging greensand into your soil directly, you can also add it to your compost pile to improve the potassium content of your compost.

, Sulfate of potash, or potassium sulfate, is also mined from old deposits. Muriate of potash tends to be cheaper, but the chlorine it contains can hurt the helpful microbes living in your garden's soil. Sulfate of potash is safer, but it is also more expensive.


When buying a ""potash"" product, make sure that it is certified as being organic by the Organic Minerals Review Institute. Many of these products are organic, but some are not.

, Also called langbeinite or sulfate of potash-magnesia, Sul-Po-Mag is a natural mineral rich in potassium. Since the mineral is water soluble, the potassium is readily available for your plants. The downside, however, is that the sulfur and magnesium content in Sul-Po-Mag could damage your plants unless the soil is unnaturally low in these minerals.

, Granite dust is mined from natural granite quarries and is fairly inexpensive. It contains a number of minerals and has a potassium content of about 5 percent. The ground up rock does not release potassium quickly, though, so it will not work well if you need to add potassium to your soil quickly or if you need to use it for vegetables. If using granite dust, you should use about 5 lbs (2250 g) per 10 square feet (1 square meters) of soil.

, If using poultry manure, 1 bushel will add a sufficient dose of potassium for 100 square feet (10 square meters). For any other type of manure, you will need 4 bushels to cover 100 square feet (10 square meters)."

Pick a liming material.,
Think about using wood ashes.,
Apply the liming source.,
Water the soil regularly.",How to Adjust Soil pH2," If you have tested your soil and found that it is too acidic, you can raise the pH by adding a base. The most common materials used to increase the pH of soil are compounds made from powdered limestone, or lime, which you can find at most home and garden store. Standard lime comes in four types: pulverized, hydrated, granules and pellets. Depending on your soil type and the amount of moisture in the ground, one of these compounds may be a good option.Pulverized lime is finely ground and more easily absorbed by the soil. However, it is more difficult to spread because it can clog the applicator.
Granular and pelletized lime are easier to spread. However, it is not as effective at altering the soil pH.
Hydrated lime should only be used with extremely acidic soils since it is more water soluble and can quickly increase a soil’s pH.
Some lime sources contain micronutrients like dolomite, which is a mixture of calcium and magnesium carbonates. However, you should only use dolomitic lime if your soil is magnesium deficient. Do not add more magnesium to soils that are already high in it., The ash of burned trees is also quite basic and can add micronutrients like calcium, potassium, phosphate, and boron. Wood ash is not as effective as lime. However, it can dramatically increase a soil’s pH over time. Because of this, you should monitor the soil closely as you apply wood ash.Keep the ash from coming into contact with any plant roots or germinating seedlings because it may damage them.
Wood ash works well in sandy soil.

, In order to get the best results, you will want to till the liming material into the soil about two to three months before planting (usually in the fall or winter) so that there is plenty of time for the pH to change. The lime should be tilled into the soil’s the root zone or the top 7 inches (18 cm) of soil.You can apply the lime by hand if you have a small enough piece of land. You can also use a spreader to apply liming material to a yard.
You can use a rake or a rototiller to work the liming material into the soil.
Because lime is not very water soluble, tilling it into the soil will maximize its effect.

, Lime will have little effect on dry soils, so you will need to apply water regularly. Water activates the lime and helps it seep into the soil. Use a garden hose or sprinkler to apply water.How often you water the soil depends on the size of the plot of land and the amount of moisture already in the soil. Too much watering can leech other minerals out of the soil.

Use organic materials.,
Consider applying sulfur.,
Think about adding aluminum sulfate.,
Till the materials into the soil.,
Rinse your plants after application.",How to Adjust Soil pH3," Over time, organic matter, such as pine needles, compost or composted manure, can lower your soil’s pH. However, this can take many years and is only applicable if you have long-term gardening goals. This is a good option for organic gardening.Organic matter is also useful for improving a soil's drainage and aeration.
Because of the amount of organic matter used and the time needed to break it down into usable soil, this application is best for small plots.

, Another way to increase your soil’s acidity gradually is by adding sulfur. The effectiveness of sulfur depends on a number of factors, including moisture, temperature, and bacteria. Because these factors can be unpredictable, the ability of sulfur to lower a soil’s pH can take several months.You can buy sulfur at most home and garden stores. Avoid using powdered sulfur because it is too fine for acidifying soil.
The increase in acidity is due to a biological reaction involving bacteria.

, This compound instantly makes the soil more acidic due to a chemical reaction involving aluminum. Because of this, many amateur and small-scale gardeners prefer aluminum sulfate to organic compounds or plain sulfur. However, because it alters the pH of the soil so quickly, it can be more difficult to control the soil acidity.You can buy aluminum sulfate at most home and garden stores.
Because aluminum sulfate creates a chemical reaction in the ground, as opposed to a biological one, some farmers and gardeners are less inclined to use it over materials that produce acidity through a biological reaction.

, You will need to till the organic compounds, sulfur and aluminum sulfate into the soil to be effective. Organic compounds may need multiple applications depending on the soil pH. Be sure to test the soil before reapplying.Avoid over applying the sulfur or aluminum sulfate.

, If the sulfur or aluminum sulfate gets on the leaves of your plants, you will need to rinse it off with a hose. Failure to rinse them off can result in burns to the leaves and damage to your plants. Watering your plants will also help the compounds set."

The pH scale is 1-14. One is extremely acidic, 14 is extremely alkaline.






Most plants are fine with a neutral soil, around pH 7.






Some plants love acidic soil (around 4.5-6.5), and include Australian natives, citrus, pro-teas, camellias, rhododendrons, azaleas, and herbs.






Some plants love alkaline soil (around 7-8), and include lavender, iris, lilac, and peas.






Soil alkalinity or acidity can be slightly adjusted with the addition of dolomite (for acidic soil) or organic matter and sulphur (for alkaline soil) but this can take a long time to change.





;
, Take a handful of soil and squeeze it into a rolled shape.


Sandy soil: This soil won't form a roll. It will crumble and appears grainy. It's common for coastal zones. Add manure and compost to improve it.






Clay loam: This will form a roll. It is the perfect garden soil, being an even mix of sand and clay.







Clay soil: This will form a sticky, firm roll. If you can sculpt with it, it's heavy clay soil. Light clay soil can be improved by the addition of organic matter; heavy clay soil is almost impossible to work with and you'll need to stick with plants that grow in it naturally or completely replace it by bringing in good soil, digging out the clay and pouring in the good new soil.







, You will often read that a soil needs to be ""well-draining"" when learning how to grow a plant. It's therefore very helpful to know whether the soil drains well or not.


Dig some holes in the garden.






Fill the holes with water.






Watch for the reaction:






If the water drains away quickly, this could indicate sandy soil and a problem for fast water loss. Add mulch and water crystals.






If the water just sits there for ages and shows no signs of budging, then it's poor draining soil. You'll need to create drainage in the garden and use a lot of organic matter.








If it drains through at a medium pace, it's good well-draining soil.

Raise the pH of your soil, if needed, by liming.",How to Acidify Soil," If you're serious about growing plants or making your soil more acidic for whatever reason, you'll know that professional sampling is more accurate than DIY home tests. It may not seem like it, but the difference between soil that is 5.5 and 6.5 on the pH scale is pretty big!


If you are in the United States, contact the nearest county extension office. They will do a basic soil test, which includes measuring pH, for free or for a small fee.;
, If you're not into the idea of professional soil testing, you can easily test the pH of your soil at home, but understand that it won't be as accurate as a professional reading. There are several ways to get a pretty decent reading at home:



Use paper strips to test pH. This method will only tell you whether your soil is predominantly acidic or basic, but it's a fun exercise that you can use with lots of different flowers, vegetables, and herbs.
Use vinegar and baking soda to test pH. Another rudimentary way of testing acidic vs. basic, this method involves taking a cup of soil and dividing it into two containers. Add vinegar to one container and baking soda and water to the other, seeing which one fizzes. If it fizzes for vinegar, it's basic or alkaline; if it fizzes for baking soda, it's acidic.
Buy a home testing kit. A home testing kit should be able to tell you your soil pH by giving you a number. This number is a more informative reading than the simple ""this is acidic"" or ""this is basic"" reading of over home methods.

, The pH of groundwater that you may use to water your plants ranges from about 6.5 to 8.5, but is usually more on the alkaline side so that it doesn't corrode water pipes.If the water you use to water your plants is basic to begin with, and your soil is as well, know that you'll need a little extra ""oomph"" to produce the desired acidic effect for your plants.


One way to get around this potential problem is to use pure, filtered water. Pure water has a pH of 7, which makes it almost completely neutral. Using pure, filtered water is effective, but it can become expensive quickly.

, pH is a measure of how basic or acidic a substance is. This measure exists on a scale from 0 to 14, with 0 being very acidic (think battery acid) and 14 being very alkaline (think liquid drain cleaner).7 is considered ""neutral"" on the pH scale.


For example, if your soil reads 8.5 on the pH scale, it means that it's slightly basic. You'll need to add a little bit of acidic material to make the soil less basic. If your soil measures 6.5 on the pH scale, it means it's slightly acidic. If you want your soil to be even more acidic, you'll need to add additional acidic material.
If you want to get into the nitty gritty, consider that pH is a logarithmic scale, meaning each number represents a 10-fold change. So a pH of 8 is 10 times more basic than a pH of 7, a pH of 8.5 is 15 times more basic, and so on.

, This is different than determining the pH of your soil, and it's a really important move. Your soil type will tell you which method of acidifying you should use.


Soil that is already well-drained and relatively loose will make acidification much easier. This type of soil can benefit from large amounts of organic compounds that acidify the soil as they break down.
Soil that is clumped with clay and seriously compacted will make acidification much tougher. Adding organic material to this type of soil will make it more alkaline, not less.

, In order to acidify these types of soils, organic materials are your best bet. Organic materials acidify the soil as they break down, but large amounts of them are needed to bring the pH down.Here are some nice organic materials you should consider using:


Sphagnum peat moss
Composted oak leaves
Compost and manure

, As mentioned earlier, adding organic materials to highly-dense soil can make problems worse, as your soil retains more moisture, making it more alkaline. For this reason, adding elemental sulfur or iron sulfate is the most surefire way to acidify soil with heavy clay components to it.


Elemental sulfur acidifies the soil as bacteria turns the elemental sulfur into sulfuric acid.It takes about 2 pounds of elemental sulfur per 100 square feet to reduce the pH of a soil that is 7 down to a pH of 4.5.Because elemental sulfur is slow to react, it's best to add it the year before planting in order to achieve the best results.Work the elemental sulfur into the soil, going as deep as 6 inches (15.2 cm).

, Iron sulfate relies on a chemical reaction to create acidity. It is therefore less dependent on temperature conditions than elemental sulfur, which depends on bacteria to produce a biological reaction.It could take upwards of 10 pounds of iron sulfate for every 100 square feet of soil to reduce pH by one unit.If you are adding more than 10 pounds of iron sulfate for every 100 square feet of soil, then you will need to split it up into two applications, spaced one to two months apart. This will give the soil time to absorb the iron sulfate after application.
Iron sulfates are lot faster-acting than elemental sulfurs. They can significantly reduce pH in a matter of three to four weeks, as opposed to several months.This gives them the added advantage of being usable the same season you decide on planting.
Be careful when applying iron sulfates. They can cause rusty stains on clothes, sidewalks, and patios. It's best to separate any clothes you get iron sulfates on from other clothes — wash them separately to avoid any cross-contamination.

, In a lot of cases, all you need to do to acidify soil is use an ammonia-based fertilizer. Many of the fertilizers which are used for acid-loving plants contain ammonia sulfate or sulfur-coated urea.


Calcium nitrate and potassium nitrate should not be used as fertilizers, even if they do contain ammonia. These fertilizers actually raise the pH of your soil., Because it is slow-acting, it's tough to make mistakes at recommended doses. Work it into moist soil as much as possible, without disrupting any root systems. Continue to monitor the pH of the soil as the months pass.

, Vinegar will lower the pH of the soil immediately, but in this case, it's not a great thing. The change happens too radically, disappears too quickly, and kills off beneficial soil organisms.Stay away from vinegar unless you're okay with the possibility of your plants dying.

, So you've already treated your soil with iron sulfates, for example, and you've just planted your blueberries. Keep the soil pH low by applying generous amounts of natural acidifying fertilizers such as cottonseed meal. Cottonseed meal, a by-product of cotton manufacturing, is especially great for acid-loving plants like azaleas, camellias, and rhododendrons., Check the pH of your soil near the base of your plants, adding fertilizers such as aluminum sulfate (especially for hydrangeas) without damaging the root system. For the best results, use a commercial pH testing kit or send off a sample of your soil to get professionally tested.


Ornamental plants and vegetables will mostly prefer a slightly acidic environment of between 6.5 and 6.8.
Hydrangeas, azaleas, rhododendrons, and blueberries will prefer a more acidic environment — between 5 and 5.5.

, In some cases, your efforts to acidify the soil will work too well and you'll be left with soil that is too acidic for your desired plant or vegetable. In these cases, you'll want to alkalize your soil with the addition of lime. Lime comes in three basic varieties — limestone, burned/quicklime, or hydrated lime — and how much to include will depend on the type of soil you have, as well as the variety of lime you choose to use. Inspect the packet for directions or talk to a horticulturist for more information.

Dig a small hole in the soil.,
Fill the hole with water.,
Insert the test probe into the mud.,
Hold it there for 60 seconds and take a reading.,
Take several measurements in different spots in the garden.",How to Test Soil pH1," Use a trowel or spade to dig a hole 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) deep. Break up the soil within the hole and remove any twigs or foreign debris.






;
, Use distilled (not spring) water. You can find this in your local pharmacy. Rainwater is slightly acidic, and bottled or tap water tends to be slightly alkaline. Fill the hole until you have a muddy pool at the bottom.








, Make sure your tester is clean and calibrated (for a more exact measurement). Wipe the probe with a tissue or clean cloth, and insert it into the mud.








, pH is usually measured on a scale of 1-14, though the tester may not include this entire range.









A pH of 7 indicates neutral soil.
A pH above 7 indicates alkaline soil.
A pH below 7 indicates acidic soil.

, A single reading may be an anomaly, so it's good to get an idea of the average pH in a plot. If they're all around the same, take the average and amend the soil accordingly. If one spot is very different than the rest, however, you may need to ""spot treat"" it.

Determine what kind of soil amendment you need.,
Bear in mind that each type of amendment will change the chemical composition of the soil -- lowering nitrogen or adding phosphorous, potassium or salt.,
Calculate how much soil amendment you will need.,
Buy soil amendments by the bag or truckload from garden centers, nurseries, compost facilities, landscapers and tree companies, farmers markets or online.",How to Buy Soil Amendments," Almost all gardeners want loamy soil, which is gritty but moist, nutrient-rich and easy to till. Sandy, silty or clay soil is generally undesirable. Inspect your soil to determine its composition and test it using a soil test kit.


Soil with less than 3 percent of organic matter should be amended with organic matter like composted manure, straw, grass clippings or wood chips.
Amend with peat if you have sandy soil. Avoid using mountain peat, because harvesting it is severely disruptive to the environment.
Biosolids consist of treated sewage mixed with other organic matter such as leaves or clippings. Use only Grade 1 biosolids, which are relatively free of pathogens, and only if you aren't growing root vegetables such as carrots or potatoes. Most gardeners balk at using biosolids to grow any food crops.
Add bark or perlite to clay soils. Never try to amend clay with sand because the combination will result in a soil that resembles concrete.;
, You may have to use a chemical fertilizer to make an adjustment. Select a low pH amendment if your soil tends to be high pH.


Choose an amendment that decomposes rapidly if you want to improve the quality of your soil quickly. Use one that decomposes slowly if you want long-lasting improvement. Most gardeners mix amendments to get both quick and long-lasting improvements.

, Measure the square footage of the area and multiply this number by the desired depth. You may have to do some fairly complex calculations if your garden isn't rectangular. The more accurate your measurements, the less likely you are to buy too much or too little amendment for your needs.

, You may be able to have large amounts of amendments delivered to your garden by the seller.

Test your soil.",How to Test Soil pH2," The solution created from the cabbage juice will change color depending on the pH of what it comes in contact with.








, Using pure distilled water will give an accurate pH test result.








, Allow it to soak for about about ten minutes and then drain the solid pieces out, leaving a violet hued juice. This juice should have a neutral pH of about 7.








, Pour a small amount into two separate cups, and add vinegar to one cup and baking soda to the other. Vinegar is acidic, and should turn the solution hot pink. The baking soda solution is alkaline and will turn blue or green.








, Pour a few inches of the cabbage juice into a clean cup and add one to two spoonfuls of soil. Wait thirty minutes, and check the color of the solution.









Purple or violet is a pH near 7, neutral.
Pink means the soil is acidic with a pH between 1 and 7. The more acidic the soil is, the brighter the pink will be.
Blue or green is a pH between 8 and 14, alkaline. The brighter green the juice is, the more alkaline it is.

Keep your vegetable plants no more than 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) away from the grow lights.

,


Turn the lights off for 6 to 10 hours every day. Vegetable plants do need a period of darkness to mature and trigger production.

,


Consider full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs.These bulbs will provide warm and cool (red and blue) light which mimics natural solar light. These lights are great to get seedlings started and will provide intense, direct light for your vegetable plants.
Use high intensity discharge lamps for energy efficiency and extra intensity. These grow lights are used by commercial growers and emit twice the amount of light for the same amount of energy. They are also more expensive.

, The light is more intense in the center of the bulb, so it will help your plants grow evenly.

,


Wipe off any dust or dirt that accumulates. Dirty bulbs do not give off as much light as they should.
Replace fluorescent bulbs that begin to darken on the ends. This means the bulb is aging and not producing as much light as it should.

Fill inner tubes with water and put your transplants in the middle of the inner tube. The water will retain heat from the sun and release the heat during the evening. Remove the inner tube when the plants can withstand cooler night temperatures.
Cut the bottoms off of large plastic jugs and push the containers into the soil over your transplants. Make sure the jugs are deep enough into the soil that they don’t blow away. Remove the jug’s cap to increase air circulation. Insert the container over your plant at nightfall and remove it during the day.

, The simplest type is made with wire loops and covered with clear plastic. The plastic needs to be anchored down and at least one end of the structure has to allow some air into the greenhouse. Even with ventilation, the soil in a southwest greenhouse could get too hot unless you mulch your plants with straw or another type of composting material.

, Follow the seed packet directions about number of days to sprouting and maturation so that you know how many weeks ahead of time to start your seedlings. This step isn’t necessary in most coastal areas where the winters are very mild.

, Very few vegetables will bear fruit without at least 6 hours of sunlight daily.

, Remove all weeds or other plant material as early in the spring as is comfortable to work outdoors.

, Use a tiller or a spade. If you are not usually physically active, it is best to till a small section every day until you have tilled the entire plot.

, Work it in with a shovel or till your soil again to make sure the compost and soil are well mixed.

, Wait a few weeks after tilling before you plant. This will allow the soil to absorb nutrients from the compost.

, Cool weather crops, such as lettuce, thrive in cooler temperatures, but wilt badly under intense sun. Cool weather crops can also be planted in early fall.

, Don't plant any warm weather crops until after all danger of frost is over. Consult the seed packet directions to make sure you plant in time for the vegetable to mature before the first frost of the autumn.

, Your seedlings and transplants will need daily watering if there is no rain. Once the plants are established, water only when the soil is dry.

, Cover your vegetables with plastic or cloth to protect them from light frosts. Root vegetables can survive hard frosts if they are heavily mulched.

Determine where to situate the vertical garden.,
Select vertical structures.,
Prepare the soil.,
Choose containers as applicable.",How to Grow Vegetables Vertically1," Most vegetables require at least 6 hours of sun, so choose a sunny location for the vertical garden. If you live in an apartment building, a sunny balcony may be an option. If you have a yard, consider a sunny location against a south-facing wall of your house.;
, In order for plants to grow vertically, they need a vertical support system. Common support structures include trellises, tripods, pyramids, walls, fences, wire cages and walls. Arches or arbors can serve as focal areas while also supporting vegetables. Almost any structure that points toward the sky can be used for vertical gardening. Consider creative options like bamboo poles, tree branches, ladders, sunflowers or corn stalks.


Choose a support structure strong enough for the vegetables you want to grow. Mature plants loaded down with vegetables can be heavy. For example, tomato plants require very sturdy vertical structures, while peas may climb almost any structure without bearing much weight on it.
Place the support system in your garden or on your patio before planting vegetables. This prevents you from damaging plants.
Locate vertical supports on the north or east side of the garden where they won't block the sun from the growing vegetables.
Anchor the support system securely. Vertical supports like trellises or wire cages can be staked directly in the ground. Trellises and other flat vertical supports also can be attached to the exterior wall of a home. If you attach a vertical support to a wall, leave space between the wall and the trellis for air circulation as the plant climbs.

, Whether you plant vegetables in the ground or in containers, soil quality is important for your vertical garden. Use weed-free, compost-rich soil. To encourage proper drainage in containers, mix the soil with peat moss or perlite.

, If you are growing vegetables in containers, you can use almost any type of container. Make sure that the container is deep enough to accommodate the type of vegetable you are growing. Larger and heavier vegetables will require larger and sturdier containers. Consider hanging baskets, urns, window boxes, washtubs, coffee cans, clay pots or wooden crates. If the container does not have drainage holes, drill small holes on the bottom of the container before filling it with soil.

Understand the basics of growing vegetables vertically.,
Select vegetables to grow.",How to Grow Vegetables Vertically2," Almost any type of vegetable can be grown vertically as long as the container is deep enough to accommodate the plant and the vertical staking is strong enough to hold the plant.


Evaluate your garden conditions. Choose vegetables that will thrive in your garden based on its lights, wind, heat and moisture. If you are growing vertical vegetables in containers, be prepared to water the containers daily.
Plant the ""vine"" varieties of plants when applicable. If you are growing beans, cucumbers, squash or beans, be sure to plant the vine variety, which will climb vertically, instead of the bush variety.

, While most vegetables can be grown vertically, several types of vegetables are known for their success in vertical gardens. If you are just starting out in vertically gardening, consider these vegetables.


Grow pole beans vertically. Pole beans will climb almost any structure, including other plants. The Native Americans often planted beans and corn together because the corn would provide a vertical support for the beans.
Grow peas in a vertical garden. Like pole beans, peas will climb almost any structure and need little encouragement to twine around vertical supports. Consider growing peas on trellises, bamboo sticks or even over an arbor.
Grow winter squash and gourds vertically. Winter squash and gourds have long vines that can extend up to 10 feet (3.0 m) for the squash and 25 feet (7.6 m) for the gourds. Because the vines grow so long and become heavy, you must provide a sturdy, secure vertical support. To provide extra support to heavy winter squash, such as butternut, wrap cloth twine or strips of pantyhose around each fruit and tie to the vertical supporting structure. Do not use string to support the squash because it may cut into the stems. Some garden centers sell materials made specifically for supporting large vegetables, like winter squash and gourds.
Grow melons and pumpkins in a vertical garden. Like winter squash, melons and pumpkins have long vines and the fruit needs additional support when growing vertically. Grow melons and pumpkins up strong, secure vertical structures. Wrap slings made of old sheets, rags, towels or fabric scraps around the melons and pumpkins and secure them to the fence or trellis to provide needed support.
Grow cucumbers vertically. Cucumbers (the vine variety, not the bush variety) are ideal for a vertical garden because they naturally climb. They can be grown up almost any structure, such as an A-frame, cage or trellis, but it must be strong enough to support the weight of the vines. Initially, cucumbers may need a little encouragement to attach themselves to the vertical structure, but as soon as the tendrils wind around the support, they will climb vertically without assistance. The cucumbers will hang vertically from the plant, making them easy to harvest.
Grow tomatoes in a vertical garden. Because tomatoes are heavy plants, they require a sturdy vertical structure. As the tomato plants grow, tie the branches to the structure with a soft twine or cotton cloth at regular intervals.

Plant vegetables indoors.",How to Grow Vegetables in Winter," You should always choose hardy, cold-resistant vegetables to use for winter gardening, but even amongst these vegetables, some hold up better in severe freezes than others. You should thoroughly research the minimum temperature and growth requirements for a winter vegetable before committing to growing it.Popular winter vegetables include arugula, beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, chard, endive, favas, kale, garlic, leeks, lettuce, mustard, onions, parsnip, radicchio, and spinach.
Onions are amongst the most resilient vegetables, with most types surviving temperatures of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius). The Walla Walla sweet onion is possibly the most resilient, with some reports suggesting that it can withstand freezes as low as -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-24 degrees Celsius).
Brussels sprouts are also fairly resistant, and are able to last through temperatures as low as 3 degrees Fahrenheit (-16 degrees Celsius). Similarly, radicchio and endive both survive in temperatures as low as 5 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius).
Lettuce is one of the least resilient cold-resistant vegetables, but even it has been known to last in temperatures as low as 24 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius).;
, Regardless of where you plant your winter vegetables, you should rotate the vegetables you plant from year to year. Planting the same crop in the same location will cause the soil to lose nutrients. Pests that are attracted to that type of vegetable will also be more likely to gravitate toward that location, causing damage.


If you do not rotate the winter vegetables you plant in a plot, you should at least plant a different vegetable during another season, like spring and summer, to improve the quality of the soil.

, The outer walls of houses, sheds, and garage provide plenty of natural protection against harsh winter winds. If you live in a region that experiences mild to moderate winters, you might be able to get away using no further protection than a south-facing wall. South-facing walls allow the plants to receive maximum sunlight while protecting them from the majority of cold winds.

, Cloches are, in a sense, portable green houses. They can be made from a variety of clear materials so that the wind is blocked from the plant while the sunlight is allowed to pass through. There are several designs that you can try.

Hammer stiff metal spikes into the ground and prop glass panes over them in a triangular ""teepee"" style.

, These are basically the same thing as a cloche, except on a larger scale.You will need to insert several large, half-hoops of PVC piping or electrical conduit into the ground around over the length of the plant bed. These half-hoops should be large enough to allow a person to walk beneath them, about 5 feet (2 m) across, 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, and spaced 5 feet (1.5 m) apart.






It may be best to nail the hoop frames down to heavy wood boards to provide them with extra support.






Hook clear plastic sheets or sheer poly fabric over the frames. You can nail the sheets in place, or you can weigh them down with heavy rocks or sandbags.







, While you can build one from wood and fiberglass, you can also buy one pre-built online or from a garden supply store. A cold frame is about 18 inches (46 cm) in the back and 12 inches (30 cm) in the front, with a clear, slanted roof that gathers the sun's warmth from an angle.

, Raised beds use stones, bricks, or wood to create frames around the vegetable plot. These frames are then filled with nutrient-rich soil. By keeping your winter vegetables elevated, you can keep the soil warmer than ground soil by a difference of 8 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit (11 to 13 degrees Celsius).

, Ground coverings insulate the soil, keeping it warmer overall than it would be if exposed directly to the brisk winds of winter.

Use soil to keep your root vegetables covered. Pile the soil around the shoulders of your root vegetables, like carrots, but do not cover the leaves that sprout above ground. The leaves need to absorb sunlight, but keeping the root vegetable itself covered is often a sufficient way to protect these crops against frost.






Warm things up with mulch. A coating of mulch should be applied to the crops just before the ground freezes. In extremely cold regions, the layer may need to be as deep as 1 foot (30.5 cm), but it can be a bit lighter in warmer regions with less severe temperatures. For best results, use light mulch, like stray, pine needles, shredded leaves, or grass clippings. You can even get as heavy as light bark mulch, especially in colder regions. Make sure that you do not pile the mulch over the sprouting leaves. Otherwise, you may inadvertently kill the crops by depriving them of sunlight.







, You can grow many vegetables during the winter in your home, provided you have enough space and the proper resources. Most vegetables have deep root systems and need to be planted in containers with considerable depth. Frequent watering is often necessary, depending on the specific vegetable you choose to grow, and you may need to supplement natural light with artificial grow lights if the gray winter skies do not let much light in through your windows.

Buy a packet of sweet pepper seeds.,
Plan to sow sweet pepper seeds indoors in late winter.,
Plant the seeds in peat pots.,
Keep the seedlings warm and moist.",How to Grow Sweet Peppers1," Standard sweet pepper seeds, which produce, red, yellow or orange bell-shaped peppers, are available in any well-stocked garden center. If you're interested in getting heirloom varieties, check online for a wide range of options. Heirlooms come in all sorts of colors and have varying levels of sweetness.;
, Sweet pepper seeds take awhile to germinate, and they will not survive outside until the temperature warms up to 70 °F (21 °C). Give yourself eight to ten weeks to start the seeds before the weather warms to at least 70 degrees and all chance of frost has passed.

, Place three seeds in each pot. Plant the seeds a quarter-inch deep. If three seedlings emerge, you'll weed out the weakest one and let the stronger two grow as one plant. Having two sets of leaves protects the plants and helps them grow more healthy than they would as individuals.Peat pots are available at garden stores. They make transplanting easier, since you can plant the peat directly in your garden bed.
You can also purchase seed starter soil and plant the seeds in two-inch seed pots or flats.

, The seedlings need to be kept at a temperature between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit to germinate properly. Set them in direct sunlight in a warm room, and sprinkle water on the soil to moisten it. Make sure the soil never dries out.


It is important that these seedlings get enough light to grow. You can always add a fluorescent light, if needed.
Be careful when watering that you do not disturb the soil in the cups. A light mist is a good way to water.

"
"
Harden off the seedlings ten days before planting them outside.,
Prepare the soil in your garden a week prior to planting.,
Dig holes 18 to 24 inches apart in the garden.,
Set the sweet pepper plants with into the holes.",How to Grow Sweet Peppers2," Do this by placing the seedlings in a sheltered outdoor space, like a garden shed or covered outdoor area. Make sure they still get plenty of light. Hardening off the seedlings will help them get used to the outdoor climate before they're planted making the transition less jarring.

, Time it so that you work the soil right as the weather is warming up. It's best to work the soil after all chance of frost has passed, and the temperature is steadily climbing toward an average of 70 degrees. Choose a spot in full sun and loosen the soil with a garden rake and add organic compost.


Make sure the soil drains well by soaking it with water. If the water puddles in the soil, you'll need to add extra compost and organic material. If the water soaks in immediately, it drains well enough for planting.
If you are planting in a garden pot, it should be at least 8 inches diameter to accommodate the plants' growth.

, The holes should be large enough to accommodate the plants and their root balls, about 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep and wide. If you're planting multiple rows, make sure they're two feet apart.

, If the plants is in peat pots, you can remove the top portion of the pots and plant the rest of the peat pot in the ground with the plant. If the plants are in any other type of pot, you will need to turn the plant over to remove the plant and dirt from the pot before setting it in the hole.


To help the dirt settle, pour some water in the holes with a watering can and pack more dirt around the plants if necessary.
Try the sulfur trick: stick a few matches upside down alongside each plant in the soil. The sulfur from the matches helps pepper plants grow stronger.

"
"
Keep the soil moist.,
Fertilize the plants after they fruit.,
Weed the pepper plants often.,
Monitor the plants for pests.,
Stake the plants if they get heavy.,
Pull or cut the peppers off when they mature.",How to Grow Sweet Peppers3," Pepper plants like heat, but they need moist soil. Water your sweet pepper plants several times a week throughout the summer. Daily watering may be necessary during particularly dry, hot spells. You can help keep the soil moist by mulching it with grass clippings.Water near the roots, rather than showering the water from overhead. This prevents the leaves from getting burned by the sun.
Water in the morning, rather than at night. This way the water will be absorbed during the day. Watering at night leaves the plants prone to mold growth.

, This will help the plants produce large, healthy peppers.

, Hoe around the plants to keep weeds away. Be careful and do not hoe too deeply, or you may cut into the roots of your pepper plants. You may also pull the weeds by hand. Be sure to discard the weeds in a separate area so they don't drop seeds and grow back.

, Pepper plants are susceptible to aphids and flea beetles. If you see pests on your plants, pick them off and drop them in a pail of soapy water. You can also spray them off using a strong stream from your garden hose. As a last resort, spray your plants with pesticides, making sure they're safe for use on vegetables.


If you're dealing with a big pest problem, you can cuff the plants. Arrange a piece of cardboard in a circular fashion around the stem of each plant. Make sure the cardboard sticks into the soil about an inch deep, and rises up several inches. This will prevent insects from climbing up the stems.

, Place a garden stake next to the main stem and fasten the stem to it loosely with twine. This will help the plant grow upright and keep the peppers from growing against the ground.

, The peppers are ready to cut when they're bright and color and look fully ripe. When the peppers have reached the correct shape, color and size, harvest them by cutting them off with a knife. The plant will now be free to produce new fruit."

Planting in the ground is great if you have good soil and don’t mind getting down on your hands and knees. It is often the best option if you want to grow large amounts of vegetables.
Raised beds work well if you don’t have very good soil and/or you have a bad back.
Container gardens are great if you only want to plant a few things or if you don’t have a yard to plant vegetables in.;
, Make a list of all of the vegetables that you would like to grow. If you are new to gardening, then you might want to start by growing some of these vegetables, which are considered easy to grow.bush beans
beets
carrots
cucumbers
lettuce
snap peas
radishes
tomatoes
zucchini or yellow summer squash
herbs

, As you think about the vegetables you would like to grow in your garden, consider the following: space, time, and amount of vegetables you will eat.Space. How much room do you have available to plant your vegetable garden? If you have a small space, you will need to limit the number of vegetables that you plant, or select a plant that takes up a small amount of space.
Time. How much time do you want to put into your garden every day? The bigger the garden, the more time you will have to put into it.
Amount of vegetables you will eat. How much will you and/or your family eat? A large garden may provide you with more vegetables than you will be able to consume each week.

, Whether you want to plant a vegetable garden in the ground or just plant some veggies in containers, you will need to find a spot that satisfies basic garden criteria.Choose a spot where your veggies will get at least 6-8 hours of full sunlight each day.
Choose a spot that you can reach with a hose. If you are planning a container garden, then you can just use a watering can.
Choose a spot with good soil. If you are planning a container garden, then just use good soil in the containers. If you are planting in the ground, be sure to test the soil to see if anything needs to be added., If you are going to plant your vegetables in the ground or in a raised bed, create a rough sketch of where you will plant each vegetable. The most common way to arrange vegetables in a garden is in rows. As you plan and sketch, allow for about 18 inches between each row so that you will be able to access the plants for weeding, watering, and harvesting. You can use your sketch as a guide when you plant your garden.Raised beds can be planted with narrower spacing the rows of vegetables in the ground.

, When you have decided what you want to grow in your garden, purchase your seeds. Make sure to check seed packet instructions for ideal planting times and other information that might help you decide which ones will work best in your garden.You can also buy seedling plants if you will be putting in your garden a bit late or if you just want to make sure that your garden gets off to a good start. But keep in mind that plants are more expensive than seeds.If you are starting with a small garden or a few containers, it may be easier to purchase small plants rather than trying to start from seeds.

, Before you begin planting your vegetable garden, you will need to gather some basic gardening tools. spade
garden fork
hoe
hose
wheelbarrow (or a bucket if you are going to plant in containers)

, You will probably get dirty planting your garden, so it is a good idea to wear gloves and clothes that you don't mind getting dirty.

, If you are planting your vegetable garden in the ground, then you will need to use a tiller or hoe to loosen the soil before planting your seeds and/or plants. If you are planting your vegetable garden in raised beds or containers, then you do not have to worry about this step. Instead, you will need to put soil into your raised beds or containers., Follow the directions on the seed packets to determine how deep to make this trench and how far apart your trenches should be. Garden rows should be about 18 inches apart, but some vegetables may require more space.If you have purchased plants, dig a hole twice the size of the container that it came in, and fill with loose soil. Then plant it in the soil at the same depth as it was growing in the pot. Some plants, such as tomatoes, may be planted deeper.

, Follow the directions on the seed packets to determine how far apart and how deep to place your seeds. Some packets will also instruct you to put more than one seed into each space.Read the instructions carefully to be sure., After you plant your seeds in the ground, cover them up with a thin layer of dirt and pack the dirt lightly. Follow the directions on the seed packets to determine how much dirt should go over the seeds., To keep track of where you planted everything, you will need to place markers at the ends of your rows or in your containers. One easy way to mark your veggies is to write the name of the vegetables on popsicle sticks and place the sticks about halfway into the ground at the end of each row or in each container., After you have finished planting your seeds, you will need to give your garden its first drink. Ground gardens drain more slowly than raised beds and container gardens, so you will need to give more water to your seeds the first time that you water them if you have planted them in raised beds or containers., Vegetables need about an inch of water per week to grow, and in especially dry, hot regions they may need twice that amount.Test your soil daily to see if it requires watering by sticking your bare finger into the soil. If the top inch of the soil is dry, then you need to water your garden.Hold off for a bit on using the hose if the forecast calls for rain. Mother nature might water your garden for you some days, but check your soil after it rains to make sure the rain has provided your plants with enough moisture.Remember that raised beds and containers drain faster than ground gardens, so you will probably need to water more frequently if you have planted a raised bed garden or container garden., Check your garden for weeds about every other day and pluck them out as soon as you notice them. Do not wait for them to mature. The sooner you pick out a weed, the better. If you wait too long to pull a weed, it may go to seed and spread more weeds throughout your garden., Whether you plant in a container, raised bed, or directly in the ground, mulching your plants will help keep them healthy and productive. Mulch around them as soon as they are big enough that you can spread mulch without covering them up., Pick veggies as they become ripe. Once vegetables begin to ripen, check your garden daily so that you don’t miss out on any of your harvest. Some vegetables can be harvested when they are young, such as lettuce and squash. The plant will continue to produce more even after you pick them and many plants even produce more as a result of picking them."

",How to Grow Swedes or Rutabaga," The best soil type for swedes is a well-drained, light soil that has been manured well. Provided there is good drainage, swedes will also grow well in heavy clay soils that receive regular moisture.;
, This is very important as it allows the bulbous roots plenty of time to grow before the coldest of winter strikes.

, Place the large, bullet-shaped seeds in drills to a depth of 2 centimeter (0.8 in) in light soils. Make it only 1.25 centimeter (0.5 in) for a heavier soil.

, The seeds should germinate within 7 - 12 days. Thin the seedlings to 22 centimeter (8.7 in) intervals about three weeks following sowing. This will be when the seedlings have developed their first set of rough leaves.

, Swedes will grow through autumn (fall) and winter. They can be pulled when required and left in the ground to keep growing in the meantime.

Wait.",How to Grow Sunchokes or Jerusalem Artichokes," You will want to pick a spot in your yard that gets at least partial sun, full sun being best.;
, Sunchoke really thrives in almost any soil, but like any plant, will flourish in optimum conditions. Use a good organic soil mix, peat moss, organic compost, and food grade diatomaceous earth in roughly a 45-25-20-10 mix.

, You will need to decide if you will plant in the ground (not suggested) or in containers. A raised bed garden is ideal, the length of the fence. It helps the plant from spreading and also creates a living privacy fence rather quickly!


Once sown in soil, sunchoke is almost impossible to eradicate. Please plant responsibly.






Your container should be well drained and at least 2' deep and equally as wide. Keeping in mind how tall the plant grows, you may need to invest in a weighted pot (or pour in some concrete) so that it doesn't get too top heavy and topple over.







, Choose any rhizome that is not dried out and free from disease and parasites. Sunchoke will grow from even the smallest discarded bit so you should experience almost 100% germination and a healthy plant with seed rhizomes no matter the size. Plant 2""-3"" in the soil and cover.

, After you have planted the rhizomes in the soil, you will want to water thoroughly until some drains through the bottom of the container. Sunchokes, like sunflowers, appreciate water, although many people have had success growing in dry climates. 2""-3"" a week should be fine.

, It should only take about 3 days for the rhizome to start sprouting roots if the soil is warm, about another week to start popping up little stalks.

Protect your crops.",How to Grow Vegetables in the South (USA)," If possible, choose a location that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight every day.;
, Note which vegetables you want to plant first, as well as where you want to plant successive crops.


Consider the mature size of the vegetable. For example, melons require a lot of space and cannot be crowded.
Figure out the best spot to plant vegetables that prefer cool weather. Some leafy vegetables like spinach and lettuce, will wilt in full sun. Plant those in rows where they will eventually get some shade from taller vegetables.
Consult the back of your seed packages to see the length of maturation of each plant. If you plant several rows of carrots, which have a long maturation date, you won’t be able to use that space to plant more seeds later in the season.

, Till or hand spade your garden. Work in compost and till the soil again to make sure the compost is worked all the way through the soil.

, Get the most produce from your garden by grouping early-maturing crops. Plan to sow cabbage, carrots and beets in the same rows that you planted your early peas and beans. You can also plant corn in between rows of potatoes, radishes in between rows of lettuce, etc.

, Other plants like pole beans don’t need support because they are heavy, but if they lay on the ground, they will rot and attract garden pests.

, Don't wait for weeds to overtake tender sprouts or transplants. Mulching helps the soil stay moist and cool on hot days. Mulching will also help with weed control, and organic mulch will enrich the soil as it decomposes., Rainwater is best because it provides needed nutrients, but rain amounts vary greatly. Most plants, especially tomatoes, must have a lot of water to produce a high yield. Consider saving rainwater in barrels so that you can use it throughout the year.

, Put fencing around the garden to keep out deer, rabbits and other small animals.

, You want to get the maximum amount of harvest from your small garden. You don’t want to plant crops that take months to grow. You want early harvesting vegetables followed by mid and later season crops. Avoid vegetables such as:Pumpkins
Squashes
Parsnips
Leeks
Potatoes

, You won’t have the space to grow vegetables that spread or need a lot of space to thrive. Avoid planting:Brussel sprouts
Celery
Squashes
Potatoes
Asparagus

, You will want to choose a location that has water easily accessible to it. It will be quite burdensome to haul water a long distance to your garden. Make sure you have a spigot and hose that reaches the garden area., Vegetables need sun, and you want your garden to get lots of it. Ideally, your vegetable plants should get approximately six to eight hours of sun a day., A square foot garden uses blocked off sections to separate vegetable plantings. These types of gardens typically measure 4x4 ft (1.2x1.2 m).Build a square foot garden by using untreated lumber. Cut four boards into 4.25 ft (130 cm) lengths.Nail or stake all four ends together to create a square. This will be the outline of your garden.
Use strips of wood or string to divide your square foot garden into 16 equal sections. Each section will serve as a separate planting area.To use string, just drive small nails into the rim of the bed at one foot intervals. Then, tie string on each nail so that it runs across the bed. This will make a grid you can use for square foot gardening.
Group the same type plant seedlings into one square foot block. For square foot gardening, it’s OK to plant more densely than normally. You could grow one tomato or eggplant per square foot, or 3 to 4 leafy plants per square. Each square within your square foot garden will yield its own vegetable planting., As soon as one crop is harvested, plant a new one. For example, group quick growing crops like radishes or black seeded simpson lettuce together. Then, harvest these vegetables. You can then use the space for later plantings like beans or turnips.


Break your planting bed into sections. Plan to grow one crop for one or two months at a time.Stagger your plantings. This will allow one crop to grow fully and make room for another crop upon its harvest.

, Alternate rows of late-maturing vegetables like peppers and cabbage with early season growers like spinach and lettuce.Plant each crop according to size and spread. Group smaller crops in between larger crops to save on space.
Keep each row of planting within reach for harvest. You want to make sure you can pick your vegetables without stepping on or damaging other plants.
You will have to weed by hand because the crops will be placed close together.

, You can use any type of container to plant your vegetables in. Look for long troughs, wooden planter boxes, pots or other types of containers. They should be at least 5 gal (19 l) and at least 10 in (25 cm) wide by 12 in (30 cm) deep.


You can create drainage in your containers by drilling a series of holes in the bottom of each pot. Drill four to five, ¼ in (1/2 cm) holes in the bottom of each container. This will allow water to flow through.

, Sketch out a plan for planting your garden on paper. Keep in mind the space you need for each vegetable plant. This will provide a good diagram of the different vegetables you have room for in your garden.

, Break up the soil with a shovel. Remove any grass or weeds that may be present. Dig down at least one spade length (6 in) (15 cm) to ensure there is plenty of space for your vegetables to take root.Remove any rocks or stones.
Add additional soil. Use bagged soil or compost. Manure is also a good soil amendment – in other words, it will improve your soil’s quality.If you have clay soil, you can add compost to improve the tilth.Raised beds and containers should be filled with soil as well. Use a mixture of compost, peat moss, and vermiculite., This will help smooth the soil and allow your vegetables to take root easier. Break up any clumps of dirt that could impede plant growth.

, Begin planting your vegetables based on the plan you have created for your garden. Keep plants that harvest often to the outside of the bed. Allow plenty of space to harvest vegetables in the interior of your garden bed.


Spread seeds according to the instructions on the seed packet.
Space plants accordingly to their maximum size.

, After you have filled your garden with soil and plant your veggies, you need to water it thoroughly. You might moisten the soil some before you plant, too., Adding a layer of mulch to your garden will prevent weeds from growing around your vegetable plants. Spread it evenly and approximately 2 in (5 cm) thick. This will save you time on pulling weeds to maintain your garden.


Mulch will also keep in moisture.
Natural mulch options include; grass clippings, peat moss, straw, and leaves.
Prevent soil diseases by rotating your crops. Never grow the same vegetable in the same area for two seasons in a row.

, Your garden will need regular watering to ensure proper growth. Provide 1 in (2.5 cm) of water a week to your vegetable crops. When the weather is hot and dry, monitor the plants and water as needed., As your vegetables begin to ripen, you should pick them quickly. Be sure to harvest your vegetables often to make room for new growth in your garden."

, You may have to pare down your list or enlarge your garden space., Order seeds from a seed catalog or visit your local greenhouse nursery for seeds (and for transplants in late spring).

, You will have to start all seeds indoors that require a long maturation; vegetables like like cool weather, such as spinach, can be sown directly in the ground in early spring.


Germinate seeds in peat pots, small clay flower pots or a shallow pan.
Water the seeds thoroughly, but gently using a fine mist spray bottle.
Place the containers in a sunny window that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight a day. You can supplement sunlight with fluorescent tube lighting. Place the lights about 8” (203.2 mm) above the seed containers.
Seal off all drafts from the window and keep the room reasonably warm or the seeds won’t sprout.
Keep the soil moist; never let the soil dry out.
Transplant your seedlings to larger containers once they have developed leaves.
Harden your plants gradually or several weeks before you put them in the ground. Hardening, or toughening, prepares your vegetables to withstand the outdoor weather. You can harden the plants by placing them outside on a porch or patio for a few hours each day, or by decreasing the amount of water you’ve been giving them. Lowering the temperature in the room they grow in will also help toughen them up.

, Contact your local agricultural extension service to see if they perform soil samples, otherwise check your local garden store to see if they offer that service.

, This often means simply adding organic compost matter to enrich the soil.

, These can be planted before danger of frost is over.

, In some parts of the Midwest, you may not be able to do this until mid-June.

, A thick layer of mulch around the plants will help the soil retain moisture and control weeds.

Select a type of sprout to start with.,
Soak the seeds in a jar overnight with filtered water.,
Drain the soak water and rinse your sprouts twice a day.,
Maintain the proper environment for germination.,
Use fresh sprouts right away.",How to Grow Sprouts1," Organic seeds, beans, or nuts are all sproutable, using the same basic method. Make sure you get organic, or pesticide-free seeds intended for edible sprouts. Many commercial seeds, used for planting, are pre-coated with fungicides, pesticides, and other things that you won't want to eat. Experiment with a variety of seeds and legumes to learn what kind of sprouts you like best. It takes a minimal amount of preparation and supplies to start. Select between:



Seeds like sesame, sunflower, buckwheat, or pumpkin

Legumes or beans like mung beans, lentils, chickpeas, adzuki, or green peas

Whole grains like barley, corn, wheat, quinoa, amaranth or rye

Vegetable seeds like alfalfa, clover, radish, kale, cabbage, fenugreek, or turnip;
, Pour in enough water to cover the seeds and let sit. Cover the top with cheesecloth, or some type of repurposed mesh: a woman's stocking, a section of screen, anything you could cinch on top and drain through would be perfect.


Any type of clean glass jar is perfect for making sprouts. Old pickle jars, mason jars, or other glass containers can be repurposed for sprouts. If you've still got the metal ring around the mouth of the mason jar, you can use it to hold the mesh covering in place, or you could use a hair tie, rubber band, or other elastic band to do the same. You can also buy a plastic sprouting lid with a mesh top for draining sprouts.
If you want to sprout microgreens like wheatgrass or pea shoots, you'll also need seed beds, soil, and a bit more time on your hands.

, In general, you should rinse any type of sprouts every morning and evening, then drain them thoroughly to promote germination, without removing them from the jar.


When sprouting legumes, it's common to swirl some water in after a few days to break up the hulls and let the sprouts form.

, You'll control the moisture by periodically rinsing the sprouts, but you'll also need to maintain an even temperature to promote germination. Keep your sprouts between 50 and 70 degrees F.


If your home is especially cool at a particular time of year, you might need a heater. An 8-watt heater for reptile tanks placed under a sprouter will help without cooking them and ruining the germination.
Some sprouts such as radish sprout better in darkness, but they will need to be in light after sprouting in order to turn green and grow larger. In general, most sprouts are perfectly fine in the daylight and normal room-temperature conditions.

, As soon as you're happy with the length of your sprouts, enjoy them on sandwiches, salads, or soups. Put any uneaten sprouts in the refrigerator. They'll keep in the fridge for about five days, but will eventually start to brown and get a little slimy, which means it's time to sprout more and toss these out.


Each variety of sprout differs slightly in the length of time and the proper treatment of the sprouts, once soaked and germinated for several hours. Some can remain in the jar for a few days to grow longer and more tender, while others will need to be replanted onto a seed bed for optimum growth and deliciousness. Consult the specific section below for more information about the specific type of sprouts you want to grow.Some sprouts will need to be dehulled after sprouting for several days. Swirl the sprouts in water to help separate the hulls, and be sure to drain afterwards.

Start with about a cup of the seeds of your choice.,
Soak in cold water for between 4 and 6 hours.,
Let edible seeds sprout for between 12 and 24 hours.,
Let vegetable seeds sprout for about 6 days.,
Consider sprouting nuts for immediate eating.",How to Grow Sprouts2," Any organic and edible food-grade seeds would be perfect for sprouting. The soaking process opens up the hulls to activation the germination process, resulting in a nutritional snack that's not that different from the original seed, but loaded with nutrients.


Edible seeds like pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame are commonly-sprouted. They're quick-working and delicious as a highly-nutritious snack.
Vegetable seeds like clover, alfalfa, radish, cabbage, fenugreek, or kale make soft and tender sprouts loaded with micronutrients. These are the kind of sprouts most commonly served on sandwiches, small and light wisps of vegetable.

, Measure the seeds into your sprouting jar and then cover them with cool filtered water, covering them by about an inch or so. If the seeds are particularly dusty, or covered in other sediment, give them a rinse first before adding the water.


Let soak for 4 hours at room temperature. Leaving them directly on the counter top in your kitchen is fine. Then drain the water thoroughly and let the seeds start sprouting., After you've drained the water off, do nothing for about a day. The seeds will start activating as if they were preparing to grow, and you'll be well on your way to producing sprouts. After a day, they're ready to eat!


After a day, remove the seeds from the jar and lay them out on a paper towel to dry thoroughly. Return them to a bowl or other container and keep them in the refrigerator. They should be good for several days, and ready to eat.
Sesame seeds, in general, become quite bitter if left for longer than six hours. Try to catch them ahead of time, then dry them thoroughly.

, Vegetable seeds will take a little longer to fully sprout to their desired length, as long as 5 or six days. While they're edible at any stage in the process, the resulting sprouts will usually be more tender and nutritious after a few days. Maintain regular rinsing and thorough drying, preferably storing the jar upside down so excess moisture can drain out and keep the sprouts fresh.


Use your eyes and nose to check on the freshness of vegetable sprouts. They'll start to turn brown and smell slightly chlorinated when they turn.

, Nuts like almonds, hazelnuts, and other oilseeds are commonly soaked for a few hours to ""activate"" their enzymes and make them more nutritious.The nutritional benefit of soaking nuts to activate the germination before eating them is somewhat unconfirmed, but if you're interested in trying, it's an easy project.


Only raw nuts will benefit from soaking. This will not work with roasted nuts.

Select a bean or legume variety to sprout.,
Soak legumes in warm water.,
Let sprout for about 3 whole days.,
Dry off the sprouts and store them in the refrigerator.",How to Grow Sprouts3," Perhaps the heartiest and the most famous sprouts are the bean sprouts. Legumes sprout thick protuberances that are nutritious and taste great, full of active micronutrients and flavor. Common legumes for sprouting include:


lentils, green or brown especially
chickpeas or garbanzo beans
mung beans, which are commonly sold in stores as ""bean sprouts""
green peas

, Start with about a half cup of dried beans (they tend to plump up some as they absorb water and shake their hulls). The water shouldn't be steaming, but warm to the touch, like a cup of tea you've let sit a bit too long. In your sprouting jar, soak the beans for at least 12 hours.


Because the legumes will plump up considerably, make sure there's enough space in the jar and cover the beans by several inches to make sure they'll stay submerged.

, Rinse the beans twice a day, and store them upside down to drain properly as the sprouts grow. Sometime the first or second day, you might need to shake the jar slightly to remove the hulls. You can add some water and swirl the jar gently to remove them. If some stay on, don't worry to much. You'll be able to pull them off before eating, if necessary.


Adzuki beans typically need about 4 days to sprout to their fullest and most delicious potential. Give them some extra time.

, After the sprouting period is over, you can remove the sprouts from the jar, gently dry them out and remove any extra hulls that haven't separated, or you can leave them on (they're edible, though somewhat bitter). They should be good in the fridge for about a week, if you keep an eye on them and keep them relatively dry.


Bean sprouts are particularly good as a topping for broth-based soups, like Vietnamese pho or other spicy dishes. They're also perfect on salads and sandwiches.

Choose a grain to sprout as a raw alternative.,
Soak whole grains in warm water.,
Harvest the sprouts.,
Make sprouted flour.",How to Grow Sprouts4," Because whole grains aren't digestible unless cooked, it makes it difficult for raw food enthusiasts to enjoy them. Sprouting grains, however, makes them easily digestible and nutritious. Without cooking, you can enjoy whole grains like rye, wheat, barley, or corn, without baking and breaking down their micronutrients.


Sprouting grain neutralizes difficult-to-digest phytic acid, releasing vitamins and nutrients not generally present in raw grain. This makes it ideal for porridges, baking, and making into sprouted flour.Hulled oats, like the kind you buy at the store to make oatmeal, won't sprout. To sprout grains, you need to buy whole grains still in their hulls, raw and organic. Other types of grains will just soak. You can ferment oatmeal with miso paste overnight, for a quick live culture option.

, Grain will triple in size over the soaking process, so it's important to start with a jar or bowl large enough to hold three times the amount of flour that you put into it to soak. Soak the grains for about 6 hours, then drain the water thoroughly and sprout them at room temperature for about 2 days. Rinse periodically and drain thoroughly.


Corn needs to undergo a slightly longer presoak, about 12 hours before draining the water and letting it sprout.
Amaranth, quinoa, and millet, commonly-mistaken for varieties of seed or rice, are actually alkaline grains, and are perfectly-sproutable using this method.
Barley won't actually sprout, but you can activate the germination process, as is done when malting barley for making alcohol, by ""sprouting"" it for about 12 hours. This will activate the process and start breaking down the hull.

, Once the tip of the sprout is about 1/4 inch long, it is ready to be used. Rinse the grains one last time. Lay them on a dry towel, and let them dry. Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator., To turn sprouted grains into flour, you'll need a food dehydrator and a grinder designed for grains. After they've sprouted, dehydrate the grains for about 12 hours and grind them into a fully-integrated and fine flour, sifting if desired. You can store this sprouted flour in the freezer to maintain it's life, and use it as you would any type of baking flour."

Sprout your greens for a more substantial project.,
Get some seeding trays.,
Line seeding trays with soil.,
Bed the sprouts on the soil.,
Water twice a day and keep them in low light.,
Harvest sprouts or grass in about 10 days.",How to Grow Sprouts5," The process for starting a small batch of microgreens like wheatgrass, pea shoots, or sunflower greens is remarkably similar, though slightly more equipment-intensive, than sprouting in your kitchen. You'll be able to trim multiple high-yield crops of sprouting greens from these projects, however, making them a good investment, especially if you're into wheatgrass shots or fresh shoots on your salad.


Start your sprouts like normal, soaking wheat seeds, green peas, or sunflowers in a jar and letting them sprout for about before rinsing them thoroughly and moving them to a seeding tray.
Sprouts need to have about quarter-inch roots showing before you move them to the seeding tray. Depending on what you're going to plant, this may take a varying amount of time, possibly 3 or 4 days., An outdoor sprouting system usually consists of trays for the sprouts to sprout and grow in, with mesh or holes on the bottom to drain from regular waterings. These are commonly available at gardening outlets, or you can make your own by punching some drain holes in the bottom of any sort of tray large enough to hold about a foot-square of soil.

, Line your seeding tray with a generous amount of soil. You don't need much, since the sprouts will be mostly growing on top and not producing substantial root systems, but it's better to have enough to trap moisture so you don't need to worry about your starts drying out.


Moisten the soil thoroughly with water and let any puddles dissipate before translating your sprouts onto the soil.
It's also common to line the bottom of plating or sprouting trays with small sections of blanket to keep the soil moist from underneath, and to mix in a small amount of vermiculite--about a cup for a 10 x 10 tray--to promote growth.

, Sprinkle your sprouts evenly on the top of the soil, spreading them out so none are piled on top of one another, which can cause molding. Use a covering tray, or a simple blanket or some sort, to cover the tray. Push down slightly on the seeds to seat them in the soil, but be gentle. You don't need to ""plant"" them.

, A few times a day, mist your sprouts and keep a close eye on them. Make sure they're getting enough water and air circulation to promote growth, and Try to keep them around room temperature, if possible. Growing sprouts in a shed with plenty of cool shade can be a nice place to keep your starts, like this.

, Wheatgrass will be tall and verdurous after about a week, but give it a few more days to reach it's full nutritional peak. Pea shoots will fill out and turn a lovely shade of green, and will be at their peak of tender deliciousness around the 10 day mark. Harvest the tops and let them continue growing, if you wish, or consider planting them to start your own crop.

Use and store the beans.",How to Grow Soybeans," There are thousands of different types of soybeans. If you want to eat your soybeans, make sure you have an edible, green variety. If you want to make soy milk or flour, find a yellow-seeded variety. If you are planning on drying the soybeans, get a black-seeded variety., Choosing the right soil for your soy plants has many advantages, including that there will be fewer weeds, less erosion, and the right balance of nutrients and pH in the soil. This will produce healthier plants with better yields.


The best type of soil for soybeans is well-draining loam that isn't packed too tightly.If you're working with soil that has a high clay content, you can make it more suitable for growing soy by mixing it with peat moss, sand, or mulch.

, Soybean plants will generally produce the highest yields when the beans are planted in May, but the soil temperature is something you have to take into consideration as well.


The ideal time to plan soybeans is two to three weeks after the last frost, when the soil warms to about 60 F (15.5 C) and the air to about 70 F (21 C)., Soy plants need a good balance of nutrients in the soil to grow properly. If there are too many or too few nutrients, the plants won’t grow properly. Therefore, it’s important to add a fertilizer to the soil if the area hasn’t been enriched in recent years.


For soil that hasn’t been enriched recently, add aged manure or compost to the soil to add more nutrients to the seedbed before planting., One particular nutrient that soy plants require a lot of is nitrogen. The best way to ensure that they get what they need is to inoculate the beans with Bradyrhizobium japonicum, which is a nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium.To inoculate the beans, place the beans in a bucket and sprinkle them with the bacterium. Use a spade or small shovel to mix the beans and coat each one.
Keep the seeds out of direct sunlight and plant them within 24 hours of inoculation.
You can purchase Bradyrhizobium japonicum through catalogues, online, or in some gardening and farm supply stores.

, Sow the soybeans 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) deep into the soil, and space the beans about 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart. Plant the beans in rows that are about 30 inches (76 cm) apart.Water the beans once they’ve been planted, but only until the soil is moist. Do not overwater newly planted beans, otherwise they may crack.

, Rabbits love soybean shoots, and will devastate your crop if you don’t protect the growing plants. To protect your crop from rabbits, put a fence around the perimeter of your garden.You can make a simple fence by driving a few stakes into the ground around the garden and attaching chicken wire to them.
You can also purchase premade panels of garden fencing.
Another method is to plant metal rings throughout the garden bed and cover them with horticultural fleece.

, Once the crops have sprouted a few inches, you should remove weaker plants to let the stronger plants flourish. To this, cut the weak seedlings at ground level; do not disturb their roots. The remaining plants should be spaced about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) apart., Soybeans do not like to compete with weeds, and will quickly be choked out if there are lots of weeds growing in the same garden. Weed the garden bed often and pull out weeds with a spade or by hand.


Once the plants establish themselves and get larger, you don’t have to worry about weeding so much, because the soy plants will choke out the weeds on their own., Soybeans typically only need additional water during three stages: when they are first growing and before they erupt from the soil, when they are developing pods, and when they're flowering.


During these periods, make sure to water the plants frequently enough to keep the soil moist., Soybeans start to mature in September, and are ready for harvest when the pods are green and the seeds become plump and fully grown.Be sure to harvest the beans before the pods turn yellow. To harvest, simply pick the entire pod off the plant.


When the seeds are ready, the pods will be between two and three inches (five to eight cm) long.

, Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Fill another large pot halfway with water and fill the rest with ice. When the water comes to a boil, put the full pods into the water and boil them for five minutes. Then, remove them from the hot water with a slotted spoon and plunge them into the ice bath for five minutes.


Once the pods have cooled, remove them from the cold water and place them on a clean towel.
It’s important to blanch and shock the beans because you cannot properly digest raw soybeans.Blanching also makes it much easier to remove the beans from the pods.

, Take a cooled pod in your hands and gently pinch both ends. As you squeeze, the seams of the pod will open and the beans will pop out. Place the beans in a bowl and repeat until you’ve removed all the beans.


Be careful when you're squeezing the pod, because the beans will shoot out!Compost the hulls. Soybean hulls contain a lot of nutrients, and you can reclaim them by composting the hulls and putting the nutrients back into the soil., Once the soybeans have cooled, you can eat them immediately, use them in your favorite recipes, or store them for later use. The soybeans will keep in the fridge for about a week, or for storage up to a year, you can process them through:Freezing

Create a potting soil mix.,
Place the rhubarb seeds into pots.,
Keep the seeds warm.",How to Grow Rhubarb from Seed1," Rhubarb seeds are covered in a paper-like shell. Soaking the seeds for 1-2 hours before planting will prepare them for germination so that they begin rooting sooner.;
, Mix equal parts peat moss, vermiculite, and compost to make your own basic potting mix.Rhubarb does best in moderately acidic soil (pH 6.0 to 6.8). You can use a pH test kit or other methods to test the soil acidity.

, Use a small, 2-3 inch (5-8 cm) pot or starter tray with drainage holes on the bottom. Fill the pots or trays with your soil mixture. Using your finger, dig a small hole about ½ inch (1.2 cm) deep. Place 2 seeds in the hole, then cover them with dirt and water them.

Use peat pots or cow pots to make transplanting easier.
Keep the soil evenly moist, watering when necessary. Do not overwater, as this can drown the seeds.

, If the room temperature is below 70 °F (21.1 °C) (21 C), you can use a heating table or heating mat to speed the process.

Grow rhubarb as a perennial if you live in zones 1-8.If you live in a state closer to the central or northern areas of the United States, such as Maine, North Dakota, or Indiana, it’s best to grow your rhubarb perennially.,
Cover your planted seeds 8-10 weeks before the final frost.,
Harden the plants off before transplanting them.,
Transplant the plants to the garden 2 weeks before the last frost.,
Transport the plants to a shaded area.,
Use mulch to evenly distribute moisture.",How to Grow Rhubarb from Seed2,", Your growing seedlings need to be protected from the cold temperatures, so make sure that you put a protective cover overtop of them in this early stage while they’re fragile. Do this at least two months before your area’s estimated final frost of the year., Harden off your plants by taking them outside little by little to get used to the sun, rain, and cold before exposing them to the elements permanently., The plants should be about 4 inches tall at this point, so they’re ready to be transplanted. Remove the plants from their pot. Carefully tip the pots upside down to remove the plant and root ball. Dig a hole twice as wide and at least as deep as the pot your rhubarb is in.If the plant doesn’t come out with a little squeeze to the sides of the pot, you can use a butter knife to cut around the soil. It also helps to water the plants about an hour before your remove them from their pots.
If you used a peat pot or a cow pot you can simply place the pot with the plant into the soil.

, Prepare a suitable part of the garden. Choose somewhere cool that the rhubarb can happily grow at its own pace. Clear out enough space in the ground so that you can plant the roots 36-48 inches (90-120 cm) apart. Planting any closer together will crowd the plants.

In warmer climates it is important to find shade for your plants during hotter months. You can plant the rhubarb by tall shade plants (tomatoes, pole lima beans), or create shade with a shade cloth., In order to allow your plants to thrive, you’ll need to keep them consistently and evenly moist. They’ll die if the sun dries their roots out. Mulching will keep the rhubarb roots properly cool and moist."
"
Grow as an annual if you live in zone 9 or higher.,
Start your seeds in August in a shady location.,
Transplant the plants to the garden once they’re 4 inches (10.2 cm) tall.",How to Grow Rhubarb from Seed3," Rhubarb can grow perennially in most areas of the U.S., but places like southern California, Texas, and Florida may only be able to grow rhubarb annually., Rhubarb doesn’t do well in intense heat, so once you’ve soaked the seeds and planted them in a soil-filled pot, you’ll need to find a shady area for them. Either put the pot in a shaded spot outdoors or keep the pot indoors. This way, the seeds will stay healthy during hotter months as they’re growing into plants., Transplant the plants to the garden after about 30 days in the pot. At this point, they should be about 4 inches tall. Carefully tip the pots upside down until the plant and root ball slide out. Dig a hole that’s twice as wide as the plant. Plant the root balls as deep as they were in their pots.


To get the plants out of the pot, it helps if you water them an hour or so beforehand. If the root ball doesn’t come out with a little squeeze to the sides of the pot, you can use a butter knife to cut around the soil.
If you used a peat pot or a cow pot you can simply place the pot with the plant into the soil.To avoid overcrowding the plants, clear out enough space in the ground so that you can plant the seeds 36-48 inches (90-120 cm) apart.
Consider planting the rhubarb on a raised bed or in a hillside to avoid drainage issues."
"
Water your plants regularly.,
Consider growing rhubarb from a crown while you wait.,
Harvest perennial plants a few stalks at a time.,
Harvest your annual rhubarb between March and May.",How to Grow Rhubarb from Seed4," It is essential to keep the soil evenly moist, so keep a close eye on your plants in the summer for signs of withering, yellowing, or dry soil. For best results, water your plants in the morning.Be careful not to overwater the plants, as they are susceptible to root rot. To avoid this, you can plant rhubarb on a hillside or on raised beds.

, Because a rhubarb crop can take several years to become established, you might want to grow a couple of plants from a crown while your seeds grow, mature, and become harvestable., Wait at least two years until you start harvesting your rhubarb so that the plant can become established. Pull off the stalks at soil-level. To keep the plant healthy, only take a few stalks at a time.Only eat the stalks -- rhubarb leaves are toxic!, Areas that grow rhubarb annually tend to have severely hot summer temperatures. Make sure to harvest your rhubarb in the late spring before the heat has a chance to kill the crop."

Harvest them 100 days after planting.",How to Grow Lentils," It may be difficult to find packaged lentil seeds at your local garden center. You may need to go to a specialty garden retailer or purchase from an organic seed business online. However, for planting purposes, any dry lentils that you find in the grocery store will work just fine., Place the seeds into a colander and rinse them with a bit of water. Pick out and throw away any that are broken, cracked, or discolored. Quality lentil seeds should have a light brown, sometimes greenish, tint., Lentils thrive with the cool, crisp weather of March. Then, they reach maturity in the hot temperatures of summer. To keep your seeds alive, the ground temperature will need to be at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) when you plant. If you have a frost after planting, don’t worry as most seedlings will survive this, even if they have to restart from the roots.If you want more flexible planting options, lentils can also be planted indoors as long as the room temperature is kept around 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius). In colder seasons, some people use indoor garden lighting to maintain a consistent temperature., Lentils grow well in both open gardens and containers. The key is to provide the plant with plenty of full sunlight. It helps to plant them alongside low lying plants so that the lentils are not overshadowed. Make sure that the soil stays moist without accumulating standing water on the top, as that can rot out the roots.If you choose to plant your lentils in a container, choose one that is at least 8 inches deep to allow for full root maturity.If you are concerned about the quality of your soil, get a quick pH test from the garden store. Lentils grow well in the pH range 6.0-6.5.

, Measure out approximately one cup of whole, rinsed lentils. Let them soak in cold water for 8-12 hours. Drain and place the soaked seeds into a glass jar. Cover the opening with some cheesecloth secured by a rubber band. Two times each day fill the jar with water and drain it out through the cheesecloth.Check that the jar is only one third full with seeds, so that they will have room to grow. You should see sprouts in just a few days.
Once you see the lentils sprouting you can keep watering for 4-5 days more and then the sprouts should be close to ready to harvest.

, Before you plant your seeds, sprinkle or spray them with a healthy mixture of bacteria, also called an inoculant, purchased from your garden store. A general use inoculant labeled for peas and beans will work just fine. This pretreatment helps your lentils to sprout additional nodules, or extensions, in their roots. This will make them more resistant to weather changes and will produce a better harvest., If your soil is moist and in good condition, plant the seeds at a depth of one inch. If your soil is drier on top, then go to a maximum depth of 2.5 inches (6.4 cm). Don’t exceed this as the seeds will not be able to sprout if they are buried too deep., In a container, try to spread your seeds out at least one inch (2.5 cm) apart. If you are planting in rows follow this same guideline and keep the rows six inches (15 cm) apart as well. With this planting sequence it is possible to yield around one pound of dry lentils per each 100 square feet (30.5 meters)., Fully grown lentils can stand over 2.5 feet (76 cm) tall. If they droop, then their flowers and seed pods can break off or touch the ground. Add a low trellis to support them and wind the plants through the gaps. Or, secure them to bamboo supports with cotton string.To create a quick trellis, get a few bamboo stalks. Stick them into the ground near the lentils. Hook the lentils to the stalks with cotton string. Then, attack the stalks to one another using cotton or nylon cord., Like other plants that enjoy the heat, lentils are fairly drought tolerant. But, they’ll grow the best if you water them just to the point of moistening. If you press your finger against the soil, it should come away damp but no water should rise from the pressed area., Lentils can be quickly killed off and blocked out by competing weeds. To prevent this, spend a bit of time each week picking out any weeds from your planting area. If the lentils are growing on top of one another, take this opportunity to thin them out as well to protect your final harvest.More air circulation will also lessen the possibility of fungus and other disease that thrive on stagnant soils.

, Tiny, pear-shaped, sap-sucking insects called aphids, in particular, are drawn to lentils and may eat them. If you see any aphids, get a bottle and spray them with water until they fall off. If you see weevils on your crops, then pull out any affected plants and discard them quickly.If deer or other animals begin to intrude on your lentil patch, them create a fenced in area or place a light netting on top of the plants.

, Go through your lentil patch and cut the plants off at the soil line when the pods toward the bottom of the plant begin to sound shaky when rattled. They may also look yellow-brown in appearance. Then, break open the pods to remove the seeds from the interior. Let them air dry for a bit before rinsing them out.You can store the harvested lentils in an airtight container until you plan to use them.

Store excess beans for later.",How to Grow Pole Beans," Like most beans, pole beans get planted directly outside in spring when there's no longer a risk of frost. For many areas, this will be in mid- to late-spring. Pole beans can be planted when the soil temperature reaches 60 F (16 C).Most beans are sensitive to cold and cannot tolerate frost, which is why it’s important to plant later on in spring.;
, Pole beans need full sun to grow properly and produce the highest yields, so choose a garden bed that gets lots of exposure throughout the day. Don’t choose a garden that’s near fennel, onions, basil, beets, or cabbage. Good companion plants for pole beans include:Carrots
Strawberries
Cauliflower
Eggplant
Potatoes
Peas

, The ideal soil pH for pole beans is between 6 and 6.5. They also need well-draining soil that’s been enriched with organic matter. To prepare the seed bed for these beans:Combine a well-draining soil, such as silt or loam, with aged compost
Amend a compact soil like clay with peat moss, manure, or shredded bark to help it drain better

, Because pole beans grow tall, they need a support to grow on. It’s easiest to build the support before planting, and this will prevent damage to the beans and roots. The best supports for pole beans include trellises, teepees or pyramids, poles, chicken wire, or large tomato cages.


Tomato cages can be purchased from most home and garden stores
You can also find garden fence panels and pyramid trellises at many garden supply stores
You can also make your own teepee or pyramid trellis by lashing bamboo stakes together, Pole beans are a type of legume, and like most legumes they require plenty of nitrogen in the soil to thrive. The easiest way to make sure they have this is by inoculating the beans with nitrogen-fixing bacteria before planting.


Be aware that inoculation is an optional step for growing pole beans – it’s not absolutely necessary.
To do it, soak the beans in warm water for five minutes. Drain the water and place the beans on a damp towel. Sprinkle them with the inoculant powder just before planting.One common inoculant for legumes is Rhizobium leguminosarum, which can be purchased at many home and garden stores.

, You can plant and grow pole beans in either hills or rows. The method you choose will depend largely on the layout of your garden, the type of support you created, and personal preference. Hills typically work better with poles and teepees, while rows are better suited for trellises.To plant in hills, use gloved hands or a spade to make small mounds of soil around the base of the teepees or poles. Make each mound about 6 inches (15 cm) around and at least 2 inches (5 cm) high. Space the hills 30 inches (76 cm) apart. Poke four 1-inch (2.5-cm) deep holes in each hill, and place one bean in each hole. Cover the beans loosely with soil.
To plant in rows, use your hands or a spade to build up the soil into long rows that are 30 inches (76 cm) apart. Poke a 1-inch (2.5-cm) deep hole for each bean, and space the beans 4 inches (10 cm) apart. Place a bean in each hole and cover it loosely with soil.

, During active growing periods like sprouting and producing pods, the beans will need sufficient water to grow. Keep the soil evenly moist when you first plant the beans and when they start developing pods. Make sure they get about an inch (2.5 cm) of water per week.When the beans have sprouted but aren't yet developing pods, you can let the soil dry out between waterings.

, Adding a layer of mulch to the top of the soil will help the soil retain moisture, regulate temperature, and protect the seedlings. When the seedlings develop their second set of leaves, add a 3-inch (8-cm) layer of mulch to the top of the garden bed.Mulch will also help prevent weeds from growing in the garden. This is important because pole beans have shallow roots, and don’t do well when competing with weeds.

, When weeds do start growing in the same garden as the beans, remove them immediately. To prevent damage to the bean roots, pull out weeds by hand.


Weeding the garden bed is especially important in the first six weeks after planting., If you plant pole beans year after year, you should definitely use crop rotation. Beans should not be planted in the same place (or a place where any legume was planted) 2 years in a row, because they deplete the soil of certain nutrients. Diseases can also linger.Beans deplete certain nutrients but also add nitrogen to the soil as they grow. Following beans with a plant that thrives in nitrogen-rich soil, like a member of the cabbage family (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and others), is a good idea.

, The first bean pods should be ready for harvest within 50 to 70 days of planting. If you harvest the pods every couple days as they mature, the plants will continue producing pods for several days or even weeks.


Pods are ready for harvest when they are long, crisp, and firm. However, harvest the pods before the beans inside become plump and developed.
Harvest beans from dry plants to prevent the spread of bacteria. If necessary, wait until the late morning or early afternoon so morning dew has dried., To eat your beans fresh, eat them the day you pick them, or store them in the fridge for a few days. Any beans that aren't going to be eaten within this time should be prepared for storage.Fresh beans can be eaten raw in salads, sandwiches, and other dishes, or they can be cooked.

, Freezing and canning are the best options for beans that aren't going to be eaten right away. For the best results, prepare your beans for storage within a few hours of picking them.


To freeze the beans, first boil them in water for three minutes. Then plunge them into ice water for another three minutes. Dry the beans completely and transfer them to sealable bags before moving to the freezer."

These can be very invasive so you may prefer to grow them in containers.
They do well in cooler climates and are best harvested after the first frost each year.;
, Globe artichokes are grown for their edible flowers and make a striking visual addition to any garden. They are available in perennial or annual varieties:


You can harvest from annual plants int the first year, but a perennial will not produce edible crop the first year. However, once the perennial variety does start producing, it will regrow year after year in warmer climates (zone 7 or above).
Another advantage of the perennial variety is that it offers bigger crops than annuals when they do eventually flower. These types of artichokes favor a sunny spot and regular watering., Cardoons are a lovely silvery plant similar in appearance to the thistle or artichoke.


They grow easily from seed, favor a sunny spot, and grow to huge but attractive garden plants which provide an unusual vegetable dish over winter months.
You’ll need to blanch the stems before eating them. This is done by wrapping the plants into bundles, surrounding with straw and then piling up the earth around the plant.

, Asparagus fares well as a perennial vegetable in areas that get a cold winter.


Although the beds take a few years to get established, once you have a thriving asparagus patch you can rely on a regular spring crop every year.
For more information on growing asparagus, see this article.

, Horseradish is a strong-flavored root that is only needed in small amounts to add a kick to food. If you are growing this root crop as a perennial, leave some of the root behind and it will regrow.


Horseradish will grow best in zones 3 to 9 in either sun or partial shade. Grown as a perennial be prepared for it to spread – so consider planting it in a deep container if you want to restrict it. For more information on growing horseradish, see this article.
The zones refer to the average annual minimum winter temperature in your area. North America is split into 11 zones, each one 10 °F (−12 °C) warmer or colder than the one adjacent to it. To find out which zone you live in, go to the National Gardening Association's website., Strictly-speaking, rhubarb is an herb rather than a vegetable but it is commonly treated as a fruit in the kitchen. It loves a rich soil and does well in cooler climates.A rhubarb plant will often be productive over a decade but they will do best if divided every 4 years or so.
Rhubarb will benefit from a mulch of manure before winter sets in. For more information on growing rhubarb, see this article.

, Sorrel is a lemony herb that works well in sauces for fish. In zones 5 or warmer it will grow as a perennial. Unusually for a perennial, you can crop soon after sowing – often after about 2 months, making it a very early spring vegetable and salad leaf.


Sorrel will grow back after being harvested but the leaves turn bitter after the flowers appear so try to pinch these off as they appear. It makes a very early spring vegetable and salad leaf.
For more information on growing sorrel, see this article.

, Some plants can behave as perennials given the right climate. These include tomatoes, sweet potatoes and peppers. In cooler climates they will behave as annuals.


Some gardeners outside the tropics may have success getting these plants to behave as perennials by overwintering in heated greenhouses or conservatories.
However, this requires a lot of additional support and and an in-depth understanding of gardening which is beyond the scope of this article.

, As perennials will occupy their space in the garden for longer than annual crops, it’s particularly important to adequately prepare the soil so they have lasting nutrition. To do this, dig some organic matter such as mushroom compost or well-rotted manure into the ground ahead of planting.

, It’s important to feed perennial crops with fertilizer to ensure the cropping continues year after year. A general all-purpose fertilizer should be applied at least monthly during the growing season.

, Larger perennials - such as the globe artichoke - will also benefit from a mulch. Apply about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of an organic mulch (such as well-rotted manure) at the base of the vegetable plant to conserve soil moisture and suppress weeds. The mulch will also help to protect the roots., Perennial vegetables generally take longer to reach cropping stage than annual varieties. In many cases, you won’t be able to harvest any crops in the first year, especially if you are growing from seed. , There are some vegetables which aren't strictly perennial but can usually be counted on to self-sow. These are usually annual plants which produce seeds that fall to the ground and grow on their own, without any human intervention.


Some examples of self-sowing vegetables include everlasting spinach, parsley, carrots and cherry tomatoes.
To encourage self-sowing, avoid planting the parent vegetable in grow bags or narrow containers, as this leaves the seeds very little soil surface to fall onto.

, There are some useful vegetables that aren't perennial but live longer than annuals. Biennials tend to provide two growing seasons and this often means two crops.


Examples of biennial vegetables include chard, beetroot, brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, chard, collards, endive, kale, kohlrabi, leeks, onions, parsley, parsnip, rutabaga, salsify and turnips.
Cold-hardy cutting celery can provide a crop in spring and fall. Don’t believe people who say you can cut celery right back and it will regrow from the stump – this doesn't work too well in practice.

, Once grown, potatoes are often hard to get rid of because it’s so easy to overlook a few smaller tubers when harvesting a crop. These tubers will regrow the following season producing what’s known as ‘volunteer’ potatoes.


Generally this is frowned upon, because the tubers can carry diseases from one year to the next and the naturally-occurring spacing isn't optimal for a good crop. Therefore, it’s best to discourage potatoes from getting established as a repeat crop.
If your potatoes do return the following year without invitation, it’s best to earth them up (pile some more earth or manure around the base of the potato shoot) to prevent them being exposed to light. This will mean any potatoes you harvest won’t be green (green potatoes shouldn't be eaten).

Freeze beans for later use.",How to Grow a Bean Plant," In general, there are two overall types of beans: shell beans and snap beans. Both types can grow in either the pole- or bush-style, but the pods of the beans are what make them unique. Shell beans are primarily removed from their pod to be eaten, and are consumed fresh or dried to save for later. Snap beans are eaten inside their pod, and are only eaten fresh (not dried for later use). You can grow multiple styles of these beans directly adjacent to one another, because bean plants are self-pollinating and won’t cross-contaminate each other.


Popular shell beans include black beans, fava beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, and kidney beans.
Popular snap beans include snap (green) beans, adzuki beans, mung beans, asparagus beans, and scarlet-runner beans.;
, Pole beans are a type of beans that are vining and must be supported with a trellis or pole. Pole beans grow an average of 5- to 6-feet tall, and can grow either shell or snap bean. Pole beans generally thrive in cooler summer temperatures, as low as 50-degrees in the summer. In the US, they thrive in the northern states.


You can use whatever support system (trellis, pole, fence, arbor, etc.) that you want for pole beans.

, Bush beans are a type of beans that grow in off a bush, and do not need a trellis or pole for support. Generally, bush beans grow best in warm environments with summer temperatures reaching above 100-degrees. In the US, they thrive in the Southern states. Bush beans should be planted in large rows, requiring much more space than pole beans.


A variety of bush beans called ‘half-runners’ is a bush/pole hybrid, and may require some support or placement near a fence for stabilization., Beans are flexible plants, able to grow in both sun and shade. When possible, choose a garden plot in most or partial sunlight. Because pole beans grow primarily upwards, you need only a small space for them. Bush beans grow outwards, meaning that they require much more space; choose a plot 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) wide and as long as you desire (for the total number of beans you wish to plant).

, Beans should be planted after the last frost has passed, typically in the spring months of March and April. Planting too early in the season will cause the seeds to freeze and die, while planting too late may not give them enough time to mature for a harvest in the fall. Check with your local agricultural extension to find out the best planting time for your area.

, Beans are one of the few plants that should not be started as seedlings indoors or transplanted into your garden. This is because they have a delicate root structure that is easily damaged, and may not survive the transfer. As a result, you should sow your seeds directly into the ground come spring., Beans grow best in soil with good drainage and lots of nutrients. To prepare your soil, mix in a garden compost and gardening topsoil into your garden plot. Use a hoe to till the soil thoroughly and break apart any clay-like chunks. Incorporating the compost into the soil will help to provide plenty of nutrients to help the beans grow.


Beans are nitrogen fixing, meaning they can pull nitrogen from the air and add fertility to the soil. They do this in symbiosis with bacteria. If you have not previously grown beans on your plot, consider adding a bacterial inoculant. You can dust your seeds with it, or add some to each hole when planting., If you’re planting pole beans, you will need to put your trellis in the ground prior to planting the beans. Place the trellis, stake, or pole in the exact area you plan to plant. As the beans grow, they will naturally wind themselves around the structure for support. Dig a hole deep enough to stabilize the trellis/pole, should there be bad weather or heavy winds., Pole beans should be planted so that there is one seed per hole, and each seed is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the next. Bush beans should be planted so that there is one seed per hole, and each seed is at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the next. The hole should be 1-inch deep.Remember that bush beans need more space in between plants than pole bean as pole beans grow vertically.

, Carefully put one seed in each hole you’ve dug; it may be tempting to put multiple seeds at once, but this will cause the seedlings to compete for space and nutrients as they grow, and possibly result in the death of the plant. Cover up each seed with 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of your garden soil.

, Immediately after planting, give your seeds plenty of water to aid in their germination. After planting, you should continue to water the seeds once every 2-3 days, so that the soil is always moist. Avoid over watering though, as too much water (leaving puddles or pools on the topsoil) will cause the seeds to rot.

, Mulch is an incredibly helpful tool for new gardeners. Made from trees, leaves, or straw, mulch is a layer of shredded plant limbs you place over the topsoil in your garden. This blocks out weeds and traps in moisture, two good things for new plants. Spread a layer of mulch 1-inch thick over your garden soil after your seeds have grown several inches tall.

, Fertilizer adds nutrients to garden soil, helping increase the growth of your beans and the overall harvest. Fertilizers are made of a combination of three primary ingredients: nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Beans naturally produce a lot of nitrogen, meaning that you should look for a fertilizer that has low nitrogen content (such as a 5-20-20 mixture). Ask your local nursery worker with help on choosing a fertilizer for your beans, if you have questions.Do not add nitrogen fertilizer to the soil if you added a nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria will help the plants make their own.

, If you want to eat your beans fresh, you should pick your beans when the pods are large and full. The pods should not yet show the shape of the beans, because by that stage they have begun to dry out. Harvest the pods by snapping them off at the top; don’t tear them, as this can damage the plant and prevent new pods from sprouting.


If you harvest at the right time, your bean plants could continue to produce new pods for several weeks.

, If you want to dry your shell beans for later use, the process is easy: leave your beans on the plant until they are completely dry. This process usually takes 1-2 months after having reached peak ripeness. You can tell when the beans are totally dry and ready for storage, as they will rattle inside the pods., Fresh beans can be frozen and used later, if you don’t want them fresh but don’t want to dry them. Simply place them in an airtight container and put them in your freezer. They will remain good for 6-9 months after initially being placed in the freezer; thaw them by letting them rise to room temperature.

Dry and store the beans.",How to Grow Lima Beans," There are two main varieties: bush beans and vine (pole) beans. They are often labeled determinate and indeterminate, respectively. Lima beans are annuals, which means that they grow within a single season once a year.Find lima bean seeds at a local nursery or garden-supply store.


Bush beans tend to mature more quickly. They are called ""determinate"" plants because they yield all of their beans at one time. The bushes grow up to 30-90 centimeters high.Stick to bush varieties (like Henderson or Fordhook) if you're growing lima beans in a pot.
""Indeterminate"" vine varieties mature more slowly, but they yield a better harvest per square foot, and they tend to have fewer problems with disease. On a pole, a vine plant can grow 2-4 meters high. Consider growing this variety in a small garden.;
, Wrap your lima beans in a wet paper towel, then seal the towel inside an airtight plastic bag. Let the seeds germinate for a few days, until they sprout stems and small roots. Each bean should feature one prominent, noticeable stem.

, If you live in a region with a short growing season, start the seeds in seedling pots roughly 3-4 weeks before you expect the final frost of the spring. Bury each seed beneath 1-2 inches of loose soil. Keep them in a warm, moist environment, no cooler than 60° Fahrenheit and no hotter than 70°.


Consider using a biodegradable peat or paper pot. Lima bean seedlings can be delicate and difficult to transplant, so it is safest to use a pot that you can plant directly into the ground. Do not try to plant a clay or plastic pot into the ground, as this will limit the plant's growth.

, Lima beans are native to Peru, and they grow best in warm climes where the temperature stays about 60-70° Fahrenheit throughout the growing season. Plant the seeds 2-4 weeks after the final spring frost, once the weather begins to warm. The temperature should not dip below 60° Fahrenheit in the evenings. Sow seedlings, if you started them indoors, or simply sow the seeds.In the Midwest, lima beans are usually planted between May 20th and June 30th.Make sure not to plant the seeds too early! They will rot in cool, moist earth. If you plant them too late, however, the high temperatures may interfere with pod growth.

, ""Determinate"" bush varieties yield all of their beans at once, which can be a lot to handle if you aren't able to sell, cook, or freeze all of the crop within 10-14 days.If you want to ensure a more gradual harvest, try planting a new batch of bush beans every two weeks for 6-8 weeks after the last frost. This should keep your bean harvest going for longer.

, Set bush beans 4-6 inches apart, and pole beans 8-10 inches apart. Sow them with the eye of the bean facing downward into the soil. If you are planting multiple rows of lima beans, make sure to leave 24-36 inches between the rows for easy access and unrestricted growth. The perfect planting site is sunny, well-drained, and moderately fertile. Aim for soil that is slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.0-6.8.Avoid high-nitrogen soil, and do not use a fertilizer that's been infused with extra nitrogen. Nitrogen fertilization will make the plant grow lush leaves, but it may limit bean pod growth.
If you don't know the pH of your soil, do a soil test before you plant the beans.

, Indeterminate beans need a pole or trellis to reach their full growing potential. Set this up as soon as you plant the seeds (or even earlier) so that you do not risk damaging the delicate roots. Set up a wooden or metal pole that is at least five feet tall, and no more than an inch in diameter. The support should be securely staked into the ground beside the plant. As the bean plant grows, you will need to patiently guide the seeking vine so that it begins to wrap around the pole.


Once the vine has ""embraced"" the pole, the plant should grow up and around the support without any further coaxing.

, If you are planting the beans in a pot: make sure to use a pot that is at least 8-10 inches wide, and equally deep. You should only grow one bush in each pot. Bush beans are better suited for container cultivation, although you can get away with a pole bean if the pot is large enough.

, Keep the earth damp, but not soggy. Be careful not to water too heavily or too frequently, lest you drown the delicate lima bean seedlings. Be aware, however, that they require about one inch of water each week (from rain or irrigation) during the blossoming and pod development stages. Pour the water at the base of the plants, not over the top: disease and mildew can develop in consistently-wet foliage.


Spread mulch around the base of the plant to conserve moisture. This will keep you from having to water every day, as the hot season develops, and it should keep the weeds down.
Frequent watering is especially important in the heat of summer. Seed pods can dry and crack when the climate grows too hot.

, Inspect your plants regularly for signs of pests. If you find any, try to identify what they are so that you can figure out the best way to get rid of them. Common pests on bean plants include flea beetles, aphids, and mites.

Sometimes, you can just spray pests with a water hose to get rid of them. You might also look into using insecticidal soap or diatomaceous earth to remove them.

, Harvest bush varieties within 60-70 days of planting, and harvest pole beans after 85-90 days.The plant will flower, the flowers will die, and seed pods will appear. If you're growing bush beans, the harvest will come all at once. If you're growing a pole variety, expect to be pulling beans off of the vine for a month or two.

, Be patient, but not too patient. If the beans dry out on the plant, they will be tough and practically inedible. To test, gently tug a seed pod that looks ready. If the bean comes easily off the vine, then it is ripe and ready. If it clings to the plant, then it might need a few more days.Try to pick pods as soon as they're ready. This will coax the plant to create new pods. Once you allow a couple of bean pods to over-mature, this usually triggers the entire plant to stop blooming and producing pods., You can prepare lima beans to cook right away, or you can dry them out for long-term storage. Freshly-picked beans will last for up to two weeks in the refrigerator.


Try blanching the beans, then freezing them. This is a safe way to store them for longer periods of time.
For very long-term secure storage, shell and dry the beans. Store them in a cool, dry, airtight container, and they will last for 8-10 months.

Store the green beans in a refrigerator.",How to Grow Green Beans," The two basic green bean varieties are bush beans and pole beans. Bush beans spread out horizontally while pole beans need to climb vertically.


Recommended bush varieties for most regions include Bush Blue Lake and Bountiful.
Recommended pole varieties for most regions include Fortex and Kentucky Wonder.;
, Green beans need plenty of sunlight to grow properly, so try to choose an area of your garden that receives full sun for your planting site.


Since green beans do not do well in heavily-moist soil, you should avoid shaded locations, since shade tends to help soil retain moisture for prolonged periods.

, Green beans thrive in loamy soil, so if your garden has heavy clay soil or sandy soil, you should amend it with organic material before planting your green beans.


Loamy soil is dark and crumbly. Test the soil by squeezing it in your hands. Clay soil stays in a ball and sandy soil falls apart completely. Loamy soil will hold its shape initially yet break apart when touched.
If working with clay soil, spread 2 inches (5 cm) of manure or compost over the soil and work it into the top 1 foot (0.30 m) (30.5 cm) of soil using a shovel or garden fork. You could also mix sawdust or sand into the soil if it is especially heavy.
If working with sandy soil, spread the same amount of heavy manure or compost into the soil in the same manner, but skip the sawdust.
No matter what type of soil you have, you should also make sure that the area is free of weeds, trash, stones, and other debris.

, Green beans do not require a vast amount of nutrients, but a light application of fairly balanced fertilizer can help your plants produce a better crop.


Lightly apply a 10-20-10 fertilizer. This type of fertilizer is slightly richer in phosphorus than in nitrogen or potassium, so it is good for producing a strong crop yield., The absolute minimal soil temperature for green bean seeds is 48 degrees Fahrenheit (9 degrees Celsius). If the soil temperature drops below this, even at night, the seeds may not germinate well.


The best soil temperature during the planting stage is 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 degrees Celsius), however. Ideally, the temperature should warm to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) once the plants reach the emergence stage.

, A trellis or other fencing is not necessary if you are planting bush beans, but if you are going with a pole variety, growing the crop without some form of trellis will severely hinder the growth and yield of your plants.


The simplest support you can provide for pole beans is a cattle panel. This is a small section of wire fence measuring about 16 by 5 feet (4.9 by 1.5 m). Simply set up the fence behind your growing area before planting the seeds.You could also use a traditional pyramid trellis or a metal or plastic stake. Position either one just behind the planting location and make sure that the bottom 4 inches (10 cm) or so are underground.

, Each seed should also be about 2 to 4 inches apart and covered lightly with loose soil.


If your soil is a little on the sandy side, plant the seeds a little deeper.

, A standard wood chip mulch works well with green beans. Mulch can prevent the soil from getting too cool or too warm, and it also helps the soil retain enough moisture.


Other good mulches include weathered straw and untreated lawn clippings.
Mulch can also help prevent the spread of weeds.
Apply roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of mulch over the plants after the soil has started to warm up.

, You can continue sowing green bean seeds every two weeks if you want a continual harvest of that lasts all summer and into fall.


Skip a planting if you plan to be gone with the green beans are ready to harvest.
Note, however, that excessively hot weather may cause the plants to drop their blossoms and pods prematurely. If you live in a region known for particularly hot summers, you may need to put a stop to your green bean growing season during the hottest months.

, For a final fall crop of green beans, you should sow the seeds roughly 3 months before you expect the first frost to hit. The time of your first frost will vary depending on the region you live in.


If the first frost occurs before your final crop of green beans is ready to harvest, the buds or pods may drop prematurely. This is true even if the frost only occurs at night and the daytime temperatures are still within the ideal range.

, Water plants in the morning and skip waterings on cloudy or rainy days. Water on sunny days so that the moisture does not soak the foliage.


Avoid soaking the seeds before planting or immediately after planting. When exposed to excessive moisture, green bean seeds have a tendency to crack and break.
Later in the growth cycle, too much or too little water can cause the blossoms and pods to drop prematurely.
Give the plants about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water weekly.

, Green beans can actually grow well with minimal nutrients, and applying too much fertilizer could actually cause an overabundance of foliage yet a small yield of actual green beans.


As a general rule, you should only apply fertilizer if the nutrient levels of your soil are particularly low in a given area.
If your soil is nutrient-deprived, you can fertilize the plants once a week with a light application of balanced, fast-release fertilizer.
Green beans prefer soils with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. If your soil is especially acidic or basic, you might need to apply fertilizers formulated to balance the soil pH.
If your soil is somewhat on the sandy side, you might need to apply a fertilizer rich in nitrogen once the first seedlings form and once more once the plants reach their bud stage.

, Weeds can choke out green beans, making it difficult for them to emerge from the surface and strangling them once they do. Remove weeds as soon as you spot them to ensure a good crop of green beans.


When removing weeds, do not dig too deep. Green beans have shallow roots, and digging too deep into the soil can cause damage to these roots.
Do not weed when the foliage is wet since doing so would increase the risk of disease.

, There are a few pests and diseases that green beans commonly fall victim to. Treat the plants with organic insecticides and fungicides as needed to keep these problems under control.


Green beans are especially attractive to aphids, mites, cutworms, Mexican bean beetles, and Japanese beetles, and are especially weak against white mold and mosaic viruses.
Get rid of cutworms with a Bacillus thuringiensis insecticide. Get rid of aphids and mites by hosing them off your leaves with water.
Neem oil and sulfur are usually adequate fungicides.

, The pods should be firm, and you should be able to snap them off the plant without tearing the stems.


Note that the seeds inside should not be allowed to fully develop. At a fully developed, mature stage, the inner seeds will turn hard.
Green beans are usually about the size of a small pencil when ready to harvest.
Harvest usually takes place 50 to 60 days from planting and 15 to 18 days after the full bloom stage.

, Keep harvested green beans in an airtight container and store for about 4 to 7 days in your refrigerator.

Freeze, can, or pickle green beans for long-term storage.

Choose a small bean or seed.,
Start with dried beans.,
Make sure that the beans or seeds you choose are certified as pathogen-free.",How to Grow Bean Sprouts Indoors1," Nearly any type of bean can be sprouted, but small beans are generally the healthiest choice. Many large bean varieties are more likely to develop mold upon sitting in moist conditions for prolonged periods of time.


Mung beans are the most commonly used bean for sprouting.
Adzuki beans, lentils, alfalfa seeds, fenugreek seeds, and cabbage seeds are also fairly small and easy to work with.;
, Fresh beans go bad too quickly to use. Dried beans work best when growing bean sprouts, but you should use recently dried beans for the best results. Beans that have been dried or purchased within the past year have the most sprouting potential.

, Pathogens are harmful microorganisms that can cause disease. Certified beans, or beans that you have harvested and dried yourself, are the safest to use.

Remove the sprouts once they reach between one and three inches in length.",How to Grow Bean Sprouts Indoors2," You can find a sprouting jar with a mesh lid at most garden supply centers, or you can use any standard glass jar. Wash it thoroughly with hot water and soap. You can also use a small plastic container ,eg. the rectangular ones you find in the DIY shop.

, Place them in a colander and run cold water over them.

, It is best to use a small amount, since a larger number of beans may make it easier for mold or other types of bacteria and fungi to grow.

, Fill the jar to the top and cap it with a mesh lid.

, Secure it in place with an elastic band. Cloth blocks out most of the air flow but permits just enough to prevent mold. Do not use a solid metal cap.

, Allow the beans to soak 8 to 10 hours.

, Open the container, pour cool to lukewarm water over the beans, and swish them around. Reseal the container and drain off the water again.

, A dark cupboard works best. Rinse and drain the beans with water twice a day. Rinsing the beans keeps them clean and moist.

, Growth usually starts within two to three days, and sprouts are usually ready to harvest after four or five days.

, Rinse, drain, and spread the sprouts out on a clean paper towel for eight hours, or until excess water evaporates.

Remove the sprouts when they are between one and three inches long.",How to Grow Bean Sprouts Indoors3," Rinsing the beans removes most of the dirt and bacteria stuck to the outer surface of the beans, preventing it from contaminating the water you will end up soaking the beans it.

, Allow the beans to soak for an hour at minimum, or overnight at maximum.

, Rinsing the beans once more removes additional dirt and bacteria.

, Use a handkerchief with a wide weave, like a light cotton handkerchief. Pour the beans into the colander, on top of the handkerchief.

, Use a light cotton handkerchief or one made of a similarly light, breathable material.

, Allow the water to drain out.

, The bucket should be about twice the size of the strainer, but does not need to be much larger.

, Decorative glass stones work well, but any type will do as long as the bag presses down on top of the beans with a sufficient amount of force.

, You must keep the beans in the dark. Otherwise, they may start to green and turn bitter.

, You must also rinse the beans and allow them to drain each time you change the handkerchiefs. This process keeps them clean and moist.

, This should only take a few days, at most. Rinse the sprouts and set them out on a clean surface to dry for eight hours.

Encourage growth.",How to Build a Wigwam Support for Runner Beans," It is best to construct your frame before planting your crop, so that you can ensure a sturdy structure that gives the plants the space to grow. Decide how many plants you want to grow, as you will need one bamboo cane per plant.;
,


Use the canes to create a circular pattern about one metre/3.5 feet in diameter.






Push each cane at least 20cm/8"" into the soil.






When you are happy with the shape of the structure, firm each of the canes into the ground.






Fix some twine to the tops of the cane, about 30cm/1 foot from the end.






Grab another cane and tie it to this one.






Continue until all of the canes are secured. Cut the twine and finish with a knot.







, To encourage the tendrils to wrap around the canes, you need to provide the plant with something on which to grip. Wrap twine around the canes about halfway up the structure to provide this.

For example, the four main types in California are: Mission, Manzanillo, Sevillano and Ascolano. Even though these are grown in the same state, the diverse climate, coupled with a particular olive strand, yields a range of results.
Significantly research your location to determine which type of olive will prosper.
Growing from seed, you will get more of a wild variety than any of the parent trees it came from.;
, This may sound easy, but the fruit must be picked directly from the tree so the seed remains alive. Olive trees prosper in climate zones 8-11.These areas have a subtropical climate and mild winters. Pick them in early autumn, after the fruits ripen and are green. Leave the black ones. Don’t pick any off the ground and make sure the ones you choose don’t have any holes from insects.


Using olives purchased from a grocery store will not work. These have been processed for consumption which means they've been cooked. This process kills the seed inside the pit, so they are no longer viable. Raw olives from the produce section may be viable, though.
If you don't have access to an olive tree, many large orchards will ship pits/seeds directly to you.

, Once you have the olives, gently smash the flesh with a hammer to loosen the fruit around the pit. Cover the crushed olives with warm water and soak them overnight. Stir the water every few hours or so. Jostling them will encourage the fruit to loosen further.


If a hammer isn't available, use a wide knife and smash with the flat side.
If you notice a few floating to the surface, gather these and discard. They are likely rotten.

, Gather the pits and use a scour pad to rub the excess skin off. This is the same pad you probably use on pots and pans. After you’ve rubbed the skin, thoroughly rinse the pits in warm water for several minutes.


If a scour pad is not available, try sandpaper.

, There is a blunt end and a pointy end on every olive pit. With a knife, nick the blunt end. Do not break through the hull completely or the seed will be useless. Instead, create a tiny hole about the size of a pen tip.


Soak these for 24 hours in room temperature water., Use a 3 inch pot for every seed. Fill them with well-draining soil. It should consist of one part coarse sand and one part seed compost. These items can be found at any gardening store. Add a little water so the soil mixture is moist, not muddy.


You can use a larger pot if you prefer. You will be transplanting the seeds when they sprout and mature.
Thoroughly mix the soil together using a spoon, stick or your hand.

, Sow the seed an inch or two deep in the soil. It's best to plant one seed per pot. This way, the seeds aren't battling over nutrients.Plant several more seeds than you want trees. Olives have a low germination rate, even under the best conditions.

, Place the pots inside a clear polythene bag. This will help maintain some moisture and work as a greenhouse of sorts. Keep the pot in a well-lit area that is warm. A windowsill is a terrific option, but keep in mind that direct sunlight can be harmful initially. If you use a bag, place the pot in indirect sunlight.


Instead of using a bag, place the pot inside a propagator if one is available.
Expect germination within a month.

, You will want to maintain constant moisture in the top two inches of the soil. You can check this by sticking your finger in the soil occasionally. Only water if the top ¼ inch of the soil appears dry. Over-watering may create fungal and bacterial growth which will destroy the plant.

, You can keep the pots in the windowsill or whatever warm area you’ve chosen until it's time to transplant the olive seedlings. Continue to water as normal.

, August to September is ideal for most areas. This will allow the tree to get settled in the soil before frosty temperatures hit. Wait until the seedling is about 18 inches tall though.


Because frost damage is a huge concern for these plants, wait until spring if your area experiences temperatures below 30°F (-1.1°C).

, Choose a location that receives lots of direct sunlight to encourage an additional growth spurt. The hole will only need to be a few inches deep. A good rule of thumb is to make it a little deeper than the container the tree was initially grown in.You can use a small shovel or your hand to dig the hole.
The good thing about olive trees is that they can tolerate most soil types. This includes rocky or sandy soil. The only requirement is that it must have good drainage or they will slowly decline and die due to too much moisture. Poorly-drained soil conditions can lead to root disease such as Verticillium wilt or Phytopthora root rot. The area around the tree should never be muddy, just slightly moist.

, Gently remove the tree, being cautious not to disturb the roots too much. Ensure the tree and the hole are well watered before planting. Place the tree in the hole, slightly higher than the ground and cover with one inch of soil from the area.


Avoid using large amounts of organic soil mix, compost or fertilizer. This will create an artificial growing environment. You can start fertilizing the tree a year after plantingIf you are planting multiple trees, they need to be at least three feet apart, and up to 28 feet (8.5 m) for larger varieties. Otherwise, they will compete for nutrients in the surrounding soil.

, The same rules apply when watering the trees outdoors. Check the area around the tree for moisture and water when the top ¼ inch is dry. Be sure not to over water. Mother nature will take over and the plant will flourish.


Olive trees are quite tough, so they do not normally require any special care or watering during the colder months. However, if the climate in your area is very dry, water them as normal to maintain moisture in the upper levels of the soil.

, Remember that with hundreds of varieties, it's difficult to predict when the tree will begin producing fruit. Some, like Arbequina and Koroneiki will bear fruit around 3 years old. Others may take 5-12 years., Olives grow very slowly, so don’t require much pruning. However, you can remove dead, diseased or dying branches, and remove branches growing low on the trunk. You can also thin out branches to allow light to reach the center of the tree."

Whether you want to grow broad beans in a small kitchen garden, or a big hoop house, there’s one that's right for the space.Some excellent and hardy varieties:


The Sutton grows only about 12"" (30cm) high, making it an excellent choice for smaller gardens, hoop houses, and anywhere space is at a premium.






The Imperial Green Longpod produces huge 15"" (40cm) pods, each containing several big beans and are noted for their flavor.






Stero are compact plants that produce heavily if picked regularly. The Stero beans are so sweet they can be eaten without cooking.






Red Epicure produce vibrant red beans that can offer a distinctive and exotic alternative to regular favas or broad beans.






Aquadulce Claudia has been around since the 1850s, winning awards for its flavor and hardiness. This variety is noted for being particularly good to overwinter. Plant Aquadulce Claudia in the winter or late autumn.





;
, Depending on where you live, you may want to plant your broad beans in the late autumn, after you've cleaned up your garden from the summer, which means you'll be harvesting them sometime in the spring when you're ready to start planting other plants. In regions with very cold winters, however, waiting until spring is essential.


Temperate zones: In most regions, you'll want to start broad beans in the early spring to ensure a late summer harvest. Broad beans like to be planted between 60℉ and 65℉ (15-18℃), and struggle in temperatures higher than 80℉ (27℃).
Warm Mediterranean climates: Let plants winter-over in areas with mild winters. Fava beans can stay healthy down to temperatures of about 15 °F (−9 °C), making them a good candidate for overwintering in some climates. Because of the long maturation period, planting broad beans in late autumn can ensure that you’re harvesting in early spring.
Cold or very hot zones: Start beans indoors in regions with sudden shifts in temperature. If you live in the American Midwest or the Southeast, the transition from winter to summer is often sudden enough that it puts a strain on broad bean varieties, making it a better choice to start your plants indoors, several weeks before putting them in the ground.

, Whenever you're planting your beans, plant them in well-tilled soil that's been properly fertilized with the fertilizer of your choice. Since broad beans are nitrogen-producers, you don't necessarily need to fertilize. If you do, use a low-nitrogen fertilizer.


Pick a spot with good sun, away from any plants in the onion family, tilling the ground in the area you're planting several inches deep and working in compost.

, Broad beans can grow in any kind of soil, as legumes are self-fertilizers. To help them convert nitrogen, however, it’s a good idea to use Rhizobia bacteria to promote growth and help the roots fix nitrogen. This black powder is available at any gardening store.Wet the seeds lightly and put them in a coffee can or a cup with the inoculant, then shake them gently to coat the seeds evenly before planting. Do this just a few minutes before you're ready to put the seeds in the ground.

, Moisten your soil with water gently before planting. You don't want standing water, - just a bit of dampness to get started.


Use your finger to poke a hole about 2"" (5 cm) deep in the ground. Place them 8"" (20 cm) apart in double rows, with the same distance between the two rows. If you're planting a variety known for growing quite large, you might plant them with a bit more space between.
Find the dark spot–the ""eye"" of the seed–and plant it downward. Some gardeners recommend planting twice as many seeds as you want plants, to allow for non-germinating seeds., If you need to start your beans indoors, a great way to start them is using empty toilet paper tubes, one tube for each plant you hope to grow. Use a seeding tray, available at any gardening store, to line up your tubes and start your broad beans.


Stand the tubes in the tray, fitting snugly. Fill the tubes ⅔ to ¾ full with potting soil. You'll probably spill some in between, but don't worry about the mess.
Place one bean on top of the soil in each tube. If you have already germinated the seeds by soaking, place the seed root-down. Water the tubes gently from the top to compact the soil a bit, then fill each tube with a little more soil, covering the beans.
Keep the tray at room temperature until the beans sprout, then move the tray to a sunny place. Cool temperatures are fine, just as long as the temperature doesn't dip too much below freezing for long.

, The small bushes that the beans will grow on will quickly become laden with heavy pods, and will sag over without the proper support. For this reason, it's important to plant stakes along your broad bean row to use to support them when they start to gain height.


Use small dowels spaced every foot or two along the row, with twine tied between, to give the plants something to lean on. You can use twine, or old strips of bed-sheet to gently tie the plants and keep them upright and keep the pods off the ground.
Don't wait until you've got a huge plant and it's flopping over to stake them. It's very easy to damage the roots and promote mildew if the plant spends too much time flopped over on the ground before getting staked up.

, Broad beans can withstand dry spells, but keep the plants well-watered, especially if you live in an especially warm climate. Water the soil deeply in the coolest part of the day–first thing in the morning, or in the evening after dinner–and avoid over watering. You shouldn't see a bunch of standing water around your broad beans.


Avoid overhead watering, which is watering the tops of the plants and letting it drip down into the soil. This will promote mildew and other problems. Water the soil.

, Broad bean roots are relatively shallow, making it very easy to accidentally uproot them if you're careless with a hoe. Weed around your broad beans by hand, keeping the area competition-free. Once the plant is established, you can lighten up on the weeding some.

, The plant will keep growing and will overproduce unless you stunt the growth by pinching off the new sprouts at the top of the plant as soon as you seen pods producing. At this point, you can harvest some of the leaves to eat, which are a surprisingly tender salad green.


Pinch out the growing tips when you see young beans appearing at the base. Remove the tips with two leaves attached from the tops of the plants. If you don't want to eat them, compost them.

, If you've got problems with rodents, groundhogs, rabbits, or other pests messing with your garden, broad beans would be a good candidate for row cover, if necessary. Row covers are plastic or cloth sheets that you can stake gently, draped over the plants. This leaves enough room for growth and air circulation, and also warmth.


Row covers can also be a great idea if you're planting in the autumn, because it will help trap the heat near the ground and protect the plants from frost.
If you use a row cover, leave the rows uncovered for a while in the middle of the day, maybe while you're weeding to let the air circulate more readily. Watch for fungal disease and wet rot at the base of the plants. If you see any whitish or yellowish patches, water them less and expose the plants to more air.

, Aphids love bean plants and will congregate usually at the top of the plants, near new shoots and buds. Some gardeners like to use insecticidal spray to keep aphids off the plants, but an easier method involves cutting the tops off the plants where the aphids congregate as you see them. If you're a diligent gardener, you should be able to pinch them off before they do much damage.

, Like other bush beans, broad beans can be tender and edible in the first couple days of their formation, eaten like sugar snap peas, or steamed whole as a side dish. Broad beans are notable for the waxy outer shell on each bean, but harvested young those outer shells will be soft and edible.


Look for a narrow pod that’s bright green. The pods should be thin and narrow, showing none of the bulges that are the sign of mature beans on the inside. If beans are showing, let them mature fully.
Don't over-pick your young beans, since the full-grown variety is where the flavor's at. It's ok to pick a few from each plant if you can't wait, but save the majority for full maturation.

, Broad beans are ready to be harvested when the pods and plump and the beans are fat and distinct in each pod. The pods will appear to plump some and begin to droop with the weight of the seeds when they're ready to harvest.


Depending on what variety you're growing, pods can be anywhere from 6 to 15 inches long, with several large, fat beans on the inside, with several pods per plant. If you pick them regularly throughout the season, you should open up space for more production as well, if you're had a good growing season, weather-wise.

, To get at the broad beans, you've got to shuck them out of their pods. Holding each pod with the pointy tip up, pull the string along the side of each bean to open the pod.


Again, depending on the variety, each bean should have 5-10 large beans in each pod, which have a thick waxy shell that needs removed before eating. It takes some work, but getting organized can help to make the process go fast.The easiest way to do this is to blanch them, dropping the beans in boiling water for a count of five, then removing them immediately with a slotted spoon and putting them right into ice water. This will loosen the shells on each bean.

, The best way to eat broad beans is the most simple: steam them and serve them simply dressed with salt and pepper. They're big, meaty, and delicious, ideally paired with red meat. They're also a great base for bean soups, or as an addition to hearty salads.

, Because broad bean plants are great nitrogen-providers, it's a good idea to return them back to the soil and let their nutrients enrich the soil. Cut each plant down to the base and dig the roots into the soil. Cover them in soil and rotate your garden so something in need of nitrogen-enrichment is planted there next season.

Plant multiple Ohia trees near one another.",How to Grow an Ohia Tree," Do not plant an Ohia tree over 9,000 ft (2,743 m) in elevation. Ohia trees are not suited for high elevations, and will likely wilt and die if planted too high.Higher elevations likely have too little oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain an Ohia tree, and may not have enough humidity.

If you live in an area above 9,000 feet (2,743 m), consider finding a different species of tree to plant.;
, Ohia trees need near-constant sunlight during daylight hours, and so should be planted in an open space that affords plenty of light.Do not plant your Ohia tree near a large wall or building that will block the sun. Similarly, do not plant the Ohia near a larger tree or bush whose foliage will prevent sun from reaching the Ohia.

Young Ohia trees and bushes that have not fully grown may prefer partial sun (about 6 hours of sun exposure a day), until they reach maturity. If your Ohia is in the ground, you won’t be able to change its sun exposure as it matures.
However, if the Ohia tree is in a planter, you can move the planter to keep the juvenile tree in partial sunlight.

, Ohia trees will become unhealthy if the soil they are planted in becomes saturated and waterlogged. To avoid this problem, plant your Ohia in a soil with good drainage. The soil should also be rich in organic material, which will nourish the growing Ohia tree and keep it healthy.You can purchase a planting soil mixture at your local hardware store, or at a local plant nursery or gardening center.
Ask the sales staff for assistance, and request that they help you find a soil that drains well.

, Unlike various other tree species, Ohia trees can be grown from seeds relatively easily.If you live in Hawaii, you should be able to purchase Ohia seeds or a small seedling at a local plant nursery or gardening center. If you live elsewhere, you can order Ohia seeds online. Check with plant retailers that specialize in Hawaiian flora, including Maui Native Nursery and Kauai Seascape nursery.

The seeds of the Ohia tree are tiny, and a cluster of them may look like a small pile of dust. These seeds grow in ¼-inch (0.65 cm) pods on the Ohia tree. The seed pods burst open when they have matured, and allow the seeds to disperse.

, Fill any size planter with a planting soil mixture, and lightly sprinkle the tiny Ohia seeds on top of the soil. Ohia seeds will grow best if exposed to plenty of sunlight, so place the planter outdoors, away from shade. Water the seeds lightly at first, with a spray bottle, until they start to sprout.Even if you’re unable to place the Ohia seeds in full sunlight, they’ll likely still grow. The seeds are tough and can grow in practically any light conditions.
The seeds will grow best between 50°F and 93°F (10–34°C). If the outdoor temperatures dip below 50 or climb above 93, bring the plant indoors to more stable temperatures.

, If you can obtain a cutting from an Ohia tree in your area (perhaps from a tree owned by a friend or family member), you can use this to grow your own Ohia. Plant the Ohia cutting in soil that is porous and drains well, so the cutting isn’t drowned by repeated waterings.If the cutting is too small to stand erect in a pot full of soil on its own, you can stick a large dowel in the soil and tie the cutting to the dowel using thread.

Take your cutting from the stem or branch tips of a mature Ohia tree. The cutting that you plant should be about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in length, and ¼-inch (0.65 cm) in diameter.
A cutting will take time to begin establishing its own roots: at least a week or two.

, Once the young Ohia tree (whether grown from seeds, a cutting, or a seedling) has begun to grow, you’ll need to transplant it from a pot directly into the ground. Plant the Ohia in organic soil. Ohia roots need to be able to absorb water but should never become waterlogged, so plant the tree in soil that drains well and is not prone to forming puddles.Ohia trees grow quickly, and will become root-bound if left in a pot for too long. Put the plant in soil in the ground as soon as it grows large enough to encourage healthy growth, or about 1 foot (0.3 meters) tall.

, The Ohia roots will have sufficient room to expand in a hole of this size. Make the hole roughly the same depth as the root ball, so that the trunk of the seedling will not be buried once it’s planted.While you’re digging, turn the soil by breaking apart clumps, removing rocks, and flipping the shovelfuls of soil upside down so that the organic material can be worked through the soil.
For added soil drainage, place a couple of cinder blocks at the bottom of the hole to allow for soil drainage. You should be able to purchase cinder blocks at a local hardware or landscaping store.

, Once the cinder blocks are firmly in place, gently set the Ohia tree in the hole and cover the roots with a rich soil mixture. Be sure not to cover the base of the trunk with soil., Ohia trees thrive in tropical environments, and consequently need to be watered often. Plan to water your Ohia tree at least once a week, using water from a household hose. In order to keep the tree healthy and encourage its growth, you can also apply a fertilizer. Purchase an 8-8-8 or 13-13-13 fertilizer, and apply it to the base of the Ohia tree once every six months.Hours after watering, make sure that the soil is draining well. You should not see any puddles around the base of the Ohia tree, and the soil should be damp but not saturated.

, Since Ohia trees frequently produce large, pleasant-smelling flowers, bees and other pollinating insects frequent the trees. Ohia trees are almost constantly in bloom, and so constantly attract insects.If you’re bothered by the bees or wasps, you can set up a bee trap or occasionally spray bees with an insecticide like Raid.

Also, avoid planting an Ohia tree within 10 feet (3 meters) of a door or garage. If large numbers of bees or wasps are frequently in the tree, they may fly into your house.

, If you’re planning on growing more than a single Ohia tree, you don’t need to worry about giving the trees plenty of space in every direction, as with some other species. Ohia trees can grow well while crowded together. Plant multiple Ohia trees with as little as about 5 feet (1.5 meters) between their trunks.Over the years, as the Ohia trees grow, you may decide to prune some of the trees’ branches. Prune using a pair of pruning shears, in cases where branches from two Ohia trees overlap.

They prefer a temperature range of 12-30 Celsius (53-86 Fahrenheit). The annual rainfall should be in the range of 850-1200 millimeters (33-47 inches).In terms of altitude, they can handle anything between 360 and 1350 meters (1181-4429 feet) but prefer moderate altitudes of between 600 and 1050 meters (1968-3444 feet).;
, You’ll want to avoid any soil that has experienced waterlogging, which sandalwood does not tolerate.If you are planting in a sandy soil, you’ll want to make sure the water doesn’t drain too quickly.Sandalwood prefers red ferrogenuous loam.
Sandalwood can also be planted in black cotton, sandy, and red clay soils.The soil pH should be between 6.0 and 7.5.
Sandalwood tolerates rocky ground and gravelly soil.

, Since sandalwood cannot survive without a nitrogen fixing host species, you’ll need to ensure the host species is well established. You may be able to find a site with already established, suitable host species such as long-lived wattles or casuarinas.If you need to plant a host species, you should space them between the sandalwood trees at intervals of 1.6-2 meters(5.2-6.5 feet).Cajanus cajan is another good host species for sandalwood trees., Soak the sandalwood seeds for twenty-four hours. Let them dry under the full force of the sun. After one day in the sun, you should see a crack developing in the seed. At this point, it is ready for germination., You’ll need some red earth, cattle manure, and sand. In a wheelbarrow or other container, mix two parts red earth to one part manure and one part sand. Fill the planting tray with this mixture.

If you plan to sow the seeds directly outdoors, you can fill the planting hole with this mixture before sowing the seeds.

, You can plant the sandalwood seeds in a small container, such as a recycled carton or a planting tray. Fill it with the prepared potting mix. Place the seeds ¾’’ to 1’’ (1.75-2.54 centimeters) below the surface of the soil., Give a bit of water everyday but avoid waterlogging the soil, since the sandalwood tree prefers dry conditions. You should see the seeds begin to sprout within four to eight weeks.To see whether water is needed, put your finger one inch into the soil. If the bottom of your finger feels dry, you’ll need to water.
Avoid soaking the potting soil, since sandalwood seeds do not tolerate water-logged soil.

, You’ll need a small shovel or a trowel. Create a planting hole that is 30 by 3 centimeters (11’’ by 1’’)., When the seedlings are around one month old, you’ll need to transplant them. Use your trowel to loosen the soil around the edges of the planting tray. Put your fingers along the sides of the tray and pull up the sandalwood seedling. Holding it by the root ball, gently place it in the planting hole.It is best to transplant the seedling in the morning before it gets too hot.You should ensure the space between the seedling and the planting hole is complete filled up with soil, since you want to avoid any potential water-logging.
You can space the sandalwood plants between 2.5 and 4 meters apart.Avoid planting sandalwood in protected forest areas.
In India, the best time to transplant sandalwood is between May and October.

, You’ll need to plant the sandalwood seedlings within one meter of the host plants. Unless the tree fixes onto the host species within the first two years, it will die.The host plants should be at least one-meter-tall prior to direct sowing of sandalwood., You’ll need to remove any weeds that are competing for moisture around the sandalwood tree, especially during the first year. You should also make sure the host species does not take too much light away from the young sandalwood tree. If it starts to grow above the sandalwood, you could tip the host species to the side or prune it.Remove any weeds that climb up the sandalwood.

, If you get a period of dry weather, you should water the sandalwood tree. Twice per week, you can give it half a litre (.5 quart) of water. It is best to water sandalwood in the evening, which prevents excessive evaporation.If your area gets below the recommended range of 850-1200 millimeters (33-47 inches) of rain per week, you’ll need to water the plants regularly.

, If the host species begins to overshadow the sandalwood tree, you’ll need to prune it back. Otherwise, the sandalwood tree will not get enough light. Prune the host species so that it is a little bit shorter than the sandalwood plant, so that it gets adequate sun., Since herbivores love the taste of sandalwood trees, you’ll want to protect your plants. Avoid damage to your sandalwood tree by putting up a fence around the perimeter, which should help prevent herbivores from eating it."

Harvest your mangoes.",How to Grow a Mango Tree," Although mangoes don’t require much maintenance once planted, they do have particular circumstances under which they must grow. Mangoes thrive best in high heat, and can handle both humid/swampy or arid areas. Most mangoes are grown near the equator, and in the United States they are primarily grown in Florida. If you live in an area that has average temperatures of 80–100 °F (27–38 °C) and cool winters that don’t freeze, you’ll likely be able to grow mangoes.


Rainfall for your area should not exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm) per year.;
, Mangoes can be grown in pots or in spacious areas outside. They prefer lots of heat and direct sunlight, meaning that they don’t grow well indoors (although they can be brought in in a pot for the winter). The size of each mango tree varies depending on what species it is, but they can get quite large, exceeding heights of 10–15 feet (3.0–4.6 m). Therefore, choose an area that will give your tree plenty of space to thrive without being shaded by other larger trees.

, There are many different types of mangoes on the market, but only a few grow well in specific areas. Visit a local nursery to find out which ones grow best in your area. Mangoes can be grown in one of two ways: via the seed of a mango, or from a grafted sapling. Mango seeds typically take eight years to produce fruit. Grafted saplings take three to five years to produce fruit and are nearly guaranteed a good harvest. If you choose to plant from a seed, choose a mango from a tree you know grows successfully in your area; taking one from a store-bought mango probably won’t provide you with a tree.








Grafted saplings will only reach about half the size of a tree grown from seed.
The trees produced from seeds tend to be much stronger and hardier, but they may not be as reliable when it comes to fruit-bearing.
If you’re testing the environmental limits with your mango growing, there are a few species that are able to grow in slightly cooler and wetter conditions than the aforementioned recommendation.

, Mangoes thrive in loose, sandy soil that drains water easily. Check the pH of your soil to see if it is in an adequate acidity range; the trees will grow best in soil that has a pH of 4.5 – 7 (acidic). Incorporate peat moss into your soil on a yearly basis in order to keep the acidity high. Avoid using chemical fertilizers or any product that contains salt, as these will hinder the growth of your mango tree. Prepare the soil so that it is tilled about three feet deep, as this will give plenty of space for the roots to spread., Mango trees should typically be planted in late spring or the beginning of summer when it is a combination of rainy







, If you live in an area that grows mangoes, visit local orchards to select a fruit. If you don’t have access to a healthy mango tree, visit a local grocer or farmer's market to select a fruit. Ask the salesperson for help in choosing a fruit that is polyembryonic.Polyembryonic seeds will produce clones of the parent tree. A polyembryonic seed should come from the fruit of a tree that thrives in your area. This way, you have a good idea of exactly the type of fruit you are getting — it should taste identical to the fruit of the parent tree., Eat the mango, or remove all existing fruit, until the fibrous pit is exposed. Clean the pit with a scrub brush, or steel wool pad, until all hairs have been removed. Be careful not to scrub away at the outer coating of the pit, and only to remove the fruit fibers that are still attached.








, Dry the pit overnight in a cool location away from direct sunlight. Open the pit with a sharp knife, as you would shuck an oyster, being careful not to cut too deeply and damage the enclosed seed. Pry the pit open and remove the seed, which resembles a large lima bean.








, Place the seed about an inch deep, and concave side down, in a container full of quality potting soil. Dampen the soil and store the container in a warm, shaded area until the seed sprouts. This process usually takes one to three weeks.







, At this point, your seed is ready to be planted in its permanent location. If you plan to have it outside, try to plant it directly outside rather than putting it in a plant and transplanting it, as that way you won’t have to worry about hardening it off or it going into soil shock.








, In your selected plot location, use a shovel to dig a hole that is two to four times the size of the rootball of your mango plant. If you’re planting in area that already has grass, remove the grass in an area a further 2 feet (0.6 m) around the plot space to make room for the tree. Mix a bit of compost (no more than a 50/50 mixture) with the soil you’ve dug up which will be replaced around the roots.

, Remove the sapling from the container or place your seed in the hole. The base of the tree







, Wait until you see some growth from the tree before you begin fertilizing the tree. After that, you can fertilize your mango tree once a month for the first year. Use a non-chemical fertilizer — a fertilizer with a 6-6-6-2 mix should be good. You can dissolve the fertilizer in a bit of warm water for application, and keep the solution on hand for your monthly use.








, Mango trees don’t like a ton of water, but the first week watering should be slightly above average. Water the new tree every other day for the first week, and then water it only once or twice a week for the first year.








If there are five or more days of little to no rainfall, then you should water your young mango tree (under 3 years old) once a week until the dry period ends.

, Weeds can become a serious problem around your mango trees if not dealt with on a regular basis. Make sure to weed regularly, removing any plants that sprout up near the trunk of the tree. Add a thick layer of mulch around the tree to help trap in moisture and prevent weed growth as well. You can add a bit of compost to the mulch as well to help supply the tree with added nutrients.








, The goal of pruning is to allow for as much space for branches to form, as the fruit will develop at the end of the branches (known as terminal flowers). Cut branches 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the trunk if there is too much crowding near the center, typically after the last fruit of the season (in the fall). You can prune your tree to limit its outward growth as well, by simply cutting off branches that are too tall or wide. If you have questions about your specific mango tree, visit a local nursery and check in for tips there.

, Because mangoes vary in color, shape, and size from species to species, you can’t tell if the fruit is ripe until you cut it open. You can get a general sense depending on how soft and fragrant it is, but should use a knife to sample the fruit. When the meat is yellow through to the core, it is ready to eat. If it is still very white and hard, then wait one to two weeks before testing it again. If you do pick your fruit early, you can ripen it by keeping it in a paper bag in room temperature for a few days. A nice alternative if you have picked them early is to make a salad by julienning them and making a green mango salad that goes well with fish dishes.

Prune.",How to Grow a River Red Gum," The river red gum grows to a height of around 20 meters (65.6 ft), and sometimes up to 45 meters (147.6 ft), so it requires a lot of space and should not be planted close to buildings or your residence. It is best in large gardens, in parks, and on farms.;
, The river red gum isn't that fussy about soil type. While it is typically found at river sites with sandy, alluvial soils, it's also happily at home in open-forest and woodland on floodplains. Hence, it'll probably be fine wherever you choose to plant it.

, Remove the tree from its casing and gently place in the ground. Firm the soil around the tree and water in well.

, Keep the area free of weeds and guard against frost while it is establishing itself.

, When the weather is dry for an extended period, prune the tree to avoid fungal diseases.

Propagate the pruned off parts to make more Pencil Trees.",How to Grow a Pencil Tree (Euphorbia Tirucalli)," When buying any potted plant from a nursery or garden center, gently life the plant out of the container and look at the roots. The plant should have these characteristics:


A firm but not compacted root ball.
White roots that do not show any signs of rot.
A dense cluster of roots that hold the soil.
Roots that extend to the edge of the container but do not circle around the inside of the container.;
, Always choose the healthiest plant to be sure that you'll have years of enjoyment. Here are a few things you should look for in a Pencil Tree:


The plant should stand upright and not look wilted.
The color should be uniformly green, except on older plants where the trunk is brown and looks similar to bark.
The plant should be free of insects and plant damage.

, The Pencil Tree is a slow growing plant that can grow up to 5 feet (1.5 m) tall. Here are some tips:


Plants between 3 inches (7.6 cm) and 2 feet (61 cm) tall will grow in a 4 inches (10 cm) deep container.
Taller plants will do well in containers that are between 6 and 10 inches deep.

, The Pencil Tree is drought tolerant and survives with infrequent watering. Areas with low rainfall are perfect for the Pencil Tree. When this plant gets too much water, the roots will rot.

, The Pencil Tree tolerates a range a light conditions. The plant will thrive in areas with partial sun, filtered sunlight and full sun.

, The Pencil Tree tolerates all types of soils.


Use a basic potting soil mix for container grown Pencil Trees.
In the landscape, the plant will grow in eroded soils, saline soils and other difficult growing conditions.

, The Pencil Tree is resistant to most pests and diseases. Most pests and diseases avoid the milky latex contained inside the stems. In wet and humid areas, the plant may suffer from stem and root rot.

, In the winter, the tips of the Pencil Tree may turn a reddish color. This is normal. During periods of freezing temperatures, the plant will need some protection.


Cover plants grown in the landscape with an old sheet. Place stakes around the plant and drape the sheet over the plant so that the sheet does not touch the plant.
Bring container-grown plants indoors or cover the plants with a sheet.

, Small Pencil Trees may need some support as they begin to grow.


Insert a stick into the soil near the trunk of the plant.
Loosely tie the main stem (the trunk) to the stick.
Adjust the tie and the supporting stick as the plant grows.

, As the Pencil Tree grows, prune the plant to keep it at a desired height.


Wear gloves to protect your hands from the milky latex.
Cut a stem near a point where the stem branches from the main branch.

, The stems that were cut off when the plant was pruned can be placed in soil. These stems will grow roots and begin to grow. Here's how to propagate a Pencil Tree:


Plant the cut end of the stem in a small container of potting soil.
Water the soil so that the soil is soaked.
Allow the plant to slightly dry out (but not completely) while it is growing roots.

Allow tree seeds to germinate.Trees don't actually need human help to spread.",How to Grow a Magnolia Tree," All plants have certain climates they prefer. Although magnolia trees tend to prefer temperate environments, they're quite adaptable. However, the potential for harsh weather conditions can make it trickier to make the tree thrive. ""Plant hardiness"" charts are available to refer to in this instance. They can offer a general indication of how appropriate your climate is for growing.Some of the bigger magnolia trees will grow between 40-70 feet tall.Certain magnolia trees are better suited to certain climates. Although magnolia trees are usually perfect for temperate weather, certain species like the Southern magnolia will suffer if the temperature drops below -5°C (23°F). This temperature issue can be lessened by planting the tree in an area where it won't get as much wind.
You should keep the time of year in mind as well. Magnolia trees are best planted in the early spring. This will allow the trees to make the most of the seasonal changes in its first year of life.The damages of harsh weather can be minimized by growing your tree somewhere where there is wind protection. Growing your tree in an enclosed area (like fenced housing) will help protect your tree during the most vulnerable years.;
, Magnolia trees favour getting full sun, but they can suffice with light shade as well. However, if you live in a particularly dry climate, it may actually benefit the tree to have a bit of moisture-saving shade.Generally speaking, you'll want to find a place that gets at least some sun every day. The spot should also have enough room for a tree to grow to its full height naturally. This means keeping it away from potential obstructions, such as housing or low-hanging power lines.


If you know your magnolia tree grows big (such as the Southern magnolia), do not grow it within six feet of a sidewalk or concrete foundation.These larger magnolias will break through the concrete with their roots several years from now.
Because growing a magnolia tree is a long-term effort, it's important to choose a spot where you'll have access for a number of years. This includes properties you own (as opposed to rent) and community gardens.

, Magnolia trees prefer lightly acidic soil with lots of humus and moisture.While none of this will be an issue if your area's climate is temperate and rainy enough, you can purchase high-fertility soil from a gardening store if there's a problem with your land.


You can test your soil using a storebought kit.Humus is a highly fertile soil matter, developed from disintegrated plant matter on the ground., Although magnolia seeds may be purchased from a store or ordered online, the seeds can be also be gathered around magnolia trees. Some experts advise attracting them from the source because the seeds are no longer viable once they dry out.Go to magnolia trees in September and October and look around the tree for seed pods to use in the spring. Alternatively, you may be able to find vendors who have gathered seeds locally and are willing to sell them. Here are some of the most common types of magnolia to consider:


The Southern magnolia is a large tree that benefits from warm weather. It's one of the largest magnolia species and grows up to 80 feet.The star magnolia grows to 15 feet and produces white flowers in the late winter. It is suited for colder environments.
The Sweet Bay grows up to 50 feet and offers fragrant, white flowers and green leaves.
If you're gathering seeds from a hybrid tree, the seeds won't necessarily grow to look exactly like the parent tree. You won't be able to tell exactly what kind of tree your seeds are growing into until they take bloom years later.

, When you have the seeds, peel off their outer shells.Place them in a bowl of warm water overnight to soften them. Following that, you should also scarify the seeds by lightly scrubbing them with sandpaper or steel wool. This will make it easier for the seeds to take root when it comes time to plant them.


Scarification refers to treating the seed's coat so that it's more susceptible to germination.

, If you collect them in September-October, you'll need to store them over the winter. To do this, dry them off, then seal them in a closed bag. Keep the bag safe until the early spring when it comes time to plant them. Keeping the seeds in a refrigerator or outdoors will help ensure they don't dry out.Putting the seeds in water first helps to soften them for storing.

, After spending the winter in storage, it's finally time to plant the seeds. Dig open an area within the first top two inches of the soil and carefully deploy your seeds. Apply some dirt over the seeds and allow them some time to take bloom. Alternatively, you can plant your seeds in a pot, and transplant the seedling into the yard once it takes form.This can be done by digging out an area, then digging out the seedling (including all of the roots through the soil) and placing it in the hole.


Trees take a very long time to grow, so don't expect fast results. Magnolia trees take about ten years to bloom flowers from their initial seeding.

, Following that, try to see that it gets water at least once a week. Magnolia trees tend to be fairly resilient, and you won't need to do much to maintain them if there's sufficient rain throughout the growing season.


The amount you should water your seedling will depend on the heat of your climate. Naturally, more water should be administered in hotter climates.

, Pruning refers to cutting the ends off of branches. Though it may sound counter-intuitive, this actually encourages the growth of new blooms and will make your tree grow faster in the long run. Wait until mid-spring to prune. Cut off branches that look misshapen or dead. Crossing branches should also be cut off, as they hurt the growth of the branches they're impeding.


This is similar to the way hairdressers cut the ends off hair to enable further growth.
Avoid pruning mature trees if you can help it. Pruning a mature tree excessively can be fatal to its existence.Pruning should be reserved for trees that are still in the process of growing.

, While it can be seen as an advanced or artistic form of pruning, you can help influence the way the tree grows over the course of multiple seasons. You can prune the branches on one side, for instance, and have it result in an irregularly shaped tree.

, Instead of growing one from scratch, you can grow a magnolia tree by cutting off a piece from an existing magnolia tree and planting it in the ground.Cut 6-8 inches from a growing magnolia branch with a sterilized pruner, and place the branch in water to sustain it. Place the cuttings in planters with potting soil and trap them in plastic bags to keep in the humidity. The cuttings may begin to root over the next few months.


Cuttings are not always likely to take root. A large percentage of attempted cuttings fail. However, you can maximize your success by dipping the planted stem in a hormone growth solution, purchased from a garden supply store.This process is much faster than using seeds, as you'll probably get flowers after 2 years as opposed to 10 with a seed.

, You can skip the seeding process by purchasing a seedling at a nursery.Magnolia trees are quite popular, so you should be able to find a selection at your nearest garden store. This can save you the months of storage so long as you're still planting in the spring. In addition, getting your seedling from a nursery will help ensure you know exactly what kind of flower colour you'll be getting.

, Left to their own devices, wind will pick up their seeds and spread them around. If you have grown a magnolia tree in an open, wild area, there's a chance its seeds will give life to new trees. Although it will take decades, you should rest assured that your efforts may give life to an entire family of trees in the future.


Trees won't germinate if there isn't sufficient room for them to take root.

Clean up the jacaranda’s dropped leaves.",How to Grow a Jacaranda Tree," If you live in a temperate or warm climate, nearly all plant nurseries in your area should sell jacaranda seedlings.If you need help locating a jacaranda plant, or if a nursery has different options to choose from, ask the sales staff for assistance.

If there isn’t a plant nursery in your area, you can also visit the Garden section of large retail stores. Retailers like WalMart and Home Depot will stock a large variety of plants, and will likely carry jacaranda seedlings.;
, If you don’t live near a nursery or garden center, or if you live in a cold northern climate, there may not be a way for you to purchase a jacaranda seedling in person. In this case, you can find and order a jacaranda online. Check major online plant retailers, such as Annie’s Annuals, Fast Growing Trees, or Nursery Live. Certain retailers will provide a seedling—with others, you may need to order a packet of seeds.

Although jacarandas commonly grow in temperate or humid climates, they can survive in cooler areas as well—even regions that receive light frosts.If you live in a northern region, it will still be worth your time to obtain and plant a jacaranda tree.

, If you know a friend or relative with a jacaranda tree, ask if you can take a cutting of their plant. A cutting is segment taken from a branch; the cutting itself should be at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, but can be as long as you would like. Place the jacaranda cutting in water until small roots begin to emerge.Then, plant the cutting in a small pot filled with rich soil, water regularly, and let the tree grow.

, Jacaranda seedlings also tend to spring up around the base of mature jacaranda trees.If you can safely and legally dig up one of these seedlings, you can transplant it into a planter and so begin growing your own tree., Jacarandas thrive with sun, and should be planted in an area that will receive frequent, direct sunlight for most of the year.Plant the tree well away from any nearby buildings, and do not plant seedlings in the shade of other, larger trees.

If your jacaranda is still potted in a planter, you’ll have greater flexibility with the plant’s location. If the pot isn’t heavy, you could even move the tree during the day to ensure that it stays in sunlight.

, Jacaranda trees will suffer if their roots don’t drain well, and they need fertile, rich soil to provide them with nutrients.If you’re planting your tree in a large planter or pot, place the jacaranda in a rich soil mixture. A local nursery or Garden center should have a variety of soil bags for sale, and sales staff can help you select a healthy mixture for your jacaranda.

If you plant the tree directly into the ground, you’ll have less control over the makeup of the soil than if you were buying it from a plant nursery. Look for a patch of soil that isn’t prone to having puddles, isn’t saturated with water, and has other plants already growing in it.

, Jacarandas need frequent watering in order to grow and thrive in temperate climates.Healthy jacaranda trees grow quickly, but will wilt and possibly die if given insufficient water. Between March and October, use a household hose to water the jacaranda tree about once a week.

During the cooler winter months, you do not need to water the tree as regularly. The jacaranda will not be growing during November through February, and so you should only water the tree about once a month.

, Although they begin small as seedlings, jacarandas can grow into massive trees. Jacarandas commonly reach between 25-50 feet (7.6-15 meters) in height and can have a width of 15-30 feet (4.5-9 meters).Plant the jacaranda in a large, open area where it will have room to grow to its full size. For example, jacarandas do well in large front or back yards.

If you plant the jacaranda in an already cramped or crowded space (e.g. under a patio roof or between narrow walls) it will not grow to its full size and may wither and become unhealthy.

, Jacarandas need to conserve much of the water that they’re given in order to thrive and grow. To help the tree conserve water, and to keep the water from evaporating directly from the soil, you can set mulch around the tree’s base. To achieve the best effect, lay the mulch about 5 centimeters (2 inches) thick.Purchase mulch from a local landscaping company, plant nursery, or gardening center.
Mulch typically comprises various forms of organic plant material, including tree bark, straw, grass, and compost.

, The branches of a jacaranda tree grow vertically and expand outward in all directions. Let the branches grow on their own; if you trim shoots or prune branches, you may permanently stunt the tree’s growth. Whenever a jacaranda branch is prunes, it sends out vertical shoots, and so continual pruning will lead to an unnaturally tall and misshapen tree.If left undisturbed, a jacaranda will grow into a roughly umbrella-shaped tree.

, The tree’s bright-colored flower clusters can grow up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) long and 8 inches (20 inches) wide. When these fall from the tree, the flowers will carpet the ground, sidewalks, and roads beneath the tree. If the tree is on your property, you’ll be responsible for raking up and disposing of the jacaranda flowers.Do not plant a jacaranda tree in a position where its branches will arch over a swimming pool. When the flowers fall in autumn, they will blanket the surface of the pool and can clog the water filter."

If the soil is not dry, the problem could be a condition called etiolation, where the rounded or stem-shaped parts of the cactus become narrower. This tells you that the cactus needs more sunlight, so move the pot to a southern- or western-facing window.;
, Any brown or black segments should be cut away. Rotting can be caused by a fungus that appears after overwatering.If the soil is soaked throughout, remove the plant and repot in a measured soil blend. If it is not entirely soaked, let the soil dry completely before watering again.


A standard mixture of soil for cacti of desert origin consists of two parts garden soil, two parts coarse sand, and one part peat., Spherical or other rounded cacti with pointy tops, or narrowing and stringy stems in column-shaped cacti, are signs of a condition called etiolation. Insufficient sunlight is the cause, so find a spot in the home that gets sunlight for a longer period (a southern-facing window) or more intense sunlight(a western-facing window)., If the parts of the sun-facing side of the plant have yellowish or brownish skin, it is getting too much sunlight. Move it immediately to a spot with better shade, such as an east-facing window, which gets gentle sunlight.Wait to see how the cactus responds to its new shadier location. If the yellowed segments don’t improve in a few weeks, cut them away up to the healthy, green areas.

, The main insect pests that can damage cacti are mealybugs and spider mites. Mealybugs are tiny, powdery white, and appear in clusters. Spider mites are red, also quite small, and spin sheet-like webs between the cactus’s spines. To remove both these, apply rubbing alcohol directly to the infested areas with a cotton swab. A miticide may also be used for spider mites."

Wash away dust and dirt.",How to Save a Dying Cactus2," For most cacti of desert origin, a good general soil mixture consists of two parts garden soil, two parts coarse sand, and one part peat.This mixture is meant to drain well, and not harden when it is dry.Use a clay pot as well--their heaviness helps keep bulkier cacti from tipping over; they also allow the soil to breathe, preventing the roots from rotting., Test the moisture level by pressing your finger into the top inch of the soil. If it is completely dry, water the cactus fully, allowing excess water to drain out the hole in the bottom of the pot , Cacti need different amounts of water depending on whether they’re growing or dormant. During the growing season of March to September, water them, on average, once a month. During the dormant season of October to February, water only once per month at the most. Watering too much during the dormant season is the main cause of complications with cacti., Most cacti need lots of sun. In the summer, keep the cactus outdoors, being careful not to let it get too much rain. Start it in a shady area at first, gradually moving it into sunnier areas to avoid sunburn.In the winter, place the pot in a southern- or western- facing window, which have the best sun exposure.

, Cacti like cooler temperatures during their dormant period in the winter. But be careful to keep them out of the way of drafts--away from leaky windows and off the floor near doors.A healthy temperature range at night in the winter is 45 - 60 degrees Fahrenheit (7 - 16 degrees Celsius),so a basement or a room that gets less heat would be suitable storage areas during this period.


Unless you have a cold-hardy cactus, be careful not to let the room temperature drop below freezing, since most cacti can’t tolerate frost., You’ll know it’s time to transplant your cactus to a larger pot when either it becomes too top-heavy for the pot to support it, or when it grows within one inch of the edge of the pot.Use a standard potting mixture consisting of two parts garden soil, two parts coarse sand, and one part peat.Replant the cactus at the same level in the soil as it was in the original pot.

, A common result of over-watering is root rot, which happens when roots sit for too long in poorly-drained, moist soil. Before repotting, gently brush away the soil from the roots after removing the old soil ball from the original pot. Inspect the root system, and cut away any soft black roots, or any dried-up roots that appear dead. Cut just up to the part of the root that is still living.You can avoid root rot by making sure the your pot has a hole in the bottom for drainage, and that it never sits in excess water that collects in a saucer underneath the pot., If the roots are damaged when you remove the cactus from its original pot, or if you needed to cut away dead roots, let the cactus sit for about ten days out of its soil. This will allow it time to form calluses around the damaged or cut areas. Place it on a piece of paper, out of the sun but away from cool temperatures.Cacti do best after repotting if you transplant them during the growing season (March to September).Most cacti should generally be repotted every one-to-two years., Most fertilizers are given a number rating that indicates how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium they contain (in the form: N-Ph.-Po.) An example of a low-nitrogen fertilizer appropriate for cacti is 10-30-20, where the Nitrogen content is rated at 10.Too much nitrogen gives the cactus a flabby texture that impedes its growth.Never fertilize a cactus during the dormant season (October to February)., If the skin of your cactus is dusty or dirty, it may not be able to photosynthesize properly.Wash off this residue with a rag or sponge and a solution of with one drop of dish soap. Then rinse the plant under a faucet or with a soaked sponge.

However, you may have the highest chance of success if you start near the end of the plant's dormant period, or at the start of the growing season.In most cases, this means early spring, but a few succulent species begin growing in autumn or winter.If you already have a succulent cutting, skip to the next section, on planting the cutting. Even if you did not follow the steps below to remove the cutting, most succulents still have a relatively high chance of propagating.;
, Select a razor blade or sharp knife, capable of making a straight cut through the plant. Reduce the risk of infection by heating the knife blade in an open flame, or by wiping the blade with rubbing alcohol.


Using pruning shears or hand-plucking methods are not recommended, as they may cause crushed or jagged tears that the leaf cannot properly heal from.If you do try to pluck the leaf, make sure the entire leaf snaps off the stem, and use a gentle tug, not excessive force., Most succulents can grow a new plant either from an individual leaf or a stem segment. However, some genera such as Dudleya or Aeonium require a stem segment.Refer to the steps below for more information.


If you do not know what genus or species your succulent plant is, try either method. The mother plant is unlikely to suffer if you follow the instructions below, making this a low-cost experiment.
For a few unusual genera, but notably with aloe plants, the plant is best propagated by removing a newly grown ""pup"".

, If your succulent has a ""rosette"" of tightly circled leaves at the top of a stem, leave that untouched and cut leaves from lower down, but not directly at the base of the plant.For succulents that mostly grow outward, rather than upward, cut the leaves from the outer edge. Cut leaves where they connect to the stem, making a straight cut.


Unless you are also taking a stem cutting, skip ahead to the section on planting your cutting.
See the Tips section if you have a succulent with very large leaves.

, Most succulents are not difficult to grow, but you can still increase your chances of a healthy plant with the right cutting. Ideally, select a stem that is actively growing, near the top or outer edge of the plant, and 4–6 inches (10–15 centimeters) long.Cut directly beneath a stem joint, or beneath the point where a leaf or bud joins the stem.Choose a piece with at least two leaves (or clusters of leaves), if possible., If you are using a stem cutting, remove the lowest cluster of leaves. Strip them with the same, sterilized knife, leaving the lowest 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) of the stem bare. Don't remove remaining leaves higher up on the stem cutting.


If buds are on your cutting, leave them on., Commercial rooting hormone powder may hasten the development of the cutting, and often includes an antifungal agent as well to prevent rot. This treatment is recommended for rotting cuttings and for older, ""woody"" stem cuttings, but is typically not necessary otherwise.Some gardeners report success using ground cinnamon as a cheaper alternative to antifungal treatment, sprinkling it onto the cut end.

, Keep the cutting on a paper towel away from direct sunlight, and check on the cut end regularly. The cut should dry out, making the new plant less susceptible to rot. Stem cuttings can be planted after one or two days of drying.Leaf cuttings undergo a more visible change, growing a ""callous"" over the cut surface. This can take anywhere from two to seven days.If a leaf shrivels significantly during this time, you may need to plant it early. This has a lower success rate, but the leaf may die if it dries out completely.

, While waiting for the cuttings to dry, fill a small pot with a fast-draining succulent or cactus potting mix. If you wish to make your own, mix together three parts potting soil, two parts sand, and one part perlite.Use coarse, salt-free, store-bought sand if possible, since hand-gathered sand may contain microorganisms or salts that could harm plants.

, Succulent plants thrive in pots that aren't too much bigger than the plant itself. Pots that allow for about an inch or two of growing room should be fine while the cutting is getting started.


The pot must have a drainage hole.

, Stems cuttings can be planted as usual, burying the stem until the lowest leaves are just above the soil, but not touching it.Buried leaves are more likely to rot, so if you have a leaf cutting, try just touching the cut end to the soil surface, propping the leaf up with pebbles.

, Young succulents may not have the water supply to withstand direct sunlight, unlike adult plants. They do best in indirect sunlight, temperatures of around 68ºF (20ºC), and in locations with good air flow., Young succulent cuttings need a regular supply of water in order to stay alive and develop roots. However, succulents are adapted to dry climates and will usually rot if kept in soaking conditions. Try using a spray bottle or small pitcher to add water to the top of the soil as soon as it dries out, about every two or three days.Mist your leaf cutting directly as well, since it has not yet developed roots.


If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, or if your cuttings develop rot, try using distilled water., A stem cutting may have a sufficient root system after four weeks, at which point you may water as infrequently as once a month.Leaf cuttings will develop more slowly, but can also be tracked by eye as small leaves and roots emerge from the cut end. Reduce watering frequency gradually once the roots enter the soil, which may take six weeks or longer.

, Succulents are slow-growing plants, and are not adapted to growing in high-nutrient soil.Use a balanced fertilizer (for instance, 10-10-10) only during the growing season, and only once the young plant is at least four weeks old, with established roots. Consider using the fertilizer at ½ or ¼ the recommended dose, to prevent the plant becoming overly tall and ""leggy"" with little foliage, or burning its root system.

Choose a Japanese maple.,
Read the label accompanying your cultivar.,
Select free-draining soil of good quality.,
Ensure that there is both sun and shade.,
Keep the Japanese maple out of direct wind.,
Keep well watered during warmer months or dry seasons.,
Feed regularly.",How to Grow a Japanese Maple," There are many possible choices because a number of different forms of the Japanese maple have been cultivated over the last few centuries. The Japanese maple is broken into various cultivar groups to help you choose:

Palmatum group: This species has hand-like leaves with five to seven lobes.

Dissectum group: This species has deep, finely serrated edges to the leaves. Each leaf has five to nine lobes.

Linearilobum group: This group has a long and slender lobe with five to seven lobed leaves.

Most Japanese maples will grow to around 5 meters (16.4 ft) in height and end up with a broad, vase-like crown. The main trunk is usually about 1 meter (3.3 ft) in height and strong.;
, There may be specific needs that apply to your particular cultivar that should be followed.
, The soil space should be deep to allow the roots to take hold easily. If you're potting the Japanese maple, ensure that the container is of a decent size, use high quality potting mix and prefer a potting mix containing water crystals.
, A reasonable amount of daily sun is required but Japanese maples don't like hot afternoon sun. Provide adequate afternoon sun shading.
, Wind can damage or dry the tree, so find a sheltered position for it.
, A good layer of mulching will help to keep the moisture in.
, Use a good fertiliser to keep the plant well nourished. Slow-release fertiliser is a good choice for summer time.

Know your cacti.,
The idea is to avoid getting pricked with them in the first place.,
Have ready the pot you want to put your cactus into.,
Slide the plant out.,
Safety first!,
Cradling the pot in one hand and the cactus in the other hand (gloved or not) gently turn the pot on its side to see if the plant is loose.,
Determine if it is pot-bound.,
Now turn the pot on its side on a surface and holding the pot steady with one hand, insert the bamboo rod or wooden dowel into the drainage hole and gently push against the potting medium or the rock that was placed there.,
If all else fails you can try tapping the pot lightly on a surface, rotating the plant as you do.,
Once your cactus is free of its pot, pull away any old gravel and screening.,
Estimate how much soil you will need to place in the new pot to elevate the plant to the correct height and place the amount needed into the new pot.,
Make sure not to bury any part of the cacti that was not buried before when repotting as this can encourage rot.,
Once your cactus is potted you can pull off the newspaper or cloth.,
Know your options if the plant is too darn big.",How to Pot a Spiny Cactus Without Getting Pricked," Cacti are succulents, but not all succulents are cacti. For instance, the familiar jade plant is a succulent, but it is not a cactus. Some people think that the difference between succulents and cacti are the spines. But this is not true either, as there are plants in the cactus family that do not have spines. The epiphytic (tree-growing) cacti of South America are examples of this of which Christmas Cactus is a member.


Most cacti have two types of spiny parts: glochids and spines, although some have one kind, but not the other.

Glochids are usually the least noticeable because they are substantially smaller in size and paler in color, while spines are usually larger, stiffer and often more colorful. Obviously when repotting a cactus you want to avoid contact with sharp spines, however glochids can be troublesome as well. Because glochids are not as firmly attached to the plant they can easily become detached and embedded in your skin and their very small size can make them difficult to see. Anyone who has ever brushed against a prickly pear cactus knows that the little glochids were the most time-consuming to remove, as there are many more of them and they are very small, often requiring magnification to find them. Additionally, many glochids have tiny barbs on them so this makes their removal much more painful. One wonders if nature designed this as a reminder to not mess with the plant again. First you get pricked and then hours later (in case you might have forgotten the first injury) you're feeling tiny pricking sensations wherever you made contact with the plant.

;
, To this end, many gardeners wear gloves when repotting cactus and if you choose to use gloves make sure that the small glochids cannot penetrate the fabric of the glove. If you don't have a pair of suitable gloves, you can use a newspaper, or an old pant leg to protect your hands, by wrapping the plant itself with the protective covering.

, If there is a drainage hole at the bottom that is excessively large, you can prevent soil and sand from escaping during watering by cutting a piece of screening and placing it over the hole. This will still allow water to pass, but will help retain the potting medium. Some gravel or pottery shards placed at the bottom will not only help anchor the screening, but will facilitate drainage at the bottom of the pot where water is more likely to accumulate. Hint: to make repotting easier in the future place a rock or shard directly over the drainage hole. (Why you should do this will be explained later.) On top of the gravel you can place some filtering charcoal. Charcoal helps to neutralize the soil.

, Trying to wrestle the plant from the pot is more likely to cause you to be pricked, so ideally you want the plant to slide out of the pot without much effort. First thing you will want to do is determine if the plant will come out easily.

, Wrap the cactus with pages from a newspaper (not just a single page) or a cut off pant leg so that the plant is enclosed on the sides and the top of the plant. The spines should not poke through the newspaper or cloth no matter the wrapping method you use. If you want you can then gently tie this with string or use a loose-fitting rubber band to prevent it from slipping off while working with the plant.

, If the plant slides out easily you may not need to repot it at all, especially if a significant amount of soil falls away and you see the root ball is considerably smaller than the dimensions of the pot. If that is the case, do not repot! The plant is not ready to be repotted if the roots still have a lot of room to grow. The only reason to repot in this case would be because it is not in an ideal pot for its size (pot too large) or you don't like the pot's appearance.

, If the cactus doesn't slide out of the pot, it's probably because it is pot-bound. If there is room around the edges, place the pot back down on a surface in its upright position and insert the kitchen knife between the dirt and the pot and cut around the inside edge until you have made one full rotation. This should loosen the plant enough that it will slide out of the pot.


Sometimes the knife won't go in, either because the potting medium has become hard-packed (this is often the case when ordinary garden soil was used, which can contain more clay) or because the plant has overgrown the sides of the pot. Don't try to insert the knife between a plant and the pot if the plant has overgrown the pot as you could damage it. Instead water the plant enough to moisten the potting medium clear through and let the plant drain completely and if necessary dry slightly. Watering can help because the water acts as a lubricant.

, Sometimes you have to insert it at different angles and push.


See why placing a rock or shard over the hole when potting helps later on when you want to repot? The rock or shard provides a hard surface to push against and this will distribute the force over a greater area, assisting you in getting the plant out of its pot. I prefer this method over than the recommendation of tapping the pot on a surface because fewer clay pots are damaged or broken this way. Usually you will feel the plant give way, but if the rod just penetrates the soil without causing the plant to come out, don't try to force it as you might damage the fragile roots.

, If necessary you can break the pot or cut it away if it is plastic.

, If the cactus was pot-bound, gently press against the root ball to loosen some of the soil. This will help water to penetrate the old root ball rather than run straight through the next time you water.

, At this time you can mix in some of the pulverized egg shells. Next place the plant into its new pot, pushing more potting medium under it if more elevation is needed as you gently tamp down the potting medium. Make sure to fill around the sides, tapping the planter lightly on a surface to settle the potting medium. You can also use your wooden dowel to tamp soil into difficult-to-reach places. The potting soil will settle after watering so this step is important to prevent later settling.

, If you dislike the appearance of the surface of the soil you can always top the soil off with some sand or decorative gravel, but don't fill beyond the root line with regular potting soil.

, Add any decorative gravel or sand at this point and water lightly. Do not over water cacti. Make sure to place in a warm and sunny location. Cold damp locations are not good for cacti.

, If your cactus is really tall and is falling over, but is impossible to wrap or transplant to a new pot because of its size, you can always place the cactus (keeping it in its present pot) into a much larger pot and pour gravel between the two pots. Some river stones arranged around the top of the smaller pot can add extra weight to help stabilize the plant.

Choose between dragon fruit seeds or cuttings from an already developing plant.,
Determine whether you're going to grow the plant outdoors or indoors, openly or in a container.,
Use well-drained, sandy cactus soil.,
Let cuttings dry before planting.,
Plant in full sun.,
Plant flush with the soil line.,
Fertilize only occasionally.,
Water the dragon fruit plant in the same manner as a tropical cactus.,
Watch the dragon fruit plant grow.,
Prune the plant.,
Pick the fruit in the latter half of the year.,
Eat up.",How to Plant Dragon Fruit," Which one you choose all depends on time. If you're growing dragon fruit from seeds, it could be two years or so before your plant bears any fruit.If you grow from the cuttings of a stem, it could take much less time (depending on how large your cutting is).


Growing from seed isn't harder, for the record. It just takes more time.
Professional growers sell dragon fruit plants that are ready to be transplanted to your garden. Just be careful as you're taking them out of the pot, to ensure that you don't damage the seedlings.;
, Believe it or not, dragon fruit can grow just fine in containers. If you do use a container, use one that's 15"" to a 24"" in diameter, and at least 10""+ deep, fitted with a climbing pole. However, the plant will likely eventually grow to a point that it needs a bigger pot, so be prepared to transplant it when that happens.


If your plant is going to be outside (whether it's in a container or not), choose a place that's at least partly sunny. The roots can be in the shade, but the tips of the plant need to be in the sun to bloom.If you live in a warm area with a long, warm growing season, this plant could sustain being outside. They can generally handle a very light frost, but that's it. If your area has a decent winter, bring it inside.

, After all, technically this plant is a cactus. The last thing you want to use is a wet, mucky soil. They are light feeders that don't need a lot of nutrient love. Plant them in an area of your garden where water doesn't tend to pool. If you get a lot of rainfall in your area, plant the dragon fruit plant on a hill or mound, so that the water drains away.If you're planting in a container, grab a large one with drainage holes at the bottom. If you don't have cactus soil available, you can come up with your own by using a mixture of sand, potting soil, and compost. Fill it up a few inches (7cm) away from the brim of the pot.

, If you obtain a fresh cutting, it is best to let it dry in a cool, shady spot for about a week. This will allow the wound to heal and prevent infection once it is planted., The leaves of the plant should be exposed to full sun for best results. Make sure it's still getting adequate sunlight as it grows., If you're using cuttings or a farm-ordered plant from a box, take it carefully from its container and replant it flush with its new soil line. If you're using seeds, sprinkle a few into each container and cover lightly with soil.


As for seeds, you'll have to wait and see which ones take. In a few weeks, you'll have sprouts and they'll likely need separated. If not, they may not reach their full potential.
Consider mixing a small amount of slow time release fertilizer into the lower level of the soil before planting; this may help your plant grow faster., Even a cutting will take up to four months to get a good, strong root system going.However, when it comes to fertilizers, be wary: too much can easily kill your plant. For best results, feed them a little slow-time release, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer only about once every two months. You may be tempted to do more to see more immediate growth, but it won't help., In other words, only give it a little water when it's practically dry. If your plant is large enough by now to have a climbing pole, keep the climbing pole moist. A dripper would be useful in this situation.


Overwatering is possibly the most common reason plants die. Don't be tempted; they don't need it. If you're using a pot, keep in mind how it drains. If there are no drain holes, it needs even less; otherwise the water will just stay in the bottom and lead to rot and decay.

, While your plant may take a couple of years to get fully going, some hit giant spurts where they can grow a foot in a week. When it does start developing, you may want to use a climbing pole to give it structure. This can help it reach its full potential without it breaking or weighing itself down.


If you've planted your dragon fruit plant from seeds and they're now visibly growing, separate them into their own pots. They need their own turf to grow and flourish.
You'll notice a bloom start to develop over the course of many weeks. However, it will only actually bloom for one night (yep, it's nocturnal) so you'll likely miss it in its full glory. Many are self-pollinating (if it's not you can try hand-pollination; brush the pistil's natural pollen down into the inside of the flower).If a fruit is going to develop, you'll notice the flower wither and the base of the bloom begin to swell. , Dragon fruit plants can get quite large; some varieties can even reach upwards of 20 feet (6.1 m).When it gets too large, start pruning it by cutting off some branches. Less weight may actually get it stronger, concentrate the nutrients, and encourage it to flower.


You don't necessarily have to throw the branches away! You can either repot them yourself and grow another plant (they will take root virtually effortlessly) or give them away as a gift.

, Dragon fruit usually produces ripe fruit in late summer or fall, but can fruit at almost any time of year if it receives enough water and warmth. You can tell that a dragon fruit is ripe when the skin turns red or yellow, depending on variety. The skin will also feel slightly soft when squeezed, but not mushy., You've been waiting years for this moment, so savor it. You can cut the fruit into quarters and tear off the rind or just dig into it with a spoon. It's sweet and has a texture that resembles kiwifruit but it's a little crunchier.


Once in full production, you could see four to six fruit-bearing cycles per year. They amp up eventually; it just takes them a little while to get there. So don't think your first fruit will be your last. You've waited patiently and now abundance is your reward."

However, if you're in a more well stocked garden center or plant specialist, you might probably run into leftover Christmas cacti on clearance. These two, as well as the Thanksgiving or crab cactus, also are sold as ""holiday cacti"".


Easter cactus, unlike Christmas cactus, has long cladophylls (leaves), which are oval and plain, not short and toothed, wavy or scalloped. The Easter cactus also has flowers that are more open then the other species. The other ones are more closed up, like tulips, and weeping.
Epiphyllum or orchid cactus are more robust and larger plants than Easter cactus and are often hybrids of other Epiphyllum species as well as Easter cactus. These plants can be found in bloom anytime spring or summer. You can always ask the dealer or nursery attendant for confirmation of species. Orchid cactus has wavy cladophylls (leaves) that set it apart from Easter cactus.

Dwarf Easter cactus, Rhipsalidopsis rosea (pink flowers) and spring cactus Rhipsalidopsis gaertneri (bright scarlet - orange red flowers) are the two main species sold at the same time. Dwarf is smaller and more suitable for smaller rooms.
The Rhipsalidopsis and Hatiora names are used for the same species. Also there are new hybrids and colors coming around in the plant trade. New colors are hot (bubblegum/fuchsia pink), white and salmon peach colors.;
, The Easter cactus originates from the warm steaming jungles of Brazil. Unlike the desert cacti, this plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows in trees and not on the ground.The Easter cactus is not a very sensitive plant and can tolerate indoor conditions moderately well. A healthy plant is necessary for flowering to occur.

, In the northern hemisphere, if the light is from a north window, you might not have to worry too much about the sunlight being too strong. The same goes for full sun in winter because it's weaker than summer sun. However east, west or south sun is too strong for many plants and the plant must be placed further from the window or a translucent curtain should be placed between the window and the plant. Too much sun will cause Easter cactus to turn yellow and crispy brown.


The proper soil to use is a mixture of orchid potting mix and African violet mix. Mix these two in equal parts and add some cactus and succulent mix or garden sand, to help make sure that the soil drains well. It's best not to buy soil mixes with fertilizer already in them, as this can do more harm than good. Regular potting mix is too heavy for Easter cactus.
This plant flowers best when its roots are crowded. It doesn't develop a large root system so only repot when it's not growing well and too crowded. Repot it after flowering during the dormant season or in the spring.

, One of the major care issues with Easter cactus is that it's very easy to overwater this plant. Keep your Easter cactus evenly moist and not soggy during growth and flowering. Once the soil surface starts to feel dry to the touch, or the first segment of your (pointer) fingertip is dry when inserting your finger into the soil, the plant needs water.


If your plant stems start shriveling and drying out, this means that the plant needs more water.
If the plant starts turning yellow and soft your watering too much. Overwatering will cause brown scars on the plants, the plant to turn bluish grey, shrivel up and also the stems to fall off.

, The preferred range is average room temperature (50 to 70 degree F) A good rule is the higher the temperature in a room, the more moisture a plant needs the lower the temperature the less moisture it needs. The moisture in the air (humidity) and the amount of water in the soil should be adjusted based on this rule depending on the room temperature. Do no expose your plant to extremes like cold and wet or hot and dry. A plant in a cool room grows more slowly, thus using less water and humidity. A plant in a warm room grows faster and this causes water loss. So the warm room plant will use more water and humidity.

, The plant does well in average humidity. Many sources say mist the plant daily or place it a larger tray with pebbles and water, but often times this leads to rot, fungi, mold and death of the plant. Pay attention to the plant if the stems are shriveling and the soil is moist, raise the humidity when you notice this. If you use a humidifier, indoor water decor, aquarium, or keep the plant cooler than requirements you don't need to raise the humidity.

, When the plant is resting for a month after flowering don't fertilize it at all. Any fertilizer that's for orchids or African violets works well for this plant.

, If these are not controlled in a prompt manner the plant will become sickly, stunted and even die.


Spider mites are critters that produce fine cobwebs in your plant. These are not attractive to look at and if not gotten rid of, they will start to kill the plant and the plant will die. Many times spider mites are a sign that a plant is too hot and too dry. Cooling the plant down and raising the humidity will get rid of this pest, or help get under control.
Mealybugs are white wooly bugs that resemble ghostly pill bugs. They form colonies of white wooly masses mostly in the ""notches"" or joints of the plant. These pest will not only suck the plant leaves but they can also leave a sticky honeydew trail that is a breeding ground for mold and fungus on infected plants.
Scales are hard shelled insects that will resemble hard brown bumps scattered around the plant. They also excrete a sticky honeydew trail that can also support the growth of mildew or mold. You can easily get rid of these pest with by taking a damp cloth drenched in rubbing alcohol and gently wiping the pest off the plant. Drenching the plant with warm water in a shower can also help greatly. Use these techniques to treat all of the pest mentioned above. If the infestation is heavy use any houseplant insecticide following directions on package.
Watch out for slugs and snails when placed by open windows or in outdoor situations check for ragged holes in the plant. These guys can be plucked off the plant when seen.
Chlorosis is a condition that causes the leaves usually of the center of the plant to turn a weird pale green yellow color. This means the fertilizer your using doesn't contain enough micro-nutrients to keep the plant healthy. All fertilizers contain three basic nutrients for plants.nitrogen(N), phosphorus(P), potassium(K) however some others have other nutrients like copper, selenium which helps plants grow better. Another problem is cold soil temps in the fall. Plastic, glazed or ceramic pots are more insulated than terracotta clay pots.
Easter cactus doesn't like to be overwatered! There are several diseases of rot that will occur under soggy conditions. Drechslera Cladophyll Rot will cause black fuzzy spots of Drechslera fungus to grow on the leaves of the cactus. Erwinia Soft Rot causes slimy black spots to start at the soil line and take over the whole plant Fusarium Cladophyll Rot or Rust will cause tan to orange sores on the plant.Pythium and Phytophthora Rot will cause the plant to turn grayish green and roots to turn mushy.These rots cannot be treated and you can try to make cuttings and start new plants or throw the plant out.

, Cut the cuttings at the ""notch"" of the stem.

, If you plant it immediately the stem ends will rot.

, They will root in 1 to 2 months. You can also use moist sand (get your sand from a garden or aquarium shop) or vermiculite.

, The Easter Cactus starts setting blooms once it's experienced a 10 to 14 week period of long cooler nights and shorter days. The length of darkness must be 14 to 16 hours long. Budding will usually start around February or March.

, The spot needs to be cool (60 to 65) and away from droughts. Droughts are sudden temperature changes like in areas close to windows and doors. Don't put the plant near any heat or electric sources. If the plant is too warm, buds may never form.


Temperatures of chilly 50 to 45 degrees also help in bud formation.

, If you want it time for Easter, you should start around Christmas or New Years. Some new cultivars may require less time.

, Any light during this time will interrupt the process and you'll have to start over. You can do this by placing anything that doesn't allow light through, like a box, black plastic bag, or larger flowerpot (with no drainage holes) over the plant.


This includes any light! No night lights, candle lights or flashlights. If it's exposed to light during the dark period buds will not set.

, Don't worry if you don't do this the exact time each time. Just don't keep the plant covered all day the plant will stop growing!

, The tip of the stem will start to swell buds and show color. Once this happens stop the process. If the plant doesn't form flowers it mean that the Easter cactus was kept in too little light and/or the night temperatures were too high.


Don't expose the plant to sudden changes in temperature or move it around too much. Doing this will cause the buds to drop before opening. If you forget to water the plant the flowers or expose it to high heat and dry air the flowers will die prematurely.

, When the flowers get wilted and die, cut them off. Don't allow them to produce fruits as this well cause the plant to have little energy and produce small, puny flowers the next season.

, Water the plant sparingly (very little) and don't fertilize it. Flowering requires energy for any plant and the plant needs to take a month-long break. If the plant doesn't have this rest period it will not produce flowers the following year.


Be careful not to overwater the Easter cactus during this rest period. The plant is not growing and doesn't need extra water. Let the soil dry out and leave the plant alone. When the soil dries to 2 inches (5cm) or more (your entire pointer finger in the soil), then you water.

Gather your ingredients.,
 Use a drop cloth to place equal parts of your soil components to be mixed.,
 Thoroughly mix equal portions of the soil components together.,
If you have some soil left over, store it in a paint bucket or opaque heavy-duty plastic bag.",How to Mix Your Own Cactus and Succulent Soil,"  A good soil mixture includes components of sand, grit and a composting element.


The sand component should be horticulture grade quality. Asking your local nursery for horticulture sand will get you what you need.
The grit component can be a multitude of materials. Most popular grit components are pumice, lava fines and perlite.
The compost component can be something similar to the normal potting soil you might buy in a nursery.  Try to find a compost component low on sphagnum peat moss as it can attract unwanted pests for you succulents and cacti.;
,  This will keep your garden or workshop area a little cleaner.

, It's important to mix the components as best as possible to ensure your plant will be happy once planted.

, Saguaro, like other cacti, need extremely loose, loamy and coarse soil that is free of organic fertilizers like manure.


Combine 1-part each of sand, peat moss, turf soil and garden loam.
Fill the pot 3/4 full of soil.

, Poke several small holes in the soil 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart using a pencil. Make the holes about 1/8 inch (0.4 cm) deep. Place the saguaro seeds in the holes and lightly pinch the soil closed over them.

, Place plastic wrap securely over the pot. Poke holes in the plastic wrap to aerate the soil.

,, Sprinkle water over the soil every 10 days so the seeds don't dry out. Even when growing from seed, cacti do not like too much water, so do not water more than every 10 days.

, After 4 to 6 weeks, you will be able to remove the plastic wrap. Keep the saguaro seedlings moist by watering once a month.

Get your kalanchoe to re-bloom.",How to Grow Kalanchoe," The best way to grow a kalanchoe plant is to take a cutting from a fully grown plant, then and planting the cutting to grow a new kalanchoe. Use a sharp pair of gardening shears to snip off a branch of a fully grown kalanchoe branch. Remove all the leaves on the lower 2 inches (5.08 cm) of the branch except for 2 leaves., After you make the cutting and remove most of the leaves, place the cutting on a paper towel and leave it out for a few days to dry. This process of drying the cutting is called “callusing.”, Once the cutting has dried, dip the end that you cut in rooting hormone. Rooting hormone stimulates the cutting so that the roots develop more quickly and healthily., Fill a small pot with drainage holes in the bottom with well-drained soil. Clay pots are a good choice for succulents because they breathe. Then make a hole in the soil with a pencil or pen. Take the dried cutting and place it in the hole you made, letting the top of the cutting poke out.It’s essential to get well-drained soil for your cutting so that the soil doesn’t trap too much moisture. You can find well-drained soil at gardening stores, and can even find soil that is formulated especially for succulents.
You can also try a mix of 60% peat moss and 40% perlite.Only dunk the cutting once in rooting hormone. Using too much rooting hormone can have a negative effect on the growth of the plant.

, Once you stick the cutting into the soil, lightly water the soil until it is barely moist. Then take a large plastic bag, cut some slits in the top, and place it over the pot to completely cover it.


Using the plastic bag to cover the pot helps make a humid environment for the cutting so that it flourishes and grows.

, After you place the bag over the pot, put the pot on a table or windowsill in indirect sunlight. Check the soil about once a week and water lightly if the soil is dry, replacing the bag back on top of the pot after watering.Until your kalanchoe has rooted, it needs to remain in bright, indirect sunlight.

, After 2-3 weeks, the roots should start growing. At this point, you can take the bag off the top of the pot, still keeping the pot in a sunny place and watering about once a week when the soil is dry., Kalanchoe need plenty of sunlight, no matter if you are growing the plant from a cutting or have bought it fully grown. If you are growing the kalanchoe inside, place it in a south-facing window in winter for direct sunlight, and in an east or west window for bright indirect sunlight in the summer.During the summer, too much direct sunlight can harm your plant., Like most succulents, kalanchoe grow best in moderate to warm temperatures. Kalanchoe do well in typical household temperatures, but if you are growing kalanchoe outside in pots, take them in whenever the temperature drops below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees C)., Kalanchoe need a very specific amount of water so that they receive the proper nourishment but don’t suffer from overwatering. When the soil is dry, water the plant deeply until water comes out of the bottom holes of the pot and pools in the drainage tray. Remove the tray from the bottom and pour out the water, then place the tray back under the pot. Allow the soil to dry completely, about a week and a half, then water again., Though kalanchoe are relatively self-sufficient plants, they do benefit from occasional fertilizing. Use a balanced, organic fertilizer such as a 20-20-20. To apply the fertilizer, follow the instructions on the label, making sure not to apply more fertilizer than the label advises.If you buy your plant from a store, it should come fertilized and you shouldn’t have to worry about it for a couple of months or so.

, If you are keeping your kalanchoe plant outside, make sure to put it in a well-protected area so that it isn’t exposed to rain. Rain can oversaturate the plant and even kill it., Once your kalanchoe has bloomed, keep an eye out for dead stalks or foliage. If you any dead growths, clip them off carefully with a pair of sharp shears right below where the dead growth starts.Reduce the amount of watering you give the plant for a couple of weeks after cutting dead growths.

, Though kalanchoe are generally resistant to disease and most insects, if they are being raised outside they can be damaged by certain bugs such as aphids and spider mites. Combat insects by applying an organic insecticide spray according to the packaging.You can also make your own all natural insecticide by mixing a few drops of dish soap, a few drops of canola or sunflower oil, and a liter of water (33.8 ounces).To apply, spray the plant directly on the affected area where the bugs are attached to the plant.

, Kalanchoes can flower again the next season if you take the proper steps to care for them. Your plant will need at least six weeks of natural winter days in order for its flower buds to form, which means about 12 hours of darkness each day.

Your plant needs to be in the dark when the sun is down during fall and winter.
Since you will likely be keeping the plant inside to protect it from the cold, place it in a room that is dark or inside of a closet during the evening and nighttime hours. This will allow the plant to bud."
"
Get the pots ready.,
Prepare your medium.,
Provide good sunlight.,
Fill the pots until the desired level with the potting mix so that the tip of the roots will touch it.,
Water your plant.,
Fertilize, during the summer growing season, as you would with other houseplants.,
Propagate your succulents by any of the following methods.",How to Grow Succulents in Pots," Succulents require pots which will accommodate the plant comfortably. The actual pot size will depend on the size of the plant. Make sure that you are not using either too large or too small pot.


There should be 3 or more holes at the bottom of the pot to allow complete drainage and aeration. Clay pots are the best.
Fill 1/3rd of the pot with gravel. Then cover it with 1-2 inches thick layer of coarse sand.;
, If you don't want to use, or don't have ready access to, ready-made succulent mix available in the market, prepare your own. Mix up a nutritious, well-drainable medium to use for planting. Use one part of garden soil, one part of coarse (river) sand and two parts of leaf mould and mix them thoroughly. Please remember to grind the soil and the leaf mould well before mixing.

, Succulents prefer bright light; hence, place the pots in an area where plenty of sunlight, direct or indirect is available. An ideal sun exposure will be from dawn to 12 noon during the summer.


Some species like the Epiphyllum and Rhipsalis require less exposure to the direct sunlight, as it may damage the plants.

, Then, hold the plant carefully at the centre of the pot, allow the roots to hang inside and place the potting mix loosely around the roots till it covers them up. Tamp down the mix delicately, if necessary with a small stick, around the roots. You may also knock the pot softly on the ground, to settle the potting soil.

, The first watering will be done on the 3rd day of planting. The plant will require the first two days to keep the soil dry in order to heal any possible damage to the root system during repotting or transit.


It's best if the first watering can be done from the bottom; to do this, you need to place the pot in a half filled tumbler, when water will climb up the soil mix through the bottom holes by capillary action. It will also permeate through the minute pores of a clay pot, along its submerged part.
Subsequent watering will have to be undertaken according to the growth rate and species of the individual plant. A thumb rule is that the soil mix should be allowed to dry up before the next watering. Succulents grow during summer and rest during winter. Usually, watering twice to thrice a week during the summer, once a week to once a fortnight during early and late winter and once a month during the peak of cold is recommended.
Over-watered plants are soft and discolored. The leaves may be yellow or white and lose their color. A plant in this condition may be beyond repair, but you can still remove it from its pot and inspect the roots. If they are brown and rotted, cut away dead roots and repot into drier potting media, or take a cutting and propagate the parent plant.
An under-watered plant will first stop growing, then begin to shed leaves. Alternatively, the plant may develop brown spots on the leaves.

, Stop fertilizing entirely during the winter. Nitrogen content of the used fertilizer should always be very low.


A low nitrogen NPK, as in the ratio of 5-15-15 can be used in a diluted, liquid form. Depending on the season, growth rate and the overall health of the plant, this can be mixed with the water every 2nd or 3rd watering. Always dilute more than the stated instructions advise, as recommended dosage is too strong for these plants.
For the organic option, liquid cow dung manure, obtained by mixing fresh cow dung with water (1 Kg in 10 Litres) and storing it for a week, can be used in 1 in 20 dilution once in a week while watering.

,


By seeds - Succulent seeds require a sterile, fine particle soil mix, heat (approximately 75 to 80°F), reduced light and maintenance of even moisture without being soggy to germinate. Prepare a pot with a fine particle soil mix and water it thoroughly. Disperse the succulent seeds on top of the soil, allowing spaces between the seeds so that the seedlings will have room to grow. (Succulent seedlings are tiny at first; usually measuring less than 1/8"" of an inch in diameter, and, depending upon the species, remain that small for months). The seed is then covered very lightly with a fine particle ""top dressing"" (such as the same soil but sifted). The seed pan should be watered daily with a very fine mist with a sprayer, making sure that only the top surface is allowed to dry somewhat in 24 hour intervals. Seed should begin to germinate within two weeks, but will appear as tiny bright green dots. As the seedlings approach 6 weeks of age, they can be gradually ""weaned"" from the water. At this time, the seedlings can be watered every other day except in very hot weather. Depending upon the variety, the seedlings can be taken out of the seed pot at 6 months to a year of age and put in small pots.
By Cuttings - Cut off a 2 -3 inches long part from the apex of a stem, with a sharp, sterile knife. Allow the cutting to callous for several days to a week (depending upon the ambient climate). During this time, a ""callus"" will form at the cut area. This ""callus"" is very analogous to the scab that the human body produces for cuts and scrapes. This ""callus"" or scab provides a two-fold barrier to protect the plant or animal. Fluid cannot leak out (which could lead to desiccation) and bacteria and fungus cannot enter (which could lead to serious disease). After the callus has formed, plant the cutting in a soil mix with extra perlite. The extra perlite will allow the aeration necessary to enable production of healthy roots. Sometimes, if you wait a bit too long before planting your cutting, it may produce ""aerial"" roots, which are actually capable of absorbing water!
By Leaves - Succulents can also be propagated by leaf cuttings. This procedure will not work for all succulents, but will be very successful with many. It is necessary to very carefully detach a leaf from the stem, making sure the leaf is detached very cleanly, and not torn away. The leaf should be placed in a cool, shady place for several weeks to a month until a tiny ""plantlet"" begins to form at the base of the leaf. The leaf can then be carefully planted in a porous soil, and should not be allowed to dry completely while the roots form. This may take a few weeks. When the leaf feels ""anchored"" into the soil, and the ""plantlet"" begins to grow, the plant can gradually be given normal watering.
By Tissue Culture - This method is only for those with access to a laboratory, but it is a method of producing many plants fairly rapidly from the cells of just one plant. In this process, cells are isolated from plant tissue. Research is done to determine what percentages of various hormones and nutritive elements are required by that particular type of plant. The cells are then placed on agar in petri dishes, and are ""transfused"" with the hormone and nutrition liquids. The environment must be extremely sanitary and must be kept at a constant humidity and warm temperature (around 70 degrees Fahrenheit). The single cells begin to divide, and produce more cells which become ""specialized"" to perform various functions, leading to the formation of a new, complete, fully functioning plant from a single cell.

Pick silver-leafed euphorbia for good drainage.,
Chose variegated euphorbias if your environment has lots of light.,
Opt for a Mediterranean euphorbia if you live in a hot environment.,
Grow woodland euphorbia for more shaded environments.",How to Grow Euphorbia1," Silver-leaved euphorbia varieties are low-growing and adapt well to sunny environments. They also are more flexible with drainage in comparison to other euphorbia plants and can be tolerant to lower-quality soil.


Euphorbia myrsinites has spidery arms and produces yellow top knot flowers in the spring.Euphorbia rigida is erect and sharp-leafed, and its flowers grow in a spiral shape. Its color is almost metallic. They are, however, more prone to pest infestations.;
, Variegated euphorbias look best in bright places because the soil it grows in is darker. Really vicious winters kill this variety, so grow it in warmer environments. Compared to other varieties, variegated euphorbias are more short-lived.

""Tasmanian tiger"" euphorbia is the brightest variety, and it grows cream and gray-green flowers rather than the usual yellow. Initially this variety was grown in Tasmania, but it's often grown in North America, Canada, and Great Britain., Mediterranean varieties (particularly euphorbia characias) are great winter plants for sunny, well-drained areas so long as you shelter them from frost storms. Mediterranean euphorbias are usually tall, billowing plants that produce bright yellow varieties in the spring.If left to themselves, Mediterranean euphorbias often self-seed, leaving less hassle for you.

, Woodland euphorbia grows best in darker environments than other varieties, though they still need some sunlight to grow. These euphorbias are usually stockier and have grey-green foliage.

Prepare well-draining soil in a pot for circulation.,
Grow euphorbia from cuttings.,
Cut new shoots off of a Euphorbia plant.,
Place the shoots in a pot with well-draining soil.,
Keep the shoot in moist soil as it roots.,
Plant it outdoors in a moderate climate once the cutting has rooted into the pot.",How to Grow Euphorbia2," Euphorbia plants need well-draining soil so air can circulate around the roots. You can buy soil specifically for succulents at most nurseries, or you can prepare it yourself. Ideal potting conditions for succulents is two parts soil, one part peat moss, one part clean sand, and one part perlite., Euphorbia seeds have a limited shelf life, so they are typically not available in commercial markets. Instead, purchase euphorbia plants from a local nursery during spring and summer months., To propagate new Euphorbia plants, cut the newest shoots from the Euphorbia plant. You can recognize new shoots from their bright green color. Use sharp scissors or a knife to make a clean cut. Rinse off the milky sap with cold water and allow it to dry before you plant it.Wear gloves while cutting euphorbia plants. The sap is a skin irritant and can be toxic., After you have cut one or two shoots from the Euphorbia plant, dip the end of the shoots in ground charcoal to seal the cut until you plant the shoots. Push the shoots into the edge of the pot, as this prevents the plant from drying out., Euphorbia plants need sunlight as it grows but also prefers a moist soil climate. Look for a location that receives bright light but is out of direct sunlight. Place the pot in this location and let it root for two to three weeks., When the plant has rooted, you can put it in a larger pot or plant it outdoors in moderate climates. Most euphorbia varieties prefer dappled sunlight with an even mix of sun and shade throughout the day."
"
Prune your euphorbia regularly.,
Water whenever the soil is dry.,
Avoid overwatering your plant.,
Check for fungal diseases.,
Watch for pests.",How to Grow Euphorbia3," Euphorbia benefits from being pruned often, especially after flowering. When the plant begins flowering, cut back euphorbia stems at the base. Trim back any damaged stems to keep the plant tidy and healthy, especially if your plant displays signs of root rot.

In autumn, cut the plant back to the ground to avoid frost killing it. Your euphorbia will grow back in the spring., Euphorbia can survive in drought, but watering often will keep your plant healthy. During warm seasons, especially the summer, water weekly or whenever the soil is dry several inches below the surface. Water the plant deeply, but don't let it sit in wet soil in case of root rot.The best time to water euphorbia in warm weather is the evening. Less water will evaporate, and plants take up more water when the temperature is cool. In the winter months, early morning watering can provide similar benefits., If your plant's root system gets too wet, the plant may develop root rot. Signs of root rot include drooping flowers or a brown, soft plant neck. Cut off the affected parts to save the plant from root rot, and ease up on watering as the plant heals.Most Euphorbia varieties do not need to be watered daily.
Plants in late stages of root rot must be destroyed. If the browning has spread to most of your euphorbia, dispose of it and propagate a new plant.

, Mildewing is the most common fungal disease for succulents, and it appears as a powdery white film. If your plant doesn't get enough sunlight or ventilation, the damp conditions can grow mildew. Use a fungicide marketed for roses ornamental plants, as general purpose fungicides are unsafe for euphorbia plants.Isolate infected Euphorbia as soon as possible to avoid mildew spreading to other plants.

, Bug problems need to be caught early before they damage your plant. Mealybugs and spider mites are the most common pests for Euphorbia. To kill mealybugs or spider mites, fill a spray bottle with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Spray the alcohol directly on the pests, checking back every one to two days to kill surviving pests.Mark your spray bottle carefully and keep it next to your plant, as isopropyl alcohol can be toxic.
Mealybugs are small, oval-shaped insects covered with a white, powdery coating.Spider mites are miniscule, reddish-brown arachnids that are generally no larger than the period at the end of this sentence."

The seeds aren't in the bright yellow flowers.,
Several months after the flower dies off and only the pod remains, gather the pods just before they dry out.

,
The pods will come off with a slight twist, leaving the fiber/cotton on the cactus.

,
Use a razor knife to slice the tops off the pods and slice down one side of the pod to expose the seeds.

,
Using a little shovel-like tool about the size of a Popsicle stick, scrape the seeds out of the pod.

,
Place the seeds in some water to soak overnight.

,
Fill germination trays with a well blended mixture of 60% peat moss/40% vermiculite and one to one part of number two coarse sand.

,
Use a horse syringe to suck the small seeds and some of the water into the syringe.

,
With the syringe, distribute the seeds evenly in the germination tray, shaking the syringe so the seeds don't settle at the bottom and all come out at once.

,
Place the trays in full sun and keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate in approximately 4 to 6 weeks.,
When the small cacti start to sprout tiny needles, use a pair of tweezers to transfer them from the propagation trays into 5 cm (2 inch) pots filled with the same soil mix used in the germination trays.

,
Allow the small cacti to grow for about one year.

,
After a year move the cacti to 10 cm (4 inch) pots and allow them to grow for another year or two.

,
During the second to third year of development in the 10 cm pots, the cacti have enough needles to ward off most of normal landscape creatures and are sufficiently established to grow in their final settings.

You can create a gorgeous centerpiece in a box, a glass bowl, a vase, a small pot, or even a glass bowl or decorative lantern! The options are plentiful. Check craft stores, home improvement stores, and gardening stores for the perfect container.

If you want these containers to be the permanent home for your succulents, make sure that they have drainage holes in the bottom. If they don’t, make sure you can drill holes into the bottom.If you’re only planning on keeping the succulents in the containers for an event, drainage holes are less important.
If you’re making centerpieces for a large event, you may want to order your containers online in bulk.;
, Your centerpiece container will probably be on the small side as it is, but choose a shallow dish so that you don’t need a large amount of potting mix.You don’t need a deep, thick layer of potting mix for succulents, which makes them such an ideal plant for a centerpiece. Any container a couple of inches deep will do., This may or may not be necessary, depending on the container you’ve selected. Glass containers may have smudges, and pots from gardening stores may be dirty, so clean your pot before you get to work creating your centerpiece. You want your centerpiece to look clean and polished on the table, and it’s much easier to clean it before adding the succulents., To create an interesting centerpiece, you want to choose a nice variety of succulents. The amount you buy will depend on the size of your container, but typically you want one or two large succulents and a variety of smaller ones to fill in the space around them. Try to find ones of varying colors and leaf types to create interest., You have a few options for this step. You can purchase a succulent mix or even a cactus mix at your local gardening store.You can also make your own by combining potting soil and sand. Succulents flourish in porous potting mixes that don’t retain much moisture, so keep that in mind. Fill your container of choice with your potting mix, and then press the surface to flatten it., To start, put your largest succulent in the middle of the container. This is the focal point of the centerpiece. If you have any particularly bright and colorful succulents, place those in the center as well. Then, simply arrange the smaller succulents moving out from the center however you desire.Make sure not to leave any large gaps in the centerpiece. Use the very smallest succulents to fill in these holes.
Lay out your arrangement first, and then start covering the roots with soil.

, For a rustic-looking centerpiece, tie twine around your container. If you are using these for a wedding or a party with a specific color scheme, you can use ribbons in that color. This is a simple addition to the centerpiece that can make them look very polished and decorative., This actually has a few purposes. The marbles or stones make the centerpiece look elegant and professional, covering the less aesthetically-pleasing potting soil. Additionally, the stones keep the soil from moving or covering the leaves of the succulents. You can choose fancier marbles that will reflect light and create color in the centerpiece, or simple stones.

Make sure to water your succulent before placing the stones over the soil.

, Instead of filling the container entirely with succulents, you can place candles within the succulents for a romantic touch. Choose wide candles that won’t tip over easily, and make sure they are taller than the surrounding succulents. Light your candles for a soft, glowing centerpiece.If you aren’t comfortable having an open flame at your event, you swap out real candles for fake, battery operated candles.

, If you’re using succulent centerpieces for an event, you might as well get double use out of them. Tie a number around the container to use these as table markers. They’ll look beautiful and help your guests find their seats. For an extra special touch, include a note encouraging your guests to take them home as a party favor."

You may want to consider pairing a few green succulents, such as jade, with a pink sedum to give a bit of colour. Look at a variety of different succulent plants and choose a colour combination that works with your style and event., You also want to select a variety of different succulents. This will give your boutonniere more texture and depth. For instance, you may want to pair a short succulent, such as pink sedum with taller and thin succulents, such as haworthia fascinata or sedum burrito., Although a combination of different succulent varieties will make a beautiful boutonniere, you may want to consider adding a flower or some greenery as a filler. For example, you could add a sprig of baby’s breath or a single rose to give the succulent boutonniere a bit of colour and texture., If the succulents you have selected to use have roots, you will need to cut off the roots using a pair of scissors. For example, you may be using a succulent that was previously planted in a pot and therefore has a small root ball. Cut the root at the base of the plant., Insert a three to five inch (7-12 cm) piece of floral wire into the base of the succulent. Pull the wire all the way through until the succulent is positioned in the middle of the wire. Then fold the wire downward from the base of the succulent so that it creates a wire stem. Repeat this with each individual succulent you are using.For a boutonniere you should use 24-32 gauge wire. This wire can be purchased at a local florist or craft supply store.

, Once you have created a wire stem, wrap the stem with floral tape. Start the tape at the base of the succulent and continue to wrap it around the wire all the way to the end. You can use green floral tape to look like a natural stem, or use a bright colour to match with the suit or tie., Once you have created an individual stem for each succulent, you need to join them all together. Twist two of the wire stems together to help secure them in place.You can also slightly bend the wire to position the succulents so that they are facing in right direction.

, Using floral tape, wrap all of the stems together. This will create a relatively thick single stem for the boutonniere., Once you are finished wrapping all of the stems together, you can cut the wire stem so that it is the desired length. Typically, you only want to leave about a one inch (2.5 cm) stem. If you want to a create a curled stem you can leave it slightly longer., Use a small piece of ribbon or twine and tie it around the boutonniere. You can wrap the ribbon or twine around the stem of the boutonniere and then attach it with hot glue, or you can tie a small bow with the ribbon to secure it to the stem., To add some extra style to the boutonniere you can create a big tail with the stem of the boutonniere. Instead of cutting the stem to one inch (2.5 cm), leave the stem longer. Then wrap the stem around a pencil. Pull the pencil out and you will be left with a spiral tail, like a pig tail., Once your succulent boutonniere is complete use a long pearl pin to attach the boutonniere to the suit jacket. Be careful when attaching the boutonniere because you do not want to get poked by the pin.

, A succulent boutonniere can keep for up to a week in a warm and brightly lit room. Avoiding keeping your succulent boutonnieres in the refrigerator. This can actually damage them. If they begin to droop you can spray them with a light mist of water, although this may not be necessary.You can also plant the succulents following your event, as a permanent reminder of your special day.

Give the cactus additional recovery time.",How to Repot a Cactus," For most cacti species, you will need to repot the plant once its roots begin to show through the drainage holes of your pot or once the crown of the cactus reaches the edge of the pot.


This will usually occur every two to four years.Repot your cactus during the dry season, usually in late winter or early spring. Roots may break during the process, and moisture can cause those broken roots to rot.;
, Slip on thick leather gloves. The material must be thick so that it can help protect you against the prickly spines of the plant.


Gloves alone may not be enough to protect your skin, but even if you take other protective measures, you should still include thick gloves among them.

, Run a dull knife around the inside perimeter of the pot, using a sawing motion to help break up the soil there. Continue as needed until the soil starts coming up as a solid mass.


If you have a plastic pot, you could also try squeezing the sides of the pot to loosen the soil there. Tap along the sides of the pot with a dull knife to help loosen the soil, as well.
The soil surrounding the root mass should be completely loosened before you remove the cactus. Otherwise, you could end up damaging the plant.

, Stack a few sheets of newspaper together and fold them in thirds to create a thick, sturdy strip. Wrap this strip around your cactus. Carefully grab this strip, pressing it against the cactus as you work, and lift both the strip and cactus up and out of the pot.Alternatively, you could skip the newspaper and use an old pair of barbecue tongs to lift the cactus out. The idea is simply to keep your skin as far away from the spines of the cactus as possible.

, Place the cactus on your working surface and use your fingers to brush off large pieces of soil from the roots. Carefully separate the roots, as well.


The roots do not need to be completely clean, but most of the loose pieces of debris should be brushed away.
Keep your gloves on during this part of the process.

, Check the roots for signs of rot, diseases, or pests. Treat these problems as needed when you come across them.Apply a fungicide to get rid of rot or other fungi.
Apply a gentle pesticide to get rid of any pests.
Use small clippers to cut off any roots that appear dehydrated or dead.

, Root pruning is somewhat controversial, and your cactus will likely survive the repotting procedure even if you leave the roots alone. Pruning the roots may help the plant thrive more efficiently, though, especially if done right.


Large tap roots take in very few nutrients. They transport and store nutrients but do not actually absorb many, so they do not help the cactus grow faster.
Cutting the larger roots can promote the health of the capillary roots, which are responsible for drawing in water and nutrients.
Use a sharp, clean blade to cut back the primary taproot by one-fifth to one-half its current size. Cut the larger roots as well, shortening them by one-fifth to one-half their size.

, Keep the cactus in a warm, dry area for about four days to let the roots dry out slightly.


The roots may get damaged when you remove the plant from its pot, and any breaks are likely to become infected with fungi or rot. The roots will be similarly vulnerable if you decide to prune them. Letting the roots dry removes this risk of infection.

, When selecting a new pot for your cactus, you should only choose a pot that is one size larger than the pot you removed the plant from. Anything larger may cause problems.


If a pot is too large, the soil will end up storing more water. This water can linger around the roots and eventually cause them to rot.
Large pots should be avoided for varieties that commonly experience root rot, like Astrophytum, Ariocarpus, Lophophora, Aztekium, and Obregonia. This is not as important for hardy species, though, like Cereus, Trichocereus, Hylocereus, Stenocereus, Myrtillocactus, and Opuntia.

, Place a little coarse potting soil in the bottom of the new pot. Use enough potting soil to keep the cactus planted at the depth it was originally planted at within in the old pot.


You may also want to consider laying a layer of drainage material, like gravel or broken clay pots (crocks), at the base of the pot before adding a layer of soil.

, If you do not have the newspaper you used when removing the cactus, prepare another strip by stacking a few layers on top of one another and folding them into thirds. Snugly wrap this newspaper around the body of the cactus.


Make sure that you have a good grip on the cactus through the newspaper.
You should have your thick leather gloves on during this part of the process, as well.
If you do not have newspaper available to you, old, clean barbecue tongs can also work.

, Carefully pick up the cactus using the newspaper and place it in the center of its new pot. Rest it on or just above the soil in the bottom of the pot.


Never press the cactus into the soil. Doing so can cause severe damage to the roots. You'll need to carefully fill the roots in with soil in order to secure it without causing harm.

, Carefully fill in the space around your cactus with more coarse potting mix. Sprinkle in as much as needed to hold the cactus in the center of the pot without packing the soil in.


Once the sides are roughly halfway full, gently tap the sides of the pot. This encourages the soil to get into the root mass gently. Repeat this step again once the sides are completely filled in.
At this point, you should also make sure that the plant is not too deep or not too high. Carefully adjust the position of the cactus in the pot as needed so that the green portion is above the soil while the brown root portion remains below the soil.

, While not strictly essential, a layer of compost can help maintain proper soil acidity and a layer of gravel or grit can improve drainage.


The compost should be slightly acidic, with a pH between 4 and 5.5. Mix the compost into the soil along the sides of the pot.
Only spread a thin layer of gravel on the soil surface, scattering it around the base of the cactus.

, For hardy species, wait several days to a week before watering your cactus so that it can continue drying and recovering. For species prone to root rot, wait two to three weeks before watering.


After its recovery period ends, you should be able to care for the cactus as you always have.

Select a patch for your garden.,
Test the pH of the soil.,
Prepare your soil.",How to Grow Peppers1," There are many types of peppers available on the market, and you can choose which kind to grow depending on the size, color, and level of spice your desire.

Bell peppers, also called sweet peppers, are the most mild of all the pepper varieties. They come in shades of red, orange, yellow, and green and tend to be about the size of a fist. Grow these to eat raw or add to many dishes.
Hot peppers come in many different varieties. The most mild of all the hot peppers is the anaheim pepper, but other popular varieties include the jalapeno and the serrano pepper.;
, Choose an area in your yard with full sunlight and good drainage.

You will grow the largest peppers in full sunlight, but they can grow in a bed that has a little shade. Avoid planting peppers in an area in complete shade.
If your soil is very rocky or tends to flood in the rain, consider building a raised bed for your peppers.

, Peppers grow best in a soil with a pH between 6.2 and 7.0. Err on the high side of the pH scale, however, as peppers can withstand slightly alkaline conditions.


If your soil is too acidic, add limestone or wood ash to neutralize the pH.
If your soil is too alkaline, add pine needles or peat moss to neutralize the pH.

, Mix fertilizer into your soil and remove any rocks and separate any large chunks in the dirt.


Fertilizers include fishmeal, chicken manure, or a pre-mixed fertilizer available for purchase at a local gardening center.
Hand pick any weeds that may be present to prevent them from overrunning your pepper patch.

Choose an area with good drainage and preferably with light, sandy soil. Make sure that it is fully in the sun. Avoid areas with poor air flow or where asparagus has been planted before., Have your soil tested for pH levels and acidity. Alternatively, purchase a soil testing kit to do this yourself. Purple asparagus needs soil with a pH level between 6.5 and 7.0. Repeat the tests every three years to see if you need to make any changes to your asparagus bed.Amend the soil with lime if the pH level is too low. Till the lime deeply into the soil.

, A year before you plant your purple asparagus, grow buckwheat on the site in the summer. Grow rye or wheat on the site in the fall and winter. This will also increase the organic matter in the soil., Begin preparing the asparagus bed in late fall. Spread a three inch (7.62 cm) layer of mulch, manure, leaf mold, wood shavings, or compost into the bed. Dig or till it down to about 10-12 inches (25.4-30.48 cm) below the surface. Turn the soil so it covers all of your organic matter., Plant asparagus with basil, beets, lettuce, parsley, spinach, strawberries, and tomatoes. Maximize the nutrient levels in your garden by planting purple asparagus with strawberries, which root on different levels. Don’t rotate asparagus onion, leeks, chives or garlic, which can transmit diseases to your asparagus planting., Dig your trenches about 8-10 inches (20.32-25.4 cm) deep in sandy soil. If you have more clay in your soil, dig the trenches about 6 inches (15.24 cm) deep. Lay down some phosphate fertilizer prior to planting.Start planting when temperatures are between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (23.88 and 29.44 Celsius) during the day and around 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.55 degrees Celsius) in the evenings.

, Plant the crowns between 8 and 12 inches (20.32 and 30.48 cm) apart in the center of the trench. Prior to planting, put 2 inch (5.08 cm) mounds of soil in the spots where you will place the crowns. Put the crowns above the roots. Be sure to remove any rotten roots before you plant the crowns., Don’t fill in the trenches completely unless you have very sandy soil. Cover the crowns with about 3 inches (7.62 cm) of soil. After six weeks, cover them with another 3 inches (7.62 cm) of soil. Fill in the trenches completely after the plants have gone dormant in the late fall or spring., Hand weed and hoe to remove weeds during the planting year. There aren’t really safe herbicides for purple asparagus in its first year. Pull out weeds early and often. Also mulch your asparagus bed to prevent weeds., Check your plants regularly for insects. The most prevalent pest is the asparagus beetle. Look for its dark, slug-like larvae on the ferns. Other signs to look for include insect bites and brown stems. Hand pick the larvae off of the ferns. Spray with an approved pesticide to get rid of adult asparagus beetles.Adult asparagus beetles are red with black spots or metallic-colored with yellow spots.

, Look for signs of diseases like wilting and yellowing mature ferns in hot summer weather or light green oval lesions on the shoots that eventually appear as dark blisters. Don’t over harvest the plants and make sure you plant in soil that has good drainage and high pH levels to prevent crown rot. Prevent asparagus rust by removing infested ferns.You can apply an approved fungicide on a seven to ten day cycle starting when the ferns are about 3 feet (0.9 m) (0.914 m) high. Stop using the fungicide in mid-September., During the first year, water your purple asparagus during dry spells. Avoid overwatering because the plants can’t tolerate water-logged soil. Overwatering can also contribute to crown rot and rust. Mulch your asparagus beds well during the summer months to retain moisture in the soil. Use straw, hay, or grass clippings and be sure that your mulch doesn’t contain weeds or weed seeds., Start harvesting your purple asparagus three years after planting the crowns. Only harvest for one month at first. This will let the plant establish its strong root system, which harvesting can weaken. After this, harvest the purple asparagus spears from early spring through May or June for about eight weeks each season., Don’t let the asparagus get much taller or the stalks will be very tough and difficult to harvest. Snap the stalks at the soil surface to harvest. Avoid cutting the stalks, which can injure the crown buds that will produce the next spears., This will help retain moisture in the asparagus bed and allow the plants to grow extensive storage root systems. Allow the asparagus to continue growing after your harvesting season is over. If necessary, stake your plants and tie them with strings for extra support. Plant the rows parallel to your garden’s prevailing wind patterns so the plants can support each other."

Find the right time to grow.,
Soak your seeds.,
Sow your seeds in a seed tray.,
Use lights to help the seeds grow.,
Harden off your seedlings when they are four to six inches tall.,
Prepare your seedlings to plant outdoors.",How to Grow Peppers2," Different varieties of peppers take different amounts of time to grow, so check your pepper species to find out. Hot peppers take the longest - about 12 weeks until maturity - while bell peppers take about 8 weeks to reach maturity.


Peppers don’t grow in cold or frosty soil, so wait to plant them until the weather has warmed enough.
Plant peppers outside at least one month after your last day of frost for the best temperature of soil.
Choose a date that you feel matches the temperature requirements of outdoor soil for you peppers, and count back 8-10 weeks from that date; this is when you will start your seedlings. Memorial day is typically a good time to plant peppers, meaning that you start your seeds in early March.

, Soaking your seeds can help to break down the seed covering and expedite the growing process of the peppers. Place the seeds in a cup of water and leave them for 2-8 hours, or until the sink to the bottom of the cup.


Make a cup of weak chamomile tea to aid in disinfecting the seeds. Soak the entire time in the cup of cooled tea to help dissolve the seed coating even faster.
Mix two tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide with a cup of lukewarm water to soak the seeds in if chamomile tea is unavailable. It too aids in disinfecting the seeds.

, They will only stay in this tray until they’re ready to plant, so don’t worry about using anything too nice or fancy.


Use a store-bought seed tray for the easiest place to sow your seeds, or make your own using an old plastic or cardboard milk jug with holes poked in the bottom.Fill the bottom of the seed tray with pebbles or small rocks and then cover with potting soil.
Plant seeds half an inch apart just under the surface of the soil, and water well.

, Peppers need a lot of sunlight, but the seeds can’t get enough sun from a window indoors. Instead, use any large light (it doesn’t have to be hot) and place it as close to the seedlings as possible.

, Pepper plants are delicate and need to be gradually exposed to a colder outdoor environment before they are transplanted entirely.


About two weeks before you plan to transfer your plants outdoors, you need to gradually expose the plants to the outdoor climate.
Start by placing your seedlings outdoors for a few hours each day, and slowly extend the number of hours the plants stay outside as they continue to grow.

, When the peppers have grown two sets of full leaves, they are large enough to be planted outside."

Finished.

",How to Grow Peppers3," Space each plant between 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) apart, and insert stakes to help the plant stand up if necessary.


This is the same process if you grow your peppers from seeds or if you transplant a store-bought pepper plant.
Plant the peppers as deep in the garden soil as they were in the pots, only adding a minimal amount of soil to the tops.
Space rows of peppers about 10–15 inches (25.4–38.1 cm) apart., Peppers especially need frequent watering, so be sure to make sure the soil they are planted in is always moist.


Water them for the first time with the chamomile tea or hydrogen peroxide mixture, as this will help to disinfect the soil that you planted the peppers in.
The soil can be dry at times, but pepper plants will produce the largest most succulent fruit when given a regular watering of a few tablespoons per each plant.

, This will add nutrients that help the peppers to grow, and help to block out some weeds from taking root immediately.


Straw and grass clippings make great mulch for pepper plants.
Add a layer about two inches thick to all of the soil between and around each pepper plant.

, If weeds pop up through the mulch, pull them gently by hand to avoid damaging the roots of the pepper plants. Weeds compete with your plants for space and nutrients and therefore should be removed from the planting area.

, Slow growth or the appearance of pale leaves are indicators that your pepper plants need fertilizing. Choose a high nitrogen fertilizer such as fish emulsion or compost tea and spread an even coating over the planting area. Water thoroughly after fertilizing to aid absorption.

, Usually, peppers take around two months to mature enough to be harvested. To encourage your pepper plant to keep producing early in the season, harvest your peppers just before peak ripeness.


Later on in the season when your plant is nearing the end of the production season, however, you can allow them to mature a bit longer before harvesting. The richer the color, the riper the fruit.
Cut the pepper at the top of the stem. Pulling on your peppers can damage the fragile stalks and roots.
If you are expecting a frost, be sure to pick all of the fruit, even if it is a bit under-ripe. A frost will damage any leftover fruit.,"

Research the average date of the last frost in your area, and plant your jicama one to two weeks after this date.The jicama plant may not grow properly if you live in an environment that stays mostly cold.;
, Unless you already have seeds, you will need to obtain them. Jicama seeds can be purchased at a nursery, some home improvement stores, or even online. Check the packet to make sure you have the right seeds before planting., Put the jicama seeds in lukewarm water to speed up germination. Place seeds in a shallow pan of warm water. Allow them to sit for 24 hours. Then, remove the seeds from the water., Look for a place in your garden that receives at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day. The spot you choose to grow the jicama will have an effect on the outcome of the harvest. The location you choose should be exposed to full sun for the duration of the six to eight hours., Choose a location with moist but well-drained soil. Make sure the soil is alkaline with a pH over 7. You can test this easily with a commercial pH tester.If you want to grow the seeds before the last frost, then you can plant them in a pot indoors. You should use planting soil, perlite, or vermiculite, and a little peat moss in a medium-sized pot.
The pot should be placed under a grow light or by a sunny windowsill.
If you start with the seeds in a pot, wait for them to grow to 3 in (7.6 cm) tall before you plant them in the garden.

, If you decide to plant the seeds in a pot before the frost, you will need to take care of the seeds. Once you have planted them in a medium-sized pot with planting soil, water the seeds regularly until the last frost. Water the seeds until the soil is moist any time the soil feels dry.

, Make the holes about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) in depth. The amount of holes you dig depends on the amount of seeds you have to plant. The holes should be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart. If you plant more than one row, then the rows should be 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) apart., You can dig the holes first, or dig them as you plant the seeds. The soil should feel moist and warm without you watering it first. Cover the seeds and tamp them down lightly. , Sprinkle water over the soil after you plant and then when it becomes dry. Do not saturate the seeds with water, even if the soil is dry. The soil should only feel moist once you sprinkle the water.Using a watering can will help regulate how much water you pour onto the soil.

, You can use an all-purpose fertilizer. The exact instructions for fertilizing depends on the directions on the package of your fertilizer. Typically, you just need to apply the fertilizer around the base of the plant. You can purchase fertilizer at a nursery or at many home improvement stores.Ask an employee at your nursery for fertilizer recommendations if you aren’t sure about which brand to buy.

, Jicama vines grow quite tall, so they will need support as they grow. Stake the vines when they are about 24 inches (61 cm) in length. Place wooden tomato stakes about 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep into the soil next to the jicama vine. Loosely tie each plant with twine., Don’t forget to keep the soil moist as the jicama grows. Test the soil out by feeling it with your hand or gently digging into it with your fingers. Only water when the soil is dry since jicama does not do well with over-watering., Remove the tiny flowers that bloom on the jicama. Removing the flowers encourages stronger root growth. You can remove them with your hand, scissors, or pruners., Jicama is not likely to have pest problems during growth. This is because the flowers, seeds, and leaves are poisonous. If you do find that you have a pest problem, remove the pests yourself, or use an organic pest spray.Make sure you know what type of pests you are targeting when you go to buy pest spray.

, Unearth the tubers from the ground using a trowel. Wait until late fall, but before the first frost to dig your tubers. This will be approximately 150 days from the time of planting. Unearth the tubers earlier than that if the vine shows signs of dying. Be careful to avoid injuring the tubers during removal. Take your time.The tubers should be 3-6 inches (7.6-15.2 cm) in diameter.

, The tubers should be firm and round. Tubers that are soft and shriveled with visible cracks and/or bruising should probably be thrown out. Brush the soil off of the tubers.Gently soak or wash them into water to remove clumps of mud or soil. Allow them to dry.<

, Jicama plants will deteriorate if they are stored in a location below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Ideally, store them in a location that is 53 to 60 degrees (11 to 15 degrees Celsius). This may be in a garage or heated basement. The location you choose should be dry. It should not be wet or humid. The jicama should be fresh and ready to eat for up to two months if stored properly.You can store the jicama in bowls, racks, or pans.

Extend your season by trimming your plants.",How to Grow Mini Peppers from Seed," You can buy seeds, or you can opt to harvest seeds from an existing pepper. You want your mini pepper plants to be as strong and productive as possible. Thus, if you choose to get seeds from a pepper, you should take seeds from the kind of pepper you’d like to reproduce. Choose one that is fresh, healthy, and from a hardy plant.You can also buy mini pepper seeds online or at your local gardening store.
Some store-bought mini peppers will be able to reproduce. However, some commercial produce is actually sterile and the seeds will not grow into fruit-bearing plants.;
, Cut the pepper open with a sharp knife. Be careful as you cut, so as not to cut many of the seeds in half. Use a spoon or your fingers to take the seeds out of the pepper. Spread them out on a piece of paper towel.Once the seeds have been removed from the pepper, inspect them and remove any that are discolored or damaged.
If the mini peppers you’re growing are hot, be careful. The seeds contain capsaicin, which is the chemical that gives peppers their heat. It can burn your skin, depending on how hot the pepper is. And it will definitely burn your eyes if you touch them after handling hot pepper seeds. Wear latex gloves if necessary.

, This step is crucial to making sure your mini pepper seeds will grow. Moisture feeds fungus, which will render your seeds useless. Let the seeds dry out by putting them in either the sun or a dehydrator.You can dry the seeds on a piece of paper towel. It will soak up any moisture.
Don't leave the seeds outside where they may get eaten by birds or other animals.
When you think the seeds are dry, test them. Dry seeds should not be able to bend. They should snap in half went bent or when you bite down on them. If they bend or leave a dent, they still have moisture inside them.

, If you plan to plant immediately, you won’t need to store your seeds. However, if you won’t be planting for a while, or you have more seeds than you need this year, you’ll want to store them for future use.Place seeds in air-tight containers such as ziploc bags or tupperware. Store them in a dark, dry place away from natural light.
Don’t forget to label your seeds!

, Pepper plants can take a long time to germinate. Get ahead of the game by starting them indoors while it’s still cold outside. You can place your seeds in starter pots as early as 12 weeks before the final frost date.Seeds can be started in any small container with good drainage. Gardening supply stores sell starter pots in multi-packs. However, you can also use paper or plastic cups and poke holes through the bottom for draining extra water.
Fill each cup or starter pot with potting soil or topsoil. Then, place the seeds in the soil, about ½” below the surface. You can plant anywhere between one and three seeds per container, depending on the size of the pot.
Plant more seeds than the number of plants you hope to produce. You’ll select and thin your seedlings once they start to grow.
Mini peppers are surprisingly hardy and don’t need special fertilizers or nutrient mixes to get started in most conditions.

, Window sills are the ideal indoor spot for your seedlings. They offer plenty of natural light and can be warm areas in a house. Mini peppers do best in warm climates, so try to offer them as much sun and heat as you can while they germinate.Be patient. Mini peppers can take weeks to germinate. Keep your eye on them and make sure they’re getting as much sun as possible.
Keep the seedlings safe from pets such as cats and dogs that might knock them over or dig at them.

, Once your seeds have sprouted, a key to successfully growing many types of pepper is keeping them almost a little too dry. By putting a fan near your seedlings, you can help blow away excess moisture that leads to root rot and fungal infections.You can also put the seedlings near a vent, where the air is generally circulating.

, It can be tempting to water your seedlings everyday, since you want to keep them growing. However, mini peppers actually do better when their soil is dry. Peppers grow well in arid climates, so there’s no need to overwater them. Over watering is an easy way to damage or even kill your mini pepper plants.A good gauge of when to water is to wait until your seedlings begin to wilt slightly. That’s when it’s time to water.
A spray bottle can be a good way to keep soil moist without overwatering.

, When the time to transplant comes, look at your seedlings and choose which ones you want to continue tending to. You likely have more seedlings than you have room for. Cut the smaller, less healthy looking seedlings to allow the healthier ones more space and access to nutrients.If you don’t want to kill the extra seedlings, you can transplant them into other starter pots and give them away to friends.
It may be tempting to keep all of your mini pepper plants and space them very densely; however, this can lead to overcrowding, and your plants may not be healthy as they compete for light and water.

, Keep an eye on your pepper plants as they continue growing indoors. When they have two sets of full, true leaves, they’re ready to be transplanted.You can transplant your mini peppers outdoors, or into larger indoor pots. Mini peppers can make great hanging plants either indoors or outdoors.
If your mini pepper plants have gotten very big indoors but it’s still not warm enough to move them outside, you may need to move them into a larger pot while you wait for the weather outside to warm up.
Place seedlings 14 inches apart to allow them plenty of space to grow, and access to nutrients.

, Wherever you move your mini pepper plants to, be sure that the excess water can drain away from them. If you plant them in a pot, make sure it is porous and has holes at the bottom.If you plant them outside, make sure the water has somewhere to go so it doesn’t simply sit in the bed and stagnate.

, Plant peppers in a spot where they can get lots of sun. Avoid putting them anywhere with lots of shade from other plants or buildings. If you’re keeping them inside, you may want to consider a growth lamp if you don’t have a particularly sunny spot for them.Don't over-water mini pepper plants. Let the soil become dry before you water them. Remember that they are used to very hot, arid climates.
Planting mini peppers up against a brick or cement wall can be great because the wall will absorb and radiate heat from the sun, giving the peppers an extra boost of warmth.

, Mini peppers of course won’t grow very large. When they seem to be the proper size (and color) pick them by cutting with a sharp knife or shears.Some mini peppers are ornamental, so you probably won’t want to pick them.
Extremely hot peppers should be picked with caution or with gloves, so you don’t get burned.

, About six weeks before you expect your first frost, cut back the tp branches and flowers of your plants. This causes the peppers that are already growing to mature more quickly, so they can ripen before the frost."
"
Begin the process 8-10 weeks before the final frost of the season.,
Place the seeds between two wet paper towels.,
Put the seed and the towels in a plastic zipper bag until it sprouts.,
Plant the sprout in a 4” (10cm) pot with good drainage.,
Water the plant as needed.,
Keep the plant indoors until you are sure the winter is over.,
Place the plants outside in direct sunlight for a few hours a day.,
Dig a hole for each plant that’s about three shovelfuls deep.,
Pour some sand and compost or manure in the planting hole.,
Set the plant into the hole.,
Fill the hole around the plant’s roots.,
Bury the pepper plants 18-24 inches (about 45-61cm) apart in the same row.,
Make the rows 24-36 inches (about 61-91cm) apart.,
Give the plants a thorough watering.,
Lay a thick layer of mulch around the base of the plants.,
Water the pepper plants consistently in the morning.,
Grow companion plants around your peppers.,
Harvest your peppers at the earliest “maturity” date on the seed packet.,
Pay attention to the color of the peppers.,
Wear gloves any time you touch the peppers.,
Avoid touching your skin after you touch the peppers.,
Cut the peppers from their plant leaving part of the stem.",How to Grow Hot Peppers," Except in some hot climates, pepper seeds won’t grow properly if you plant them directly into the garden soil. They need to germinate for a while indoors in a controlled environment.The timeline of this varies, because the end of winter can be tricky to predict. Expect to start the seeds around the end of January or the beginning of February.
If your area has especially mild winters, or you live in a warm climate, you have more freedom when it comes to when you must start the plants.;
, Fold two paper towels separately into small squares. Wet the paper towels with room temperature water. Place the seed on one paper towel and lay the other towel on top of that.This provides an incubator-like environment for the seed to start growing.

, Grab a zipper bag and slide the wet towels with the seed into it. Store the bag inside in consistent warmth. If you keep the temperature around 70℉-80℉ (about 21℃-26.6℃), the seeds should sprout in about one week’s time.If your house is not quite warm enough, consider keeping a heat lamp on the seed bag.

, After a week or so, when the seed has sprouted, transfer it into a pot. Put the seedling about ⅛ inch (about 3mm) to ¼ inch (about 6mm) under the soil. Use organic soil, or soil that’s meant for seed-starting. Also make sure the bottom of the pot has drainage holes.Keep the plant in the pot until it grows about 8-12 inches (20-30cm) tall.

, Peppers soak up a lot of water, but they don’t like soaking wet soil. Check the soil daily to make sure that it’s moist. If the top of the soil has crusted over, the plant needs water. Water it lightly and check it again later to see how moist the soil is.

A soil moisture meter is a great help in keeping the soil moisture regulated.

, Continue to nurture the baby pepper plant until it reaches late spring or summer in your area. Peppers only grow in warm weather, so if there is a chance of cold or frost, keep it inside a little longer.When it seems like spring and it’s been two weeks since the last frost, it’s probably safe to move the plants outside.

, Your pepper plants may not survive if you move them from the protected inside to harsh, all-day sunlight. Spend a couple more weeks setting them outside in direct sunlight for brief periods during the day.It may be best to choose hours in the morning or late afternoon, rather than during the hottest hours.
Over the course of the two weeks, leave them out for a little bit longer each day. On the last day you do this, leave the plant out for about 8 hours.

, This is not really an exact amount, but not every plant or garden is the same. If you make the hole about the size of three good shovelfuls, you’ll have room to add some sand and compost, as well as put the plant in.

Dig one hole at a time and follow the next steps. Then you can judge if the hole was big enough for your plant or if you need to make the following ones bigger.

, Since peppers started out in tropical climates, they thrive in sandy soil. Put one shovelful of sand into the hole, followed by one shovelful of compost or manure.Level the sand and compost out and pack them down just a bit.

, After the sand and compost are in the hole, gently pull the pepper plant from the pot. Place it into the hole carefully so that it stands up straight. Ideally, the top of the soil that’s attached to the plant should be about one inch (2.5cm) below the top of the hole., Use the extra dirt from when you dug the holes to fill in around the plants. Pack the soil down nice and tight so it is pressed against the roots and soil that was on the roots., As the pepper plants continue to grow, they will spread their leaves out. Because of this, it’s important to plant them far enough apart for them to expand., Each row needs to be far enough from the one next to it so the plants can expand on both sides and give you room to walk through. You’ll want about one foot (30.5cm) of walking room between the rows, so be sure to leave enough room.It’s better to put them farther apart rather than too close.
Check recommendations for the specific variety of pepper that you are planting. Some benefit from closer spacing.

, Soak the soil all around the plants so the soil from the plants combines with what you added around the roots. There’s a danger of overwatering, so pay attention that the ground doesn’t become soggy. Transfer the soil moisture meter to your garden., Pepper plants want evenly moisturized soil, which can be hard to maintain. To keep the water in the soil from evaporating, pack mulch around the base of the plants. Mulch protects the soil from the sun and helps the soil store moisture better., Hot pepper plants are thirsty and require a good amount of water. At the same time, you don’t want to overwater them so the soil is soaking. Water them deeply every five days to one week.Check the soil moisture meter every day to see if you need to water the plants more often.

, Some plants help peppers grow better and keep insects away from them. Grow onions, basil, and chives to deter insects like aphids, slugs, and mosquitoes that harm your peppers. Plant tomatoes and corn to give your pepper plants shade and create a windbreak., Most seed packets list a date when the plants are considered mature and are ready to be picked. If you harvest the peppers at the earliest date listed, the plant yields more peppers.A general guide is 75-90 days after you put them into the ground.

, Most pepper varieties have a color range that tells you when they are ready to pick. Look at the seed packet to see what color the peppers shown are. The packet might also list what color the peppers should be at peak ripeness., The oils in the pepper are what make it so hot. Some peppers will actually burn your skin if you are not careful. When it comes time to pick your peppers, wear thick gloves to keep the oil from getting on your skin., Even wearing gloves, you are at a risk for transferring the pepper oil to your skin. Make sure that you don’t rub the gloves on your skin, especially anywhere on your face or around your eyes., Pulling peppers off of the plant can break the stalk. It’s best to use garden shears or a sharp knife to cut the peppers off. Leave about an inch (2.5cm) of stem on the pepper when you cut it off."
"
Place 2-3 seeds in your pot and cover with a small amount of soil.,
Seed trays work well for this because the lids hold in the moisture and watering is typically not needed.,
Now that your plants are getting bigger, remember to keep replanting them in bigger pots, remember..you want them to be big and fruitful.

,
When there is no frost on the ground (preferably 2-3 weeks after last frost due to the soil being about 60 degrees F) you can move your plants to your garden.

,
Find a spot that will get lots of sun for at least 6 hours a day.,
Place your plants 12–16 inches (30.5–40.6 cm) apart with at least 2 foot (0.6 m) in between rows.

,
Never forget, water is as important to a pepper as sun, water once a day or once every 3 days, as long as they are getting at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water a week.

,
Keep your garden weeded, weeds take water your peppers need.,
After 3-4 months it's time to harvest.",How to Grow Jalapeno Peppers," Water the soil. Follow the seed packet for optimal planting depth. Keeping the soil moist is crucial until the seeds germinate.;
, Keep the seeds in a dark place with a small amount of filtered light until sprouts appear. Then remove the lid and place them on a south-facing windowsill. Regular watering will be necessary now. Occasionally turn the tray so that the plants grow upright. They will lean toward the sun. After 2-4 leaves form, it will be necessary to separate and repot into a larger pot.

,,, Dig your hole twice as wide as your pot and deep enough that the dirt is right at the leaves level.

,,, At three weeks of having them in your garden place some mulch or mushroom compost on them for extra nutrients.

, They should be bright green when they are ripe, this is when they are at their mildest, you can leave them on if you want them to be more pungent and hot. They will be black then red. Red peppers are best for drying too.

Make a mini-hothouse to get a head start on your garden.,
Decide on the materials and location for your larger hothouse.,
Decide how your hothouse will be heated.,
Water and fertilize as needed according to the types of plants you are growing and what they require to thrive.,
Order or purchase seeds from a reputable garden center.,
Walk through your greenhouse or hothouse daily.",How to Grow Hothouse Vegetables," A small project can involve making a mini-hothouse using a plastic tub about 2 by 3 feet (61 by 91 cm) in size.


Clean the tub thoroughly and line the bottom of the tub with pebbles to keep water away from the potted plants you will place on top of the pebbles.
Fill pots with potting soil and add a few seeds. Sprinkle a little potting soil over the seeds and water lightly.
Place plastic wrap over the tub and put it into a sunny spot. Water periodically when the soil becomes dry, but take care not to over-water; just be sure the soil is kept moist.
Remove the wrap when the plants are 2 inches (5 cm) in height. Allow the plants to grow uncovered until the weather and conditions are right to transplant them into your regular garden.;
,


Choose a spot that receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Be sure you have easy access to water. Find a site protected against prevailing north winds.
Purchase a greenhouse or hothouse kit or build one yourself using a frame, glass, Plexiglas or plastic film. You can find plans online or in how-to magazines or books.
Determine the floor you want. It could be concrete, dirt or gravel, for example. Concrete or brick will help hold the heat, but could cause mold and bacteria to grow because they also retain moisture. Gravel will allow for good drainage, but will not be as warm.

,


If you are depending upon solar heat, provide a way to vent air should it become too hot. Louvered windows or flaps you can raise or lower will provide ventilation. Consider using a shade cloth to keep temperatures down during very hot days.
You may choose to install a heating system to keep temperatures constant. Your hothouse may need to have access to electricity. Attaching your hothouse to your home will let you heat it using your home heating system.
Keep the temperature at about 80 degrees F (27 degrees C). Anything hotter or colder will not allow optimum growth.
Keep air fresh by allowing for ventilation. Don't make your hothouse airtight. Keep humidity levels up by using a misting system or by using tubs of water in the hothouse to add moisture to the air.

,


Tomatoes and cucumbers will need feeding each time you water. Other plants may need less. Check with a local professional gardener or online to learn about recommended watering and feeding levels for the types of plants you are growing.

,


Plan your year's vegetable crops before placing your order so your hothouse garden will be well thought-out. If you choose to transplant seedlings outdoors, do so according to your climate zone.

,


Check on the progress of your vegetables, make adjustments to the amount of heat, ventilation, and light.
Take care of daily routines such as watering and fertilizing. You can stop small problems from becoming crop failures by catching plant illness, infestations, and other problems early, before they've done irreparable damage to your plants.

Till the soil as soon as the ground thaws in the spring.,
Work in organic matter.,
Test the pH level of your soil.",How to Grow Organic Spinach1," It’s best to till the soil to a depth of at least 12” (30 cm) because spinach has a very deep taproot. If you don’t have a tiller, you can use a garden spade to turn over the soil.;
, Use a shovel to work in generous amounts of rich, organic matter.


Add alfalfa meal to the soil. This will increase the nitrogen level in the soil, which will encourage fast growth. (Blood meal also adds nitrogen, and some organic farmers use it, but it can attract unwanted meat-eating animals, such as raccoons.)

, Spinach thrives in soil that has a pH level between 6.5 and 7.5. You can take a soil sample to your local nursery or agricultural extension service.

Hydroponic vegetable gardening has steadily gained popularity as a hobby that anyone can enjoy.,
In hydroponics, the plants roots are suspended in a solution of nutrient rich water solution to absorb essential nutrient from it.,
When you are planning to make your own hydroponic vegetable garden, choose from the assortment of types of containers available in the market for hydroponic growing.

,
Use rock wool as a growing medium because it provides roots with a good balance of water and oxygen.,
Right amount of hydroponic nutrients for your vegetable garden is very essential for plants vigorous growth.,
Hydroponic vegetable gardens require plenty of lights for their growth.,
Try to maintain grow room temperature and humidity level, to create an ideal environment for vegetables to grow.

,
Even if you live in place where environment is not suitable for growing plants, with hydroponics systems you can make growing possible.

,
Hydroponic vegetables are healthy, energetic, and consistently reliable.",How to Grow Hydroponic Vegetables," If you have limited space and cannot form a full-fledged vegetable garden, hydroponic gardening would be a rewarding experience for you. With the help of hydroponics growing systems you can easily grow vegetables you desire without worrying about the outdoor setting or soil problems. It is important to provide plenty of lights for your hydroponic indoor garden to get a good result. Let’s learn some of the hydroponic gardening secrets to make your vegetable garden healthy without much effort.;
, Plants grown in hydroponic systems filled with water leave fewer chances of problems caused by water.

,, It also helps the plants healthy growth in each stage.

, You have to understand the nutrient needs of your plants and accordingly provide well-mixed nutrient solution.

, The type of lighting that you need to provide and ideal for your hydroponic system would depend on the plants that are to be grown.

,,, It’s a clean and extremely easy method of gardening. In traditional gardening, vegetables grow a large root system to search for food and water however in hydroponics food and water are fed directly to the roots. This enables the plants to grow twice faster.

Ensure a higher germination rate.,
Use a hoe to smooth the soil.,
Place the seeds 1” (2.5 cm) apart.,
Cover the seeds.,
Water the seeds.,
Keep sowing seeds.,
Thin young seedlings.,
Provide shade.",How to Grow Organic Spinach2," Place your spinach seeds between wet paper towels, put the towels in a sealable plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator for 7 days before you are ready to plant them.

, Tamp the soil lightly, forming rows that have a depression of 1/2"" (1.3 cm). The rows should be about 10” (25 cm) apart.

, Planting the seeds too close together will make it harder to thin them later on.

, Sprinkle soil over the seeds and lightly tamp the soil with a hoe or with the palm of your hand. Use just enough soil to cover the seeds.

, You should water immediately after planting. It’s best to water your spinach seeds with a sprinkling can so that you don’t dislodge the seeds. Once the plants have rooted, you can switch to a garden hose.

, Plant several new rows of spinach every 7 to 10 days during the spring if you want to enjoy fresh spinach all season long. You can even plant spinach seeds in the late fall for an early spring crop. Freezing weather won’t harm the seeds.

, To ensure healthy, strong plants, thin seedlings to 6” (15 cm) apart once 2 true leaves have formed. (True leaves are fully formed.)

, Spinach is a cool weather crop and will bolt (go to seed) if the weather is too hot and it gets too much sun. Provide a shade cloth or plant the spinach in the shade of taller vegetables, such as pole beans.

"
"
Harvest your spinach when it matures.,
Prevent your plants from bolting.,
Add fertilizer to encourage new growth.",How to Grow Organic Spinach3," The average maturation time is between 43 and 50 days. By that time, there should be at least 6 leaves on each of your spinach plants. Pick baby spinach leaves from all the plants, so that every plant will keep growing to maturity.

, When bolting, the spinach will begin to form a center stalk. If this happens, your spinach will be tough and bitter. Remove large developed leaves and remove any brown, withered or diseased leaves to prevent your spinach from bolting too early. You can start picking leaves as soon as they are big enough to eat.

, Once your spinach plants have at least 4 true leaves, add some organic fertilizer to the soil. The spinach will not only grow faster, it will taste sweeter.

Tie your eggplant to the stake to promote upward growth.,
Keep an eye out for pests.,
Harvest your eggplants once the skin looks glossy.",How to Grow Eggplants in Pots," You need one pot for every two seeds. Seedling trays and other containers made of cheap plastic may make it easier to transfer your seedlings into larger pots later on.;
, The pot must have a 5-gallon (20-liter) capacity, at minimum, and each eggplant should have approximately 1 foot (30.5 centimeters) of space to grow. As a result, you may wish to plant only one eggplant per pot.

, Eggplants love heat, and clay pots retain heat better than plastic. Select an unglazed pot if you can remember to water your plants frequently, but go with a glazed pot if you have a history of forgetting to water your plants. Unglazed pots dry the soil out more quickly than glazed pots, so eggplants living in unglazed pots will need more frequent watering.


Clay pots are also heavier than plastic pots, making it easier for them to support the weight of a mature eggplant.
The pot should also have large drainage holes to help balance out the moisture level of the soil. Drainage holes will allow excess water to leave the pot, minimizing the risk of root rot.

, Gently scrub the inside and outside of each pot with soap and warm water. If you do not clean your containers, microscopic insect eggs and harmful bacteria inside the pots could damage your eggplants.

, A good, simple option is a mix of two parts potting soil and one part sand. The soil provides your plant with the nutrients it needs, while the sand controls moisture. Mix a little compost and 5-10-5 fertilizer into the soil to provide additional nutrition. A 5-10-5 fertilizer contains fairly mild concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, with a little extra phosphorus to promote stronger roots and increase the yield of eggplants.

, Without any support, your eggplants will have very little upward growth and, as a result, they will yield very little fruit. A tomato cage or teepee stake should be enough to provide your plant with adequate support.

, Eggplants require temperatures of 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 degrees Celsius) or higher, which may be difficult to provide in the outdoors during spring. By starting your eggplants indoors, you can begin as early as April.

, The soil should be loosely placed into the containers, but it should not be compressed.

, Use your pinky finger or the rounded end of a pen or pencil to create holes with a good diameter.

, Planting two seeds improves the odds of at least one seed sprouting. Planting more than two seeds may deprive the seeds of the nutrition the need to take root, however.

, Lightly drop the soil over the seeds instead of packing it in.

, Choose a window in full sun, meaning one that receives direct sunlight for at least 8 hours a day. Full sun provides enough light and warmth to spur growth.

, Keep the soil moist to the touch at all times, but do not supersaturate, especially if using trays without drainage holes. You do not want to create puddles on the top of your soil, but you should also seek to prevent the soil from ever drying out.

, In each pot or tray compartment, keep the stronger of the two seedlings and snip the other one down to soil level. Do not yank the weaker seedling out, since doing so may disrupt the roots of the seedling you wish to keep.

, Only do this if the weather outdoors has warmed up sufficiently, however. Eggplants do best when kept outdoors, even in pots, since they have more access to sunlight and can be pollinated.

, Keep the feet of the stake or tomato cage flat on the bottom of the pot, positioning the stake in a straight, upright position.

, Pack the soil around the stake and make sure that the stake is held firmly in place. Leave 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of empty space in between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.

, The hole should be in the center of the pot.

, The weaker seedling should have already been thinned out.


Wet the soil to make it as compact as possible. Moist, compact soil will be easier to transplant than dry, crumbly soil.
If the seedling is in a cheap plastic container, you can “wiggle” it out of the container by bending the plastic.
If the seedling is in a stiffer container, you may need to carefully slide a gardening trowel into the side of the pot and beneath the entirety of the pot’s contents. Tip the container on its side and slowly guide the seedling, soil and all, out of the pot.

, Keep the seedling as upright as possible.

, Do not press down with too much force, since doing so may damage the root system. You should, however, fill in any empty space in order to make sure that the seedling is firmly in place.

, Give your plant a thorough watering, but do not allow puddles to develop on the top of the soil.

, An outdoor spot that receives full sun is ideal, as both the light and sun are essential in promoting a good harvest. Eggplants thrive in warm soil.

, In hot, dry weather, your plant may even need multiple waterings a day. Feel the surface of the soil with your finger tips and saturate the soil if it appears dry. Allowing the soil to dry out will reduce the number of eggplants you can grow.

, Use a water soluble fertilizer and water your eggplant before adding it to the soil, rather than adding it to dry soil. Follow the directions on the back of the label to determine an appropriate amount.


If the leaves of your eggplant begin to pale, you may need to add more fertilizer. A boost of 5-10-5 fertilizer should help significantly if a lack of nutrition is your plant's only problem. A fertilizer with a higher number, meaning a higher percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, may prove too strong.
Do not dig any deeper than 1/2-inch (1 1/4 centimeters) beneath the surface of the soil when scratching in fertilizer. Digging any deeper than that could disturb the eggplant's roots, which are rather shallow.

, Soil with a pH between 6.3 and 6.8 should fulfill your eggplant's needs. Litmus paper or a pH meter should be able to give you an accurate reading.


If you need to increase the pH, try using agricultural lime.
If you need to decrease the pH, add additional organic matter such as compost or plant litter, or switch to a fertilizer with urea in it.

, As your plant begins to climb, loosely tie the stem of the plant to the stake using twine or thin fabric thread. Tying the thread too tightly may cut into the stem or choke it.

, Cutworms are one of the most common pests that attack eggplants, but they can usually be driven away by placing a cutworm collar over the plant. You may also consider an organic pesticide to drive away cutworms and many other pests.

, The fruit should stop growing larger and, in many cases, it will be around the size of a large orange. The length of time this takes varies depending on the variety you chose, but your eggplant will usually be ready for harvest within two or three months after you initially planted your seeds.


Snip the eggplant off its vine using pruning shears. The vegetable should only have a short stem upon removal.

Choose a variety of chilies.,
Find the best location for planting.,
Decide if you’re going to start your chilies early indoors.,
Amend your soil.,
Prepare the seeds.,
Plant the seeds in small containers.,
Water the seeds.,
Place them in a location with heat and sunlight.,
Watch for the seeds to sprout.,
Harden off your seedlings.,
Plant at the right time.,
Dig your holes.,
Plant your chilies.,
Water the chilies.,
Maintain the plants.,
Harvest your chilies.",How to Grow Chillis," Chilies are one of the most wonderful plants to grow, because they come in such a wide variety of colours, sizes, tastes, and spice-levels. Chilies can be either an annual (must be replanted each year) or a perennial (grow back on their own). There are also three general types of chili: sweet, hot and ornamental. All three types have some level of spice, but sweet chilies are the mildest, ornamental have lovely colours and shapes (but can be very hot), and hot chilies are used primarily for their intense spice and flavour.


Chilies range from green, butter yellow, peachy orange, and fire-engine red, to plum and a pitch black hue. The colour doesn't have a direct correlation to the flavour or spice level of each chili pepper.
Visit a local nursery to find out what variety will thrive in your local environment.
Certain chilies are used in different areas of the world for special recipes; for example, Serrano chilies are used primarily in Mexican dishes, while the Calcutta pepper is used in Asian curries.;
, Chilies are heat-loving plants, and are the most successfully grown in areas that have plenty of sun. Choose a plot in your garden that gets full sun or at least mostly sun for the majority of the day. If you live in a desert area, you may need a location with a bit of shade so that the chilies do not get sunburnt. If you live in an area that gets lots of rain, try to find a location in full sun with good drainage; too much water will drown out the chilies and cause them to grow less fruit.

, If you don’t live in the traditional chili growing zones (near the equator), then you may benefit from growing your chilies indoors in pots during the winter, and then transplanting them outdoors in the spring when the weather warms up. Although you can certainly just plant your seeds directly into the ground, you might not have as high of chances of them sprouting than if you start them indoors and transplant them as seedlings.


You can grow chilies from seeds or starts from nurseries, but you’ll have much more variety with growing the former.
Starting seedlings is easy; just plan it out at least 6 weeks prior to transplanting the chilies outdoors. Chilies can be transplanted outdoors after your area's last frost date.

, The soil in your garden may need to be altered slightly in order to produce the biggest, healthiest, and heartiest crop of chilies. Chilies prefer soil that has good drainage and that has plenty of nutrients. Therefore, mix a bit of sand into your soil to help it to drain better, and incorporate in compost a few weeks or months prior to planting. If your soil has poor or average drainage, you can enhance it by mixing in a bit of sand. If potassium is not already present in sufficient amounts, then you’ll notice a significant growth boost if you increase the amount of potassium in the soil as well. Always test your soil first. If your soil is low in potassium, then visit a local nursery to choose a fertilizer that has lots of potassium and little nitrogen (like a 0-20-0 blend).Test the pH of your soil and determine if you need to make further adjustments; chilies like soil that has a neutral or slightly acidic pH of 6.5-7.
The further in advance you can prepare your soil, the better your chilies will grow.

, To help make the coating of the seed easier for the new growth to penetrate, you can use a damp paper towel and plastic bag to soften them up. Place a folded damp paper towel in a plastic bag and then place the seeds inside of the towel. Put the bag in a dry, warm place, such as a cupboard in your kitchen and leave them there for two to five days. The seeds should start to sprout within this time frame and then you can plant them., You can purchase seed trays for your seedlings, or you can simply use individual planting pots for each seed. Fill each small tray or container with your soil (already amended with fertilizer and compost). Then, place a single seed about ½ an inch below the surface of the soil in each container.

, Seeds will need to be watered on a daily basis, so that the soil is kept moist at all times. Give seeds the biggest amount of water after first planting, and then continue adding about a teaspoon of water daily after that.

, If you’ve planted seeds before, you may have a heat lamp on hand; heat lamps are perfect for aiding your seeds in growing quickly. If not, place your seeds in a location that gets plenty of sunlight, like a south facing window, and lots of heat, like near a radiator. Just be careful the seeds are neither too hot nor too cold, as both will result in little to no growth.

, It will take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks for the seeds to first sprout. The seeds will sprout a pair of leaves to start, known as ‘seed leaves’. After a bit, a second pair of leaves will sprout; these are known as the ‘true leaves’ and signals that the chilies are ready for transplanting. You can continue waiting for them to grow and for the heat outdoors to rise, or you can plant them as is when their true leaves come in., Seeds that are grown indoors are used to a constant temperature with little fluctuation; when they are introduced into the ‘wild’, they can experience a bit of shock from the varying temperatures, moisture levels, and changing sunlight. Harden them off by placing their pots or trays outdoors for a few hours every day. Start at only 2 hours a day for about a week, and then add one hour to each additional day they are placed outdoors until they can stand being outside for a full 24 hours. At this point, they can handle being planted outside without fear of shock.

, Wait to plant outdoors until after the last frost of the spring, typically around March or April depending on your local weather. Plant on a sunny day in the late morning or early afternoon when it’s not too hot, so as to avoid transplant shock.

, Chilies should be planted individually to avoid crowding, even if you are planting seeds directly outdoors. Dig small holes slightly larger than your seed or root ball using a garden trowel. These should be spaced about 1 foot (0.3 m) apart, but depending on the type of chili you’re planting the spacing may need to be greater. Research the chilies you’re growing to find out the perfect spacing conditions for your plant.

, Place each chili plant or seed into the holes you've dug. Replace the soil over the top of each, so that only about ¼ inch of soil is on top of the roots or seeds. Don’t tamp or press down on the soil too much when you’re finished, as the chilies will grow better in loose, well-draining soil.

, Chilies will thrive when their soil is moist, but not soaking wet. After the first planting, give the chilies a bit of extra water to avoid transplant shock. Then, water them on a daily basis so that the soil is damp. If you’re growing sweet peppers, you can make them even sweeter by giving them more water than usual.

, It will take a month or longer before the chilies begin flowering and bearing fruit, so you will need to maintain their health during this time. Pull out any weeds that you encounter, as these will steal space and nutrients from your chilies over time if you leave them. Incorporate compost and potassium fertilizer into the soil on a monthly basis to keep the nutrient levels high. You can also add a layer of mulch to the top of the soil, to lock in moisture and block out weeds.


Depending on the type of chilies you are growing, you may need to use a trellis. For example, bell peppers do better with the support of a trellis.

, Time to harvest will vary between species of chilies, but you can generally tell when they’re ready by their size. Chilies will change colours, so unless you have a clear idea of what colour the ripe chili will be, don’t rely on colour as an indicator of ripeness. If you’re questioning whether a chili is ripe for picking, give it a taste! You’ll know whether it needs to continue growing for a bit longer, or if it’s ready to make a debut in your kitchen.If you're aiming to make chili powder or pepper flakes with your chilies, leave them to shrivel and dry up on their own on the branch before harvesting.

Plant your rootstock in a safe place where you can watch the trees carefully for signs of insects, deer or other damage.,
Remove any shoots that extend from the rootstock.",How to Graft an Apple Tree," The rootstock must be hardy in your area. You can plant an apple tree from seedling to use as rootstock, but you will have to wait several years to create a sturdy plant.


Rootstock must be suited to your climate and local insects.;
, Ask your local nursery about purchasing rootstock. This is the best way to ensure your type of rootstock is well suited to grafting.


Discuss the varieties of scion that work well with the type of rootstock you buy when you purchase the stock from the nursery.

, Keep it moist, in cool conditions through the winter. Although rootstock is sold when it is a few years old, it can be purchased just before you graft.

, The diameters of the branches have to match; however a graft with a thinner scion might be successful, as well.

, Grafting success increases with practice, so you may need to cut several scion and rootstock branches before you are successful.

, You can store them until the next spring, when they will be ready to bud and plant. You want to have scion branches that are harvested above freezing but when the apple tree has already fallen dormant.

, Use sharp shears. Wash the shears with alcohol before harvesting different types of scions.

,, Nurseries or mail order services can send you scion branches to store until you are ready to graft.

, Place it in a large freezer bag. Add the scions to the plastic bag to store in the refrigerator until you are ready to graft.,, This is often between April and May, but will depend greatly on your climate., It should be the same size as your scion.

, Then, you will cut the end of the scion at a downward angle so that the remaining buds are above the grafted section.

, Use clean, sharp shears. You need to expose fresh, green cells or cambium on both scion and rootstock to graft successfully.

, A sharp knife increases the chances of a graft.

, The cut should be approximately one inch (2.5cm) in length. Ensure you have three good buds above the cut.

, Cut upward at an acute angle. When you place the two branches together, they fit together as though they were one branch.

, This allows the cambium cells to contact each other on at least two points. They slide together to form a sturdy union.


Cut the rootstock tongue groove approximately one-third the way down the previous cut. You will need to cut downward, in the opposite direction of your previous cut, to make an interlocking groove.
Cut the scion stock one-third the way down in an upward angle.
Rock the knife down the grove slowly so that it doesn’t slip and you don’t cut yourself., You will need to slowly slide the cambium, or green portion of one branch, into the cambium of the other branch. The grafted portion should be fairly stable.

, Leave the end sticking out so that you don’t need to cut through the grafted area to free it when the graft starts to grow.

,, Seal the top with wax as well.

,, Keep them in a cool, moist area. They can also be packed into sphagnum moss in a plastic bag and moistened until they are planted.

, They will need to remain in this climate for two to four weeks.

, It should be in full sunlight.

, You want the scion to flourish, but you don’t want the rootstock to take over.


At first, you can leave some leaves on the rootstock so that nutrients keep flowing up the tree until the graft is successful. However, if you see an actual branch start to form on the trunk of the rootstock, remove it; this will help encourage the scion to grow.
Once the scion really starts to grow and new leaves appear above the graft, remove any further growths from the rootstock, below the graft. This removal will help the plant thrive with growth on the scion, rather than the rootstock. The rootstock will keep trying to grow its own branches, and you need to remove them for as long as the tree lives.

Purchase a bay tree seedling or take cuttings.,
Plant the bay tree.,
Keep watered but allow the soil to dry out thoroughly between watering.,
Mulch the bay tree.,
Fertilize once every spring.,
Prune.,
Harvest.",How to Grow a Bay Tree," Many nurseries and garden centers will have a bay tree in their herbal area. If you'd rather take a cutting to propagate it, then follow these steps:


Take a heel cutting, a fresh shoot or tip in early summer or in autumn/fall. Cut from a mature bay tree. The cutting should be about 8cm (3"") in length.
Remove the upper and lower leaves from the cutting.
Dip the intended root end into hormonal cutting mix. This will stimulate vigorous root growth.
Put the cutting into a container filled with two-thirds coarse sand and one-third peat moss.
Put the container under a plastic bag hanging over wire or similar to keep it from touching or landing on the cutting. This creates a mini-greenhouse for the cutting.

Be patient. It will take around 9 months for the cutting to root.;
, Decide whether you want to grow the bay tree in the garden or in a container. It will do well in both places but the container bay tree will need to be given continuous re-potting and renewed soil to ensure best growth. Spring is the best time to plant a young bay tree.


Bay trees prefer full sun aspects in cool to warm zones. For a hot zone, provide partial shade for very hot or tropical climates. They should also be sheltered from wind.
Select soil that drains well, of a medium richness. If you are placing the bay tree into a container, add a little lime to balance out acidic soil.

, Water more often during hot weather.


Bay trees in a container need more regular watering.

, Do this for both in-ground and container-grown bay trees. The topsoil is adequate. However, be sure to keep any mulch away from the tree's trunk.

, Give the bay tree complete plant food.

, There isn't really a need to prune bay trees unless you want them to form a particular shape or you don't want it to grow beyond a certain height. Bay trees grow to about 10-20 meters (33-66 feet) but if they're in a container, they'll grow much shorter.


The bay tree responds well to being turned into a topiary; this is more commonly done for bay trees grown in containers.

, The leaves are used for cooking and can be picked any time once the tree is established. They're best picked early in the day to preserve their aromatic flavor.

Choose an area with full sun and/or partial shade.,
Choose an area with rich, moist soil.,
Test the pH of the soil.,
Fertilize the soil with manure, compost, or any other high-nitrogen organic fertilizer.",How to Grow Celery2," While preferring a temperate climate, celery also enjoys full sun if possible. However, it will grow well in partial shade as well.

, Originally a wetland plant, celery can tolerate relatively moist soil conditions that other vegetables cannot. However, make sure the planting area you choose is not prone to flooding.


You may want to build a raised bed to plant your celery in. Keep in mind that some varieties of celery grow very large harvestable roots, so make sure to build your planter deep enough if you choose to do so.
Use cedar wood to build the planter bed if possible, as it does not mold when it gets wet.

, Celery varieties prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Though celery does not require impeccable drainage like most vegetables, it does require rich, healthy soil.


Evaluate the soil's calcium and magnesium levels in order to determine what type of limestone to add to your soil. If the soil is low in magnesium, add dolomitic limestone. If it is high in magnesium, add calcitic limestone.
Add the limestone two to three months before planting if possible to allow the soil to absorb it. After adding, check the pH again., Mix about four inches of organic fertilizer into your soil. Celery likes extremely rich, organic soil. This will help the seedlings grow into strong, producing plants.

Start your celery seeds indoors about 10 to 12 weeks before the last spring frost.,
Transfer your seedlings to your garden two weeks before the last spring frost.,
Plant the seedlings six to 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart in rows 18 to 36 inches (45.7 to 91.4 cm) apart.,
Place the seedlings in the ground and cover with soil.,
Water the planting area very thoroughly.,
Add mulch to the planting area.",How to Grow Celery3," You can sow the seeds in peat pots with several seeds per cell to ensure that at least one will germinate into a seedling.


To speed up germination, you can pre-soak your seeds in water overnight.Cover with about one-inch of potting soil but do not pat down with your fingers after sowing the seeds. Celery seeds need a lot of light to germinate. Water the peat pots to moisten the soil after planting your seeds.
Place your seeds in a warm place so that the soil stays between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit until the seeds germinate. This should take two to three weeks.
After germination, place the seedlings in a cooler indoor location so that the soil is between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Carefully thin the seedlings so that there is only one per cell after they germinate.

, Make sure that it is not too cold outside. Celery can handle a light frost, but temperatures below 55 °F (13 °C) in the day and 40 °F (4 °C) at night for longer than one week can harm your celery plants.

, You only need to dig holes slightly deeper than the depth of the peat pots cells. Pat the sides of the cells to get the seedlings to slip out without harming the roots.

, Only cover up to the first level of foliage and pat the planting area around the seedlings lightly with your hands for support.

, Celery requires constant moisture, so do not allow the soil to dry out at any time. If celery does not get enough water, the stalks will be stringy and bitter. Be sure to water several times per week and increase your watering routine during particularly warm or dry spells.

, To keep the soil cool and moist, add a few inches of mulch made of leaves, grass, hay, or other plant material on top of the soil. Doing so also helps reduce the ability of weeds to infiltrate the planting area."
"
Fertilize every two to four weeks.,
Water your plants regularly.,
Blanch celery one week to 10 days before you plan to harvest them.,
Harvest the celery stalks, leaves, and/or roots.",How to Grow Celery4," Celery plants are heavy feeders that require rich soil that must be fertilized frequently. To keep your celery plants happy, fertilize with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer every few weeks from planting to harvest.

, The most important aspect of caring for your celery plants is making sure that they are always well-hydrated. If they do not get enough water, celery plants will become shriveled and bitter to the taste.

, Blanching consists of shielding the celery stalks from the sun to achieve a milder flavor. Cover the stalks with newspaper, a milk carton with the top and bottom removed, or any other type or paper or cardboard. You can use twine to tie the celery stalks to keep them from sprawling.


While blanching is not required, it will alter the taste and color of your celery. Additionally, blanched celery is less nutritious than unblanched celery. Most people prefer the sweeter taste of blanched celery.
Be aware that some varieties are ""self-blanching"" and don't need to be blanched., You can begin to harvest the stalks when they reach eight inches in height. Make sure to begin your harvest from the outside stalks and work inward. This allows the innermost stalks to continue to mature.


Once mature, celery can sit in the ground for about one month as long as the soil remains a cool temperature between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
The longer the celery grows and the darker it becomes, the more rich in antioxidants, and thus nutritious, it will be. However, it will also become more tough and fibrous."

Cut the stems of the cayenne peppers when they mature to between 3 and 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2cm) long.",How to Grow Cayenne Peppers," If you live in a hot climate, you should opt to grow them outside. People who have colder weather should aim to grow them in a container, where they can be moved indoors and outside according to the heat.


If you plan to plant them in a container, choose a pot with drainage holes. Place a shallow dish below the pot, so that you can irrigate the soil well.;
, Although your seeds may be able to fertilize outdoors or in a container, cayenne peppers germinate best at a constant heat of 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius), which is often too hot for places that frost or even regular indoor temperatures.


Soak your pepper seeds in a glass of water overnight.






Fill your grow packs up to 1/2 inch (1.3cm) from the top of the back with commercial seed starting mix. Place 3 or 4 cayenne pepper seeds in each cell. Try to space them evenly. Cover with 1/4 inch (0.6cm) of seed potting mix.
Moisten the soil. Cover the grow pack with plastic wrap. Place it on a sunny windowsill or on the top of the refrigerator to germinate. Dampen the soil when needed over the next 1 to 6 weeks.






Thin your seedlings over the next few weeks. First snip off the weakest seedling when they get their first leaves. Cut off all but 1 seedling when they form 2 sets of leaves. This seedling should be ready to plant, once there is no risk of frost.

, If you are planting in a garden, you will need to choose a bed that gets at least 8 hours of sunlight per day.


If you plan to plant your pepper plants outside, you should add compost. The soil should be slightly acidic. You can add some aluminum sulfate to increase the acidity of the soil.






If you plan to plant in a container, you can buy potting mix from a gardening store. You can also make your own potting mix with even ratios of loam, peat moss and sand. You will need to sterilize the mix in the oven for 1 hour. Place it in a shallow pan and heat it to 220 degrees Fahrenheit (140 degrees Celsius).







, The hole will need to be wider than it is deep for the roots to spread out. If you are planting in a container, you should remove some soil before placing your pepper plant inside, so you don't compact the soil by pushing it down.

, Loosen it well by gently pinching the side of the pack on all sides.

, Add soil atop the roots. You may need to add more soil to the base of the cayenne plant once the dirt settles.


If you are using a container, you will want to fill it with soil up to 1.5 inches (3.8cm) from the top of the pot.

, You should water the plants when the top inch (2.5cm) of soil is dry to the touch. If you are watering in a pot, sprinkle the pot until water starts to come out of the saucer at the bottom.

, You may want to place mulch around them to avoid weeds and keep moisture in the soil.

, Otherwise, place it in a sunny window to ensure it gets at least 8 hours of sunlight per day.


If you have a wall outdoors that reflects heat, such as metal siding, place your pepper plant next to it during the day. The increase in temperature will produce more fruit.

, This is preferable to picking the peppers themselves. Cayenne peppers usually develop between 70 and 80 days after germination.

Subsequent tier growth.,
When the leading shoot reaches the top climbing wire remove the tip (during early summer) so the leading shoot is below the top tier climbing wire.,
Now your apple tree should have filled out considerably and you will formed an espalier of your first apple tree.

",How to Form an Espalier With Your Maiden Apple Tree,";
, Let your creative juices flow and there will be endless opportunities to position your espalier.

, Ensure the maiden tree is attached to a support stake. Also, you will need to ensure that there are a series of horizontal climbing wires positioned at different heights perpendicular to the maiden tree's support stake. In time, you will manipulate the tree to grow alone these wires.

, Cut back leaving three healthy buds exposed near the top of the pruned single stem.

, Come mid to late summer these three healthy buds will have grown into shoots. You need to delicately (albeit firmly) tie the top shoot to the vertical support stake. Also, tie the other two shoots to side support sticks which are positioned at an angle to each other of approximately 45 degrees. The side support sticks must be tied firmly to the first tier horizontal climbing wire. Come the next winter it is time to again prune the apple tree and hopefully the top shoot has grown vertically passed the second tier climbing wire. Prune this shoot just at the point at which it passes the second tier climbing wire. Next, remove the support sticks from the other two shoots and strongly prune the length of these shoots ensuring that there is one healthy bud left exposed on each shoot. Tie these pruned shoots to the first tier horizontal climbing wire.

, In the following summer, the new side shoots which have sprung from the original top shoot are to be tied to support sticks and fastened to the second tier climbing wire. Then prune off any shoots that may have grown between the first and second tier wires. Remember to sharply prune any side shoots that you fastened to the first tier climbing wire so that the shoots are only 3 to 4 leaves in length.

, In the coming winters form more tiers in the same manner as described above. Always prune strongly so the leading shoot is cut below the new tier reached in the presiding summer. Cut tips of all shoots on lower tiers.

, Where the side shoots fill the climbing wires remove the ends of these shoots and trim sublateral side shoots to one leaf long.

Plant at the right depth.,
Water regularly.,
Harvest when the plants are the right size.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Store in refrigerator.",How to Grow Chard," There are three main type of chard that you can plant: white-stemmed, colored, and perpetual. White-stemmed chard is usually the most productive, but colored chard are the most attractive ornamental option. Perpetual varieties, which have a spinach-like taste, typically remain compact, so they’re ideal for small or container gardens.White-stemmed varieties, such as ‘Fordhook Giant’ and ‘Silverado,’ are usually more tolerant of both heat and cold than other types of chard.
Colored varieties, such as ‘Pink Passion,’ ‘Golden Sunrise,’ and ‘Orange Fantasia,’ come in shades of red, pink, yellow, and orange, and usually grow quite tall. You can find some seeds and seedlings that only feature a single shade and others that offer a mixture of colors.
Colored varieties of chard are usually the least cold hardy, so they work best in warm to mild climates.
Perpetual varieties, such as ‘Perpetual’ and ‘Verde da Taglio’, provide mild tasting leaves over a more prolonged growing season. They tolerate heat pretty well, so they're a good option for warmer climates.;
, When you’re planting chard, you can either start from seeds or seedlings, which are young plants that you can purchase from your local nursery. The obvious benefit of planting chard from seedlings is that you don’t have to wait as long for the plant to develop, so you can enjoy your chard more quickly. On the other hand, planting chard from seeds is less expensive and you usually have a wider range of varieties to choose from.In a warm or mild climate, you shouldn’t run into much planting your chard as seeds.
In climates where you go from a warm season to a cold season very quickly, you are usually better off planting your chard from seedlings.

, If you decide to plant your chard as seeds, you’ll likely find packets that contain a mixture of colored chard. However, you can customize your chard by combining different colors yourself to get the exact combination that you want. Purchase packets of seeds for different colors, such as pink and orange, and mix them together before planting.You can also mix white-stemmed varieties with colored chard for a striking contrast in your garden.

, You can plant chard in either the spring or the fall depending on your preference. If you’re opting for a spring harvest, plant the chard two to three weeks before the last frost. For a fall harvest, you can plant as early as late summer but no later than 40 days before the first frost.A spring planting usually provides a harvest through the spring, summer, and fall.
If you plant in both the spring and the fall, you can have a chard harvest virtually year round.

, When you’re selecting a spot in your garden to plant chard, it’s important to consider the amount of sunlight that the plants will receive. In early spring and fall, when the weather tends to be cooler, chard prefers full sun. In the summer, when the weather is warmer, it prefers partial sun. However, keep in mind that chard usually tolerates heat fairly well, so it can work well in a sunny section of your garden.Chard grows well in containers, so if you don’t have the right spot for it in your garden, consider planting it in a pot or planter.

, For chard to grow well, it needs properly prepared soil. Several weeks before you plan to plant, dig through the area to remove any large rocks or weeds. You should also mix some compost and organic fertilizer, according to the rates on the label. Allow the mixture to sit for two to three weeks, so the soil has time to receive enough moisture and air.Chard grows best in soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8, so it’s slightly acidic. You can purchase a soil pH testing kit at your local garden supply store to check your garden.

, For a successful harvest, you must space the chard properly. For seeds, plant them in rows approximately 3- to 6-inches apart. If you’re working with chard seedlings, place them in rows approximately 12-inches apart.When you’re creating the rows for the chard, make sure that they’re at least 18- to 24-inches apart.
If you’re working with seedlings, you may need to thin them out to get the distance right. Use cuticle scissors to cut them rather than pulling them out.

, When you’re ready to plant the chard in the soil, it’s important to place it at the right depth. For seeds, plant them approximately ½- to ¾-inch deep. If you’re working with seedlings, place them as deep as possible so the soil reaches the bottom of the leaves.Pay attention to how many seeds you plant too. The rule of thumb is eight to ten for every foot in the row., Consistent watering can help your chard grow better. Stick to a regular schedule, and apply approximately 1- to 1 ½-inches of water a week if it hasn’t rained. Place a rain gauge in your garden, so you know how much water the plants have received and adjust accordingly.Giving chard enough water can also help prevent it from getting a bitter taste.
Adding an organic mulch around the plants can help them retain moisture so they grow well. Ground bark, compost, straw, or finely ground leaves work well as mulch.

, You can usually tell when chard is ready to be harvested because the leaves are large enough to eat. The plants should be approximately 6- to 8-inches tall, though colored varieties may be taller. Use a sharp knife to cut off the outer leaves that are at least 1 ½-inches off the ground.If you’re careful when you harvest the chard, the young, inner leaves will continue grow in place of the outer leaves that you've removed, so a new harvest will be ready in the future.
It typically takes anywhere from four to 12 weeks for chard to be ready for harvest.

, Right after you harvest the chard, bring it inside to rinse it in cold water. The water helps cool the leaves, and remove any dirt, insects, or other debris from the surface. Take a moment to examine the chard after rinsing to ensure that the leaves are completely clean. Insects in particular can cling to the underside.Place the chard leaves on a piece of power towel after rinsing to soak up any excess water.

, The best place to store your chard is in the refrigerator, where it can last for two to three days. Make sure that the leaves are completely dry, and place them inside a ventilated plastic bag. If possible, store them inside the crisper drawer.You can also freeze chard if you’re not going to use it right away. Place it in boiling water for two minutes and then immediately into ice water to blanch it. Dry thoroughly, and place in airtight containers or plastic freezer bags for freezing. It can last up to a year in the freezer.

Draw a line where you want to remove the root.,
Dig around the root with a spade.,
Cut the root where you marked.,
Grab the cut end and pull the root towards you.,
Install a barrier.,
Fill in the hole.,
Monitor the tree in the upcoming days.",How to Dig up Tree Roots," Cutting the root too close to the tree can cause structural instability and can cause the tree to fall over.Measure the tree trunk's diameter with a tape measure and multiply it by 8. This number is the closest distance from the tree that you can cut the root.For example if your tree has a diameter of 2 feet (60.96 cm) you shouldn't cut the root closer than 16 feet (4.8 meters) from the tree itself.;
, Larger roots are called structural roots and are important in keeping the tree in place. These roots begin at the base of the tree and flare out. Do not cut larger roots 6 inches (152.4mm) to one foot (304.8mm) from the trunk for every inch in diameter that the tree is. You can measure the diameter of the tree by wrapping a tape measure around the tree at chest height.For instance, you shouldn't cut a tree that's 16-inches (406.4mm) in diameter 8 feet (2.4384 meters) to 16 feet (4.8768 meters) from the trunk.

, When removing large portions of the tree's roots, make sure to wait up to three years before cutting more roots. Removing over 20% of your tree's roots will seriously harm it and could kill it.If you plan on cutting a large portion of the roots from a tree, consider completely removing the tree instead.

, If you don't feel confident cutting a tree's roots, then you should seek professional guidance before doing so. Arborists from a local cooperative extension will sometimes provide tree root pruning services for a fee. If you'd rather do it yourself, see if you can have them come in for a smaller consultation fee.Arborists will have the equipment and knowledge to safely remove the tree roots for you.

, Measure a safe distance away from the tree before digging your hole. If the roots that you want to remove are underground, you'll need to reveal them with a shovel. Dig a hole around the tree where you want to remove the roots using a trenching or a digging shovel. Do your best not to disrupt or break the tree's roots while you do this., Once you've located the root you want to remove, use spray paint, colored chalk, or a thick marker to mark the spot where you'll cut the tree root. Marking the root will help guide you and prevent you from cutting the root too close to the tree. Simply mark the root with a line that will help guide where to cut with the saw.

, Dig around the root with a smaller spade, making sure to dig under the root as well. Leave space around the root, so it's easier to cut it. Completely reveal the area where you'll cut with your shovel and give yourself enough space to make cuts.

, For smaller roots, like those that are less than an inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, you can use regular gardening shears or gardening scissors to cut the root.If you are cutting a larger root, you‘ll need to use a special tool -- a root saw or a mechanical reciprocating saw. You can purchase these saws at home and gardening stores or online.Some store locations will allow you to rent reciprocating saws for a daily rate.

, Grab the loose end of the root and pull it towards you until it tears free from the ground. If the root is embedded deeply into the ground, you may need to dig up more soil around the root. Once you're done, discard the root, and continue doing this to the other roots that you're cutting.

, To keep the root from growing back, put in a barrier under the soil before you fill in the hole. Use a heavy duty plastic tree root barrier, and install it 30-inches (76 centimeters) below the surface of the soil.You can purchase a plastic tree root barrier at most lawn and garden centers.

, Fill the hole you've made with mulch or fertilizer purchased from the store. As an alternative to mulch, you can also fill your trench with grass seeds or sod if you want grass in the area.Take your cut tree's roots and dispose of them.

, Take a look at your tree on a daily basis and evaluate its health. If branches are starting to die and fall off, it could be a sign that you've done too much root damage and have killed your tree. This is dangerous because it could cause the tree to fall. If this is the case, you'll have to remove the entire tree.If you notice that the tree is dying, it's best to call an arborist or landscaping company as soon as possible. They will be able to evaluate whether you need to remove the tree and the steps you can take next.

Maintain the woodlands as the cycle repeats.",How to Coppice," Most broadleaf trees will sprout after coppicing, although species with good disease resistance are more likely to stay healthy.Most conifers (trees with needle leaves) will not regrow after coppicing.


Some common and reliable coppicing trees include oak, ash, hazel, sweet chestnut, sycamore, willow, most alder species, and lime.The yew, monkey puzzle, and coast redwood can be coppiced despite being conifers.Beech, birch, wild cherry, Italian alder, and some poplar species are less desirable choices, either sprouting weakly or only sprouting while the stump is fairly small.;
, Younger trees are much more likely to grow back healthy and vigorous after severe pruning.You can attempt to coppice mature trees, but they are more likely to die, or to take two growing seasons to reshoot.Once a tree has been coppiced once, you can continue to coppice it indefinitely. In fact, a regularly coppiced tree tends to live much longer than its untouched relative, since young growth is resistant to disease and age-related problems., Coppicing is a flexible technique, since you can harvest the shoots at any size. Depending on the desired use or market demands, you may decide to harvest your shoots as stakes, posts of various sizes, or firewood. The following are rough guidelines only, based on typical uses of each wood:Hazel can produce bean sticks and similar products in 7–10 years.
Sycamore and sweet chestnut trees can produce fence palings in 15 to 20 years.
Oak and ash is often grown for 25–35 years before harvest, for roundwood or firewood.
In general, the longer and larger you plan to grow your trees, the more widely spaced you can plant them. (The stumps will continue to grow.)

, This is when the roots have the highest reserve of sugars and starch for new growth. It is possible to coppice later in spring or in early summer, but the results may be diminished. Don't leave it any later, or the cut bark and new shoots will not have time to harden before winter.Coppicing too late in spring also increases disturbance to flora and fauna.
Shrubby dogwood and willow species will grow brightly coloured winter stems after coppicing. If this is your goal, cut these species back in spring, shortly after the new growth appears., You will need to make clean, even cuts that don’t crack the bark, and you will need clean tools that won't spread disease from other trees. Chainsaws may lead to slightly reduced growth compared to axe cuts, but the small loss may be worth it for thick trunks. The most important factor in tool choice is the ability to make a clean cut.Make sure you know how to safely fell a tree before coppicing mature trees, or before clearing existing trees to make room for a coppice.

, There is disagreement over how low to cut the tree. Traditionally, cutting very low to the ground (say 3 cm / 1.2 in) is said to improve yield by encouraging new shoots to form their own root systems.In some studies, however, higher stumps (15 cm / 6 in +) produced more shoots and were less vulnerable to rot from ground moisture.The ideal height to cut likely depends on the species, and on the value of the cut timber. You may wish to experiment with different heights, or to seek local advice.


You can instead pollard the tree, meaning cut it at a higher point on the trunk. The traditional purpose of pollarding is to keep shoots away from livestock. Today, it is sometimes used as a windbreak or for aesthetic reasons.Except for the height, pollarding is identical to coppicing.

, This is a traditional technique for reducing rot and fungal disease. It's not clear how much of an effect this has, but it is an easy step to take.Aim for an angle around 15 to 20 degrees.


Angle the cut to receive more sunlight so it dries more quickly after rain.(This is typically south-facing in the Northern Hemisphere.)

, Many growers leave some untouched trees or ""standards"" among the coppiced stools. This preserves some aesthetic and ecological aspects of the woodland. Ideally, the mature trees should be widely spaced (no more than 40% canopy cover), and include a variety of ages.The standards do not need to be the same species as the stools. Oak and ash are common standards, and often harvested for timber (on a much slower cycle than the coppice). Beech is not recommended due to its dense canopy.The alternative ""simple coppice"" system coppices all the trees in an area at the same time. This is most commonly used for sweet chestnut, a low maintenance tree that can reshoot indefinitely at the same rate., Divide the woodland into sections, or ""coupes"", to coppice in a staggered rotation. By having each section at a different stage of growth, you provide a variety of habitats for different woodland species.This also allows for steady economic benefit, so the amount of wood you plan to use or sell each year factors into the size of your coupes.

, The shoots are tasty food for deer and other animals, so secure the area before spring. If the fence seems ineffective, you can cover the stools with plant debris or hedge clippings, but this may affect the shape of the new shoot growth., Harvest when the sap is down for highest quality wood and least damage to the tree.

, For larger shoots, use a sharp axe. For smaller shoots, use a billhook or handsaw.

, The lowest point of the cut should face outward, to promote rain runoff.Start at the outer shoots and work in toward the center, cutting close to the base of the shoot., Small shoots can be adequately seasoned in about a year.

, Coppiced woodlands can last indefinitely. Maintenance is low, but important over the long term:


Plant new trees as stumps die off. Stump death in most species is unrelated to the number of times the tree has been cut back, so there is no need to replace old stumps.
Prune or fell mature ""standards"" (if using) to reduce canopy cover to 30% at the start of each coppice cycle.Soil fertility will eventually decline, but you can typically grow a coppice without fertilizer for decades."

Replant the shrub.",How to Clear Large Shrubs," It’s best to clear large garden shrubs at a time when birds aren't nesting, to avoid disturbing wildlife.


Aim to clear larger shrubs during the fall or winter to avoid this.
It’s usually easier to dig when the soil is fairly dry, so you should also avoid digging after heavy rainfall.;
, A sharp pair of pruning shears and a small saw will make the job of clearing the shrub a lot easier – remember sharp blades are safer than blunt ones.


A round-bladed spade with a pointed tip will make it easier to dig through the soil, and a mattock will be useful for cutting through the roots.
Also remember to wear appropriate clothing – including sturdy gardening gloves and strong boots.

, Use the pruning shears to cut the shrub right back until only a small amount of stump is remaining.


This will make it much easier for you to expose the root ball and pull it out of the ground, which is necessary for completely clearing the shrub.
Leaving the shrub's roots in the ground will simply allow the shrub to grow back. , Use the round-bladed spade to dig a trench around the stump. Beware of digging close to water or electricity supplies.


Consider calling 811 (the national ""call before you dig"" service) to find out if any utility lines run beneath that part of your garden.

, Using the spade and mattock, cut through the roots as much as possible to make it easier to pull the root mass out of the ground.


Although it's only necessary to remove the root head and main roots to prevent the shrub from re-growing, you should also remove as much of the rest of the root mass as you can to make space for subsequent planting.
Shaking the soil out of the roots will make the plant lighter to handle.

, Once you have cut away the shrub and pulled up the root mass, you can dispose of the plant material anyway you like. If the shrub is small enough, you could try to compost it, otherwise you should consider burning it.


Don’t compost any diseased plant matter you cut away – burn it or put it in the household trash to prevent infection spreading to other plants.

, Once you have disposed of the root ball, use a mattock or spade to break up as much of the remaining root in the ground as you can – breaking the root up will help it to rot away naturally in the soil.


It’s also a good idea to incorporate some well-rotted manure or compost into the soil now to benefit the next plant that will go in the ground here.

, Another approach that involves less digging is to wrap a length of chain around the root stump and pull it from the ground using a car jack or a towing vehicle.


It will help if you can mattock out the roots a little to dislodge the root from the ground.
You’ll need to be aware of where your water and power lines are to avoid accidentally damaging these.

, Cut off the majority of the shrub above ground, leaving only a fairly short length of stump above ground. Purchase a glyphosate-based shrub killing chemical treatments from the garden store.


This treatment needs to be applied fairly soon after cutting – it won’t work on an old stump that’s been sitting in the garden for years. Handle carefully and follow manufacturers instructions.
Treat the stump over the autumn and winter, when the sap isn't rising. It may be necessary to drill holes in the woody stump to pour the treatment into.
You’ll need to have considerable patience as the stump may take a good while to die away and the area will not be suitable for immediate replanting.

, Although you might want rid of your shrub, there may be someone in your local area who would love to have it.


You might try advertising on a local message board such as Gumtree or Craigslist to see if anyone wants a free shrub and is prepared to dig it out and collect it. Take a good digital photo and you may be surprised who’s interested!

, Prepare the ground at the new location well by incorporating lots of well-rotted manure or compost. It’s best to do this well ahead of time if possible. Dig up the shrub to be moved in the, fall after the leaves have dropped off, or in early springtime, before new ones form.

, This is important, as it will allow you to transfer the shrub as quickly as possible, which prevents the roots from getting stressed or dried out.


In order to dig a new hole, it's important to get an idea of the size of the shrub's roots. This will ensure that the new hole is big enough. To do this, take a tape measure and find a point on the main trunk of the shrub that is 15 centimeter (5.9 in) above the ground.
Measure the trunk diameter at this point. Multiply that by ten to get the size of the root diameter. Once you have the root diameter, you can dig a hole of the same diameter or larger.

, If your soil type is sandy, give the shrub a good watering two or three days before moving it. This will help preserve the root mass when you dig it up.

, Dig the root ball out with the back of your spade facing the plant. You can move it to its new location by placing it on an old sheet or tarpaulin which you can drag across the ground.


If you don't have time to replant the shrub immediately, you will need to tie up the branches of the shrub to protect them. Start at the bottom and use a spiral wrapping movement to wrap the branches against the trunk.
Make the roots as compact as possible but avoid damaging the branches by tying too tightly.

, Lower the shrub's root ball into its new location and cover with soil. Don’t tamp the soil down with your feet as this can damage the roots.Water the shrub well until it's established in its new position.

These 3 factors are absolutely essential when determining ideal locations to plant a tree.;
, Use a measuring tape to plot out its recommended radius where you want to plant your tree to ensure it will fit. Root systems on large trees are strong, and if you plant your trees too closely to buildings, sidewalks, concrete, or other structures, the roots may break them apart as they get larger.

, If your yard allows, plant 3 large trees, 1 each on the west, east, and north sides of your house. These locations can help to shade your house in the summer and block wind in the winter. These benefits can result in as much as a 50% reduction in energy costs.

, There may be cables, wires, and pipes buried in your yard, and you run the risk of serious injury or costly repairs if you cut into one of these while digging. Each utility should be willing to come out free of charge and mark off where its equipment is located.

They go dormant in winter, but cannot withstand frost. If you live in a place with harsh winters (temperatures below freezing), a container is best so the plant can be moved inside or stored during winter.


Early spring is the best time to plant a frangipanis so it is established and blooming heavily by summer.
Plunging, or burying a potted plumeria in the ground, can be done in cooler climates. This way you can keep your plant in the ground, yet still be able to easily move it inside during winter.;
, Choose a spot where it will get at least 6 hours of sun daily. You may also want to plant it somewhere you will be able to enjoy the lovely scent its flowers produce. Great locations include placing them near patios and windows, or beside driveways and walkways.


If you have a patio or deck with outdoor seating, plant your frangipanis nearby so you can see and smell the beautiful blooms all summer. Or, if using a container, find a sunny spot on the deck to keep it.Their shallow roots make them well suited for planting along pathways and other hardscapes, like pools and water features., Your hole should be as deep as the root ball and three times as wide. It may help to loosen the soil first by digging in with the tip of your shovel several times, wiggling your shovel around each time to break up the dirt. Containers should be at least 40 cm (15¾ inches) in diameter.


Terra cotta pots absorb heat, helping simulate a tropical environment for the roots, and provide good drainage since they are porous. They are also usually top heavy, which will help support the plant as it grows.
You can use a plastic pot if you prefer or want a cheaper, decorative option, as long as you If you take special care to use a good quality, well-draining soil.

, When planting, you may find the soil has poor drainage, like clay or silt, when you dig into it. You will need to mix this with compost or commercial soil made for dry-loving plants before planting.Containers should be filled with premium potting mix with no added wetting agents.


Cactus mix is a good option, or you can mix regular potting soil with pearlite or orchid bark.Place large rocks or broken pot fragments in the bottom of containers before adding any soil, so holes don't become clogged.
The best kinds of water soluble fertilizers you can use will have a phosphorus content 50, fertilizers can get as low as 20, but higher content is OK as well., Use your hands to loosen the soil at the very bottom of the root ball and gently spread the roots out. Failing to separate the roots makes your plant susceptible to root rot.


If the plant is already root bound, meaning the roots have grown around and filled the pot, you need to use a planting knife to cut them apart before planting.When using a root knife, make three vertical incisions near the bottom of the root ball, a few inches deep with each cut running through the bottom.
To separate the root ball, use your hands to pull apart the roots from each other so they grow in different directions.

, If your pot or hole is deeper than the root ball, add some soil first. When planting in a container, you should only have a few inches separating the top of the root ball and the top of the container. Cover the root ball halfway with soil, water thoroughly, and allow it to drain. Fill rest of container or hole with soil and pack it down to support the trunk.


Watering the soil at mid-point will help it to settle and eliminate air pockets around the roots.Be sure not to cover any of the exposed trunk with added soil. You only want the tree to be planted as deep as it was in its original container.

, For containers, the plant will have enough water when you see excess start to come out the bottom holes. Trees planted outdoors should be well watered after planting, but moderately throughout the spring and summer months, especially while the tree is young.A good technique for potted watering is to water until it pools, wait 30 seconds for it to drain, and continue this until you see drainage.

, Mulch and moss help retain moisture in ground soil longer in hot, dry climates. Whichever you choose to use, make sure it doesn’t touch the trunk or the plant could develop fungal decay from too much moisture.For plants growing in containers, you could dress the container with Spanish moss. Be sure to keep it lose around the trunk.

, You should bring your frangipanis inside when temperatures starts getting toward 40°F (4.4°C) or so. Store it in a dry, ventilated area that stays above freezing. Remove all leaves from the plant before storing.Return your plumeria to the outdoors after winter storage when the temperature most nights reaches 50° or above. Place the container in a sunny spot or plant it wherever you want and water thoroughly. , Frangipani can withstand drought conditions and do not like staying wet. Overwatering can cause root rot. If planted in the ground, they need only an inch of water per week. Container plants generally need more regular watering. Do not water at all during winter months when plant is dormant.


Begin watering your frangipanis for the season at the first sign of leaf growth.Stop watering when leaves begin to drop in the fall. This means the plant is starting to go dormant for the season.Keep a rain gauge in your garden to measure weekly rain and/or the amount of water accumulated from sprinklers.
Water containers until water comes out the drainage holes, then wait to water again when the first few centimeters of the soil becomes dry.
Check the drainage holes of potted plants periodically and make sure they have not become clogged., Start with the first feeding in early spring when the frangipanis comes out of dormancy and leaves are at least 2 inches long. Always use a fertilizer with high phosphorus content.In most cases, this will involve sprinkling one tablespoon per five gallon pot onto soil and watering.In early spring, use a 15-15-15 mix. (Phosphorus is the second number displayed.)
In April, switch fertilizers to a 6-20-20 blend with micronutrients.
Use 0-40-0 when buds start forming.
For the last feeding of the season in early fall, use 6-20-20.
Frangipanis stop growing when the average temperature is consistently below 65°F (18.3°C). In Southern areas, they may bloom through November, but watch the nighttime temperatures in your location carefully to know when to stop feeding it., For plumeria planted outside, use a frost cloth to cover the whole tree if nighttime temperatures are going to drop below 33°. Use a cloth big enough to come to the ground on all sides. Remove the cloth during day when its sunny or if it will rain. Rain could weigh the cloth down and break limbs.If your plant gets frost damage, the ends of branches will turn brown and the tips may turn black. Cut off any black parts and check brown sections for firmness. Any soft spots should be cut off, also.
Treat the cut ends with a fungicide to prevent further damage to the wounded part of the plant.

, Rust is a fungus that looks like rust on metal. If you see signs of rust, remove all heavily affected leaves. Spray the rest of the tree with a mix of one heaping tablespoon of baking soda, one tablespoon of Neem oil, a few drops of dish soap mixed with a gallon of water. Use a tank sprayer, and spray once a week until no signs of rust are visible.Do not spray in the middle of the day in summer or you might burn the leaves. Spray in the morning or evening when the plant isn’t getting direct sunlight.

, Trimming branches helps shape your plumeria and encourages growth the following year. The beginning of winter is a good time to prune your tree, just before storing for the season. Established, mature trees only need pruning to keep them at their preferred size, or if they have damaged or diseased limbs.Plumeria are considered young for 3 or 4 years. After this, they only need to be pruned when they outgrow their space or require shaping.
Never remove more than 10% of the branches to avoid stressing your frangipanis and inhibiting new growth.
Blooms only grow at the end of branches and take two years to form on cut branches. Consider pruning only half of the tree one winter, and the other half the following year to maintain seasonal flowering., Frangipanis should not be exposed to direct sunlight during pruning or in the few days following it. If your plumeria is planted in the ground, wait until the sun is less intense and no extreme weather is expected for a few days., Doing this the first few years will encourage trees to produce more branches and become fuller. Use hand pruners and cut the stem at an angle. After cutting, the trimmings can be put in a vase, composted, or thrown away.


Always wear work gloves and safety glasses when cutting. Branches ooze a milky sap when cut that can irritate skin.

, Frangipanis tend to produce more than one main stem, which will change the shape of your tree by making it more bushy. Trim down any stems competing with the main trunk, or cut them off close to the beginning of the branch.Shortening branches encourages new shoots to grow out of the branch, making your tree fuller. If you want a branch to grow new shoots, do not cut it closer than 6 inches to the main trunk.Exactly where you trim your frangipanis and how much depends on your vision for the tree. Air on the side of caution to avoid over-pruning. You can always make a second round of cuts.

, This will open up the remaining branches to sunlight, prevent the spread of disease, and allow the tree to become stronger. Cut close to the main stem at an angle.You may also cut any branches that grow in odd directions to create the shape you desire.


You may also remove lower limbs to create a canopy shape and keep the branches off the ground.
Any limbs that look diseased, have been damaged by frost or exposure, or are infested with beetles should be cut and disposed of as soon as possible.
Trim away any noticeable damage, infestations, or sickness as soon as you notice. Waiting may cause any of these to spread.

If you don't own the land on which the tree grows, make sure that the landowner is okay with you removing it.

, If the tree is on your own property, then you can chop it down at your own discretion. You'll need to ask permission if the woods are on public land or on someone else's private land. Do not illegally chop down a tree.

, You'll need to consider how tall the tree is and where it will fall. Discern whether the tree is leaning in any particular direction, and make sure that it won't fall onto any person or property. Decide what you'll do with the tree once you chop it. If you plan to move the tree, you'll need to let it fall somewhere that you can easily recover it. If you leave the tree where it falls, it will take some time for it to rot into the ground. In the meantime, it can serve as a home for beetles, roaches, ants, snakes, and other pests.


View the tree from all angles to ascertain if it leans in any one direction. If so, determine whether it will cause damage to fences, trees, driveways, sheds, or any surrounding property. You must also determine that it will not fall back across or against your house. Proceed only if it passes this test, and you still feel confident.

, You can use an ax, which is a slower, more archaic method best suited to smaller trees. Many modern tree-cutters use a chainsaw, which is heavier-duty, but more expensive and arguably more dangerous. Your choice will be largely dependent upon which tools you have at your disposal. Only use a chainsaw if you are very comfortable using heavy-duty power tools.

, Be extremely careful not to stand in the path of a falling tree, and make sure that there is no one—friends, neighbors, children, pets&mash;in the way when you make the cut. Consider wearing gloves, a helmet, goggles, and other safety gear. Remember: if the tree is large, it could easily kill you or a loved one when it falls.


Be aware of property damage. Make sure that the tree won't fall onto any buildings, vehicles, etc.
If you are chopping a tree in the woods, make sure that you know where all members of your party are at all times. Make sure that you can safely remove the tree from the woods.

, Use a chopping ax (not a splitting ax) or a large machete/knife. The size of the necessary ax depends on the size of the tree.

, Tie it as tightly as you can to another tree, or big rock in the direction you want it to fall. (You may throw a cord with a weight on it over a limb and pull a rope up and figure out how to tie it.) Tie the rope to something that is farther away than the height of the tree, unless you don't care where the tree lands. Tie this rope tightly and make sure there are a couple of backup knots on it.


Avoid damaging any fence, building or vehicle.

, Try to get a good ""V"" shape going on the side of the tree--remember, axes aren't saws; you cannot chop in a straight line.


Do not try to chop the wood straight. Wedge out little pieces on the side you want it to fall.
You do not need to make it all the way through the tree on one side, just think about where it is best to chop it.

, Keep your eyes and ears open, and be prepared to run out of the way Watch upward, and listen for cracking and groaning sounds. Cracking or groaning will tell you that the tree may be about to give way. As you chop, continue to glance upward into the tree for any swaying or leaning.

, A tree can fall quickly and quietly, and it can easily catch you by surprise. If you are not paying attention, the tree could fell you!


Expect the tree to swing around as it falls. This is due to limbs or the slant of the tree, and due to your ""guide"" rope. Limbs of your tree may extend outward far enough to strike you. Stay out of the way.
Watch for surrounding trees. The branches of other trees may become entangled or break, and you may find that other limbs and trees begin to fall around you.

, You can rent small chainsaw with with an 18"" bar at most hardware stores. These saws are normally 2 cycle engines which require a mixture of two cycle oil and gas. If you rent one, insist on them providing you with a full can if gasoline mixture. You will need what is called ""bar oil"", which goes into its own tank and lubricates the chain and the bar it is on. Finally, have then shop you how it starts, and ask them to check to make sure the chain is sharp.

, If the tree is standing pretty straight, you will need to make a wedge cut.

, Go to the front of the tree and start your saw. Let it run for a minute to warm up. If your chainsaw doesn't have an automatic oilier, make sure to push the oil button occasionally. Most modern saws do include an automatic oilier.


You never want the chain or bar to get dry under the heat. Bar oil is formulated to cling to the bar, and it will actually string from the bar it you touch your finger to it.

, Rev the saw up about halfway. Hold it completely horizontal, then make a cut from the side in about 1/3 of the diameter of the tree. Then, go up about 3-4"" above that cut: pick an imaginary line that will start above the 1st cut, and maintain 45 degrees all the way down, (an angle cut) to where the horizontal cut stopped. Go no further. This is your wedge piece, which you will need to remove.


You may need to knock the wedge piece loose with a sledgehammer. Knock it on the side, then the top, then the side again.

, You can assist the tree in falling along your desired path by roping it and tying it securely with at least a 1/2"" rope 2/3 of the way up the trunk. Then, hook that rope to a come-along hand-winch that's tied to a larger tree. Make sure that the larger tree is far enough away that your tree won't fall into it. As you start to cut the tree, have a friend begin to crank the come-along to maintain pressure toward your targeted zone.


Alternatively, you can use two wedges. Once your saw blade is well into the cut (far enough along so the wedges will not hit the bar of the saw) begin to drive them in equally behind the saw blade. Watch the tree as it is being cut. If it leans one way more than the other and that takes it off path, pound the wedge on that side in a bit more. Try to keep the wedges even so the tree falls evenly.
Do not stand directly behind the tree. It can break loose from the trunk and ""kick back"", causing extreme damage or even death to the cutter(s).

, Move to the back of the tree, and make sure the area where you stand is completely clear. Pick a horizontal, straight line that will intersect the top angle of the wedge cut you made – about 1/3 of the way from where it ends in the tree. As you cut, use a high engine speed, but don't push the saw too hard. Eventually as you near the intersection of the wedge cut the tree should begin to bend in the direction of the fall. Do not cut all the way through.

, When the tree begins to fall, move out of the way and yell to anyone around to get out of the way. If the fall begins to slow, give it a little more cut until it resumes falling. It will normally break loose of the stump and lie on either side of the stump.

, Lop the limbs off in the direction of the growth, and take a piece of chalk to mark where you want each cut made. Saw it up and remove it from the area!

Use a 14-foot ladder that is very sturdy. , This is in late winter between February and April. During this time, the tree stores energy in the roots and trunk, so pruning the branches is unlikely to cause damage.


Apple trees develop their buds for the coming year in the summer.

, Healing these branches will take energy from the tree that can be used for fruit production. Use hand shears for small branches, lopping shears for medium branches and a manual saw for large branches.

, Don’t lop off the top of the tree. Plan to take it down to an 18-foot height over the course of three to four years to ensure it will have a long life.

, This is a small, stump like edge of the branch that extends from the tree or another branch. Pruning cuts that have a collar will heal much more quickly than those that are flush with the trunk or branch.

, Then, top the main scaffold limb at 16 feet (4.9m). Follow up the second year by cutting long shoots that grow off of your previous cuts.


Prune just above the crotch if you want to make a few drastic cuts and train the tree. Use a sloping cut. This may be necessary if there is almost no new growth within reach from the ladder.

, As you prune over the course of three years, more wood will grow at a low level thanks to increased sunlight. It will eventually replace fruiting wood that is lost at the top.

, Leave an upright shoot at the end of each branch. This will give you an abundance of fruiting wood.

, County extension agents can instruct you on local businesses that offer this service. The ideal pH for an apple tree is 6.2 to 6.5.If your tree is the ideal pH, don’t fertilize it. Plan to fertilize only if the leaves are pale and the tree shows weak growth.

, If they grow more than eight inches annually, apply one pound of sulfate of potash for every five bushels that were harvested the preceding year. If they grew less than eight inches, apply one pound of 10-10-10 fertilizer in early May.


10-10-10 fertilizer is 10 percent nitrogen, 10 percent phosphorus and 10 percent potassium.
Apply the sulfate of potash in early spring, just after growth begins.
Spread the fertilizer over the ground to the edge of the spread of the branches. #*Make sure it is an even layer.
Never fertilize after July 1.

, If so, you can apply one cup of borax every three to four years.

, You want to avoid using lawn or weed killing products around the base of the apple trees as well.

, Although leaf mold is a useful compost for gardens, it can lead to leaf-borne illnesses and mouse boring problems in your apple tree.,, Water every few weeks if your climate doesn’t provide much water.


You may need to provide about 5.4 inches (13.7cm) of water every 21 days.

, The water must reach the roots that are three feet (0.9m) below the soil. Most people water infrequently, but for thirty minutes to an hour at a time.

Quarantine new plants from infested plants.",How to Grow Epiphyllum Cactus," You can buy epiphyllum cactus cuttings from a garden center or an online plant store.


Cactus cuttings are sections of a mature stem which are planted and used to grow a whole new plant.If you already own an epiphyllum cactus that is strong and healthy, you can make your own cuttings. Choose a healthy leaf of approximately 4 inches (10 cm) and cut it off at the stem below the base of the leaf. Repeat this process until you have obtained the desired number of cuttings.;
, Good places include a garden shed, bathroom, or basement. Because the epiphyllum cactus is a succulent plant, cuttings can remain good for up to a month.


Storing the cuttings will allow them to cure. The purpose of curing the cuttings is to allow calluses to form over the ends of the cutting. The calluses protect the cuttings from rot.
If you purchased the cuttings and don't know exactly when they were made, cure them for a week before planting.

, This will allow adequate room for the cactus to grow while the drainage hole will prevent over-watering.


Plastic pots are preferable to terracotta pots, as they will allow the soil to retain moisture for a longer period of time.
Choose potting mix for epiphyllum cacti. This consists of three parts potting soil mixed with one part of coarse non-organic material such as perlite, which is also referred to as sponge rock. The non-organic material should be 1/8 to 1/2 inch (1/3 to 1 1/4 cm) in diameter. You can also add 1 to 1 1/2 tbsp. of orchid bark per pot.
Alternatively, you can plant the cuttings in pure perlite. However, once the cuttings have developed roots, you will have to move them to epiphyllum potting mix.
The potting mix should always be damp, never wet. This will ensure healthy and faster growth.

, If you water them too soon, the cuttings will rot.


To check for rot, tug gently on each cutting. If you feel any resistance, this is good because it means the cutting is rooting. You can water the cutting.
If a cutting has rotted, take it out of the pot, cut away the rot, cure the cutting, and pot it again.

,


Epiphyllum cacti love growing in hanging containers, and doing so will provide a good base for the pendulous growth of the plant. As an added bonus, hanging containers make it harder for snails — the number 1 epiphyllum pests — to get to the plants.
A shady spot under a tree or beneath a shade structure made of cloth or lath provides the right amount of light. If grown in direct sunlight, cacti can get burnt. If set in too shady an area, the cactus can become overly lush and will be shy to produce flowers. Also, the long stems won't be strong enough to hold themselves up and will may fall over, sustaining damage.
If possible, choose walls or eaves that face east or north for the best lighting.
Ensure good air circulation, but protect the plants from storms and strong winds. Windstorms may cause hanging baskets to swing against each other and long stems to whip around, causing breakage.

, The soil should never be completely dry, but should also never remain wet after watering.


Check the soil regularly to gauge whether you need to add water.
When you water, make sure to add enough water so that any excess water flows out of the drainage holes. This will rinse out the soil and prevent the accumulation of soluble salts in the soil.

, Epiphyllum cacti bloom best when you give them regular, light fertilizer applications.


Feed your epiphyllum cactus at each watering time from May to late August. After this period, only fertilize every other watering time.
Only use about one-third to one-half the amount of fertilizer that is recommended on the label. Since cacti naturally grow in relatively low nutrient environments, they won't require as many nutrients for healthy growth.
During the winter, fertilize with a low or no nitrogen fertilizer. Use a 2-10-10 or a 0-10-10 formulation. After the blossoming season is past, fertilize with a balanced formulation like 10-10-10 or 5-5-5.

, Frost and prolonged temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.5 degrees Celsius) are harmful to epiphyllum cacti.


Cover your cactus with a blanket or cardboard box for better protection. Epiphyllum cacti are also vulnerable against hail, which may not be big enough to break the stems but can cause unsightly scars where each hailstone has struck.
The most optimal time to plant cacti is during the period from April to September. This will ensure a warm, sunny atmosphere while also avoiding direct sunlight that may hinder growth.

, Changing the potting mix will resupply the nutrients that will have naturally been absorbed by your cactus


Each plant's size will determine when you need to repot it. A plant that is growing well and is beginning to get too big for the pot will need to be moved to a bigger pot, while a plant that remains small can stay in the same pot for longer.
Use 7 to 8 inch (17.5 to 20 cm) plastic pots with the same drainage holes and potting mix.
Wrap newspaper around the stem of each plant to prevent damage.
Holding the plant around the base of the stem, turn it upside down, and carefully tap the pot against a hard surface such as the underside of a table to loosen the soil from the inside of the pot. Gently pull the pot away from the plant and remove the old soil.
Examine the roots. If any show signs of rot or any other damage, cut them away as close to the plant as possible.
Don't be discouraged if you haven't noticed any flowers; an epiphyllum cactus will not bloom until it has grown to the size of its pot, which usually occurs 3 to 4 years after planting the cutting.

, This will prevent your cactus from sustaining diseases or other infections that can affect growth.


Use a 10% diluted bleach solution, mixing 1 part chlorine bleach with 1 part water.

, Make your cut just below the flower head.


Pruning dead parts of the plant not only improves its appearance, it will encourage new growth and healthy blossoming., When you locate a stem to remove, follow it back to the base of the stem and make a straight cut just outside the joint of the parent stem.


Immediately disinfect shears after trimming dead or diseased stems. This will keep the disease from spreading throughout the plant.
It is best to assume that any dead stem died as a result of disease. Disinfecting after each pruning session may require more bleach, but it will keep your cactus healthy and beautiful.

, Trace them back to the parent stem and cut at the base.


These stems are usually located along the outer edges. Remove stems as needed until all sides of the plant are fairly uniform.

, Snails are fairly simple to spot and remove (use store-bought snail bait), but the aforementioned bugs require specific measures for preventing infestation.


Mealybugs have a waxy, white, cottony appearance. They are slow moving and usually are in clusters along leaf veins or spines, on the underside of leaves, and in hidden areas at the joints.Scale insects resemble small, cottony dome-shaped shells. They attach themselves to stems and leaves but can be pried off.
Spider-mites are hard to see with the naked eye, but signs of infestation include webbing and small brown dots, especially on younger growth. If you tap the affected area of the plant over a piece of white paper, spider-mites will resemble dust.These insects tend to suck the plant's juices resulting in weak, wrinkled, or shriveled leaves. Severe infestations can result in the death of the plant. First symptoms can include stickiness or black mold on or near the plant.

, You can also spray with a diluted alcohol solution of 1 parts alcohol and 3 parts water.


Spraying is best for fighting spider-mite infestation and other hard-to-spot bugs. Be cautious however, as this may damage the epidermis of the cactus. Test a small area before spraying the entire plant.

, Insecticidal soap can be purchased at your local garden or home improvement store.


This treatment may also damage your cactus. Since cacti have oils and waxes that make them susceptible to damage, it is best to use it sparingly and to test a small area before washing the entire cactus.

, Use insecticides like Neem or pyrethrins for visible bugs. Systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid or Acephate are best for controlling pests that aren't as easily accessible.


Consult the label to see how much you should use on your cactus and whether or not prolonged use is safe.

, Remember that infestation isn't just harmful, it is contagious and will spread from plant to plant until it is stopped.


Check new plants carefully for the previously mentioned symptoms and bugs. If you are absolutely sure it is pest free, keep it in an area far away from the infected plants. If you do find pests on your new plants, it may be best to simply discard it rather than treat it to save you time, money, and effort."

Grow cacti from seed.,
Propagate cacti from cuttings or offshoots taken from mature cactus plants.,
Purchase a cactus plant from a local garden center.",How to Grow Cactus in Containers1,"


While this method is not difficult, it can be time consuming to see results. Cactus seeds could take up to a year to germinate and several years for the young cactus to begin to flower.
Unless you have a heated greenhouse, it's best to sow cactus seed in the late spring. Seed companies often offer many mixed varieties of cacti seed.
Use clean sterilized shallow pots to begin your seeds. Use a mixture of potting soil and sand. Place the seeds on the soil and cover them with just enough sand to anchor them. Keep in mind that cactus seeds don't germinate well if they have been sown too deeply.
Dampen the soil enough to wet the seed. When the soil dries out completely, use a mister to keep it moist. Do not over water.
Cover seeds with glass or plastic wrap and be sure to wipe away any condensation that may form. When seedlings appear, remove the cover. Carefully prick apart any seedlings that have grown together. Place the seedlings in light, but not in direct sunlight. Keep temperatures around 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).;
,


Allow the cuttings to dry and its cut edge to heal for a couple of weeks.
Place the healed cutting into a rooting medium formulated to encourage roots to grow. Make certain the cutting is right side up. If placed upside down, it will not grow. After a week, begin to water the cutting sparingly.

,


Avoid plants with damaged spines or those that look bruised, spindly or lopsided.
Read the directions that come with the plant or speak to a professional about the best way to care for the type of cactus you selected to grow.

In a shady garden bed, simply scatter the seeds on the soil. There's no need to cover them, unless you want to use netting to keep the birds off. Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate.
Make sure that the garden bed is in the shade. Beavertail cacti seeds need shade to grow, whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlight.
Be aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cutting. It can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowers.

Try to choose a part of the plant that has a thick stem with healthy leaves.Use sharp, clean clippers to snip off the stem. Make sure to leave a few inches of space between the bottom of the stem and the leaves so that you won’t have to remove any leaves when you plant it.;
, Giving the cutting a few days to dry out and scab over will help keep your little Jade plant healthy while it is rooting. All you have to do is leave the cutting in a dry place until it seems a bit dry. The place where you cut the stem should be scabbed over.The larger the cutting, the more time this will take. It will also take longer if you are doing this in the winter as opposed to during the warm summer months.

, Rooting hormone (also called rooting tonic) is a mix of different plant hormones that will help cuttings grow more successfully.You can make your own homemade rooting hormone or you can purchase a commercial rooting hormone.


If you purchase a commercial rooting hormone, you should follow the instructions provided. However, in general, you will apply the rooting hormone directly to the stem that will be placed in the soil. Do this just before planting.To avoid contaminating your bottle of rooting hormone, pour a small amount into a container. Use the hormone in your vessel for the propagation work and discard any leftover. This way, the rest stays fresh.
This step is optional. Though it may increase your chances of success, Jade plants are known for their ability to root successfully on their own.

, You should not use regular potting soil for your Jade plant as it is too heavy for this plant to root in. Instead, purchase a soil made specifically for succulent plants or mix your own and add a few handfuls of sand for better drainage. The key to remember is that Jade plants need soil that drains well.You can mix your own soil by mixing together a combination of sand, perlite, and a compost of some sort. Succulents prefer soil that drains easily, so it is important to avoid regular potting soil. You can find all of these ingredients at a nursery.If you are worried about your plant draining well enough, use a clay pot instead a plastic pot. Make sure that there is a drainage hole on the bottom where water can escape. If there is a saucer underneath the pot, always empty out any excess water.
Jade plants don’t need a huge amount of space, so if you have a small clipping you can use a pot that is small.

, Use your finger or a pencil to make a small hole in the soil (just big enough for the stem to fit into). Place the stem into the hole so that the rooting hormone is covered (if you used it). If you didn’t use root hormone, just place the stem in deep enough so that the plant can stand up on its own.Pack the soil in loosely around the stem. You don’t have to pack it in too tightly as this will discourage drainage. Just pack it tight enough so that the stem feels secure in the pot.
If planting the cutting directly doesn’t work for you, try rooting it in water. Place your cutting in a jar with the tip of the stem just above the surface of the water. The cutting will begin to root, and then you can plant it., It is important that the small plant is kept in a sunny place, but do not place it in direct sunlight as the leaves will burn. In three to four weeks, you should notice new growth on the top of the plant. This is a good sign that your plant has successfully rooted.Avoid the temptation to water your plant while it is rooting. This will increase the chance that the stem will rot and kill your rooting plant altogether.
Once your Jade plant has rooted, you can consider moving it to a larger pot if you want to.
If your plant doesn’t seem to be rooting, and it’s only been a few weeks, try waiting a bit longer. Succulent plants root easily, so it may just be that you haven’t given the plant enough time. Alternatively, you can gently remove the cutting from the pot to see if roots are growing. Don’t do this too often, though, as it only slows the process., Jade plants are succulents, which means that, while they do need water, they don’t need a lot. If you touch the soil and it feels moist, the plant does not need water. On the other hand, if you notice the leaves are starting to wilt then you know the plant is not getting enough water.Stick your finger up to the first knuckle into the soil. If it is dry, then it is OK to water it. If it is still moist, then it doesn’t need more water.In the winter months, your plant will likely need even less watering than normal so be sure to always check the soil.Many people recommend watering succulents by soaking the entire pot in a tub of water, which allows the plant to soak up the water from the bottom. However, you can also water the plant by pouring water into the pot through the top. The most important thing is that you allow the excess water to drain completely from the pot.
Do not leave the Jade plant sitting in water. If you notice excess water, be sure to empty it from the saucer.
Try to avoid getting the leaves wet when watering.

, Jade does need a lot of sunlight, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be in full sun for the entire day. Avoid placing your jade plant in a south-facing window, as it will probably burn. Instead, look for a place where your plant will get about 3 to 5 hours of sun each day.Move your plant in stages. For example, if you have been keeping your jade in a dark, shadowy corner, but want to move it to a bright window sill, don’t just pick the plant up and plop it on the window sill. Such an extreme change is likely to cause the leaves of the Jade to burn and fall off. Instead, move the plant gradually so it has time to adjust. For example, move the plant out of the dark corner to a place where it may get an hour of indirect sunshine. Leave it there for at least a few days before moving it to an area with a bit more sunshine. Keep doing this until you’ve got your plant to the desired location.

, If any leaves have fallen off the tree into the pot, remove them. You can also prune your plant to keep it healthy. If you want to prune your jade, you can remove just about anything you want, but avoid messing with the main stem too much, or you may kill the plant.Cutting off new growth will help the plant stay more bush-like and less spindly.

, Jade plants are very hardy and easy to keep alive, so you don’t have to worry much about whether the temperature is right. Keep them in a place at room temperature. This means that you shouldn’t place them in a south facing window where they will receive direct sunlight for most of the day.In the winter, they prefer a slightly cooler temperature (e.g. around 55 degrees Fahrenheit or 13 degrees Celsius).

, Though you can leave the plant in the same pot for many years, as long as you are not overwatering it, changing out the soil every two to four years will give you a chance to inspect the roots for any damage or rot. Additionally, giving the plant some fresh dry soil will make sure the plant continues to flourish.If you notice that a Jade plant you’ve had for many years is not doing well anymore, replanting it may help it spring back.

, If your plant is dusty, you can use a soft cloth to gently remove dust. Alternatively, if it is a rainy day, it is OK to place the plant outside, which will help rinse off the dust.Make sure, though, that if the leaves get wet, they are able to dry out completely. A plant with water left on the leaves may rot or grow mildew.

, It is not a common problem, but Jade plants can become infested with bugs. If you notice a problem with small mealybugs on your plant, use a bit of rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab to gently wipe down the leaves of your plant.When looking for bugs, look for small, fluffy, white deposits on the leaves. These are a sign that there are bugs. Additionally, you can use a magnifying glass to identify red spiders, which are too small to see with the naked eye.Avoid using an insecticidal soap on your plant as this may damage the leaves.

You can purchase them online or at a local garden center.
If you already own a Beavertail cactus, you can make your own cuttings. To do this, choose pads (the flat, oval-shaped sections that make up a cactus) that are 6 months old or older and cut them at the base. In order to form a callous and prevent rot, cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry, dark place for 10 to 14 days.

,


Prepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with it. Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage.
Set the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch (2.5 cm.) deep. If you plant the cuttings too deep, they might rot.
Put some rocks around the pad to anchor it in place.

,


If you live in an area with strong summer sun, position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and south. This will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day.
Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds.

,


Do not water the cutting for the first month. The moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow. Too much water might cause rot.
After 1 month, roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time.
Always let the soil dry before you water the cuttings. Once fully rooted, they are extremely drought resistant.

,


During the spring, summer, and fall, the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer.

,


From the first pad, many more will form. The second or third pad will bear some flowers, but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests.

Buy saguaro cactus seeds from a seed distributor.,
Purchase saguaro cactus plants from a garden center.,
Buy a rescued saguaro cactus.,
Buy transported saguaro cactus plants from approved suppliers.",How to Buy Saguaro Cactus," Saguaro cacti reproduce through seeds, which can be harvested from the plant's red fruit. One saguaro can produce as many as 40 million seeds over the course of 175 years. Several online seed distributors sell saguaro cactus seeds, which are tiny black seeds about the size of a pinhead.


Choose saguaro cactus seeds as an inexpensive way to grow the plant. The seeds are typically available in packs of 20 for $2 to $5.
Be prepared for slow growth. The saguaro seeds will germinate in 3 to 10 days. However, the cactus grows only about 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) in 10 years. If you choose to plant a saguaro cactus from seeds, be prepared to wait decades to see the plant grow.
Consider desert dome kits. Several seed distributors sell saguaro desert dome kits, which include the seeds, preferred soil, planting instructions and an incubator dome. The dome protects the cactus during its germination and provides the ideal growing conditions for the saguaro.;
, Young saguaros, which typically range from 10 to 20 inches (25.4 to 50.8 cm), are available through Arizona-based garden centers and online distributors.


Choose young saguaro cactus plants as a moderately priced option. A 15-inch (38.1 cm) saguaro cactus usually costs about $50.
Select a healthy saguaro cactus. If buying the cactus in person, examine the plant. Make sure the cactus doesn't have signs of bruising, damaged spines or uneven growth. The soil should be gritty and well-drained. The plant should not have any visible signs of scaling from common cactus pests like mealy bugs.
Be prepared to transplant the saguaro cactus to another container or into the ground within a few weeks. Saguaro roots typically are about 4 to 6 inches (10.1 to 15.2 cm) deep and spread out underground in a distance equivalent to the height of the plant. The main root of the plant is about 2 feet (0.6 m) long (.6 m) and extends directly below the plant into the soil. If the cactus is not transplanted, the container will inhibit the plant's growth.
Select a protected location to plant the saguaro cactus. Young saguaros grow best under a ""nurse tree,"" which is a larger tree that protects the cactus from harsh sun rays and helps provide moisture. Once the saguaro cactus grows to a mature size, the nurse tree usually dies because the 2 plants are competing for sun and water.

, Cactus rescuers preserve hundreds of saguaro cactus plants that are threatened due to development. Rescued cacti usually are sold at local plant sales in Arizona. Depending on the size, the plants typically are sold for $5 to $500. Often the proceeds benefit public cactus gardens or school botanical programs.

, To purchase a large, mature saguaro cactus, consider having a cactus transported to you. Because saguaros can grow up to 50 feet (15.2 m) tall and weigh more than 4,000 pounds (1,814.4 kg), relocating the plant requires the work of a professional and trained team of cactus brokers and transporters.


Plan to spend between $500 to $2,500 for a large saguaro cactus.
Enlist the services of a cactus broker approved by the state of Arizona. There are stringent laws governing the sale and transporting of saguaro cacti. Make sure your cactus broker is compliant with the Arizona Department of Agriculture.
Ensure the team transporting your saguaro cactus has the proper equipment. A saguaro more than 4 feet (1.2 m) tall (1.2 m) requires the work of several strong people to transport it. A saguaro more than 6 feet (1.8 m) tall (1.8 m) requires the use of hydraulic equipment to transport it.
Hire experienced transporters. Moving such a large plant can result in injury to the transporters and to the cactus. Any damage the saguaro experiences during relocation, such as skin tears or cracks, will decrease the chance of survival in its new environment.
Mark the south-facing base of the plant. In order to thrive in a new location, the cactus should be transplanted with the same orientation.

This often occurs because the plant isn't getting enough light, so it grows taller and the leaves begin to space out to reach more light.A succulent with a long stem is called a leggy plant.
Take leaves from the bottom of the plant, and leave the younger and smaller growth near the top.;
, Your propagation attempt will have a better chance of succeeding if you start with healthy mother leaves. To find healthy leaves to propagate, look for succulent leaves that:Are uniformly colored with no discoloration
Aren't ripped or torn
Don’t have any spots or marks
Are full and plump looking

, The best way to remove a leaf for propagation is to gently remove it with your fingers. Grab a healthy leaf with your thumb and forefinger. Hold the leaf firmly but gently near the base, where it attaches to the stem. Twist it back and forth slightly, and delicately wiggle it back and forth until it comes off.Hold the leaf by the base to prevent breakage. The entire base of the leaf must come off the stem, otherwise it will die.

, After you remove the leaves from the stem, lay them out on a towel or parchment-lined baking sheet. Place them somewhere warm in indirect sunlight to dry. Leave them for three to seven days, until the wound heals and a callous or scab forms where the leaf was removed from the stem.


If you place the cut leaves in soil before the wounds heal, they will rot and die before they grow into new plants., Fill a bottle cap with some rooting hormone. Wipe the calloused end of the leaf with a damp towel to moisten it slightly. Dip the moistened end into the rooting hormone. Make a small hole in the potting soil, and immediately place the end of the leaf into this hole. Use your finger to pack the soil around the rooting hormone.


Rooting hormone is not necessary to propagate succulents from leaves, but it will decrease rooting time and increase the chances of success., Prepare a shallow tray by filling it with cactus or succulent soil or damp sand. Lay the leaves on top of the soil with the calloused end facing upward and away from the soil.


It’s important to use cactus or succulent soil, because these plants need well-draining soil to thrive.
You can also make your own soil mixture by combining equal parts sand, perlite, and potting soil., Most succulents are desert-dwelling plants, which means adults need plenty of full sun to thrive. But when you're propagating succulents from leaves, they need indirect sunlight until the new plant is established.Keep the leaf cuttings by a warm window that doesn’t get direct sunlight, or that’s protected by a tree or window shade.

, Rooting succulents need a bit more water than adults, but too much water will cause them to rot and die. Instead of watering, use a spray bottle to mist the soil every day. You just want the top of the soil damp.If you live somewhere with lots of humidity in the air, you may not need to mist the leaves at all while they're rooting.

, After about four weeks, the leaves will start to grow little pink roots from the cut. Sprinkle a thin layer of the soil over the roots to prevent them from drying out.Once the roots have been buried, they will continue to grow into a new succulent plant. When the new plant starts to create its own leaves, you can transplant it to its own pot.

, Eventually, the roots of each new plant will establish and the new succulent will start to form leaves of its own. The mother leaf that you used to propagate the new plant will wither. Gently twist and wiggle the mother away from the new plant. Be careful not to damage the young roots.


When the mother does wither away, it’s time to transplant each succulent into its own pot., Start with 2-inch (5-cm) pots with drainage holes in the bottom. Succulents do better in smaller pots than larger ones. Place a layer of pebbles in the bottom to allow for better drainage. Fill the pot the rest of the way with store-bought or homemade succulent mix.


The ideal medium for succulents is an equal mixture of sand, perlite, and potting soil.
You'll need one pot for every new succulent plant you’ve propagated.

, Make a hole in the center of the soil with your finger. Place a new plant into the hole and brush the soil over the roots to cover them.


It will take about a year before the new succulents reach a normal size. As they grow, you can transplant them into larger pots., Once the new plants are established and transplanted, stop the daily misting and switch to an adult succulent watering schedule. Let the soil dry out completely between watering, and only water when necessary.


When you water a succulent, give it a full soaking so the soil is thoroughly wet., After transplanting the new succulents, you can move them to a warm location that gets plenty of direct sunlight. South- and east-facing windows will get the most direct sunlight, as long as there are no obstructions."

Don't be frightened by natural ""corking"".",How to Grow a Cactus," When it comes to obtaining seeds for your cactus, you have two options: buying seeds from a gardening store or supplier or picking your own from a cactus that you already have at your disposal. Here, you are essentially choosing between price and convenience — store-bought seeds are cheap and pre-packaged, while self-picked seeds are free but require a little more work.


If you're buying seeds, you shouldn't have too much trouble finding them for sale. Many brick-and-mortar garden supply stores sell cactus seeds, while online shopping sites can allow you to effortlessly browse hundreds of varieties before ordering.
If, on the other hand, you want to pick your own seeds, start by finding the seed pods or fruits on your cactus. Usually, these are brightly-colored offshoots of the main cactus body which bear a flower. When the flower falls off, the pod or fruit is ripe and is ready to be harvested (assuming it has been pollinated).;
, Remove the pods or fruits from the cactus before they dry out. The pods should not be full of moisture but should still be damp to the touch inside. The seeds themselves, which are inside the pod or fruit can vary in appearance from cactus to cactus. Some seeds will be discrete black or reddish dots clearly visible from one another, while other seeds can be so small as to appear like sand or dust.









""Ripe"" pods with mature seeds should come off with a slight twist of the hand, leaving the interior fiber/cotton on the cactus. If the pod does not come off easily, it is not ready to be removed.

, Once you've removed all of the mature pods from your cactus, it's time to remove the seeds themselves from the pods. Begin by using a sharp knife to slice the tops off of the pods. Next, slice down one side of the pod to expose the seeds. Finally, remove the seeds by carefully scraping them from the inside of the pod.









Obtaining the seeds from tropical varieties of cactus can be different than obtaining the seeds from a desert cactus, but the general concept is the same — remove the fruit from the plant and open it up to expose the seeds. For example, the seeds of a Christmas Cactus, a type of tropical cactus, can be harvested by removing the blueberry-like fruit and squeezing or tearing it open to produce small black seeds., Whether you bought seeds or harvested them from an existent cactus, you'll want to plant them in clean, shallow containers filled with suitable soil. Moisten the soil thoroughly before planting but do not allow any standing water to remain. Next, spread the seeds across the top of the soil (don't bury them). Finally, lightly cover the seeds with a very thin layer of soil or sand. Cactus seeds only have a small amount of stored energy and if planted too deeply will not reach the surface before they run out.









Cacti require well-draining soil, especially desert varieties that are vulnerable to diseases from standing water. Try a mix of ⅓ compost, ⅓ horticultural sand, and ⅓ perlite.If the soil you use for planting hasn't been pasteurized (it should say whether or not on the packaging), you may want to consider heating it in the oven at 300o F (about 150o C) for half an hour. This kills any pests or pathogens in the soil.

, Once you've moistened the soil and planted your cactus seeds, cover the container with a transparent lid (like plastic wrap) and place it in a location where the seeds will receive a good amount of sun — a sunny window is a good location. Sunlight should not be intense and constant, but should be strong for at least a few hours each day. The transparent lid will retain moisture in the container as the cactus begins to sprout while allowing light to reach the cactus.









Be patient as you wait for your cactus to germinate. Depending on the species of cactus you are growing, germination can take anywhere from several weeks to several months.Tropical cacti are used to the shady environment under the jungle canopy and thus generally require less sun than desert cacti. You can usually get away with growing a tropical cactus in a brightly-lit spot that receives no direct sunlight. For instance, hanging pots under a shaded awning are a great location for tropical cacti.

, While desert cacti in their natural environment are routinely exposed to extreme temperature swings (from extremely hot during the day to extremely cold at night), tropical cacti enjoy balmy, consistently warm weather. Thus, it's a wise idea to grow tropical cacti in locations where they won't experience intense, direct sunlight during the day or chilly cold at night. Try to keep tropical cacti at a temperature of roughly 70-75o F (21-24o C) — greenhouses are great for this.









If you don't live in the tropics, you'll probably need to grow your tropical cacti indoors, where temperature and access to sunlight is much easier to control.

, In the weeks after you plant your new cactus seeds, your seedling should begin to germinate. Cacti typically grow fairly slowly, so this can take a month or more.Eventually, you should be able to see the first tiny emergence of your cactus's spines. When this happens, start giving your cactus a chance to breathe by removing the transparent cover during the day. As the cactus grows, you may leave the cover off for longer periods of time until the plant is well-established and no longer needs the cover.









It's worth noting, however, that this will increase the rate at which water evaporates from the soil. This means that you'll need to start watering. Try to do so cautiously — don't let the soil dry out completely, but don't ever leave standing water in the container from over-watering.
Note that many tropical cacti won't have spines, so in this case simply remove the cover once the seedling sprouts up through the soil.

, As noted above, cacti grow fairly slowly. Depending on the type of cactus you have, it should take about 6 months to 1 year to grow to roughly the size of a large marble.At this point, it's a wise idea to repot the cactus in a different container. Like most potted plants, keeping a cactus in a container that's too small for it can cause the plant to become nutrient-starved, inhibiting its growth and even killing it.









To repot your cactus, use sturdy gloves or a spade to remove the entire plant, roots and all, from its growing medium. Place it in a new, larger container with a the same type of soil, pack the soil around the cactus, and water.

, As the visible, above-ground portion of your cactus grows, its roots will as well. As your cactus becomes larger and larger, which can take years, it may need to be repotted multiple times. However, because the transplantation process can be stressful for plants, it's important that you allow your cactus to ""recover"" after each time you repot it. Instead of keeping the repotted cactus in a location where it receives a good amount of sunlight, try keeping it in a shaded or partially-shaded area until its roots re-establish. Gradually re-introduce the cactus to sun over a period of a month or so.








, Established cacti have less vigorous watering requirements than most other potted plants. Though they do require some water, their reputation as hardy desert survivors is well-earned. Most varieties of desert cactus require little water once they're fully established. Though individual species of cactus may differ in the amount of water they require, a good general rule is to let the soil dry out completely before watering. Depending on the temperature, this mean waiting a month or longer between waterings.









Remember that cacti experience slow, gradual growth. Thus, they don't need very much water. Watering more frequently than is necessary can lead to to problems for the plant, including root disorders that can cause the eventual death of the plant.
Tropical cacti are something of an exception to this rule, as they are naturally acclimatized to more humid environments than desert cacti. While you can get away with a little more watering if you have a tropical cactus, you should still wait until the soil dries out before each new watering.

, Though cacti grow slowly, their growth can be supplemented during the growing months of spring and summer with the light application of fertilizer or plant food. Cacti generally require less fertilizer than other plants — try using a dilute solution of liquid fertilizer once a month. Mix a small quantity of liquid fertilizer with an equal volume of water. Use this mixture to water your cactus every second or third watering.









The precise amount of fertilizer you should use can vary based on both the species of cactus you are growing and its size. Specific information should be on the fertilizer's packaging.

, One of the most common problems when it comes to potted plants is fungal rot (also called root rot). This affliction typically occurs when the roots of a plant are held in contact with moisture that is unable to properly drain, which becomes stagnant and encourages fungal growth. This can happen to most potted plants, but desert cacti are especially susceptible as they naturally require only a small amount of water compared to other plants. The best cure for rot is a preventative one: simply avoid over-watering in the first place. As a general rule, it's better to under-water than to over-water when it comes to cacti. You'll also want to use a good-quality potting soil with a high level of drainage for all cacti.









If your plant has rot, it may appear swollen, soft, brownish, and/or decayed, with the possibility of splits in its surface. Often, but not always, this condition moves from the bottom of the plant up. The options for treating rot after it has set in are limited. You can try to remove the cactus from its pot, cut away any slimy, blackened roots and any dead tissue above ground, and re-plant it in a new container with clean soil. However, if the damage to the roots is extensive, it may die anyway. In many cases, it's necessary to discard plants with rot to prevent the spread of the fungus to other adjacent plants., Etiolation is a condition in which a plant experiences pale, sickly growth because it is not exposed to enough light. Cacti with etiolated growth will often have a thin, flimsy quality and a pale, light-green color. The etiolated portion of the plant will grow towards a nearby light source, if there are any. While etiolation is permanent in the sense that any sickly growth that has already occurred cannot be reversed, future etiolation can be curbed by ensuring the plant receives a sufficient amount of sunlight.









However, you won't want to throw a cactus with etiolated growth into intense, direct sunlight immediately. Instead, gradually increase the amount of sun the plant receives each day until you notice that its growth has become normal. Exposing any plant to drastically increased sunlight can be stressful for the plant, while exposing an etiolated cactus to such levels of sunlight can be fatal.

, If you've ever noticed that you've gotten an especially-bad sunburn after being in water, you've experienced something similar to phototoxicity, a harmful malady that can affect your plant. After applying an oil-based pesticide to a plant, the oil from the pesticide remains on the surface of the plant, acting as a sort of ""tanning lotion"" by increasing the intensity of the sun's rays. This can cause the portions of the plant on which the oil is present to become burnt, grey, and dried-out. To prevent this, place the cactus in a shaded location for a few days until the oil-based pesticide has done its work before returning it to the sun.








, One aspect of the cactus life cycle with which most people are not familiar is the process of ""corking"", in which the bottom portions of a mature cactus slowly start to develop a tough, brown, bark-like exterior. Though this condition can appear serious because it replaces the natural green exterior with one that appears dead, it's not actually a sign that the plant is in any danger and can usually be ignored.









Natural corking usually starts at the base of the plant and can slowly creep upwards. If the corking starts elsewhere on the plant, this can be a sign of a problem. For instance, if the top of the cactus and the side facing the sun bear this weathered appearance but the base of the cactus does not, this can be a sign that the cactus is receiving too much sun, rather than the result of natural corking."

They have thick roots that spread out and require a wide diameter for proper growth. If your variety grows large and top-heavy, aim for a sturdy pot that won't tip over. Terra cotta is a good choice.


Make sure the pot has drainage holes at or near the bottom. If you're repurposing a container, avoid glass or other materials that you can't add holes to.
Varieties with roots that remain close to the soil surface will thrive in a shallow pot. Those with taproots that penetrate deeply into the soil require a taller pot. Read the care instructions that come with your plant (usually on a plastic tab that sticks in the soil) for details.;
, Look for cactus soil mix at your local garden center. Read the label to make sure it contains equal parts compost, horticultural sand, and grit. Double check that all ingredients are horticultural-grade., Invert the original pot and tap it gently to loosen the plant. Carefully clear the soil away from the roots using a chopstick or toothpick. Then, place the plant in the new pot. Use soil mix to cover the bottom of the plant to the same point that it was covered in the original pot.


Repot your succulent every year. The new pot should be slightly larger than the old one to allow for new growth., If you live in a hot climate, put your plant in a location that gets a few hours of filtered sunlight each day. In colder climates, six hours of full sun is acceptable. For indoor plants, rotate the pot at least once a day so that the entire plant receives sunlight.Don't put your plant in a south-facing window if you live in a hot climate. If you live in a cooler climate, test any south-facing windows for too much heat in the afternoon. The plant can literally become sunburned with too much sunlight.
If you have a “-veria” succulent, keep it out of the direct afternoon sun to avoid sunburn., The frequency of waterings depends on the variety of the succulent. Make sure the soil is moist at all times during the spring and summer months. Follow the care instructions for details specific to your variety.


Avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot., Like deciduous trees, succulents enter a dormancy phase during the fall and winter months. Allow the soil to dry completely before rewatering during this time. Depending on the variety, this can be as little as once a month.Some flowering varieties need more water than ones that don't produce flowers. Read the care instructions for details."

Revive an old tree log.,
Build a succulent bed.,
Shutter up your succulents.,
Connect old windows as a display case.",How to Display Succulents2," You may have a dead or old tree log sitting around your yard that you haven’t had a chance to remove. You may also live near a beach and find large and beautiful pieces of wood that have washed ashore. Filling old or dead logs up with your succulents can be a stunning way to revive the wood and display the variety of succulents you have.Make sure to let any old and/ or moist wood dry completely before creating your display. Hollow out the areas you want to fill. Replace the hollowed out wood with cactus soil and plant your succulents.

, Gardens and/ or terraces are great spaces to display your succulents. You can incorporate a succulent bed into your existing garden or create one using large and small plant potters.Decide if you want to use large potters or smaller pots. If you’re using a larger potter, plant several different types of succulents in it for visual effect. You can also plant succulents in smaller pots and arrange them vertically or horizontally in your large potter. You can also use old fountains, wheelbarrows, or other garden implements to display your succulents. Arrange smaller pots on the ground or using tables to display your succulents.Place succulents in existing flower- or plant beds. They are also a great way to separate different plant specifies within a bed.Consider adding or using existing water features near the succulents so they have a bit of humidity and add a calming effect for you.

, Much like indoor wall displays, you can also make outdoor versions using old shutters. Whether or not they are hanging on the side of your house or taking up space in your garage, repurposing your shutters can provide an easy way to frame and display your succulents.Add chicken wire to the back of any old shutters that are not hanging. Then fill the chicken wire with Spanish moss and cactus soil before nailing a board to the back of the shutter. Place your succulents between the slats of your shutter(s).
Fill in any hanging shutters as best you can with Spanish moss and cactus soil. Then add your succulents between the slats.

, If your own your home, chances are you have old windows in storage or hanging around your garage. Wiring or nailing the frames of windows together can provide you with a creative way to display your succulents in your garden or on your terrace.Construct your display case using three or four old windows. Make sure they are either nailed wired together for a stable structure. Nail a sturdy piece of wood to the bottom so that you can move your window display.
Fill the display with cactus soil, Spanish moss, and your succulent selection. These different textures provide a visually stimulating arrangement.

Use a large enough pot.,
Fill the pots with soil.,
Dig a small hole in the dirt.,
Transfer the seedling to the new pot.,
Pack the seedling in place.",How to Grow Bell Peppers Indoors2," ""True leaves"" refer to fully grown leaves, rather than leaves that are just beginning to grow.

, If you plan on keeping each pepper plant separate, a 2-inch or 4-inch (5-cm or 10-cm) pot should suffice. You can also combine multiple pepper plants into a single pot if it is larger.

, Use a loose, well-draining soil, preferably one with a high content of organic matter.

, The hole should be the same depth and width of the compartment your seedling currently sits in. If planting one seedling per pot, dig the hole in the center of the pot. If planting multiple seedlings in one pot, dig multiple holes that are at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart.

, Gently ""wiggle"" or pry it from the seedling tray by squeezing on the sides of the plastic compartment. Once the seedling has been removed, roots, soil, and all, place it in the hole.

, Pack the soil around the base of the seedling so that it is firm and steady.

Keep the peppers warm and well-lit.,
Water consistently.,
Test the pH.,
Pollinate the peppers when they flower.,
Harvest the peppers as they mature.",How to Grow Bell Peppers Indoors3," After transplanting, ideal temperatures range between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 27 degrees Celsius). Bell peppers also need plenty of light to grow. A sunny window may accomplish both requirements, but even the sunniest window may not be enough. Fluorescent grow lights generally work much better. Keep the lights no less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the top of the plant for 14 to 16 hours each day., Thoroughly soak the soil every few days, allowing the top of the soil to become just barely dry in between each watering.

, Bell peppers grow best in soils with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.Add ground agricultural lime to the soil if you need to increase the pH. Add compost or fertilizer to the soil if you need to decrease the pH.

, Using a cotton swab, gently rub pollen from the anthers on a male flower. Swab the pollen into a female flower, applying it onto the large pollen-collecting center stalk, called a ""stigma."" Pollinating the pepper plant will increase your yield.

, Once they reach a usable size and an appropriate color, the peppers should be ready to harvest. Use sharp, clean shears to make a clean cut, leaving a stem that is about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in length.

Cover the mouth of the jar with cheesecloth or clean pantyhose.,
Soak the alfalfa seeds for at least 12 hours.,
Drain the water.,
Rinse and drain the seeds again.,
Place the jar on its side in a dark location.,
Remove the jar every eight to 12 hours to rinse the alfalfa seeds.,
Move the sprouts into the sunlight.",How to Grow Alfalfa Sprouts1," You can find them at health food stores, feed stores, or on-line seed suppliers. Organic seeds are also available. Seeds come in packages as small as 8 to 16 oz. and sacks as large as 1 pound. If you're planning on eating a lot of alfalfa, it's cheaper to buy the seeds in bulk.;
, One tablespoon will yield 1 1/2 cups of alfalfa, enough to fill a jar and provide for a meal or two. Store the extra seeds in the original bag or in a sealable plastic container.

, Take the seeds you want to grow and place them in a fine-mesh sieve or on a piece of cheesecloth and rinse them thoroughly. Pick out any seeds that are broken or discolored.


Washing all your seeds at once will cause some to sprout before you are ready to use them. Only wash the seeds you plan to immediately sprout.

, Flat-sided jars work best because you can lay them on their sides to allow better circulation.

, Make sure the seeds are completely covered.

, This will keep the seeds in the jar when you drain the contents. Secure the covering with a rubber band.

, Keep the jar in a dry, warm place while you soak the seeds. The seeds don't need direct sunlight to sprout.

, Leave the cheesecloth or pantyhose in place and turn the jar upside down over the sink. The water will drain out, while the seeds remain inside the jar.

, Make sure all the water drains from the jar, so that the seeds don't rot.

, Good choices are a closet or pantry that provides a warm, comfortable temperature. Make sure the seeds are spread out across the base of the jar., Rinse the seeds with lukewarm water, thoroughly draining the seeds each time. Do this for three to four days, or until the seeds sprout to a length of 1 1⁄2 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm).

, Spread the sprouts in a thin layer on a platter or dish and put them in a sunny window for about 15 minutes. This will activate important enzymes that make the sprouts so healthy. Wait for the them to turn green. When the sprouts turn green, they are ready to eat. Store them in the refrigerator, which also slows their growth, for up to a week.

Identify common pests.,
Fight mealy bugs and aphids with insecticidal soap.,
Treat vine weevils with nematodes.,
Quarantine new plants.",How to Care for Succulents2," Mealy bugs, aphids, and vine weevils are the most common pests that succulents attract. Check for mealy bugs at the point where the leaf attaches to the stem. Look for aphids on leaves, stems, and flower buds. Watch for impaired growth or limpness, which is evidence of vine weevils or root mealy bugs.Mealy bugs are usually about 2 millimetres (0.079 in) to 3 millimetres (0.12 in) long and resemble lice. When they first attack, they'll leave balls of white fluff on the plant. When squashed, they leave a red stain.Vine weevils are large gray insects that resemble beetles. They lay their eggs in the soil in late summer, and their larvae have fat white bodies with brown heads.Aphids are about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) long. Their bodies are pear-shaped and can be black, green, yellow, pink, gray, or brown., Mix a few drops of soap in tepid water. If you have severe infestation, add a few drops of cooking oil to the mixture. Apply it to the affected areas with a cotton swab. You can buy insecticidal soap at your local nursery.For root mealy bugs, remove and discard of the soil. Dip the plant in water with a temperature of about 160 °F (71 °C). Replant the succulent in fresh, clean soil., Buy nematodes at your local nursery. Water them into the soil, where they'll attack the weevil larvae. Repeat the treatment according to the instructions on the package., Pests can “hitchhike” on plants fresh from the nursery. If you're already growing succulents, isolate the new arrivals for about two weeks. Check for pests and signs of disease daily.


After you plant your succulent in its permanent location, continue to monitor for problems at least once a week."

Purchase zone-appropriate varieties.,
Check the drainage of your soil.,
Buy native varieties, if possible.",How to Care for Succulents3," Succulents are available in varieties that can grow in agricultural zones as cold as Zone 4 and as hot as Zone 9. If you live anywhere between Zones 4 and 7, go for the sempervivum or similar variety. For Zones 8 and 9, opt for more heat- and drought-tolerant varieties. Before you make the final purchase, read the label on the plant or speak to an expert at your local nursery.If you're not certain which zone you live in, visit the website for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or non-U.S. equivalent for assistance., Succulents need soil with good drainage. Avoid low spots in the garden where water can pool. If your garden soil stays soggy for a long period of time, read up on how to improve the drainage., You'll have this advantage if you live in a dry climate. Native succulents have their own built-in defenses against pests in your area. They also invite local beneficial insects that could help in the growth and propagation of other plant varieties in your garden.Visit your state or provincial government website, university websites, or local botanical societies for assistance.

Refill the pan periodically for four to five days.,
Move the tray into the sun when the sprouts are 1⁄2 to 2 inches (1.3 to 5.1 cm) long.",How to Grow Alfalfa Sprouts2," Measure out 1 tablespoon of seeds, which will yield 1 1/2 cups of alfalfa. Store the unused seeds in a resealable plastic container or in their original bag.

, Place them in a fine-mesh strainer or a piece of cheesecloth and rinse them thoroughly. Sort through the seeds and remove any damaged or discolored seeds.

, Place the seeds in a glass jar. Cover the seeds with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of cold water. Cover the jar with a piece of cheesecloth secured with a rubber band. Place the seeds in a dark room and soak them for at least 12 hours.

, Pour the water through the cheesecloth, which will trap the seeds inside the jar and keep them from spilling down the sink.

, The type of tray that comes with a red terra cotta growing pot is perfect for this purpose. Spoon the seeds inside the tray and spread them out so that the evenly coat the tray.

, Choose a pan that's bigger than the tray, and set the tray inside the pan. Fill the pan with water so that it rises about halfway up the sides of the tray. Don't add so much water that it spills into the tray.


Place the tray and pan in a dark room to allow the seeds to sprout.
This method works because the clay tray will absorb water from the pan - just enough to moisten the seeds enough to help them grow. With this method, no rinsing is required.

, Check on it every and fill it when the water evaporates. The clay tray will continue absorbing water and keeping the seeds moist, helping them to sprout.

, Put it in a sunny window for about 15 minutes. They're ready to eat when they're bright green."

Hull the alfalfa.,
Use the alfalfa.,
Store the alfalfa.",How to Grow Alfalfa Sprouts3," The hulls are edible, but many people like to remove them for aesthetic reasons. To remove the hulls, place the sprouts in a bowl of water and irritate the sprout mass with your hands. The hulls will easily separate from the sprouts and rise to the surface of the water. Pour out the water with the hulls and save the sprouts., Alfalfa sprouts are a wonderful addition to any type of salad. They taste best when they're fresh from their last rinse. Simply chop or separate the sprouts and add them to your favorite salad recipe.


Sprouts are also great as a filling for sandwiches.
Sprouts are tasty inside a pita wrap.
Try adding nutrition to your standard burrito by wrapping some sprouts in with the beans and rice.

, Let the alfalfa completely dry after the last rinse - if you store it wet it will rot. Place the dry alfalfa inside a plastic storage bag and keep it refrigerated."

Save a good plant’s seeds.",How to Grow Artichokes," You’ll want to choose a type of plant and growing methods according to how cold it gets where you live. In short, if you live in a climate that has consistent winter temperatures between 10 °F (−12 °C) and 20 °F (−7 °C), plan to plant artichokes annually. If you live in a relatively warmer climate, you may be able to grow a perennial artichoke variety.If you live in the U.S., see the maps provided by the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service to determine what zone you live in. If you live in Zone 8 or higher – which corresponds with the temperatures cited above – go with an annual plant varietal.
These USDA maps also contain information on the temperatures used to assess an area’s zone, which you can compare to temperatures in your area.;
, There are several artichokes varietals, generally classified as either green or purple. Among the green varietals, go with “Imperial Star” artichokes for an annual plant and “Green Globe” for a high-producing perennial. Among purple artichoke options, “Violetta” may prove especially hardy, and “Opera” will mature especially quickly., Rich, fertile, moist soil is best for artichoke growth. That said, artichokes are hardy plants capable of growing in most soil as long as they are fed and the soil can drain. Consider building raised beds to assist in drainage if you live in an area with heavy rainfall. Plan to prepare soil with at least a hand’s depth of compost tilled into the ground before planting., You can maximize the growing season in your area by getting a head start with your artichokes indoors. Start your seeds in individual 4-inch (10.2 cm) containers and leave them under fluorescent lights or in a heated greenhouse. In normal indoor temperatures, seeds will likely germinate in a week or so. Increase the size of planters as needed.Begin exposing seedlings to temporary outdoor sessions six weeks before the anticipated last frost date in your area.

, Move seedlings outdoors 3 to 4 weeks before the anticipated final frost. You actually want to expose the plants to a temperature below 45 degrees to trigger flowering. They should be about as tall as your hand. Plant them with the crown of their root system just poking out of the dirt.Cull weak seedlings. After 8-10 weeks, healthy artichoke seedlings will have stocky stems and two sets of leaves. Remove any that do not.

, If you live in a place that only has 90-100 days a year without frost, you’ll likely need to start your plants with transplants. Plan to start growing your transplants indoors late in the winter or in early spring. Harvest will occur in late summer or early fall.Acquiring rooted shoots from a year-round greenhouse or online plant distributor is a great way to establish transplants quickly. If doing so yourself, use a serrated knife to begin cutting an offshoot under ten inches tall that’s growing from the base of the plant. Dig around the offshoot to ensure roots come with the offshoot as you remove it., If possible, 4 feet (1.2 m)-6 feet (1.8 m) between individual plants is even better. These plants have large, aggressive wingspans and require substantial room to grow. If using raised beds, artichokes don’t necessarily need their own beds, but do need ample space to spread their leaves., Condition soil with nutrients your plants can begin eating as soon as they’re in the ground. For each plant, work at least one shovel full of compost or aged manure into the soil. Alternatively, you can use one cup of high-nitrogen fertilizer. Add these food sources to the soil right before planting.Consider adding ½ cup of feather or blood meal as well as a ½ cup of bone meal to the soil as well, for added nutrients.

, Artichokes depend on a high-nitrogen diet in order to grow to their full potential. Provide 2 teaspoons of a nitrogen-based fertilizer to each of your plants about a month after they are planted. Give an additional 2 teaspoons of fertilizer to each plant every four weeks after that.Place or pour fertilizer just beside the plant’s stalk and irrigate to soak the fertilizer into the soil.
Side-dress each plant with (1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kilo) of aged manure just before you expect them to bud., Your plants require 1-1 ½ inches (4-5cm) of water per week. If this amount of water is naturally provided by rain, make sure you’re watering them accordingly. Water extra in the spring and summer to encourage the growth of larger, thicker buds.Make sure the soil around your plants is able to drain excess water. If the ground around the plant becomes water-logged, consider replanting in a raised bed.

, Watch out for upright flowering stems that are topped with flower buds. Most stalks will produce 3 to 5 buds. These will arrive in mid-to-late-summer. Remove the buds when the lowest scales (called bracts) on the bud begin to open. The bracts at the top of the bud will still be tight.Use a sharp knife, leaving a chunk of stem as tall as a credit card.
Wait for more buds. Put freshly cut buds in the fridge until you’re ready to cook them. Plan to harvest another crop of smaller buds if the growing season allows it.

, If you’re growing a perennial and hoping your plants will survive the winter, take steps to protect them. Cut the plant’s leaves back after it’s flowered and the season has concluded. Mulch heavily around and above the plant to keep the roots alive.Make sure the plants are covered by at least a hand’s depth of mulch. Cover mulch with another hand’s depth of straw or leaves for added protection.Perennials can usually be expected to stay productive for about four years. However, you can get a few more years of productivity by splicing plants before planting and replanting the portions separately.

, If you have a plant that’s especially hardy and returns year after year with quality buds, consider propagating it. The best way to propagate a perennial is to splice off one of the small offshoots as the plant first emerges in the spring. Establish the shoot as its own plant., Another way to propagate a particular plant is to collect its seeds. A long season, however, is necessary to allow seeds to ripen. If you live in a place with long summers, allow a large bud on your favorite plant to bloom, shrivel, and turn brown. Remove this dried flower and place it in a paper bag. Keep the bag indoors for two weeks, then shatter it and collect the seeds it disperses. Seeds regularly last for as long as six years!"

Use your foot to apply the appropriate amount of pressure it will take to separate a well-rooted rhubarb plant.

,
Dig a hole for each rhubarb section.,
Place a crown section into the hole, root section first.,
Fill in the remaining inch (2.5 cm) with soil.,
Plant rhubarb crown sections in the remaining holes.,
Mark the areas you have just planted with a stake or stick.",How to Divide Rhubarb Plants," The plant should be divided when it is dormant. In warmer climates, this may be mid-December or February. In colder climes, it may be dormant from late fall to early spring. Since the plant will no longer be producing stalks, it may be hard to spot, so be sure to mark the plant with a stake or stick, so that you can find it again.


If you live in an area with snow, it is best to do this before or after the ground freezes.;
, The soil may be cold at this time of year. Wear appropriate clothing that can be soiled.

, Since rhubarb can only be divided every 5 years, the roots should be firmly attached to the crown. You will need to break some roots under the crown with the fork.

, Each section must have at least 1 white or pink bud on it. You may need to look carefully before using the spade, in order to see the hidden buds.


A large rhubarb plant could be divided into up to 8 plants, as long as care is taken to include a bud and at least a small amount of root with each section.

,, The hole should be bigger than the rhubarb crown section.

, Make sure the top of the crown is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the top of the hole.

, Press it down with your foot to ensure that the crown is firmly planted in the soil.

,


Root pieces need to be properly protected if you are not planning to plant them immediately. They must not dry or freeze. Keep them moist and moderately warm.

, The rhubarb should start to sprout in early spring, when the soil warms.

Decide what to grow.,
Select a garden area.,
Design the garden.",How to Create a Vegetable Garden1," What vegetables do you like to eat? Think about which vegetables you'd like to eat this summer, then plan your vegetable garden accordingly. Most vegetables grow well in a variety of different climates, but it's a good idea to learn what grows best in your region's garden zone before deciding what to plant.Choose vegetables that can be harvested at different times. This way, you'll have produce all summer instead of all at once.
Some plants don't grow well in certain regions. Find out if the vegetables you want to grow require a cold snap to get started, or if they'll wither and die when the temperature gets too hot. You might have to be selective about what you grow if you live in a climate with very short summers or an area that doesn't get much water.
Choose plants with similar growing and soil conditions to make it easier to care for your vegetable garden.;
, Vegetables need strong, full sunlight, so choose the sunniest part of your yard to create your vegetable garden. Avoid areas that are shaded by your house or a tree during part of the day. Choose a spot with good drainage and rich soil.


You determine if an area has good drainage by checking it after a heavy rain. If a puddle forms, that area is probably not suitable for a vegetable garden. If the water seeps into the soil quickly, it should be fine.
Choose a flat area without roots and rocks. This will be much easier to till the soil to prepare the garden for planting.
If your soil doesn't have good drainage, you can create a raised bed which allows plants to grow above ground level.
Some vegetables grow well in large pots, too. If you don't have a yard, peppers, tomatoes and potatoes can all be grown in pots on a patio or fire escape.

, Now it's time to figure out how much space the garden should take up, and where to place vegetable plants. Different vegetable plants require different amounts of space. Figure out how much space you will need for the plants.


You need to know how much space to leave between the seeds or seedlings you plant, as well as how much space the mature plants will take up. Squash, zucchini and pumpkins take up a lot of space and produce a lot of fruit, while potatoes, carrots and lettuces stay relatively contained.Planting vegetables in rows helps you keep track of which plants are which.
Factor in extra space between the rows to allow you to walk into the garden to weed, fertilize, and water it, as well as to harvest ripe vegetables.

"
"
Buy seeds and supplies.,
A soil tiller.,
Get the soil ready.",How to Create a Vegetable Garden2," Choose whether to start your garden from seeds or sprouted seedlings. Purchase from a catalog or nursery. You will also need to determine which garden tools to buy. Gardening can be done by hand with simple tools, but a very large garden may require a tilling machine to loosen the soil.Here's what you'll need:


Seeds or seedlings. Nurseries have good selections of seeds and seedlings and staff who can help you decide which varieties to buy.
Fertilizer. A good natural fertilizer will boost your vegetable plants. Work bone meal, blood meal or fertilizer into the soil. Compost works well.
Mulch and topsoil. Vegetable plants need to be protected from wind and heavy rain when first planted. Use mulch or simply a fine layer of topsoil. You could cover the soil with loose hay to protect sprouting plants.

, This machine loosens dirt, allowing you to add fertilizer and dig holes for the vegetable plants. For a small garden, simply use a hoe, but for large gardens more than 10 square feet, you may want to buy or rent a soil tiller.


A shovel, a spade, and a garden rake. Use these essential gardening tools to dig holes and to move plants and soil.
A ruler or measuring tape. Vegetable plants need to be planted at different depths, so it's useful to measure the holes you make with a ruler.
A hose with an adjustable watering feature. The ability to change the water pressure comes in handy.
Fencing supplies. Rabbits, squirrels, deer and other animals like to nibble on vegetables, so you may want to construct a fence around your garden.

, Mark the corners of the garden area with rocks. Clear the area within the borders free of roots, rocks, sticks, weeds, and other large debris. Use the soil tiller, hoe or rake to break up the soil into small pieces, working it to a depth of about 12 inches (30.5 cm), depending on how deep your vegetables need to be planted.


Work fertilizer into the soil with a garden rake. Be sure to distribute it evenly.
Be sure to take the time to remove large rocks buried in the dirt. They'll get in the way of your plants' roots, and it's worth taking the time to clear the area.
If you're concerned about the quality of the dirt in your yard, buy a soil testing kit to find out how many nutrients and organic matter it contains, as well as its pH level. All of these factors affect the nutrition and growth rate of your vegetables. After you've tested the soil, you can add whatever it might be missing.

"

Dig holes and plant the seeds or seedlings.Use the spade to dig holes to the depths required by the various vegetables you're planting.,
Water the garden.,
Weed the garden.,
Keep critters away.,
Care for the vegetables according to their needs.",How to Create a Vegetable Garden3," Put a little fertilizer into each hole, then drop the seeds into the holes or gently place the seedlings into them. Cover the holes with topsoil and a layer of mulch, if required.

, For the first few weeks, while the vegetables take root, you need to keep the topsoil moist. Use the misting function on your garden hose to lightly spray the garden every day.


Check the soil often. If it seems to be dry, mist it again.
Avoid watering the garden at night. If water sits all night without getting absorbed or evaporating, it could cause fungus to grow., As the vegetables take and begin to sprout, take notice of non-vegetable plants that may also be taking advantage of the fertilizer and water you're providing. Grasp the weeds close to the roots and gently pull them out, then throw them away in an area away from the garden so their seeds don't spread. Be careful not to pull up newly sprouted vegetables.

, Before the vegetable plants begin to bear fruit, you might want to put up a fence to keep out the rabbits and squirrels. A short chicken wire fence usually does the trick. If you have deer, however, you might need to build something larger.

, Give the vegetable plants the amount of water, pruning, and fertilizer they require. Continue weeding the garden frequently as the vegetables grow throughout the summer. When it's time to harvest vegetables, pick only the ripest ones first and allow the others more time to grow.

Beets. Some varieties have dark green leaves and dark red stems. Beet greens can also be used as salad greens.







, For examples of flowering herbs, see Choose Herb Blossoms for Eating.

, They increase both the colour spectrum and the variety of flavors.

, Vegetables tend to be annuals (rhubarb, asparagus, and artichokes are exceptions), so you have an excellent opportunity to vary the vegetable display yearly and to experiment with displays that you like best. In long growing summers, you might even vary the display twice or more during the season.


Changing the look can also help with crop rotation, which will help keep your garden and soil healthy.







, In some climates, you can plant a succession of cool-season and warm-season crops in the same spot. Planting new plants in succession like this means that you will spend less time looking at empty spaces. It will also improve your overall yields.

, Because of the seasonal, temporary nature of most vegetables, you will probably want certain elements to anchor your garden when nothing is growing, or when plants are very small. Here are some elements that can help create permanent structure:


Raised beds may be created in a variety of shapes, heights, and patterns. Remember that you will want easy access to the contents of vegetable beds for weeding and harvesting.







Paths, patios, and lawns surrounding the vegetable garden are important elements of negative space. Correctly planned, paths also give you access to your garden without stepping in cultivated areas.







Trellises give your vegetables somewhere to climb, but they probably also persist in your garden during the off-season. Make them attractive, by themselves.






Permanent plantings. These may be trees (fruit trees or ornamental), perennial herbs or vegetables, or simply ornamental perennials. Whatever permanent plantings you choose, try to situate them so that they do not compete too much with your vegetables for light, water, or soil.







Fences, hedges and walls create a perimeter for the garden and they add color and structure. They may also support climbing vines, trellises, or espaliered fruit trees






Garden statuary, fountains, sundials, and other ornaments are often placed at the center of a formal garden layout. Include one or two to create interest, but don't overdo it. After all, you're growing vegetables, not statuary.







, Since you wish to look at it as well as cultivate crops, keep it clear of weeds, remove spent foliage and spent crops, keep things pruned neatly, and so on.

, You will still need to give everything adequate spacing.

Try to wait to sow crops until the last chances of frost have passed.,
Consider sowing your seeds indoors.,
Prepare the vegetable begs regardless of whether or not your sow your seeds outside.,
Protect your outdoor vegetables from pests.,
Place mulch over your vegetables when the harvest is over and the winter is coming.",How to Garden Vegetables in the Spring1," It’s usually a good idea to wait until all danger of frost has passed to sow your vegetables. Later sowings usually catch up with earlier sowings, so waiting to plant will most likely not hurt your harvest. Warmer months also soften up the ground, making it easier to work the soil and sow your vegetables.


Some crops, like carrots or peas, can be sown before the last frosts.;
, You can also start sowing your seeds indoors by placing a pot on a window ledge or in a greenhouse. Indoor temperatures provide a milder climate for young seedlings.


However, seedlings that are grown indoors will need to be “hardened off” (gradually adjusted to outdoor climates) rather than just being moved outdoors when the weather is nice.

, If you are sowing indoors, you can still prepare the outdoor beds in the early spring. To do this:


Weed the area and incorporate plenty of well-rotted manure into the soil.
Improve drainage if the area is soggy by incorporating some grit into the soil or raising the beds.
If you plan to plant perennial vegetables, you might incorporate a slow release feed such as bonemeal.

, Slugs and snails can present a serious threat to your seedlings and young plants. There are various methods you can use to protect your plants from these pests, including:


Laying pellets, setting traps, or surrounding your plants with barriers such as copper tape.
You can also check your plants for snails and slugs each day and remove these pests from your plants when you find them.

, Some plants will not produce their first year but will be ready to produce the next spring. If this is the case with your plants, protect them from the cold of winter by covering them in a thick layer of mulch. Brush the mulch aside in the early spring.


Plants that may not produce their first year include cabbage and asparagus.

Notice the color.,
Choose fiddleheads with tightly-coiled fronds.,
Check for a groove in the stem.,
Look around for spore sticks.,
Research different types of fiddleheads.,
Search in wet, wild areas.,
Pick the fiddleheads by the stem.,
Brush off any foliage clinging to the fronds.,
Rinse the fiddleheads thoroughly.,
Cook and eat the fiddleheads right away.,
Boil or steam fiddleheads to cook them.,
Incorporate fiddleheads into your favorite dishes.",How to Forage or Harvest Fiddleheads," Ostrich fern fiddleheads are most often a gleaming jade-green color. The fiddleheads that are ripe for eating will always be a bright green hue, though this may sometimes be hidden by a thin, brown, papery skin covering the outside of the stalk. Stay away from fiddleheads that have an inconsistent discoloration or appear dark and mottled, as these may be rotten.Keep a sharp lookout. The brown, scale-like skin of ostrich fern fiddleheads can make them practically invisible in dim, wooded surroundings.
Dark green fronds might be other types of fiddlehead ferns, like shield, wood, or lady fern, and may be unsafe to ingest.;
, The best fiddleheads will be smooth and firm to the touch, with coils that are wrapped tight and haven’t yet begun to sprout foliage. Inside the enclosed fronds there should be a bushy growth that will go on to become the broad leaves of the fern. Pass over fronds that are loose or beginning to unravel. This is a sign that they’re likely past their prime.Other types of fern fiddleheads exist that are inedible or even poisonous. These ferns usually have slightly different characteristics, such as bent, fuzzy tendrils or fronds in shapes other than spirals, though it can often be difficult to tell a difference.
Unless you’re certain that the fiddleheads you’re looking at are of the ostrich fern variety, you should not attempt to handle or consume them. Doing so may put you at risk of of serious illness., Along the inner edge of the stalk where it wraps into the coil, you should find a deep U-shaped depression, much like a stalk of celery. The groove is used to transport nutrients up through the stalk to the fronds of the mature fern. This is one of the key features that can tell you that what you’ve discovered is indeed a fiddlehead of the ostrich fern variety.Ignore fern fronds with flat, round or fuzzy stalks.
The stems of ostrich fern fiddleheads can be eaten along with the fronds. Just snip off the brown roots tips before washing and cooking them.

, Fiddleheads reproduce by spreading spores, which are located on long, brown sticks that poke out of the ground around the edible green stalks. They are ordinarily found near water or in marshy wetlands. The spore sticks tend to be tall, which allows them to be seen from a distance. If you happen to catch sight of these, it means there are fiddleheads close by.Fiddlehead spores use flowing water to reproduce, so be sure to check for them along the banks of any bodies of water you happen upon.
Scan for fiddleheads growing nearby in clusters of five to nine fronds., Ostrich fern fiddleheads are just one variety of fiddlehead green. There are many others, including some that may not be safe to eat or cook with. When you’re out foraging for fiddleheads, avoid similar plants that feature stalks or fronds of different shapes and colors. Though these may not be harmful to ingest, it’s better not to take the chance.Pay close attention to pictures and descriptions of ostrich fern fiddleheads to avoid confusing them with other types of inedible ferns.

, Ferns love moisture, and for this reason you’ll typically find clusters of wild fiddleheads springing up near the banks of rivers, lakes and streams in cold, wet climates. You’ll often be forced to travel well off the beaten path in order to come across a crop of fiddleheads. This just makes finding and picking a big handful of them more fun.In North America, the funny green stalks usually begin to poke up around April, May and early June, and they aren’t around long before they grow into lush adult ferns.Fiddleheads are a fairly common sight throughout various parts of Maine, Alaska, New Zealand, Canada and even Southeast Asia.

, To harvest fiddleheads, simply grab them down low on the stalk and pluck them free in one quick motion. You can also use a pair of sharp scissors to snip the fiddleheads from their stems if you’re harvesting a lot of them at one time. The stems themselves should be tough and have a bit of give—if they’re brittle, there’s a good chance they’re dead or diseased.Go after the fiddleheads that are still standing. Never pick loose fiddleheads up off the ground.
Leave at least one or two fronds intact, or the plant will die., When you’re seeing fiddleheads for the first time, you’ll probably notice that they’re partially covered with a kind of brown, scale-like husk. This fibrous material should be removed prior to cleaning and eating the fiddleheads. Just run your fingers down the length of the stalk and fronds to brush away the flaky skin.Soaking the fiddleheads in lukewarm water can help loosen tough, fibrous skin.
This outer shell is not harmful to eat, though it may get stuck in your teeth or cause textural issues.

, Like any other freshly-picked vegetable, you’ll want to wash the fiddleheads before you consume them. Place the fiddleheads in a strainer and run them under a stream of cool water to clean away dirt, insects and any remaining bits of brown skin. Pat the fronds dry with a paper towel, cut away the stalks and they’re ready to go in your favorite recipes!You can also soak the fiddleheads in a bowl of water for 5-10 minutes for a more thorough cleaning. Soaking may reduce the vegetable’s crunchiness, however.
Rinse the fiddleheads as soon as you bring them home, even if you don’t intend to eat them immediately.

, Fiddleheads are best enjoyed while they’re fresh. This is when they’ll have the crispiest texture and the brightest, most intense flavor. The curled fronds of the fiddleheads are the part that are most commonly devoured, though the stalks are also edible. Freshly-picked fiddleheads are a fleeting delicacy that can only be savored during spring’s wet season.Shortly after being picked, fiddleheads will begin to lose their color, flavor and crunch.
Wrap uneaten fiddleheads in plastic and place them in the produce drawer of the refrigerator to store them. The tasty fronds will keep for a week or two in cool, dry places.

, Submerge a bundle of fresh fiddleheads, stalks and all, in a pot of boiling water to soften them, or steam them in a pressure cooker for 10-12 minutes. Their flavors can vary depending on their age, freshness and growing conditions, but are generally similar to green beans, asparagus and other green stalky vegetables.The fiddleheads will darken slightly when they're done. Avoid overcooking them, as this can make them mushy.
Cooking with high heat is necessary to eliminate bacteria and trace amounts of toxins contained in the plant. Fiddleheads should never be eaten raw., Find creative uses for fiddleheads in recipes where you would ordinarily use green beans or asparagus, or simply serve them on their own to highlight their unique flavor and appearance. The crunchy greens can be cooked whole with butter or oil and offered as a side, chopped up and added to soups and pasta dishes or chilled and used to top a spring salad.If you don't plan on serving them right away, you can preserve the fronds and make them even more flavorful by pickling them in apple cider vinegar with salt, black peppercorns, mustard seed, allspice and garlic.Make fiddleheads a staple in your fresh springtime cuisine before they're gone for another year.

Understand what ‘planting out’ refers to.,
Help your plants to “harden off”.,
Plant your indoor plants in your outdoor vegetable garden when the soil has gotten soft.",How to Garden Vegetables in the Spring2," ‘Planting out’ means moving your indoor potted plants to outdoor vegetable beds. The process involves transferring pot grown seedlings, or ones grown indoors or under glass, to the outside garden or vegetable plot. You can start planting out vegetables in early spring but it’s usually better to wait until later springtime when the frosts have passed.


Your plants will be slower to grow in the cooler temperatures so there’s little benefit in putting them out earlier in the season.

, If you’ve sown vegetables indoors, give them some time to adjust to life outdoors by ‘hardening off’. This process lets your plants acclimatize to the moving air, different humidity, and temperatures of the outside world. When you simply place these types of plants outdoors without going through the hardening off process, their development can be detrimentally affected. To harden plants off:


Move plants sown inside your home to a cooler space such as an unheated greenhouse. You can leave your plants outside during the day but bring them in at night.

, You can make your life much easier—and your plant’s life more pleasant—when you plant your vegetables when the soil is easy to work with. Avoid gardening if the ground is still cold and hard.

"
"
Be aware that there are some vegetable plants that you can ‘quick crop’.,
Consider planting beetroot.,
Try growing quick crop salad.",How to Garden Vegetables in the Spring3," Quick cropping is when you sow very fast growing vegetables and harvest them within a few weeks time. The cooler temperatures in Spring will often mean they aren’t as fast as they could be later in the year but some will be available for harvest in only a few weeks.


These include beetroot, radishes, kale and more unusual varieties such as kohlrabi, rocket and bok choi.
In some cases you will only be able to harvest the baby versions of these vegetables after this amount of time.

, Beetroot can be planted in late winter but grows faster when it is planted in mid-spring. Some varieties will be ready for harvesting about 90 days from sowing, especially if you start them off under cloche or fleece protection.

, Quick cropping salad leaves, like rocket, can be grown and harvested within a few weeks. You can cloche-protect late summer sowings of rocket for cropping through the winter and into spring. Otherwise sow in spring and expect to crop baby leaves within four or five weeks. for cropping baby leaves within 4-5 weeks.Lamb’s lettuce (corn salad) is more slow growing but can be planted in November for spring greenery. Winter sown lettuces need protecting from cold wind (a polytunnel works well).

Go for leafy greens like arugula, spinach, kale, and lettuce.,
Choose root vegetables like beets, radishes, and potatoes.,
Try vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and celery.,
Go for endives, garlic, and peas.",How to Choose Vegetables for a Shade Garden1," These leafy greens do well in light to partial shade. They may not grow to full height or have large, fat leaves, but they will still taste good. Often, leafy greens grown in the shade have a less bitter taste.Other leafy greens like chard and mustard greens also do well in light to partial shade.;
, Root vegetables often flourish in the shade, as they do not require a lot of direct sunlight to grow well. In addition to beets, radishes, and potatoes, root vegetables like turnips, carrots, and parsnips also do well in light to partial shade., These vegetables do well in light to partial shade. You can also try vegetables like rutabagas, sorrel, watercress, and Brussels sprouts in a garden with partial to light shade. They are all cruciferous vegetables., These vegetables flourish in the shade, as they do not require direct sunlight to grow well."
"
Pick leafy herbs like basil, mint, and parsley.,
Go for chives, rosemary, and lemon balm.,
Try herbs like horseradish, garden cress, and valerian.,
Grow catnip in the shade.",How to Choose Vegetables for a Shade Garden2," Certain herbs can flourish in light to partial shade, particularly leafy herbs like basil, mint, and parsley. Herbs that grow in the shade tend to have a less bitter taste and a longer growing period, meaning you will have access to these herbs for longer throughout the year., These herbs do well in light to partial shade. You can grow them in pots in the shade and move them to sunny areas periodically if they start to wilt., These herbs can handle the shade. You can also try growing lesser known herbs like angelica, chervil, costmary, lovage, sweet flag, and sweet woodruff.

, If you have a cat at home and are looking for a cheap, healthy treat for your cat, try growing catnip in the shade. Catnip is easy to grow and maintain in a backyard garden with light to partial shade."
"
Start crops indoors and then move them outdoors.,
Arrange the garden by shade-tolerance.,
Paint nearby walls and fences white.,
Move crops into the sun if they start to wilt.",How to Choose Vegetables for a Shade Garden3," To encourage good growth, start crops indoors in planters and then move them outdoors once they have germinated. This will help the seeds germinate quickly and make growing the crops outdoors in the shade less painstaking.


You may also want to keep certain crops in planters so you can move them to sunnier areas in your garden later. Leafy herbs like basil or leafy greens like kale may do better in planters so they can be moved if need be.

, If you have an existing garden and want to plant vegetables in shadier areas, organize them by shade-tolerance. Put vegetables that need direct sunlight in the sunny spots and then plant vegetables and herbs that do well in partial to light shade in these spots in your garden. This way, your garden is organized based on what will grow best in sunlight and in the shade.Do not try to plant vegetables or herbs that require full sunlight in shady spots, as they will not grow well.

, To attract more light in shady spots in your garden, you can try painting nearby walls and fences white. This will help to reflect sunlight on the garden on hot, sunny days.Have light colored paving on driveways or sidewalks next to the garden can also help to reflect sunlight onto the garden’s shadier spots.

, If you notice certain vegetables or herbs starting to wilt in the shade or if they do not appear to be growing at all, try moving them to a sunnier spot. You can try replanting them or move them in planters to a spot with direct sunlight in your garden.Most shade tolerant vegetables and herbs will do well in the shade and do not need to be moved. But if you notice certain crops are not doing well, you can try exposing them to sunlight to get them to flourish.

Does an area tend to be especially wet or dry? The hot, south side of a building or fence will benefit a very different set of plants than a low, wet spot in dappled shade.;
, It will help with the watering if plants with similar water requirements are nearby.

, A large number of identical plants invite more pests and diseases than a variety of different plants.


Your garden is a great place to experiment with more than just a couple of veggies.
Squash, melons, cucumbers, pumpkins, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, peas, beans, and corn are all fairly easy plants for beginners.
Asparagus and artichokes are perennial plants. Properly cared for, they will return year after year.
Fruit trees, grapes, and different sorts of berries also grow year after year.
Herbs, such as basil, rosemary, oregano, and thyme can be used to season your other plants.

Many flowers, including chives, hibiscus, fuchsia, roses, and nasturtiums, are also edible. Try garnishing your next salad with some nasturtium blossoms.

, There is no point in growing rows of radishes if you don't like radishes.

, A single zucchini seed can keep a moderately sized household busy all summer. Another zucchini seed can survive nicely for a year on a shelf in a cool, dry place. A good rule of thumb is to aim for at least five meals' worth of any given crop. If something was a great success, you can always plant more next season.

, If you are planting the same thing from one year to the next, plant it in a different location. Try a different variety, too. It helps to keep pests and diseases from doing too much damage.

, Dig in plenty of compost or manure. It takes work, yes, but it improves the structure and fertility of the soil. It also improves the drainage characteristics.


If you choose to add chemical fertilizer, do so in moderation. Over-fertilizing can burn plants and encourage rapid growth that makes plants susceptible to disease and pests.
Consider building a raised bed, especially if the soil you have is very poor or doesn't drain well.

, Know your climate and the requirements of your plants. Seed packets and catalogs can help. Don't plant cold-sensitive seeds too early in spring and don't plant cool season crops at the height of summer. Some crops may never grow well (or at all) in your particular climate, so read the instructions and experiment with various things.

, Take a garden shovel and make a line that stretches across the garden. Sprinkle the seeds into it and lightly cover over them. Depending on the seeds, you can also poke holes at intervals.



Read the seed package or other instructions specific to your crop. Seeds need to go at different depths and spacings.
Try hills or clusters. If this is a garden you'll be looking at, you could even interweave foods with flowers.
Know which seeds will transplant and which won't. Starting your seeds in pots can help you get a jump on warm weather or simply get them off to a healthy start.

, If you start with a seedling from a nursery, take a good look at that seedling before you bring it home. It does not need to be large (in fact, smaller seedlings may become better established in your garden), but it should not be root bound and it should be free of diseases and pests. Don't take it home if it isn't in good condition.

, Unless you're getting plenty of rain, that probably means at least daily until the seeds sprout and for the first few weeks until roots are established. After that, it depends upon your climate and the crop.


Over-watering can drown plants or lead to ""damping-off"" in seedlings.
In dry climates, a generous application of mulch can help to keep water in.
A drip system or soaker hose can spare you having to wander around with a hose. Remember to put it on a timer or at least set a timer so you don't forget to turn it off.

, Many seed packets encourage you to plant extra seeds and then thin them.

, Beans and peas and grapes certainly require support. Tomatoes prefer it, and many squashes and melons can grow up a trellis to save space.

, Start about 5 days after they sprout they should be about 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) tall. You can add a bit of bagged fertilizer to plenty of water, use a slow-release fertilizer according to package directions or, if you prefer the organic approach, you can top-dress the garden with more compost. Remember, don't over-fertilize. It can scorch plants and cause excess growth at the expense of health and production.

, A weed is any plant growing where you don't want it, and it might very well include plants that you want someplace else in your garden, such as poppies, mint, or ivy. Weeds in your food garden will compete with your plants for water, light, and nutrients.


Hand pull weeds close to your garden plants.

Hoe the weeds. Try a scuffle hoe. Its blade slides back and forth near the surface of the soil, chopping off the tops of weeds without disturbing too much underneath. Even weeds won't make it if you chop off their tops too many times.
Try to pull or cut weeds before they go to seed and make more weeds for next season.
Apply mulch, especially on pathways and areas away from plants. A thick mulch slows the growth of weeds and makes it easier to pull what does grow.
Use weed killers in moderation (if at all). The surface of the soil doesn't need to be spotless all summer, and organic controls are best. Some weeds are growing resistant to chemical herbicides. No weeds withstand pulling or repeated hoeing.
Add weeds that haven't gone to seed to your compost pile or let them dry out and use them as part of the mulch in your beds. Weeds that you remove from your garden remove nourishment with them.

, Since this is a food garden, you will probably want to take it easy on the chemicals.


Keep the garden healthy. Most plants naturally resist disease and pests if properly cared for. That means enough but not too much water, adequate spacing and light, and proper nourishment in moderation.
Rotate crops from one year to the next.
Don't demand perfection. Don't worry too much if a couple of leaves or fruits get chewed on.
Remove and do not compost leaves, plants, or branches at the first sign of disease. You can often halt the spread of diseases, fungi, and the like.
Water in the morning, especially if excess moisture is a problem. If your schedule only permits evening and you have not automated watering, water the ground and leave the foliage dry, or water early enough in the evening that the leaves can dry fully. Check the moisture level before watering.
Invite beneficial creatures. Wasps, bees, birds, bats, spiders, ladybugs, ducks, and many other creatures can all help to keep the insect population in check, but only if they themselves are not threatened by your other controls.
Use traps targeted for problem pests. Place an upside-down flower pot near your garden or prop up an old board on sticks or other supports. Check it after dark and crush and remove any snails or slugs hiding there. Try insecticidal soap (you can make it yourselfor neem oil as less toxic alternatives for garden pest control.

, This is why you grew the garden, wasn't it? Besides reaping the rewards of your efforts, harvesting makes many plants produce longer.

, Some plants ""come true"" (produce a plant similar to the parent) and some don't. In general, you can save seeds from heirloom and other non-hybrid varieties, but look it up, if you aren't sure. Saving your own seeds saves yourself having to buy as many for next year.

, Depending on your climate, you may be able to get a cool season crop in on the way to winter (or even during it).


Clear warm-season plants that have died back.
Clean up the garden. Dropped fruits and dead foliage can harbor diseases and pests from one season to the next.

Overwinter perennial plants.
Prune plants and plant bare root starts while things are dormant.

Make sure that your garden box will be able to drain.,
Add grit to soil that doesn’t drain well.,
Weed the area where you plan to put your garden bed.,
Add fresh topsoil to stop weeds.",How to Build Vegetable Garden Boxes1," Do not put garden boxes on surfaces that will not absorb the water that runs through your garden box. For example, tarmac and concrete are not ideal surfaces for a garden box.


If you plan to place the box on a surface that was previously turfed, remove the turf by peeling it back with a spade.;
, If drainage is a real problem, such as if puddles form easily after rainfall and don’t quickly drain away, consider incorporating plenty of horticultural grit into the ground to improve drainage.

, If weeds are persistent in the area, try to eliminate them before you build your garden bed. You can lay some horticultural weed-resistant fabric; this will allow water to drain away, but won’t allow weeds to grow through the fabric.


Alternately, lay several layers of old newspaper or cardboard on the surface of your soil. These materials will help to smother weeds.

, If you have a serious weed problem, consider removing the top 30 inches (76.2 cm) of soil and replace it with fresh topsoil. After doing this, place weed control fabric in the area where you plan to place your box.


You can also use chemical weedkillers. Read the manufacturer’s label if you choose to use chemical weedkillers.

, Purchasing an oak sapling 2 to 4 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in diameter is less complicated and requires less maintenance.

, Determine the tree's expected mature height to ensure that the tree won't grow into power lines or other overhead obstacles. To be sure you have enough space, consider the size of the canopy, which is the diameter of the tree at maturity. Before choosing an oak, consider the tree's moisture, sun and soil requirements to ensure that your soil and climate can sustain the tree.

, Use a soil pH test kit, available at home and garden stores, to determine what kind of soil is in your planting area. Check the area where you will plant the tree to determine how much sunlight it receives. These factors will help determine which type of oak is best for your site. For example, a live oak will require well-drained, loamy or sandy soil, and at least 4 to 6 hours of sunlight.

, Bur oaks, also called majestic oaks, are slow-growing, 80-foot tall trees with an 80-foot spread. The trees are often used as ornamentals or as windbreaks, especially on farms.

, Sawtooth oaks have moderate water needs and tolerate salty soil, but not alkaline soil. Sawtooth oak tree provide good shade, as the canopies spread 40 to 60 feet (12.2 to 18.3 m) and mature height of the tree is up to 60 feet (18.3 m) tall.


Gobbler sawtooth oak trees are similar to sawtooth oaks, but provide smaller acorns that are eaten by wild turkeys.

, Search the Internet for nurseries that sell and ship oak trees. Reputable dealers will provide you with the description and growing conditions for the tree, zone information to ensure you are buying the right tree for your locale, shipping information, and a guarantee of the quality of tree.

, Some people consider the northern red oak a specimen tree. Specimen trees have various qualities that set them apart from ordinary trees. In the fall, northern red oak foliage ranges from yellow-brown to bright red. Red oaks grow up to 2.5 feet (76.2 cm) per year for 10 the first 10 years. At maturity, the trees reach 60 to 75 feet (18.3 to 22.9 m) tall, with a 45-foot spread.

, Pin oaks are one of the most widely used trees in landscaping, as the trees have moderate water requirements and do well in a range of soils. Lower branches of pin oaks die as the tree ages, as sunlight cannot reach the branches.

, White oaks, which produce large numbers of acorns, thrive in moist, well-drained, acidic soils. White oaks range from 50 to 80 feet (15.2 to 24.4 m) tall, with an equal spread.

, Willow oak is a popular tree for residential properties, streets and parks. Willow oaks grow about 2 feet (60 cm) per year up to a mature height of 60 feet (18.3 m) tall with a 35-foot spread. Willow oaks tolerate drought, standing water, salty soil, heat and pollution. Water needs are moderate.

, The tree grows 80 feet (24.4 m) tall with a canopy measuring 80 feet (24.4 m) in diameter. The live oak is a majestic tree that stays green year round.

Look at trunk diameter when choosing trees.,
Select fruit trees with straight trunks.,
Avoid trees with low branches.,
Choose trees with crowns of branches spreading out uniformly all around.,
Examine the trees' roots.",How to Buy Fruit Trees2,", The fruit trees that establish quickest generally have trunks with diameters ranging from 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to 5/8 inch (1.6 cm).

, Trees with crooked trunks are more likely to topple when burdened with fruit or during windy weather.

, These make it difficult to walk beneath the trees at harvest time. Low branches also make lawn maintenance difficult and offer easy perches for animals that will eat the fruit., There should be clearly defined leader branches growing in the middle.

, Choose fruit trees with abundant roots that appear healthy and free of injuries.

Get sturdy timber.,
Consider buying a kit to make your garden box.,
Get four pieces of timber to build a square or rectangular box.,
Purchase your fittings.,
Consider using repurposed items to make a unique garden box.",How to Build Vegetable Garden Boxes2," You’ll need pieces of sturdy timber to construct your boxes. Make sure the wood has been pressure treated or preservative has been applied to it. This will help your garden box to last longer.


If you are using reclaimed wood such as railway sleepers, check that they are plant safe. Some wood can be contaminated with chemicals that will negatively affect plants.

, These kits consist of pre-measured lengths of wood and all the fixings you need to fit them together. The kit also may only include just the fixings.


If you purchase only the fixings, you’ll need to source the wood yourself.

, If the planks aren’t wide enough to provide enough depth to the boxes, you may wish to double up and make your box out of two planks stacked together on each side.

, If you aren’t using a kit, you’ll need to source your own fittings. You can either use chunky posts, which will sit within the boxes so that you can nail into them at right angles, or metal fixings such as right angled brackets. Get four (or eight, if stacking planks to make a deeper box) of whatever fixing you use.


You’ll also need some nails to fit your fittings, and a drill or manual screwdriver.

, You can also make garden boxes using bricks or construction blocks. You can also repurpose old items to make garden boxes. These include old bed frames or furniture such as wooden chests of drawers. You may need to drill drainage holes in some of these repurposed items. You can purchase woven willow walls or use metal sheeting, sandbags or logs to make the walls of your garden box.


Just make sure that whatever you use is water resistant.
Wooden items will probably need to be treated with wood preservative to prolong their life in the garden.

Begin by marking out the area where you plan to place your bed.,
Cut your boards.,
Drill the boards into place.,
Add weed-resistant material.,
Fill your garden box with topsoil.,
Plant your garden.",How to Build Vegetable Garden Boxes3," You can use spray paint to do this, or use string tied to pegs inserted into the ground. If you are using posts, insert these into the four corners of your bed.

, If you are cutting your own boards, cut them to fit the size of your box. You won’t be sinking them into the soil so the width can be the same as the height of the bed.

, The simplest way to make the beds is to drill the boards directly into the posts.


It may be helpful to have a second person to help you hold the pieces in place while you drill.

, Once your box is constructed, line it with weed-resistant material and screw or staple this material to the sides of the box. This allows water to penetrate but weeds and burrowing animals won’t be able to get through the fabric into your garden box.


You can also line the box with several layers of old newspaper or cardboard.

, Add topsoil or a mix of compost and topsoil so that the layer of soil is about two inches from the top of the box. Press the soil down gently.


Your level of soil may shrink after you water the soil. The soil will also settle over time, so you may need to add more topsoil.

, Once you have added the topsoil, plant your garden with whatever vegetables your heart desires. Add a layer of mulch around your plants to keep weeds down and to help your plants retain moisture in their roots.

Consider which vegetables grow best in your climate.,
Choose vegetables that grow well where you plan to plant them.,
Determine how much time you are willing to invest in your vegetable garden.,
Choose vegetables that you and your family enjoy or ones that you wish to try.",How to Choose Vegetables to Grow,"

A good way to ascertain if a vegetable is suited to your area is to look at a zone map and chart to identify the zone in which you live. Then you can check a zone chart to find out which vegetables grow best in your zone. Zones are numbered 1 to 12 and are based on the average minimum temperature in an area.



 


Some vegetables grow best in warm conditions and cannot tolerate frost. These include snap beans, corn, cucumbers, melons and peppers.






Vegetables that grow best in somewhat cooler weather and can tolerate short periods of frost include beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, lettuce, spinach and sweet peas.






Perennial vegetables like asparagus and rhubarb can be harvested year after year if they are planted in the right area.





;
,

Some vegetables prefer bright sun, while others prefer some shade. Learn the preferences of the vegetables you are interested in planting in order to find the proper placement for them in your garden.






Some vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers, grow well in pots. Others, such as carrots and beets, need to be planted in the ground. If you are planning to grow vegetables in pots on your porch, these and other root vegetables are probably not a good choice.







,

Some vegetables only need weed control to thrive. These vegetables need less care and take less of your time than other types.






Some vegetables, such as peas and tomatoes, need staking or a fence or trellis. Consider the time needed to stake or build supports for these vegetables.






Some vegetables are more likely to be infested by pests than others. Consider the amounts and types of pest control you are willing to use in your garden.







,


Many vegetables have a deeper flavor when they can be picked at the peak of ripeness and aren't transported very far. You may be surprised to find that your family and friends find they enjoy homegrown vegetables that they do not enjoy when they are bought in a store.
Many varieties of vegetables that are not commonly available in grocery stores can be grown in your garden. Vegetable gardening is a way to expand your eating choices.

Determine whether it's time to trim.,
Determine the health of the palm tree.,
Select pruning equipment.,
Select climbing equipment.,
Get protective gear.,
Consult a professional.,
Sterilize your pruning tools.,
Set up your climbing gear.,
Remove dead or damaged leaves only.,
Pull off loose petioles (blades) from the fronds.,
Prune flowers or developing fruit from the palm if your particular species is the flowering type.,
Discard of pruned fronds, petioles and fruit properly.,
Wait a year (or longer) before trimming again.",How to Trim a Palm Tree," Though experts recommend avoiding pruning as much as possible, there are some circumstances that call for a trim. Start by determining if you really need to prune. And remember, the less pruning you can do, the better. Prune to remove dead or dying fronds
To remove potential fire hazards, especially near buildings or homes
To increase visibility and safety near driveways or sidewalks
To prevent damage to buildings or homes during high winds
To remove fruit, seeds and flowers
Never prune for purely cosmetic reasons or else you risk damaging the palm tree.;
, Unless they are a hazard to people or property, palms only need to be trimmed when fronds (leaves) die or are broken, or when the tree begins to flower or bear fruit.









Look for dead or dying fronds on the tree. Dying fronds appear brownish, yellow or white and are often wilted or hanging down.
Look for potassium deficiency in your palm tree. Potassium deficient palms typically have yellow spotting on the oldest leaves. A potassium deficient palm tree should not be trimmed because this would result in additional fronds losing nutrients and turning yellow. If your tree is potassium deficient, supply the tree with additional potassium and wait at least a year to trim.Look for broken fronds which should be removed before they are torn off and cause damage to the tree.
Look for palm flowers and fruit stalks which use up energy and slow the growth of the tree.
If there are no dead or dying fronds, broken fronds, flowers, or fruit stalks, your palm tree doesn't need to be trimmed.

, There are a variety of pruning tools that can be used to trim your palm tree. Consider the size of your tree to determine which tool you need.A serrated knife can be used to cut off fronds that are less than 1 inch in diameter. A knife is also useful for removing flower stalks from the tree.
Large clippers or pruning sheers can be used to remove fronds slightly larger than 1 inch in diameter.
A hand saw or pruning saw will make it easier to remove thicker, larger fronds from the tree.
A chainsaw can be used to cut very large, very thick fronds, but extra precautions should be taken to ensure you don't hurt yourself or the trunk of the tree.

, Palm trees can grow to be very tall. The equipment you'll need to reach the fronds will depend on the height of your tree.








Step stools or a small ladder can be used for shorter trees.
Extension ladders can be used to trim trees up to 15 feet (4.6 m) in height.
A bucket lift or cherry picker should be used to trim very tall trees.
Climbing gear should be used by trained professionals only, and climbing spikes or cleats should never be used as they can damage the trunk and spread disease.

, Gardening gloves and safety goggles should be used when trimming your palm.Palm fronds usually have very sharp spikes along their edges. Gloves will help protect your hands.
Sawing and cutting sends small pieces of debris flying. Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes.

, Palm trees can grow very tall and large, spiky fronds can be unwieldy. If you're dealing with a tall tree or do not feel comfortable using the equipment it's best to consult a professional.









Look for someone with experience trimming palm trees.
Make sure whoever you hire does not use gear that could damage the tree, such as climbing spikes or cleats.

, Pruning tools can spread disease from one tree to another. All of your pruning tools should be sterilized before you begin trimming your tree.








Wipe any dirt or debris from your pruning gear.
Sterilize the tools by placing them in a solution of 1 part bleach to 3 parts water.
Take chainsaws apart and soak both the chain and bar.
Let tools soak for 5 minutes.
Rinse tools with clean water and allow them to air dry before using.

, Before you scale the tree, make sure the climbing gear you are using is secure and stable.









Check that your ladder, step stool or cherry picker is stable and that any climbing equipment you are using is secure.
Ensure the tree is not being bent, punctured or otherwise damaged by the climbing equipment you are using. If you damage the trunk of your palm while pruning, the tree may not heal.

, Removing healthy fronds robs the tree of important nutrients and can result in slow growth, the spread of disease and the death of the palm.









Mature fronds are found below the current year's growth. It's important to leave at least two rows (or more) of mature fronds.Begin at the bottom of the foliage and look for dead, dying or broken fronds.
Use your pruning gear to remove dead or broken fronds from the trunk. Cut each frond at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the trunk. Cutting too close to the trunk can damage the tree.
Remove green fronds only if they hang at an angle below a line that is 90 degrees, or parallel. to the ground. Don't prune fronds that are above this horizontal line as it can weaken the tree.Never cut off the top, or crown, of the palm. The crown will not grow back and the tree will die.
You do not need to prune self-cleaning palms such as King palms, Kentia palms, Jubaea palms or Chamadoreas. Their leaves fall off naturally as they die, making trimming unnecessary. If it is only necessary to trim a self-cleaning palm because of potential safety hazards. Trim dead fronds or the oldest fronds only.

,


Take the loose petiole (blade) between your fingers and pull gently. If the petiole does not come off easily, leave it.

, Palm flowers and fruits take energy and nutrients away from the tree, attract pests, and create hazards for people walking below.


Cut fruit and fruit stalks from the fronds or trunk and remove flower growth by hand.
Fruit stalks and flowers should be removed as soon as they are visible.

, Place fronds in a trash bin made for organic waste. Palm tree fronds tend to have sharp needle-like protrusions that can prick those who handle the waste.


Continue to wear gardening gloves as you clean up debris.
Pick up any fallen fruit, flowers or seeds. Pests that can harm the tree are attracted to dropped seeds and fruit. Fallen fruit can also stain concrete and produce unpleasant odors, and the seeds can germinate in undesirable places.
Consult your local waste disposal service department to find out how and where to dispose of palm debris.

, Palm trees do best when left alone. Green fronds produce all of a palm tree's food. Keeping them around is integral to maintaining the health and strength of your tree. For that reason, you should never take off more leaves in one year than the tree can produce in that time.

Examine the sunlight conditions.,
Check the soil.,
Contact your local extension office or a professional arborist.",How to Buy a Flowering Cherry Tree1," Cherry trees prefer full sun, except in extreme southern areas, where they can tolerate partial late afternoon shade.;
, Test your soil if you are unsure of its type. Flowering cherries are adaptable to different soils, but prefer well-drained, loamy soil. They thrive best in a neutral or slightly acidic soil, between 6.2 and 7.0. Use a soil pH testing kit to determine your soil's makeup.

, A tree specialist in your area will have knowledge about the local growing conditions and if they are best suited for flowering cherries. They will also be able to help you choose the best type of cherry tree to buy.

Phone your local garden centers and nurseries and inquire about the types of cherry trees they carry.,
Buy online.",How to Buy a Flowering Cherry Tree2," Discuss your planting scheme with the professionals at the nursery or garden center prior to shopping there. Once you decide to buy, have the salesperson help you pick a healthy tree.

, Try websites such as arborday.org or naturehills.com, which offer a variety of plants and trees available for shipping with guarantees of quality. Reputable online nurseries will provide descriptions and growing conditions for the plants and trees, and should also provide detailed shipping information and prices.

Inspect the cherry tree once it is purchased.",How to Buy a Flowering Cherry Tree3,"


Check the roots. Saplings with a root ball should have lots of root growth, but the ball should not be broken. Potted trees should have adequate root growth, but not so much that the roots encompass the outside of the container. The roots and soil should be joined together, and the soil should be moist.
Examine the trunk and branches, especially in mature trees. Look for healthy bark that is bright in color. Avoid leggy and spindly top branches, and look for well-developed leader branches (those coming from the top of the trunk).

Select a variety of branches for pea staking.,
Place your twigs around the bush.,
Make sure twigs are placed against the bush.,
Adjust your stakes over time.,
Remove twigs.",How to Stake up a Bush or Tree1," Pea staking involves the use of dead branches as natural stakes. This style of staking works best for bushes with a spreading growth habit. Head out into the woods and find a few branched twigs that have a solid main branch.This method of staking can add some pizazz to your planters or garden beds if you come across colorful branches, such as dogwood.;
, Stick the thickest end of your twigs down into the ground 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) deep so they won’t blow over in the wind.


This is a good method for giving bushes some guidance while growing or for fixing a bush that has sustained damage and needs support., Place twigs near parts of the bush that need extra support. You’ll want to have the twig make physical contact with the bush since you will not be tying your bush to the twig.Place twigs around the entire bush if you’re wanting to guide its growth or place them selectively if you’re just fixing a few areas that are damaged.
Since your twig will have many branches, it’ll help naturally support the weight of your plant and help guide its growth.

, You may need to replace your branched twigs over time if they decompose. You should also be proactive in moving them as your bush grows, so as not to stunt growth.You’ll know to move your twigs when the bush begins overtaking them in growth. Simply move the twig out a little bit further from the plant.

, So not to weaken your bush, you should remove the supports once your bush has reached maturity or no longer needs the extra support."
"
Select one bamboo or wooden stake.,
Insert the stake on the windward side of the tree.,
Locate the primary branch.,
Tie the primary branch to the stake ⅔ of the way up the stem.,
Remove the stakes after one growing season.",How to Stake up a Bush or Tree2," A single stake method works best with a bare root tree, or a tree that was dug out of the ground when leafless and that had all of its soil shaken from its roots. Select a bamboo or wooden stake for small and medium sized trees or if you’ve got a larger tree on your hands, use a metal stake.Select an angled stake if you’re concerned about letting your tree have room to flex and build up its own strength.
Select a tall, straight stake if your tree is top heavy., Dig a hole 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) deep about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the base of the primary branch on the windward side of the tree, or the side with the prevailing wind. If planted on this side, your tree will pull away from the stake instead of rubbing against it.If you’re doing preventive staking, place your stake in the ground before you plant your tree. This will prevent damage to the roots of your tree if you accidentally hammer your stake into them., Once your tree has been planted, look for the primary branch that supports the most growth. This is typically near the center, but if you have a tree that has split down the center, there may be 2 primary branches.

, Using a material with a flat, broad surface, such as elastic or a cord inside of a rubber hose, tie the branch to several locations on the stake for firm support. You should use a figure eight loop to tie the branch to the stake in order to prevent the stake rubbing up against the stem.Take care not to use a tie that is a bare cord or wire as these will cut into the tree and damage it.

, After one growing season your tree’s root system should’ve spread out enough to fully support the tree without additional help from stakes. Remove the stakes and save them to reuse on another tree or bush.


You could always leave the stakes in place after removing the ties. Then you’ll have a barrier to protect the tree from lawn mowers."
"
Gather two or three wooden stakes and broad, smooth ties.,
Drive the stakes on sides equidistant from the tree.,
Attach the ties ⅓ of the way up the stem.,
Remove the stakes after one or two growing seasons.",How to Stake up a Bush or Tree3," The double/triple stake method is useful for trees with balled or burlapped roots to prevent it from rocking back and forth in the wind. You’ll need 2-3 stakes of the same size. They should be roughly ⅓ of the height of the trunk. Acquire 2-3 ties that are broad and smooth for attaching the tree to the stake., Place your stakes at an angle about 15–18 inches (38.1–45.7 cm) from the trunk on opposite sides. Make sure that the stakes are buried deep enough in the ground that they do not give when pushed against.This will help to keep the tree stable in poor weather and storms.

, Attach each tie about ⅓ of the way up the stem so the tree will have some flexibility to give in response to the wind.You want the tie to be firm, but with some give to it.

, Make sure to remove the stakes after one growing season. If the tree’s root system moves in the soil when you remove the stake system, leave it in for an additional season."
"
Select stout stakes and strong wire.,
Drive the stakes angled away from the tree.,
Tie the wires on the canopy stem.,
Remove the stakes after one or two seasons.",How to Stake up a Bush or Tree4," Guying a tree is used for larger trees, such as deciduous trees. Guying anchors are shorter and stronger, and so you’ll need 3-4 stouter wooden stakes. You’ll need to gather wire and padding for the wire around the tree as well.Since you’ll be using shorter stakes, make sure you mark them with bright paint so no one will trip!, You’ll want to place the stakes equidistant from the tree’s stem below the edge of the tree’s canopy. Make sure they’re at an angle away from the tree for maximum support., Attach the wire tautly, but not restricting all movement, from the tree to the stake. You’ll tie the wire around the stem above the first set of branches, also called the canopy stem. Be sure to use padding, such as a rubber hose, to protect the tree stem., If the tree’s root system seems firmly anchored in the ground, remove the guying system after one growing season."
"
Dig around the roots.,
Cut up the roots.,
Pull out the roots.,
Remove the stump.,
Fill in the hole.",How to Remove Tree Stumps1," Use a shovel to dig next to the stump, exposing the roots underneath the surrounding dirt. Move around the circumference of the stump and continue digging until you've exposed all of the largest roots around the tree. Dig deep on either side of the roots to expose them as much as possible.


If the roots seem very large and deep, and it's difficult to completely uncover them, you might want to consider a different root removal method. The digging method works best when you're able to uncover the roots almost to their tips.;
, Depending on the size of the roots, use loppers or a root saw to cut them into pieces. Cut them into manageable pieces and pull what you can out of the ground. Toss them into a pile as you go, clearing away as much of the root system as possible.









Using an ax to cut the roots is possible, but not recommended because it can shatter dangerously if it strikes a rock, and it will usually end up stuck between roots if they are not completely exposed.

, Use a grub hoe to wrench the remaining embedded roots out of the ground to their very tips. If you need to make more cuts as you go, do so — it will make pulling them out of the ground easier. Keep going until you've removed all of the major roots, then go back and pull out anything that's left.








, After all or most of the roots have been processed, you should be able to easily dislodge the stump. You may need to use the shovel to dig underneath the stump and cut a few more roots under it before you can get it out.









Now that all the wood has been removed, you can chop it up and add it to your compost pile.

, The final step is to fill up the hole with loam or sawdust. If you fail to do so, the ground around the hole will collapse and you'll have a large dent at that spot in your yard. As the loam or sawdust settles, the ground will sink in a bit, so you may need to keep adding material to the area every few months before the ground will stay flat.

Locate a stump grinder.,
Position it over the stump and start grinding.,
Shovel out the grindings.,
Fill the hole.",How to Remove Tree Stumps2," This machine grinds up stumps and their root systems to a depth of about a foot beneath the ground. Stump grinders can be rented from machine rental houses by the day.If you'd prefer not to operate the machine yourself, you can hire someone to come to your property with a stump grinder and do the job for you.


You should wear gloves, goggles and ear protectors if you plan on operating the machine yourself.

, Following the manufacturer's instructions, position the stump grinder and turn it on. It will grind the stump's surface and work its way down into the ground to grind up the roots. You'll need to move the stump grinder around the circumference of the stump in order to take care of the aerial roots as well.








, The ground will repair itself more quickly if you remove the ground up wood. Shovel it out and put it in your compost pile or dispose of it in another way.








, Replace the grindings with loam or sawdust to fill the hole. Continue adding matter to the area as it depresses over time.

Find out if it is legal to burn the stump.,
Build a wood fire on top of the stump.,
Keep the fire burning.,
Shovel out the ash.,
Fill the hole.",How to Remove Tree Stumps3," There may be restrictions in your area for open fires, especially if you live someplace with draught conditions. Before you begin, call the local fire department to make sure it's okay to burn your stump.

, It might be handy to use the chopped-up tree you just cut down as fuel to burn a fire on top of the stop. Lay out the wood on top of the stump. Surround the stump with more wood, so that the stump will be at the center of the fire.








, It will take several hours to burn the stump. Keep adding more wood so that the fire stays large and hot. Keep it burning for as long as it takes for the stump to alight and burn down to the ground.








, After the stump has burned, shovel the ash out of the hole and discard it.








, Replace the ash with loam or sawdust. Keep adding matter to the area when it sinks every few months.








"
"
Drill holes in the stump.,
Apply the stump remover.,
Keep children and animals away from the stump.,
Monitor the stump.,
Chop it up.,
Burn the rest.,
Replace the ashes with loam.",How to Remove Tree Stumps4," Use a drill with a large bit to drill a series of holes in the top of the stump. The stump will absorb the chemicals through these holes, so make sure you space them evenly.








, Most stump removers are composed of powdered potassium nitrate, which reacts with the wood to soften and rot more quickly. Check the directions on the package and apply the stump remover to the stump as instructed.







, If the stump removal powder is ingested, it can cause harm to kids and pets, so make sure they don't go near it.

, It should begin to soften and rot within a few weeks. When you deem it to be soft enough to easily remove, it's time to finish the job.








, Use an ax or a shovel to chop up the softened stump. Remove pieces as you chop them away. Keep going until you've leveled the stump.








, Build a fire over the remaining softened wood and let it burn all the way down. This way you'll remove what's left of the stump and its roots.








, Dig out what's left after the fire has burned and discard it. Fill up the hole with loam or another filler, like sawdust. Keep adding more material over the next few months until the ground stays leveled.

Select the variety of palm you want to plant.,
Opt for a small, medium, or large palm depending on budget, aesthetics, and maneuverability.,
Choose the location for your palm.,
Do not dig a hole or drive vehicles where underground utilities can present hazards in the location you choose.,
Maneuver the tree close to the location you will be planting.,
Dig your hole so that it's at least six inches wider on all sides and six inches deeper than the plant’s existing root ball.,
Remove the root ball cover (usually burlap or plastic) to expose the roots.,
Ease the tree into position, making sure the top of the root ball is slightly lower than the level of the adjacent ground.,
Straighten the tree.,
Backfill the hole barely covering crown.,
Stake the tree to keep it standing, if necessary.,
Water the tree thoroughly.,
Hold off on fertilizing the palm for six to eight weeks after planting.,
Keep the tree watered as often as necessary until it is established, if the soil is gravel and sand it will need more watering.",How to Plant a Palm Tree," Palms vary in size from relatively small Windmill and Sago Palms, to giants like Royal Palms and Queen Palms which, when grown, may tower fifty feet in the air. The amount of sunlight palm trees require, as well as the amount of cold they tolerate, also depend on species. Consult a listof some common palms used in landscaping, and their sunlight requirements and cold tolerances:


Warm weather palms:


Cuban or Florida Royal Palm. Cold tolerant to 22° F (-5° C); full sun to partial shade.

Sago Palms. Cold tolerant to 20° F (-6° C); filtered sunlight to full sun.

Canary Island Sate Palm. Cold tolerant to 19° F (-7° C).

Queen Palm. Cold tolerant to 18° F (-7° C); full sun.


Cold weather palms:


Mexican Fan Palm. Cold tolerant to 15° F (-9° C).

Cabbage Palms. Cold tolerant to 12° F (-11° C); full sun.

Pindo Palm. Cold tolerant to 10° F (-12° C).

Chinese Windmill Palm. Cold tolerant to 8° F (-13° C); full sun.

;
, What size palm you select will depend largely on just three things:

Budget: Small palms cost less, big palms cost more. Small palms can cost as little as $100 while big behemoths can cost thousands of dollars.
Aesthetics: Do you want to watch your palm grow, or do you want it to immediately fit into your landscape? Mature trees cost much more than immature trees.
Maneuverability. Starting with mature palms is expensive, sometimes so big that they need to be trucked and craned into the site.If you're trying to plant in a location where maneuvering big trees is going to be hard, you may want to opt for a smaller one.

, Because large palm trees are extremely heavy and you may need to use heavy equipment during the planting process, it's best to look for an area that is easily accessible. Planting on an even, low slope in the front yard will be much easier than planting on a steep grade or in the back.

, Check into the property plat plan. See city or county permits, maps and utility plats, and call your local utility for locating service to be sure of routing of underground utilities, if there is any doubt. Hitting an underground water, natural gas, petroleum, power, or telephone line can cause real problems, liability and unnecessary headaches.

, This will make digging the hole the proper size much easier, since you can measure the root ball of your tree and compare that to the hole as you dig. Some palm trees can be buried above their root ball.


For example a Mexican Fan Palm (Washingtonia robusta) can be buried 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) deeper than the original top of the root ball. This can be advantageous when you are trying to match all trees to a specific height. It would also eliminate the need for bracing.
Do not bury the root crown (top of the tree ball) or trunk of any other palm trees; please consult with a certified arborist prior to planting if you have any doubts about how deep your palm can be planted.

, Then put 6 inches (15.2 cm) of sand in the bottom of the hole. With a tape measure, determine the width and height of the palm's root ball and then dig accordingly.



Try a quick drainage test, if where you're digging the hole is poorly drained clay or has much exposed rock or stone ledges. Dig a hole 16 inches (40.6 cm) deep, in soil with normal moisture, then fill it with water (extremely arid, dry or wet/soggy soil is not able to give a good test result). If it drains within an hour or two, you have excellent drainage. If it drains within 12 hours, you have acceptable drainage. If it hasn't drained after 24 hours, you have a drainage problem, and you probably shouldn't plant at that location without fixing it first.
Be sure that the hole is deep enough to barely cover the top of the palm's root ball, but not so deep that the trunk can be drowned and rot. Exposed top of the tree's root crown is good -- but grading soil up to and exposing the root ball is a no-no. Palms with exposed root balls are said to be “on their tiptoes,” and are less stable. On the other hand, palms planted too deeply risk rot on their trunks, also destabilizing them, causing disease and rot.

, Avoid shaking the soil from the roots any more than necessary, since this will allow them to dry and cause the delicate, hairlike feeder roots to die. Also avoid splaying the root ball before planting; although it may seem like you're giving the roots room to breathe, this process actually does more to hurt the root ball than help it.

, Typically, the top of the tree's root ball should remain only 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) below the ground when the tree is seated and the hole is filled all around (backfilled).

, Palm trees often have curved trunks, so the plant may not be plumb (vertical) when you finish the project.


Also make sure to find the front side of the palm, e.g. the side that has been given the most sunlight. Depending on your preference, you'll probably want the sunny side of the palm facing a spot where you can enjoy it. If the palm is in the front yard, that probably means facing the street; if it's in the backyard, that probably means facing the house.

, Fill the hole with a washed plaster-grade sand backfill, watering as you go. The sand backfill will ensure good drainage plus provide rigidity so you may not have to brace the tree.

, Palm trees do not have large tap roots that support it, so they must be temporarily braced to keep them standing until their roots become established. That is, unless you are using the washed plaster sand backfill. This normally provides enough rigidity to avoid using braces.


Wrap the trunk at least 1/4 up the tree's height with a 16 inch (40.6 cm) wide piece of burlap to keep the bracing board cleats from chaffing the bark when the tree tries to sway in high winds.
Drive stakes on three sides, equidistant apart around the tree's circumference, and fasten lumber support braces (2X4 treated lumber will work) to blocks of wood secured to the trunk with tie wire, placed over the burlap.

, You may want to create a small earthen dam around the root ball to keep the water from shedding away from the tree's roots while you water, particularly if the tree is on a hillside or in soil that doesn't absorb water easily. Mulching the base of the tree will also help to keep the soil moist. Use about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of non-compacting mulch.

, Remember, transplanting your palm tree already poses a shock. Unfortunately, adding fertilizer poses another shock. To minimize the shock your tree might experience and maximize its chances of thriving, don't fertilize until six to eight weeks after planting.

When you do decide to fertilize, remember to use a slow-acting fertilizer, and hold off placing the fertilizer directly near the trunk. Place the fertilizer one or two feet around the trunk of the tree to avoid over-fertilizing.

, The establishment period will depend on the type of tree, its size, and whether it was a container plant or a wrapped root ball specimen. Generally, the roots should be watered thoroughly, but not flooded. Watering daily for the first few weeks, weekly for the following few months, then tapering off the watering is a normally suggested schedule.

Maintain your avocado tree.",How to Plant an Avocado Tree1," Cut into the avocado carefully, so as not to injure the pit, which is in the fruit's center. You can do this by scoring the skin/fruit about ½ an inch (1.3 cm) deep all the way around the outside, and then twisting the two halves in opposite directions to open it. Carefully remove the pit and set it aside.


So that you don’t waste the fruit, use the avocado meat to create the tasty dip/topping known as guacamole.;
, Wash the avocado pit gently to remove all the flesh. Use warm water and your hands, and avoid using soap. Be careful not to remove the seed cover which is light brown, as this may destroy the pit and make it less likely to grow.








, Holding the pit ""narrow"" (pointed) side up, stick four toothpicks into the middle section at even intervals, just enough to give a firm hold. This will allow you to balance the pit on the inside of a cup, without completely inserting it into the cup.









The pit should sit in about 1 inch of water, so keep this in mind when inserting your toothpicks.

, Add some water to a small, slender container (preferably glass) until it reaches the top rim. Your container's opening should be wide enough to accommodate the full width of the avocado pit easily; however, make sure that it is not too wide, otherwise the toothpicks will not be able to reach and the pit will fall in.








, The toothpicks should sit on the rim of the container, leaving 1 inch of the pit only submerged in the water. Make sure the pointed end is up and the rounded end is in the water, otherwise your avocado will not grow.








, Set the avocado-topped container in a temperate, undisturbed place — near a window or any other well-lit area to begin rooting and the growth process.








, Do this to ensure that contaminants (i.e. mold, bacteria, fermentation, etc.) do not hinder the avocado's sprouting process. Ensure the base of the avocado always remains moist and submerged in water.








, Over the next two to three weeks, the avocado's brown outer layer will begin to dry out and wrinkle, eventually sloughing off. Soon after, the pit should begin to split open at the top and bottom. After three to four weeks, a taproot should begin to emerge at the base of the pit.







, Take care not to disturb or injure the taproot. Continue to allow the avocado pit time to establish its roots. Soon, the avocado will sprout at the top, releasing an unfolding leaf-bud that will open and begin to grow a shoot bearing leaves.








, Avocado trees are very particular in terms of their ideal climate and growing conditions. Most of the time, avocado trees should be planted in a pot, and moved around to meet the changing weather. Avocado trees prefer a temperature of 60 – 85°F (15.6 – 29.4°C), and established trees can handle temps as low as 28°F (-2.2°C).







, Avocado trees can grow in soil at almost any pH level, but it must be low in saline and have plenty of drainage. The soil does not need to be heavily fertilized until after the tree is about 1 year old. At that point, you should conduct a soil test to find out what nutrients are available








You may want to use a 10-10-10 fertilizer twice a year to help the tree out. In general, you can use regular potting soil and add some rocks to the bottom of the pot to aid in draining excess water., Use a 20 – 25 cm (7.8 – 9.8 inches) terracotta pot filled with enriched soil to 2 cm (.8 inches) below the top. A 50/50 blend of topsoil and coir (coconut fibre) usually works best, but make sure you check the soil where you're planting to ensure this is the right blend. Smooth and slightly pack the soil, adding more soil as needed. Once the soil is prepared, dig a narrow hole deep enough to accommodate your avocado's roots and pit.








, When the tree reaches 6-7 inches in height, prune it back to 3 inches. When leaves have re-grown, you are ready to plant. Remove the sprouted pit from the water container, and gently remove each of the toothpicks.








, Carefully bury the avocado pit in the soil such the top-half of pit shows above the surface of the soil. This ensures the base of the seedling trunk doesn't rot under the soil. Pack the soil lightly around the pit.








, Water your plant daily or enough to keep the soil moist. Avoid over-watering to the point the soil becomes muddy. If the leaves turn brown at the tips, the tree needs more water, while if the leaves turn yellow, the tree is getting too much water and needs to be permitted to dry out for a day or two.







, Continue to tend to your avocado plant regularly, and in a few years you will have an attractive and low-maintenance tree. Your family and friends will be impressed to know that you cultivated and grew your own tree from an avocado pit salvaged from your guacamole recipe.

Do you want to add a couple of trees to your property to give it greater curb appear and increase the value of your home? Or maybe you just want the pure enjoyment of seeing the tree grow and invite wildlife such as birds to sit on its branches. Knowing what you want in planting a tree will help you make the best decisions about everything from what kind of tree best suits your needs to where to plant it.;
, You’ll need to think about the weather in your local area before planting a tree to make sure that you get a species that will survive and thrive in your garden or yard. Using the Plant Hardiness Zone scale can help not only identify your local climate, but also the best types of trees to plant.


The Arbor Day Foundation offers a system of identifying climate for plants called the Plant Hardiness Zones. It divides the United States and Canada into 11 different zones that are based on a 10 degree Fahrenheit difference in the average annual minimum temperature.The United States, for examples, is located within Zones 2 through 10.You can access the Plant Hardiness Zones at http://shop.arborday.org/content.aspx?page=zone-lookup and then lookup the zone in which you fall.
Knowing your zone will help you identify the types of trees and other plants that you can plant and expect to grow in the zone’s temperature extremes.Know that the Plant Hardiness Zones don’t account for local differences including moisture, soil, winds, and other conditions that could affect the survivability of individual plants., You’ll also want to consider the terrain on your property before you plant a tree. Factors such as slope, neighbors, drainage and erosion can have an impact on what trees will thrive on your land.









For example, if you live on particularly hilly or steep land, it may not be a good idea to plant trees because their roots may not be able to take proper hold.
If you’re planting a tree or trees to combat erosion, you’ll want to plant trees that already have a strong root ball so they don’t get swept away at the next rainfall or windstorm.
Think about what kinds of other trees and plants are there so that the tree you plant not only fits in with the overall aesthetic scheme, but also that the tree has room to grow and won’t kill other plants and trees around it.

, Most communities will have zoning laws about trees and digging holes on properties within its borders. It’s important to check these laws to make sure that you are able to dig and plant trees. If not, the community may not only prevent you from planting the tree, but also force you to pay fines. .


Zoning laws related to planting are often related to digging holes near telephone and electric poles and other cables. You'll need to make sure that you know where these cables and systems before you dig.
You may also want to check with local utility companies about digging around their poles and cables so that you don’t disturb them or harm anyone when you plant or as the tree grows.
In the United States, you can call 811 before you dig. This will get your underground utility lines marked for free, which will help to prevent damage, injury, and fines.

, If you have any questions or are unsure about something related to planting a tree, talk to a professional arborist in your area. Consulting with someone who understands your wishes and local conditions can help you find the best trees to plant.









You can either go to a local nursery to find a professional arborist or use the Arbor Day Foundation’s search tool to help you find a professional arborist in your area. The search tool is located at http://www.arborday.org/trees/health/arborist.cfm .

, After you’ve done the background work on your climate, land, and zoning laws, you’re ready to buy a tree to plant. Purchase a suitable tree for the region, climate, and your yard.









Trees native to your area tend to do well, and you won't be introducing a potential invasive plant species. It will be easier to care for a tree that is already native to the area.You can find the best species of tree for your area. For example, if you live in northern Canada, planting a palm tree probably isn’t feasible. The Arbor Day Foundation can help you find the best tree for your area simply by putting in your zip code or Plant Hardiness zone into the search engine at http://shop.arborday.org/content.aspx?page=tree-nursery .
As a rule of thumb, plants with bare roots—those that are in burlap and not in a container—thrive much better than trees that are in containers.

, You want to give your plant the best chance at growing and surviving. Planting at the right time of year is a key factor in this. Planting times will vary depending on the plant and where you live.

, Again, this will vary depending on where you live.


If you are not sure of the best time of year to plant your tree, consult your local University Extension Service or similar service. Each county in the United States has a University Extension Service and many countries, including India and Kenya, have them as well.If you are in the United States, you can locate your local University Extension Service using the National Institute for Food and Agriculture’s interactive online map at http://nifa.usda.gov/partners-and-extension-map .

, Once you’ve purchased your tree, you need to prepare it for planting. This will help ensure that you’re planting the tree properly and that it will survive. The process is slightly different for a small tree and a large tree.









If the tree is a sapling, turn it upside down gently to get it out of the container. If it is in burlap, wait to cut it off until you’ve planted the tree in the ground.
If the tree is beyond the sapling stage, cut through its packaging. If it is in burlap, wait to cut it off until you’ve planted the tree in the ground.
If there is a wire basket or wiring on your tree’s roots, remove it with wire cutters so that it doesn’t grow into the roots and kill the tree.
Keep as much dirt around the roots as possible and don’t move it more than necessary to keep the roots from drying out.
Don't leave a tree's roots out of its container or burlap for too long because this could damage or dry them out.
If you’ve decided to plant a seed instead of an already growing tree, follow this step. Growing a tree from a seed means germinating the seed, planting it at the appropriate time and taking close care of it. This method will take than transplanting a tree from a container.To get a seed to germinate, you may have to use scarification. This means that you break the seed coat and allow moisture to penetrate so that the plant embryo can begin germinating.
Once the seeds have germinated, plant them in an individual container or a seed tray. Move the trays or contains to a brighter location that is well ventilated.
Each type of tree has different seeds with different needs, so make sure to follow the instructions accordingly for the type of tree you are planting.

, For example, if you are planting a seed from a Golden Delicious apple, you won’t necessarily get a Golden Delicious apple tree. You’ll only be able to tell once the tree fruits.








If you want to grow a tree that yields a certain type of fruit, it’s best to buy one from a nursery to help ensure that it has good rootstock and that you get exactly the fruit you want.

, Once you’ve had a chance to look at your land and think about what your goal is, you can decide on a spot to plant your tree. Mark this spot with a bright and wide circle.









Make sure to take things like power lines, the location of your house and driveway, as well as other trees into consideration so that the roots don’t damage your property as they grow.Use a special marking paint to mark your spot. These containers have a special nozzle so that you can spray them upside down., Before you start digging the hole to plant your tree, measure the plant’s root ball. This will tell you how deep you need to dig the hole.









At this point you can remove the burlap that is around the root flare, or where the roots connect to the trunk.Using a cultivator or garden trowel, remove the top layer of soil from the root ball.
Remove only enough soil to expose the root flare.Measure the height and width of the root ball, from the ground to the top of the exposed root flare, and from one side to the other., Using a shovel, dig the hole in which you’ll plant your tree. You want to make sure that it is large enough to accommodate the tree’s size and give it plenty of room to grow and take root.


Dig a hole that is 2-3 wider and about as deep than the root ball. This will give the tree enough room to fit and allow fresh roots to grow without stress.Try to dig the hole with a small ""pedestal"" of dirt in the center of the hole where the tree will rest. The hole should be a little deeper around the edges but there should be a pedestal of dirt in the center where the root ball sits. This pedestal prevents the root ball from sitting continuously in water. Any excess water will naturally flow to the deeper areas of the hole around the edges where the roots can drink from if needed.
Measure the hole to see if it is wide and deep enough. If necessary, dig out more soil to reach the desired depth and width.Put a light coating of superphosphate in the hole to promote a healthy root system., The time has finally come to plant your tree. After you’ve carefully prepared the hole, place the tree gently into its new home. If it doesn’t fit, remove it and adjust the size of the hole.









Be sure the hole isn't too deep or too shallow. The ground level of the plant should match up with the ground level after you backfill the hole.
Do not bury over where the stem changes to root, also called the crown, or leave any roots exposed.
You can place the handle of your shovel flat across the hole from one side to the other to measure whether the crown is level with the surrounding soil before filling in the hole.

, When the tree is in the hole, identify its best face and turn it in the direction you want. Taking this step will make sure that you can enjoy how the tree looks and also make sure your tree has its best face forward.








Remove any burlap from the tree’s roots at this stage.Make sure you position the tree as upright as possible. How you position the tree will affect how it grows in later years for years.
Consider using a level to measure if you’ve positioned the tree upright. You can also ask a friend or family member to see if the tree is positioned perfectly upright.
Use stakes to help the tree grow upright if necessary.

, Using a mixture of compost and the soil you dug out while you prepared the hole, backfill (or refill) the hole. Make sure you have enough soil to support the roots while giving them room to grow.Backfill three quarters of the hole with existing dirt, one quarter with compost or composted manure as needed.
It’s important to make sure that there are no air pockets around the roots as you backfill the hole. In order to get rid of any air pockets that might be present, backfill only part of the hole and then lightly tamp it down with your hands or the shovel. Do this for subsequent layers.
When tamping down backfill, make sure to proceed gently and also not use your feet because you could trample the roots.
Use some compost or composted manure, if needed. If the soil that you currently have is not rich, has clay-like qualities or has the consistency of dust or sand, the addition of manure or compost will give the tree a great start in life.
If the compost or manure smells, it hasn’t been properly composted and shouldn’t be used because it can “burn” your tree.
Resist the temptation to use a commercial fertilizer. It can over-boost the tree and make it ""burn out” or not thrive.
Give fruit and nut trees extra attention. Adding manure or compost is essential if you are planting a fruit or nut tree.

, If your tree is still a sapling, use a stake to help it grow for about the first year of its life This will keep the tree from blowing over in the wind and allow the roots to become established.









Make sure the stakes you are tied loosely to the trunk. Do not dig into the bark or tighten around the trunk.Remove the stakes once the roots have a chance to become established, after about a year.Larger trees may need two or three stakes., Once the tree is planted, water it and keep up a regular schedule of watering. This will help the roots become established in the surrounding soil.









Water the tree every day for several weeks to let the roots get established. After this, you can reduce the frequency of watering.Water as necessary for the conditions in your area. Take into consideration humidity, rainfall, and sunshine to help you decide when to water your tree.
If you are planting fruit or nut trees for a small home orchard, continue to water weekly for the life of the tree, as your crop depends on consistent irrigation. You’ll also want to fertilize fruit and nut trees monthly, or according to package directions.

, Considering adding a layer of mulch around your tree to help keep moisture in and weeds out.


Cover the planting hole with 1-3 inches (2.5 cm - 7.6 cm) of shredded hardwood or leaf mulch. Keep the mulch at least 12 inches away from the trunk or it may cause the trunk to rot.Mulching around the tree will protect the tree from trampling and lawnmowers, which are two activities that commonly kill young trees.

, If there are any broken, dead, or diseased limbs on your tree, remove them gently with a knife or gardening shears. If there is nothing wrong with the tree, there is no need to prune it until after the first growing season.







, Appreciate its shade and beauty and thank yourself for adding another tree to the world. You won't regret it and as long as you properly care for it, the tree can grow a long time!


You’ll need to make sure that you water your plant to keep it thriving. You want to achieve a balance of giving it enough water to penetrate the roots while not drowning it.
Watering your tree with a steady stream from a garden hose for about 30 seconds should be sufficient. The soil should feel moist at all times and mulch will help retain the moisture.Check soil moisture by digging about 2” below the surface and then use your finger to test if soil is moist. If it is, you don’t need to water."

Obtain Epsom salt or rock salt.,
Drill holes in the stump.,
Pack the holes with salt and top them off with wax.,
Cover the stump.",How to Kill a Tree Stump1," Using Epsom salt or rock salt is an easy way to kill a stump cheaply. When you use the salt method it takes several months for the stump to die, so it might not be your best bet if you need to get rid of the stump quickly.


Do not use regular table salt, which is harmful to the soil surrounding the stump. Use 100 percent Epsom or rock salt with no added ingredients, to make sure the land around the stump doesn't get disturbed.
For a stubborn stump you can try a chemical stump remover or an herbicide containing glyphosate or triclopyr instead of salt.While a chemical herbicide will kill the stump faster, keep in mind that it could kill the roots of surrounding trees or shrubs as well.;
, Drill a pattern of holes across the surface of the stump, so the solution will be able to penetrate. The holes should be about 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide and at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep, or 12 inches (30.5 cm) if you have a long enough drill bit. Penetrating deeply will ensure the salt solution saturates the roots below the trunk.








If you don't have a drill bit this long, use an ax to chop into the wood and make gouges as deep as you can.
If you're working with a stump that has large arial roots, drill holes in those as well.

, Fill up the holes 3/4 full with epsom salt or rock salt. Don't forget the holes you drilled in the arial roots. Now light a plain, unscented candle and drop wax into the holes to plug them.









It's important to make sure the salt stays in place, rather than scattering over your yard, since excess salt can be harmful to topsoil and the roots of other plants.

, Put a plastic tarp, trash bag or another nonporous item over the stump to cover it. It will die more quickly without sunlight and rain to continue nourishing any shoots that come up. After six weeks to several months the stump will die. Check it every once in a while to see how things are progressing. When the stump is dead, it should begin falling apart on its own.

Protect young pines from hot sun.",How to Grow Pine Trees1," Some types of pine trees used for landscaping include white pine, jack pine and Scotch pine. Ask the seller about growing environments if you live in a different climate or at a different elevation than the location where the seedling was grown.;
, Bare-root pine seedlings must be planted during the late fall and winter, when pine trees are dormant.Container-grown seedlings can be planted at any time, although the hottest summer months will require additional shade and water to prevent dehydration and sun damage.


Most seedlings can be kept for several weeks between 35º and 38º F (1.7 – 3.3ºC), but you should check with the seller in case the species you bought has different requirements., Keep the roots damp until you are ready to plant, but refrain from soaking them in water, which could kill them. If the roots form a dense ball, or circle the sides the of the container, carefully rearrange the main root branches so they are more spread out.Some seedlings are sold with a small amount of soil mixture packed around the roots. Try to keep as much of this on the roots as possible while rearranging.

, Each pine tree should have plenty of open space, with no small plants around its base and no root systems of other trees nearby. Choose a location where the tree will receive direct sunlight during the cooler parts of the day.


If you cannot plant a pine tree somewhere with shade on its west side, instructions are included below for creating a sun shade.
A mix of sand and loam is best for pine trees, but you should only need to mix in suitable organic mulch such as sphagnum if the soil is a hard clay consistency.Choose an area with well-draining soil. A 1 foot (30 cm) deep hole filled with water should drain easily within 12 hours. If it does not, you may need to install drainage.

, Do not plant trees when conditions are windy, dry, or above 85ºF (30ºC). The soil should not have standing water or ice on the day you plant, but should not be parched either., The top layer of soil is the highest quality, so fill the bottom few inches (about 10 cm) with topsoil after you dig your hole. Be sure to dig the hole large enough that the roots still fit after you've added the topsoil.Warning: Contact your utility company to discover the location of underground lines before digging any large holes.
Try to plant the tree to the same level it was planted in the nursery. If you're unsure, it is better to plant the tree too high than too low.

, Although burlap and other biodegradable material can be left on the plant, carefully removing it gives the seedling a better opportunity for growth.

, Fill the hole again after planting, periodically patting down loose soil with your shovel handle, not with your feet.Fill the hole until it is level with the surrounding soil, or slightly lower if the climate is especially dry, so water can run into the roots.


Have an assistant hold the tree upright while you fill the hole if necessary.

, Staking pine tree seedlings is only necessary in areas of unusually high wind. If you think the pine tree is in danger of blowing over, use one or two stakes attached by ties or straps, and leave enough room for the tree to sway.Do not loop wire directly over the tree.

, You may need to provide a sunscreen for your small pine tree by using a tarp or sheet of painted plywood. Planting where there is shade from another tree or a building is also a practical choice. The shade should be on the west side of the tree, which is where the sun is located during the hottest parts of the day.

Divide the plant.",How to Grow Yucca," Yucca seeds are slow to germinate, and many species have a low success rate sprouting at all. The seed may even take a full year after planting to sprout.


For a quicker process, take a cutting from an existing adult yucca plant. This method is described in the next section.;
, Yucca seeds planted indoors should be started in winter, to give them as long as possible to germinate before the next winter begins. Planting directly in garden soil is not as effective. If planting directly in garden soil, plant in early spring., Fill a container with approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) of water. Place a paper towel on top of the water, then place your seeds on top of the paper towel.This method increases the odds of the seeds surviving and germinating. Planting the yucca seeds directly in soil has a very low success rate.

, Keep the container at room temperature, adding a small amount of water periodically to prevent the seeds from drying out and going dormant again.

, Some of the seeds should eventually sprout, but this can take anywhere from one month to a full year. Once the seeds have opened up and begun to sprout, prepare individual, small pots with a mixture of equal parts sand and compost.If these materials are not available, use any well-draining soil mixture, typically with 30% or more sand or small gravel.

, Plant the sprouted seeds, sprouting side up, 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) under the soil's surface. Cover it with soil and water the soil thoroughly.

, Let the first thorough watering almost dry out, then water regularly to keep the soil damp, but not soaked. You should see the sprouts emerge from the soil within a week.

, The yucca plant may not be sturdy enough to thrive outdoors for at least two or three years. Keep it indoors during this period, or indefinitely. Transplant the yuccas to a larger pot if its roots begin to wrap around the outside of its current pot. Once the yucca plant is two or three years old, you may plant it outside in the springtime, following the instructions in the planting outside section.


When transplanting, be careful to dig deep enough to expose its entire taproot. This central, long root can be quite long in some yucca species.

, After a couple years of growth or more, yucca plants may produce offshoots near the base that grow on their own stem. During the dormant colder season, select a stem with dark brown bark, not a young, cream-colored stem.Cut a section off of this stem.


The length and thickness of the cutting do not matter much. A cutting 3–4 in. (7.5–10 cm) long should be sufficient.

, Use a clean knife or scissors to remove the leaves nearest the base, leaving the leaves on the top. With fewer leaves, the cutting will go through less severe moisture changes, which increases the odds of it surviving the transplant until its roots can grow.

, Place the cutting in a cool, shaded area. This dries the plant out slightly to encourage root growth for seeking moisture. After 4–7 days, the cutting should be ready to plant.

, Select a pot with drainage holes. Fill it with a cactus or yucca potting mix, or make your own quickly draining soil. Two parts seed-starting mix and one part sand will provide nutrients for the young plant without keeping it too wet.Do not use beach sand, as it contains high salt content. Sand from stream banks is usually acceptable.
If you would like, you can dip the end of the stem in a rooting hormone or a homemade root stimulant at this point. This is not a necessary step, but it may encourage growth.

, Only push the stem far enough into the soil to keep it steady and upright. Often, you'll need to use a gentle rope or other soft line material to anchor the stem upright to another object.

, Start the plant indoors to protect it from chilly evening temperatures and from sudden gusts of wind. Keep it near a sunny window, but not in direct sunlight while its roots and leaves are still developing.

, Roots should develop fully within six weeks.You may be able to see them peeking out of the drainage holes, but if the plant appears healthy, you can assume the roots have grown.


If the roots fail to develop, you may wish to try again with a cutting from a larger, more mature yucca plant.

, This method requires an already mature yucca plant. Find one that already has several side shoots. Choose one shoot that you would like to grow your new plant from., With your shovel, loosen the soil around the plant. Dig in a circle around the plant about five inches outside of the shoot. Do not worry if you cut through roots., As you dig, you can start lifting up the plant from below with your shovel. Lift the plant until you are able to remove the whole shoot and the root ball from the ground., Once you have removed the root ball, you can transplant the shoot to another location. Follow the same instructions and guidelines for planting the yucca plant outdoors., The acceptable USDA Hardiness Zones for yucca range depending on species, from zones 4 through 11 (minimum winter temperatures of -30 to +25ºF or -34 to -4ºC), depending on your species. Zones 9 through 11 (17 to 25ºF, -7 to -4ºC) are typically safe even if you do not know your exact yucca species.If you live in a lower or higher zone, it's best to consult an experienced gardener or garden nursery employee to identify your yucca species and find out what zones it will thrive in.

, Yucca plants thrive during the warm summer months. Planting the yucca at the beginning of the warm weather season gives it the longest growing season possible.

, Yucca plants need a hot, dry environment, so give your plant access to direct sunlight. Certain yucca species can thrive in colder or shadier locations, but these are in the minority, and typically still do well in full sunlight.


If the plant was kept in a shady location, consider moving the pot to an area of indirect sunlight for a week before moving it into full sun. This gives it time to adjust, reducing the chance of burning or withering.

, The yucca plant should be placed in a soil mix that is 50% sand or gravel and 50% soil. You should make sure that there is neither too much gravel nor too much soil.

, If you built a stone bed, build a wooden wall around the location the yucca will be planted in to hold in the soil that will form a raised bed above the stones. Nail four 3 feet (0.9 m). by 1 foot (0.3 m). (1 m by 30 cm) boards into a square frame to place around the stone bed. You may wish to tilt the bed facing toward a sunny direction. (Tilt south in the northern hemisphere, north in the southern hemisphere.)


Alternatively, tightly pack one or two dozen large stones that measure about 1 foot (0.3 m). (30.5 cm) in height around the stone bed to form a wall. This is more labor-intensive, but may provide additional drainage.

, Yucca needs a fast-draining soil to prevent root rot. Use a special yucca or cactus potting mix, or mix your own with three parts lightweight clay, four parts sand, and one part ordinary soil.If you prepared a raised bed, this soil is placed within the boards or stone wall. Otherwise, simply have this soil ready for later.

, The hole should be twice as wide and twice as deep as the yucca's root ball. Slightly larger than the current pot the yucca is kept in should be enough if you are not sure how big the root ball is.

, Gently pry the yucca out of its pot. Turn the pot on its side. Grab the yucca at the base of the stem and slowly ""wiggle"" it out, soil, roots, and all. Place the yucca into the newly dug hole. Fill the rest of the hole with your soil mix and pack the soil around the base of the stem to hold the plant in place. The roots should not show above ground., The chippings keep the root dry at the neck by preventing water from splashing onto it accidentally.

, Use a water soluble, potassium rich fertilizer, diluted to a ratio of about one part fertilizer to four parts water. Apply it once a month during the summer months, during the morning. Fertilize yucca zero to two times during the entire cool season (autumn through winter).


Only fertilize more quickly if your yucca is a fast-growing species. Most yucca species are slow-growing and can be harmed by excess fertilizer. Similarly, if you miss a monthly fertilization in the summer, it is not a big deal. The plant will likely still grow.
Some recommend only fertilizing yucca once a year. This is because yucca can survive well in areas with low nutrients., Many yucca plants can get by without any supplementary watering, relying solely on rainwater to survive. Once foliage starts to develop in the warm months, however, you can water it weekly, giving the plant just enough water to slightly moisten the soil without making it wet to the touch.Reduce the frequency of watering if your yucca plant develops brown tips with yellow rings around them. This is a sign of over-watering.

, Not many pests are drawn to yucca, but snails and slugs will attack new growth. Use a standard pesticide or organic pesticide to get rid of them. Small, green aphids can be washed off with soapy water.

, Rust and mildew are the most common diseases. Spraying a fungicide may help rid the plant of disease, especially if it is only mildew, but a fungicide may or may not work against rust.

, Some yucca grow in a rosette shape, and produce a long, central flower stalk. After it dies, this stalk should be cut back all the way to the base to prevent rot. Other yucca varieties are tall and tree-like. These may be pruned to direct growth, but always wear gloves and safety goggles, as yucca can send sharp splinters flying when cut.In either type, cut off dead or withered leaves from the base of the plant whenever you see them.

, Yucca plants can be damaged if exposed directly to frost. Spreading a thick layer of mulch can go a long way in keeping the plant warm and dry. However, keep mulch away from the lowest leaves to prevent rot.You can also protect the plant by placing a solid sheet of glass or plexiglass over the bed instead of mulch.

, If the Yucca grows too thick and dense after a few years, you can take a shoot from it to plant elsewhere. Choose an off-shoot you would like to remove, dig a perimeter around it, and lift the shoot from below with a shovel. You can cut any roots to the mother plant. Transplant this shoot to a new sunny area. This is best done during the dormant season."

Cover the stump.,
Wait three to six months.,
Cut off any saplings that crop up.",How to Kill a Tree Stump2," This method is free, but can take a long time. The idea is to slowly kill the stump by denying its basic needs. Put a dark tarp or trash bag over the stump so it won’t receive sun or water.








, During this time, the stump will slowly die. Check it from time to time to see how things are progressing. It should begin to rot and fall apart.


As it dies and rots, you can use stump removal solution to speed the process along. It's available at nurseries and garden centers.
You can also add some Epsom salt to cracks that appear in the stump, or see Method One and drill holes in the stump and fill them with salt to make it go faster.

, Covering the stump should prevent anything from growing, but until the stump is dead, you can cut saplings off the base of the trunk as they sprout, or paint them with a woody brush killer that contains triclopyr. If your goal is to allow one tree to grow from the old stump, cut off additional saplings do not apply an herbicide.

Drill holes in the stump.,
Pour kerosene into the holes.,
Build a fire on top of the stump.,
Dig out the ashes and fill in the hole.",How to Kill a Tree Stump3," Burning is a good way to remove the stump after you have killed it. Start by drilling plenty of holes across the surface of the stump. The holes should be about 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide and at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep, or 12 inches (30.5 cm) if you have a long enough drill bit. Penetrating deeply will ensure the stump gets burned down to the tips of the roots so that it will be easy to remove.







, Soaking the stump with kerosene will enable you to light it on fire so it will burn into ash. Make sure the stump is fully saturated, or the fire may go out before it reaches the tips of the roots.









Another option is to place charcoal on top of the stump and light the charcoal on fire. The coals will slowly burn down through the stump. This method will reduce the chances of burning nearby plants.
If you're worried about nearby objects catching fire, you shouldn't use this method. You're going to be setting the stump on fire, and while it's quite effective, it can be dangerous if you don't have plenty of room around the stump.
Check local city ordinances to make sure it’s legal to do a controlled burn. Call 411 to find out more information.

, Put scrap wood on top of the stump and use a fire starter to ignite it. As the fire burns down, the stump will catch and burn up. Look closely to make sure the stump actually catches, and add more wood as necessary to keep the fire going.








Be sure to monitor the stump as it burns to ash. Don’t leave it unattended, in case the fire gets out of hand.
Depending on the size of the stump, the burn may take several hours.

, Use a shovel to remove all of the ashes, down through where the roots were, and fill in the hole with fresh soil.

Get a stump grinder.,
Cut the stump close to the ground.,
Grind up the stump.,
Shovel out the grindings and fill in the hole.",How to Kill a Tree Stump4," You can also chop up a stump to remove it. To use this removal method, you will need a stump grinder. You can rent one from a home improvement store. This machine has a rotary cutter that will drill into and grind up the stump. It's a good method to use if you have a huge, stubborn stump you need to remove. Renting a stump grinder is probably the most prudent option, but if you have a lot of stumps to grind, it might be worth it to buy one.Get protective equipment, too. Goggles and a mask will protect you from sawdust and flying wood chips.
If you don't enjoy handling heavy machinery, call a local landscaper and explain that you have a stump that needs to be removed. You'll be able to pay someone else to do it.

, Use a chainsaw to level off the stump just a few inches from the ground. Remove any branches or roots that stick up too far off the ground so that the stump grinder will have a stable surface on which to operate.







, Put on your goggles and mask, and position the stump grinder over the stump. Then, following the manufacturer’s instruction, move the grinder slowly across the stump's surface to grind it up to bits. Continue along the arial roots to grind those as well until the stump has been fully ground up.









Be careful not to get your feet in the way of the grinder. Wear heavy boots so you won't accidentally hurt yourself.
Make sure children and pets are safely away from the equipment before you begin operating it.

, Remove all of the wood chips and discard them (or use them as mulch, then fill in the hole with soil.









You might need to use an ax to chop out remaining roots.

Mulch around the tree frequently.,
Water as needed depending upon type of pine, weather conditions, and soil.,
Protect the young pine trees from animals.,
Prune dead or diseased branches only.",How to Grow Pine Trees2," Wood chips are cheap and work well for pine trees. Apply them to several inches (centimeters) depth around the tree, leaving space around the trunk.


While mulch should help control weeds in addition to providing good growing conditions, you should pull out any grasses or other small plants near the base of the tree if you do see any grow there.
Do not use a plastic barrier underneath the mulch. The tree needs water and air to be able to pass through the mulch., Instead of following one watering guide without variation, you should pay attention to how moist the soil is around your tree. Here are some tips:Soil that feels moist and holds together when picked up should not be watered, as over watering can suffocate the roots. Only water when the soil is mostly dry and crumbles apart, until it feels moist again.
Water more in fall so the tree is prepared for winter. Water additionally during dry winter spells to protect young trees from drought, which is especially dangerous when the tree expects a wet season.

, A plywood sunscreen can also do double duty as an animal repellent. However, if you live in an area with deer or other persistent, large wildlife, you may need a plastic tube or chicken wire fence encircling the seedling., Pruning to direct growth is not necessary for pine trees and may stunt their growth. Cut dead or diseased branches a short distance from the trunk, leaving the ""branch collar"" ring between the branch and the trunk.Follow the instructions in the article How to Prune a Tree carefully to avoid damaging your pine.

Understand how long this method takes.,
Collect large pine cones.,
Spread the cones out on a dry, warm surface.,
Extract the seeds.,
Put the seeds in a clear, water-filled container for 24–48 hours.,
Decide whether to store the seeds before planting.,
For a small quantity of seeds, store between moist paper towels.,
For a large quantity of seeds, store in a cheesecloth bag.,
Check your seeds weekly for sprouting.,
Plant the seeds in a tube or pot with a pine tree potting mix.,
Care for your seedling.",How to Grow Pine Trees3," Growing pine trees from seeds can be a long, challenging process. You will have to acquire seeds when the pine cones are ripe, most likely in autumn. Depending on species and climate, you may need to prepare the seeds for 30–60 days as describe below before planting in pots. They will grow slowly, and may take over a year before they can be transplanted into outdoor soil without significant risk of death.While most pine cones ripen between August and October, some species such as the Scotch pine remain usable until March.Your local climate will also be a factor. Read the description of ripe pine cones so you know what to look for.
See Growing Pine Trees from Seedlings for an easier, faster method.

, Pine cones come in two varieties: small male cones and large female cones. Only the female cones produce seeds. Choose large pine cones with scales that are not fully open, or spread apart. If the scales are spread apart, they may have already released their seeds.You may take fallen cones or pick them from the tree by twisting them off the branch.Female pine cones are usually higher on the tree, so you may need a stepladder or a hooked pole.
Choose brown or purplish pine cones, as fully green cones are not mature and have not produced useful seeds.
Pine trees that have produced many cones are more likely to produce useful seeds., Place them in direct sunlight if possible, and let them dry out so the scales open and give you access to the seeds. You may warm the room to speed this along, but do not heat the cones above 113ºF (45ºC)., Each scale of the pine cone should have one or two seeds underneath it, sometimes attached to a thin ""wing"" for catching the wind. Shake the cones on a tray with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) mesh or hardware cloth; the seeds should fall out of the cones and through the mesh.


Shake over a tarpaulin to easily collect the seeds afterward.
Use tweezers to pull out stubborn seeds, or if you only collected a few cones.

, Use room temperature water. Besides providing the seeds with water they need to begin growing, this provides a test of which seeds are usable. The full, viable seeds should slowly sink to the bottom of the container. The empty, unusable seeds will float to the top.Cut open one or two of the largest floating seeds to check whether they are actually empty. If they are full, wait longer for the remaining seeds to sink.
Discard the floating seeds at the end of this process. They are not usable.
Large operations sometimes place a bag of seeds in running water, which is better at removing fungal spores that could cause infection. This is difficult to achieve at home, but you could consider changing the water every 12 or 24 hours.

, Fresh pine seeds acquired in fall can usually be planted immediately. However, even fresh seeds may benefit from a special environment which increases the speed of germination (sprouting) and reduces the chance of your seeds staying dormant after planting. Storing seeds in this way to mimic ideal seasonal conditions is called stratification.


Different species of pine tree do best in different conditions. Identify your species in a regional tree identification book or website if possible, and look up how long ""stratification"" takes. If you can't, the below methods should work as long as you check the seeds' progress regularly.
In general, pines that grow in relatively warm climates further south (but not at high elevations) require little to no stratification before planting and can simply be stored dry at room temperature, while pines from damper, colder climates cannot grow without a cold, moist period.

, If you have a handful or two of seeds or fewer, this method may be easiest. Stack paper towels until the stack is 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick (3 to 6 mm). Add just enough water to moisten every part of the towels, then hold vertical by one corner until the excess water drains off. Place the seeds on one half of the paper towels in one layer, then fold the other half over the seeds. Seal in a ziploc or similar plastic bag and store in the refrigerator at about 41ºF (5ºC).


You may wish to include a thick straw or other thin tube to allow a small amount of air exchange with the outside, to ensure the environment has sufficient oxygen.Note: certain species benefit from several weeks of storage in a warm, dark area before transfer to the refrigerator. The duration of this warm period varies widely by species, so search for specific information online if you can identify your seeds.

, Immediately after completing the soaking step, put half a pound (0.23 kg) of seeds or less onto a square of cheesecloth or other soft mesh material and tie it into a bag. Hang or hold up the bag and let the excess water drain for about a minute. Tie the neck of a larger, plastic bag to the neck of the cheesecloth so the water can continue to drain without soaking the seeds. Hang this in your refrigerator at about 41ºF (5ºC).



Note: If you can identify your species, search for information on ""stratification"" for that species online. You may wish to store the bag in a warm location before transferring to the fridge.

, A seed beginning to germinate will crack open and start to extend a growing root. Depending on the species and the individual seed, this could take anywhere from 3 weeks to multiple years, although you never need to store a seed for that long before planting.For seeds that refuse to sprout after several weeks, you can encourage them by letting them dry out, then repeating the treatment.
If the growing season is over or you wish to save seeds for next year, dry the surface but leave them slightly damp, then store in the refrigerator. Keep checking regularly to be sure they don't sprout.

, Pine seeds are vulnerable to infection and rodents when planted in outdoor soil. Try to find plastic tubes intended for growing pine trees, as these are best for encouraging long root structures that will support the tree.Otherwise, an ordinary small plant pot will work.


Instead of using soil, use a potting mix intended for pine trees, or create your own mix of 80% pine bark and 20% peat moss.Push the seeds just under the soil with the pointed root facing downward.
If keeping the plants indoors, keep the pots on a raised table to make it more difficult for mice to reach them.

, Follow the instructions for Caring for a Pine Tree Seedling to provide proper care. With the correct levels of sunlight and water, your tree should be ready to transplant into a taller tube or pot after one or two years, depending on the species.


Pine trees grow best with plenty of sun, but young seedlings are susceptible to damage during the hottest part of the day. Place the seedling somewhere it will be shaded during the early afternoon, such as near an east-facing window.
Keep the seedling moist but not soaked.
Carefully transplant the seedling to a larger pot after it reaches 2 inches (5cm) in the smallest ""multi pot"" tubing, or once it reaches 4 to 6 inches (about 10 to 15 cm) in a medium sized tube or pot.

The tree could also take between four and fifteen years to bear fruit for the first time.A young tree purchased from the nursery is actually a combination of two plants: one tree bred for healthy roots and other attributes, plus branches of another tree grafted onto the first. These branches come from a tree that produces high quality fruit, and because they are already mature, the tree should produce fruit within a year or two after purchase. All that explained, feel free to continue with these steps if you're up for a challenge.;
, Cut open an orange carefully without breaking the seeds inside, or simply use the seeds that aren't damaged by the knife. Pick out seeds without any dents or discolorations. Seeds that appear withered and dry, usually after they've been left out of the fruit for too long, have a lower chance of growing.


Note that some varieties of orange are seedless. Ask a fruit seller for a variety with seeds.

, Hold the seeds under running water and gently rub off any pulp or other material that has gathered onto the seeds. Be careful not to damage the seeds, especially if some are already beginning to sprout.


There is no need to dry the seeds afterwards. Keeping them moist will make them more likely to sprout.

, Assuming you're using seeds that haven't yet begun to germinate (sprout), you can shorten the time it takes to reach that point by keeping them in a moist environment. You could keep damp seeds in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for 30 days before planting, or simply keep the soil they're planted in moist, but not soggy.If you are using seeds that have dried out, they are in a dormant state and can take months to germinate, or fail to do so at all.Professional orange growers soak some slow-germinating orange varieties in gibberellic acid before planting to speed up the germination even more.This is typically unnecessary for a home project involving a handful of seeds, and can easily backfire if the wrong amount is used for your orange variety., Plant them about 1/2 inch (1.2cm) beneath the surface.Orange trees aren't too picky about which potting mix you pick, but it is important that water does not pool around the seeds (and later roots) and cause rot.Water should drain through the pot quickly when you water the soil. Optionally, you can purchase citrus potting compost to add to the mix, which will increase its ability to hold nutrients and create the more acidic (low pH) environment that citrus trees thrive in.Remember to put a plate or other object underneath the pot to catch the draining water.
If the soil is poor at draining, mix in hardwood bark chips. This makes the soil less compact, which lets water drain through faster., Whether indoors or outdoors, the soil does best at temperatures between 75º and 85ºF (24º–29ºC).Sunlight is the best way to warm your soil to the correct level, since a radiator could dry out the soil too quickly. If you live in a cold or low-sun region, you may need to keep your orange tree in a heated greenhouse or conservatory, even before it's germinated.

, If you'd like to speed up the tree's growth, adding a small amount of fertilizer to the soil every 10–14 days will help.To get the best results, you would need to tailor your choice of fertilizer to the level of nutrients in your soil, which should be on the label of the potting soil if you purchased it. Otherwise, choose a balanced fertilizer with relatively even amounts of nutrients.


Stop adding fertilizer once the plant has grown into a young tree. Follow the instructions for a Seedling or Young Tree instead. It shouldn't need additional fertilizing until its second year.

, Citrus seeds have the unusual ability to produce exact clones of the mother plant, called nu-cellar seedlings.These are typically the two fastest-growing sprouts, while a third ""genetic"" offspring tends to be smaller and slower-growing. Cut off this weak third sprout in order to produce a tree with the consistent quality the parent was bred for.

, Whether you just purchased a tree or have been growing it for years, you should plant it in a container that the roots easily and comfortably fit into, but not into one far larger than the root ball.The best time to re-pot your orange tree is in the spring, before it has put a lot of energy into growing.Cut off any dead or broken roots before planting.First sterilize the knife by boiling it or rubbing it with alcohol to reduce the chance of transmitting disease to the tree.
Pack the soil gently around the roots to remove pockets of air. The top roots should end up just under the surface of the soil.

, Oranges can grow in USDA hardiness zones 8 through 10 (with minimum annual temperatures of 10 to 40ºF / -12 to 4.4ºC). If you live in one of these warm climates, you may be able to find a place to plant the tree outside:


Choose an area protected from the wind.
To allow for root growth, plant standard-sized orange trees at least 12 feet (3.7m) from walls and other large obstacles, and 25 feet (7.6 m) from other trees.If using dwarf orange trees, look up your variety's requirements.
The trunk itself can grow to be 10 feet (3m) wide. Plant the tree at least 5 feet (1.5m) from foot paths to keep them clear.

, When planting orange trees outside, dig a hole just deep enough to cover the roots. Cover the roots with the soil you just dug out. Potting mixes tend to hold too much water for orange trees, which can lead to rot.Do not cover the trunk with soil, or the orange tree could die.

, Keep an eye on young seedlings, since they are always more vulnerable to burning or other dangers than established plants, but orange trees should do best in full sun. The best temperatures for orange trees are between 75ºand 90ºF (24–32ºC). They will do poorly in spring or summer temperatures below 45ºF (7ºC), and depending on variety might die in temperatures of 32ºF (0ºC) or below. Sustained temperatures above 100ºF (38ºC) for several days will likely cause leaf damage.If your adult tree is exposed to too high temperatures, hang a sun shade or sheet over the tree until the temperature decreases below 100ºF (38ºC).
Move your orange tree indoors before a frost occurs. Citrus trees are more vulnerable to frost than heat, although some varieties may be able to survive a mild period of frost.

, Orange trees, once grown into young trees rather than sprouts, prefer to be in soil that dries out before being watered again. Wait until the soil feels dry when you make a deep hole with your finger, then water heavily until the soil is soaked. A large adult plant should be left alone until the soil is dry to 6 inches (15 cm) beneath the surface.Typically, the tree can be watered once to twice a week, but this varies depending on temperature, humidity, and amount of sunlight received. Use your judgement and water more regularly during hot, dry seasons, although you should generally avoid watering plants while the sun is high in the sky.
If your tap water is hard (mineral-heavy, leaving white scale on kettles or pipes), use filtered water or rainwater instead to water orange trees., Adding fertilizer or manure at the right time gives the trees all the nutrients they require to grow and produce fruit, but incorrect use can burn the tree or cause other damage. Use a special citrus tree fertilizer, or any fertilizer that is especially high in nitrogen. Follow these instructions for applying fertilizer or compost:Young trees 2–3 years old should have two tablespoons (30mL) of nitrogen-high fertilizer spread under the tree 3 or 4 times a year, immediately before watering. Alternatively, mix one gallon (4L) of high quality composted manure into the soil, but only in the fall when rains can wash away excess salts before they cause damage.
Adult trees 4 years or older grown outside require 1–1.5 lb. (0.45–0.68 kg) of nitrogen a year. Your fertilizer should say what percentage of nitrogen it contains, which will allow you to calculate how much fertilizer you need to use to achieve the correct amount of nitrogen. Scatter over the root area of the tree and water into the soil, either annually during the winter or in three equal batches in February, July, and September.

, Dust or grime buildup on a plant's leaves can prevent it from photosynthesizing, which is part of how it gains energy. Brush or rinse the leaves every few weeks if the plant is kept indoors.

, Unlike some varieties of trees, orange and other citrus will do fine without pruning. Only remove completely dead branches, and suckers near the base that look especially unhealthy. You may prune your tree to shape its direction of growth and keep it short enough to pick all the fruit, but only remove heavy branches during winter months to avoid sunburning the exposed inner tree., If your tree is still young and has just been planted outdoors, it may be especially vulnerable to sunburn. Tie newspaper loosely around the trunk and large branches if you see signs of sun damage, or are living in an area with strong sun., Yellow leaves may be a sign of alkalinity, or too much base salt in the tree. Test your soil pH to confirm this. If the soil is too alkaline, apply an acidic (low pH) fertilizer and heavily wash the soil to leach out alkaline salts.Too much manure fertilizer, or manure applied during the dry season, can be a cause of alkalinity.

, Aphids are small green pests that feed on many types of plants. If you see them on your orange tree, wash them off with soapy water.Many other solutions are detailed in the Control Aphids article if this does not work.

, Ants can be difficult to eradicate, but placing the pot in a larger container of standing water makes it impossible for them to get to it. Use pesticides sparingly and as a last resort, especially if the tree is bearing fruit.

, If possible, young trees should be brought indoors before the frost. However, if they are planted outside and you have no space indoors, you should wrap the trunks with cardboard, corn stalks, fleece, or other insulating material. Cover the trunk all the way up to the main branches.Healthy adult orange trees will rarely die due to frost, but they can experience leaf damage. Wait until spring to see which branches survive before pruning the dead ones off.

, Leaving fruit on the tree may reduce the amount the tree produces next year, although if you are only using fruit for home purposes an adult tree should produce more than you need. Some varieties, such as mandarins and Valencia oranges, alternate years of heavy production with years of light production.Fertilize less during the year leading up to light production, since the tree has lower nutrient needs.

Select a sunny, moist spot.,
Install supports for your plants if needed.,
Plant the honeysuckle in the early spring.,
Care for your honeysuckle.",How to Grow Honeysuckle1," While honeysuckle plants can tolerate partial-shade, they flourish in the sun. If possible, choose to plant your honeysuckle in a location that receives full sun. The site you choose should also have soil that retains some moisture—excess water should drain off.Without sunshine, honeysuckle plants will not flower profusely and they may shed their leaves.;
, Once you have selected the location, determine if the plant will serve as ground cover or if the honeysuckle will climb up a support structure. If you intend to use the plant as ground cover, you will not need to install a support structure. If you would like to train the honeysuckle to climb, you will either need to plant it near an existing wall or fence, or install a trellis, stakes, wall, or fence. If you are not planting your honeysuckle near an existing fence or wall, Insert the support structure into the ground prior to planting the honeysuckle.


If you install the structure after placing the plant in the ground, you may damage the root system., After the threat of frost has passed in the spring, you may plant the honeysuckle in your garden. If you are using the honeysuckle as ground cover, plant them between two to five feet apart. If you are training your honeysuckle, place each plant six to twelve inches away from the support structure and three to fifteen feet away from other plants.Dig a hole as deep as the plant’s current root system. The hole should be two to three times wider than its container.
Combine new compost into the soil you removed from the hole.
Remove the honeysuckle from its container without damaging the root system.
Loosen the plant’s soil with your fingertips before placing it in the hole.
Scoop half of the soil-compost mixture into the hole. Water the area to remove unwanted air pockets. Allow all of the water to drain.
Fill in the rest of the hole with soil-compost mix.
Water your transplanted honeysuckle thoroughly.
If you are training your honeysuckle, attach the plant to the support structure with old nylon hosiery tied in a figure eight. The crossed part of the tie should lay between the stem and the support structure., There are several actions you can take to ensure the health and prosperity of your honeysuckle plant. These include:


Immediately after planting, cover the base of the honeysuckle with a two inch layer of compost, followed by a layer of mulch. The mulch will help the soil retain water.
If your region receives less than one inch of rain per week, water the honeysuckle plant.
After your honeysuckle has flowered, prune the plant."

Choose the right type of lemon tree.,
Purchase a good specimen.,
Select a large container with drainage holes.,
Prepare an all-purpose soil mix.",How to Grow Lemon Trees Indoors1," Meyer lemon trees are the most common for indoor growing and produce small to medium fruits with a strong flavor. Pink variegated lemon trees are another good option for beginners and produce lemons with pink flesh.;
, Shop at a nursery for a tree between two and three years in age. Planting a lemon tree from seed can be done, but is not recommended, since trees planted from seed may take a long time to grow and produce fruit.

, A 10 to 15 gallon (40 to 60 liter) container should give your tree plenty of room, and under average conditions, a lemon tree can grow up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) in a container that large.


If the container you choose does not have any drainage holes, drill one or two into the bottom.

, A store-bought, soil-based mix that is slightly acidic works best. Mix sand into the potting mix to allow for better drainage.


A potting mix with a base of peat moss can also work and presents a soil less alternative. These artificial mixes work even better when they contain compost.

Taper your care off as the tree grows.",How to Grow an Oak Tree from an Acorn," Acorns are best harvested in the early-to-mid autumn before they have fallen from the tree.Choose acorns that are free of worms, holes, and fungus. Suitable acorns should be brownish with slight tinges of green remaining,though the appearance of acorns can vary based on the type of oak tree they come from. A good general rule is that acorns are ready for picking when they can be removed from the cap without tearing them.Note that the cap is not part of the acorn, but a (separate) protective covering. By removing the acorn from the cap you are not damaging it unless you tear the acorn itself.
If possible, look for suitable trees in the summer. You'll want mature trees whose acorns are easily-reached via ladder or with a long pole.

Some oak varieties, like red oaks, have acorns that take two years to mature, rather than one. As you pick suitable trees in the summer, keep this in mind - the acorns on some oaks will be ready in the fall, while others won't be ready until the following year.

;
, Put the acorns that you've harvested in a bucket of water. Allow the acorns to settle a minute or two. Discard any acorns that float - these acorns are bad.


If, at any point, you notice that an acorn is soft to the touch, discard it as well. Soft, mushy acorns are rotten.

, Take the ""good"" acorns out of the water and dry them off. Place them in a large zipper bag with damp sawdust, vermiculite, peat mix, or another growth medium that can hold moisture. You should be able to fit up to 250 acorns in especially large bags. Put the bag in the refrigerator for a month and a half or longer - as long as is needed to germinate the new oak.


This process is known as stratification, which is simply exposing a seed to cold temperatures, mimicking the natural conditions that a seed would experience had it fallen to the ground. This primes the seed for sprouting in the spring.
Periodically check on your acorns. The medium should be just barely moist. Too moist, and the acorns may rot. Too dry, and they may not grow.

, Even when stored in the refrigerator, most acorns will begin to germinate in the presence of moisture. The root end may begin to crack through the shell around early December (late fall, early winter). Whether or not the root has cracked through, the acorn is ready to be planted after about 40-45 days of storage.


Handle your seedlings with care - the emerging roots are easily damaged.

, Obtain fairly small 2 inch (5 cm) diameter gardening pots (or, if you prefer, large styrofoam cups or milk cartons), for your plants. Fill these with a good quality potting soil (some sources also recommend adding milled sphagnum moss). For watering purposes, leave about an inch (2.5 centimeters) of space at the top. Plant your acorn just below the surface with the root facing down.


If using a styrofoam cup or milk carton, poke holes in the sides of the cup near the bottom so that water can escape.
If you prefer, you can also try just burying the acorn in the yard. Bury the root and gently tuck the acorn to one side on top of suitable rich, soft soil. This will only work if the taproot is already well established, long, and has detached adequately from the acorn. Be warned - this leaves the seedling vulnerable to mice, squirrels, etc.

, Water your plant until water comes out of the holes at the bottom of its container. In the coming weeks, water frequently, never allowing the soil to dry out. In this stage of their life, keep your seedlings indoors. Place them on a southern windowsill, where they can absorb the winter sun. You may not notice rapid above-ground growth right away. This is because, during the first stage of its life, the plant is developing its taproot below the surface of the dirt.


If you live in the southern hemisphere, place your seedlings on a northern windowsill instead.

, Gardening sources differ about the next steps to take - some recommend planting seedlings directly into the ground after a few weeks of growth in a pot or cup, while others recommend gradually increasing the amount of each day that the plant is exposed to the outdoor weather before finally planting it in the ground.Still others recommend transplanting the seedling to a larger pot, allowing it to grow further, and then finally planting it in the ground. Though there is no single right way to decide when to transplant a seedling into the ground, there are qualities to look for which can inform your decision to transplant your seedling. Good candidates for transplanting:


Are about four to six inches tall (10 - 15 cm), with small leaves.
Have white, healthy-looking roots.
Appear to be outgrowing their container.
Have shown substantial taproot growth.
Are a few weeks to several months old.

, Location is everything - pick a location for your oak tree where it has room to grow and won't be a hindrance when they've grown large. When choosing the site for your oak tree, some things to consider are:


The availability of sunlight. Like all photosynthetic plants, oaks need sunlight to survive, so don't plant them in shaded areas.
The location of nearby sidewalks, water lines, buried pipes, etc. You don't want to have to kill your tree if work needs to be done in your yard.
The shading effect of the full-grown tree. If you would like your oak tree to eventually provide shade for your home, plant it to the west or southwest of your home to maximize the shading effect it will have in the summer, while minimizing its shade in the winter.Note - in the southern hemisphere, the tree should be to the west or northwest side of your house to get the shading effect.


Nearby vegetation. Plants compete with each other for sun, moisture, and other resources. Don't plant your young oak right next to any substantial vegetation, or it may not reach maturity.

, When you've picked a good spot for your tree, clear any minor vegetation in a 3-foot (.9 meter) circle away. Use a shovel to turn over the dirt in the area to a depth of about 10 inches (25 centimeters), breaking up any large clods.If the soil isn't moist, you may want to moisten the soil yourself or wait until after a rain to plant your tree.

, In the middle of your 3-foot (.9 meters) circle, dig a hole about a foot or two deep (61cm-91cm) and a foot (30cm) wide. The precise depth of your hole will depend on the length of your seedling's taproot - it should be roughly deep enough to accommodate it.

, Taproot facing down and leaves facing up, gently place your oak into the hole you've prepared. Make sure the hole is deep enough to accommodate the oak's roots. Replace the dirt around the plant, packing it in lightly. Water your seedling after planting it.


Pack soil around the oak seedling, sloping the soil away from the seedling so that water does not sit at the trunk of the tree, which can be damaging.
Lay a circular mulch of bark chip about one foot (.3 meters) around the tree to help the soil retain moisture and discourage the growth of weeds. Make sure it does not touch the stem of the tree.
To increase the chances of a successful planting, you may want to place several acorns in the same area. In this case, plant young seedling acorns directly into the ground by clearing a 2x2 foot (61 cm x 61 cm) area and placing two acorns into that space, with one or two inches (2.5 cm - 5 cm) of soil on top.

, Oak trees - especially young, fragile ones - are a source of food for many herbivorous animals. Acorns are a frequent snack for squirrels and mice, who can easily dig them up. Small seedlings are also vulnerable to rabbits, deer, and other animals that like to eat leaves. To ensure your young oak trees aren't devoured, take steps to protect them. Cage your young trees with chicken wire or sturdy plastic fencing around their stem to prevent animals from reaching them.


If you live in an area where deer are common, you may even want to consider caging the top of the tree.
You may also want to use pesticides to protect your tree from a variety of pests, including aphids and June bugs. Use caution when selecting pesticides - only use ones that are not harmful to your oak tree or your family.

, An oak's long taproot allows it to draw moisture from deep soils even when surface soils have been completely dried out. During the winter and wet months, it's not usually necessary to water your oak trees. However, when oaks are young, hot and dry weather can be damaging. A drip irrigation system is a useful way to get water to young oak trees when they need it most. Irrigate your tree with about 10 gallons (38 liters) of water via drip irrigation system every week to two weeks. Irrigate during the hottest and driest months for about two years, lessening the irrigation frequency as the tree grows.


Remember not to allow water to collect around the base of the tree.Arrange your irrigation system so that water drips around the tree, not directly onto its base, where it can cause rot.

, As your oak grows and its roots deepen, you will need to care for it less and less. Eventually, it will be big and tall enough that animals won't be able to kill it and its roots will be deep enough for it to survive the summer without any watering. Slowly, over several years, reduce the amount of care you give your tree (which, aside from watering during dry months and protecting it from animals, should not be all that much). Eventually, your tree should be able to thrive on its own without showing any signs of distress. Enjoy the lifelong gift you've given yourself and your family!


Within 20 years, your oak may begin producing acorns of its own, though, depending on the species, optimal acorn growth may not occur for up to 50 years.

Find a large container.,
Plant the honeysuckle in the container.,
Install a support system.,
Train your honeysuckle.",How to Grow Honeysuckle2," When you plant honeysuckle in a container, the pot must be large enough to accommodate the plant’s growing root system. Select a container that is two to three times larger than the honeysuckle’s current pot.


If you intend to install a support system within the pot, the container will also have to accommodate for the trellis or stakes., Fill your large pot approximately halfway full of soil and/or compost. Carefully remove the honeysuckle from its plastic container without damaging its root system. Insert the plant into the large pot so that the base of the plant sits flush with the lip of the container. Fill in the empty space with more soil and/or compost.


If you need to elevate the honeysuckle, add more soil or compost to the pot until the plant’s base reaches the lip of the container.The type of honeysuckle you choose to plant is dependent upon the size of the container you wish to use, the climate of your region, and availability at local nurseries, markets, and stores. Before you purchase a honeysuckle, make sure the variety is not considered invasive., In order to train your honeysuckle to climb, you must provide it with a support structure. You may position the container next to a south-facing wall or fence. If this option is not available to you, you may install a trellis or set of stakes within the pot itself.


You can create a makeshift cage out of three bamboo dowels and nursery wire. Insert the three dowels along the inner edge of the container at even intervals. Wrap a piece of nursery wire around the top of the three dowels. Cover the rest of the structure—from its top to its base—with five to seven rings of nursery wire.

, Once your structure is in place, you can train the plant to climb up the trellis, stakes, wall, or fence. Wrap the plant’s vines around the support structure. You can attach the honeysuckle to the structure with old nylon hosiery.If you have not already done so, move the honeysuckle to a sunny location and water the plant.

Take cuttings from a honeysuckle plant.,
Remove the stem’s outer layer.,
Treat the cuttings with root hormone.,
Plant and cover your cutting.,
Let your honeysuckle take root.",How to Grow Honeysuckle3," You can start a new honeysuckle plant from a cutting, or portion of an existing plant, treated with root hormone. Remove six to eight inch pieces of vine from your honeysuckle plant with a sharp knife. The cut you make should be slanted as opposed to straight across. If possible, separate the cutting from the vine just below a leaf node, or the portion of the stem that produces leaves. Remove the lowest two sets of leaves.


Take your cuttings from a plant that is at least two years old., With a knife, carefully scrape off the top layer of the stem. You do not need to remove the entire layer, only the portion that spans from the base of the cutting to the lowest leaf node. This distance will be approximately two inches.


This step is optional and should be avoided if you do not have a steady hand., Root hormone is used to enhance the growth of plant’s roots. Place a small amount of powder or liquid root hormone into a clean disposable dish. Dip two inches of the cutting into the root hormone. Tap the excess product off on the side of the dish.Root hormone is commonly used on cuttings, like honeysuckle, that generate roots rather slowly., Fill a small container with fresh soil or compost. Insert the cutting two inches into the fresh soil. Stick a bamboo skewer into the soil approximately half an inch away from the cutting. Water the cutting. Cover the plant with a plastic bag and seal the bag with a rubber band.


The bamboo stick with keep the bag off of the cutting., Once the cuttings are planted, relocate the containers to a bright, sunny sport. Within two to three weeks, the cuttings should produce roots. To check their progress, lightly tug on the cutting to see if it is attached to the soil. When the roots are at least one inch long, you may transplant them to a larger pot or into your garden.


Don’t forget to water your cuttings. The soil should remain moist, not damp or dry."
"
Purchase or collect honeysuckle seeds.,
Dry the seeds.,
Plant the seeds.",How to Grow Honeysuckle4," Honeysuckle seeds are not available in every region, at every nursery, or through every seed catalogue. If you can not find a supplier and you have access to a honeysuckle plant, you may collect the seeds directly from the spent flowers.


Honeysuckle seeds are found in pods. When the pods become dry and brittle, they are ready for harvest. Ripe pods should snap off the stem and split a small amount when squeezed., After harvesting the pods, the wet seeds need to dry. Dry the seeds in a well ventilated room. The room should be kept at a temperature between 70 and 95℉. After two to six weeks, the seeds will be ready to plant.


You can dry the seeds in a closed paper bag, an open plastic cup, or a mixing bowl covered with a piece of screen, lightweight fabric, or cheesecloth., Fill a small container with moist perlite soil. Sprinkle or place the seeds on top of the soil. Water the seeds immediately. The seeds will germinate within fifteen days.


The seeds must be wet to germinate, or transform from a seed to a seedling. Check the soil every day to determine if the seeds need additional water."

Find a saucer that is large enough to fit beneath the bottom of your container.,
Lay a layer of landscaper's cloth over the bottom of the container.,
Place a layer of gravel or broken pots inside the bottom of the pot.,
Fill your container halfway with potting mix.,
Slip the lemon tree out of its nursery pot.,
Pack soil around the tree.,
Water the tree immediately.",How to Grow Lemon Trees Indoors2," Place a few pebbles or gravel on the saucer and add a little water before placing the container onto the saucer and the pebbles. The water-filled saucer will help maintain a trace amount of humidity around your tree.

, This cloth will prevent soil from draining out of the container's drainage holes when you water.

, The gravel will promote better drainage, preventing the roots of your tree from drowning or rotting.

, Pack the soil in so that it will create a sturdy base for your tree to stand in.

, Rub its roots slightly to help them spread out before placing the tree into the pot.


If you purchased a bare root tree, create a mound of soil and place the tree into the pot with its roots spread over the mound.

, Press the soil down firmly to remove excess air, creating a denser, sturdier set-up to support the tree. Do not allow any roots to remain exposed, and do not cover the trunk. The trunk will begin to rot if kept covered.

, Give your tree enough water so that excess drains out into the saucer. Empty the saucer once the soil finishes draining.

"
Keep the soil moist.,
Mist your tree using a spray bottle.,
Keep the room humid by using a humidifier.,
Manage the temperature of the room you keep your lemon tree in.,
Place your tree in a south-facing window.,
Supplement natural light with artificial lighting.,
Pollinate your lemon tree by hand.,
Feed your tree with a balanced fertilizer.,
Prune with caution.,
Root-prune only as necessary.,
Watch out for pests.,
Keep a look out for signs of disease.,
Thin out clusters of lemons.,
Twist ripe lemons off the tree.",How to Grow Lemon Trees Indoors3," Periodically check the top 2 inches (5 centimeters) of the soil. When the top 2 inches (5 centimeters) are moderately dry, give your tree a thorough watering until excess water drains out of the bottom of the pot and into the saucer. Empty the saucer.


If using hard tap water, you may need to drop the water's pH before giving it to your tree. Adding 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) white vinegar to 1 gallon (4 liters) of water will usually do the trick.

, This should be done on a frequent basis, if not daily. Misting your tree mimics the natural humidity that your tree misses out on by being indoors.

, If your lemon tree does not seem to be doing well even in spite of frequent misting, you may need to go a step further in keeping it moist by running a humidifier in the same room for a few hours a day. You can monitor humidity levels by using a hygrometer, and the relative humidity level should be around 50 percent during the spring and summer.

, These trees do best in rooms with an average temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 degrees Celsius) by day and 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 degrees Celsius) at night. While temperatures that dip below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 degrees Celsius) will not kill your tree, they will cause your tree to go into dormancy and stop growing.

, Lemon trees need full sun, meaning 8 to 12 hours of sunlight a day.

, Place a 40-watt fluorescent grow light several inches (10 to 20 centimeters) above the top of your tree. Keep the light on as long as necessary until your tree has soaked in a total of 8 to 12 hours of light.

, By keeping your tree inside, you prevent bees and other insects from pollinating it. Some trees can produce fruit without being pollinated, but pollination greatly increases your odds of a plentiful yield.


Perform the process early in the day, preferably in the morning. Pollen can be killed by the heat or dryness of a warm afternoon.
When your tree flowers, gently rub the antlers inside each flower with a paintbrush or cotton swab. The antlers are the yellow tips of the five stamens that stick up from the center of the flower. Rubbing the antlers gathers a dusty yellow pollen onto the brush.
Rub the pollen onto the sticky lobes of the pistil. The pistil is the center stalk that rises above the other stalks in the middle of a flower. Gently apply the pollen you gathered on your brush or swab onto the lobes, or stigma, until the pollen sticks.
Allow the plant to take over from there. The plant should finish developing from that point without further assistance.

, Select a fertilizer with high levels of nitrogen and moderate levels of phosphorus and potassium, such as a 12-4-4 fertilizer. The numbers refer to the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively, so the first number should be highest. Many plants would experience a decrease in fruit and flowering with a high-nitrogen fertilizer, but citrus trees are heavy nitrogen feeders and need a higher dosage than most plants for rapid growth. Fertilizers that also include minerals like iron and zinc will help your tree to absorb the food better. Apply your fertilizer once or twice a month according to package directions.

, Pruning too many leaves will reduce your yield, but occasional pruning can be helpful. Remove dead, broken, and diseased branches, and thin to control the height and spread of your tree as space allows.

, Your tree should remain root-bound in order to keep its size in check, but some potted lemon trees will stop producing fruit if their roots get too out of control. When a tree stops growing, root-pruning becomes necessary.


Remove your tree from its pot. Expose the roots and keep them moist by spritzing them with water from a spray bottle.
Use pruning shears to remove the largest roots that circle around the root ball.
Shave 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.5 centimeters) of the roots around the exterior of the root ball using a sharp knife.
Repot the tree and prune approximately 1/3 of its foliage to balance out the pruned roots.

, Pests are rare for indoor trees, but small infestations can occur. Spray the pests with soapy water to kill them off. If this does not work, apply neem oil.

, Fungal diseases are especially common, but bacterial diseases can attack as well. Look into possible anti-fungal and anti-bacterial remedies to determine what might work best to treat the specific disease your tree has.

, Once a cluster of small lemons appears on your tree, remove 2/3 of them to allow the remaining 1/3 a chance to mature to full size. Typically, lemons take between 7 to 9 months to ripen.

, You may also use shears to snip them off, but truly ripe lemons usually drop with a fair amount of ease.

Decide whether to plant in fall or spring.,
Start your seeds.,
Prepare a planting bed for the transplants.",How to Grow Leeks1," If you live in a mild climate (growing zone 7 or warmer), you can plant leeks in the fall for a spring harvest, then plant again in the late spring for a fall harvest. Leeks planted later in the year will overwinter and grow in the spring. If you live in a climate with harsh winters, leeks should be planted in very early spring, as soon as the ground is workable.


Different leek varieties are meant for different planting times. Ask an expert at your local nursery to inform you what varieties work best in your climate.;
, Fill seed trays with a seed starting mix (not potting soil) and sow the seeds about 6 weeks before the last frost of the winter. Leek seeds germinate best at a temperature around 77 °F (25 °C), so keep them in a warm, sunny room.If you're starting seeds in the fall, you can keep them outdoors in a sunny spot. Keep the starting mixture moist.


If you wish, you can direct sow the seeds instead of starting them in trays. Prepare a planting bed with plenty of compost. Plant the seeds 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep and several inches apart.
The seedlings are ready to transplant when they grow to be at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) long.

, Prepare a permanent bed for the seedlings. Choose a spot in the sun that has well-draining soil. Work compost into the soil to a depth of at least 8 inches (20.3 cm). Dig a trench 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep.Leeks must be planted deep in the soil so that the base of the stem stays out of the sun and becomes ""blanched."" The blanched part is the white, tender, edible part of the leek.

Grow spinach in USDA Hardiness Zones three through nine.,
Choose savoyed and semi-savoyed varieties to plant in the fall.,
Choose smooth-leafed spinach for a faster growing time.,

Cover the seeds with soil and pat lightly.,
Spread mulch over the planting area.,
Water the planting area thoroughly.,

Thin your plants.,
Keep your planting area moist.,
Cover the soil with a shade cloth if temperatures climb above 80℉ (26°C).,
Fertilize your plants only when necessary.,
Harvest your spinach.,
Overwinter your spinach.",How to Grow Spinach," Spinach is extremely cold-hardy and fares well in these mild to cold climate zones. This cold-weather crop prefers temperatures between 35 and 75℉ (1 and 23°C)., Savoyed varieties are characterized by their dark green crinkly leaves. They are best for planting in the fall because they become especially crisp in cold weather.

, Smooth-leafed spinach grows upright and produces leaves lighter in color than those produced by savoy spinach. It grows quickly and easily and is the perfect addition to any summer salad., Though spinach prefers a mild climate and will not do well in extremely hot temperatures, it does like full sun. Spinach will produce in partial shade, though the yield may not be as impressive, nor the plants as productive.

, Spinach likes a moderately moist habitat, but will not do well in soil that floods regularly or does not drain well. If you cannot find an adequate plot in your garden you can make a raised vegetable garden bed or plant your spinach in a container.


If building a raised vegetable bed, use cedar wood planks if possible. Cedar resists rot when exposed to water.
Because spinach is a small plant that does not grow extremely deep roots, you will not need a large growing space if you are only growing spinach.

, Spinach prefers a slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.5 and 7.0. You can add limestone to the soil to adjust the pH level manually.


Evaluate the soil's calcium and magnesium levels in order to determine what type of limestone to add to your soil. If the soil is low in magnesium, add dolomitic limestone. If it is high in magnesium, add calcitic limestone.
Add the limestone two to three months before planting when possible to allow the soil to absorb it. After the limestone is incorporated, check the pH again., Spinach likes soil rich in organic matter such as manure, alfalfa meal, soybean meal, cottonseed meal, blood meal, or any other high-nitrogen fertilizer. Be sure to mix a few cubic feet of organic material into the soil to ensure adequate richness.


Make sure to remove any rocks or hard clumps of soil before adding the organic fertilizer. You can use a bow rake to check for and remove any unwanted objects.
Pull any weeds or voluntary plants that are growing in the planting area. These may compete with your spinach plants and crowd them and/or transfer disease to them.

, Spinach is a cold-hardy crop with wide range of possible planting dates:


Spring harvest: Plant your spinach four to six weeks before the last spring frost. This early crop can ""bolt"" (grow leggy and bloom), so harvest before you reach 14 hours of sunlight a day for best results. Some cultivars are less likely to bolt than others.Fall harvest: Plant six to eight weeks before the first fall frost for a more reliable fall crop.
Overwinter: Plant spinach in autumn for a small late autumn harvest, followed by a dormant winter period with an early harvest next year. See below for more instructions.

, Make sure the rows are spaced at least eight inches (20cm) apart if planting in rows. Doing so allows the seeds to mature without having to compete for space. Make sure to buy fresh seeds for planting each year, as they do not stay viable for long.








If you are transplanting seedlings, space spinach plants about 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) apart. This allows the seedlings to grow and expand their roots without competing with each other for space.
You can either purchase seedlings at your local nursery or garden supply store or start them indoors in peat pots. However, it is recommended that you grow spinach from seed if possible as seedlings are difficult to transplant and the roots can be damaged in the process., The soil does not need to be compacted over the seeds; in fact it should be rather light and fluffy. Just be sure that the seeds are not exposed to the air and are entirely covered by soil.








, Cover the soil of the planting area with a few inches of hay, straw, leaf, or grass mulch to prevent weeds from sprouting. Pulling unwanted weeds may harm the fragile spinach roots, so mulch is a good alternative for weed control.

, Make sure to use a watering can or a light shower setting on your hose. A strong setting can disrupt the newly planted seeds or even wash them away.








, If you live in a particularly hot climate, consider using cold frames or heavy row covers to keep the soil cool during hot summer days. Also be sure to sow extra seeds and water twice daily if growing in hot weather., As your spinach plants grow into seedlings, thin them lightly to prevent the plants from competing for space. You want the plants to be spaced far enough apart that the leaves of neighboring plants barely touch, if at all. Remove plants several times during growth to keep this balance, saving the tender young leaves for eating.








, You want the spinach to grow in soil that is continually moist but not overly drenched. Depending on the climate, you should water your spinach crop on average once or twice per week.

, Again, spinach does not do well in hot weather. If temperatures begin to climb, you can cover the soil with a shade cloth to lower the temperature of the soil and keep the plants cool.

, If your spinach plants are growing slowly, you may want to add more nitrogen-based fertilizer. As mentioned above, spinach likes soil rich in organic matter such as well-rotted manure, alfalfa meal, soybean meal, cottonseed meal, and blood meal. Add the fertilizer according to label recommendations and water thoroughly.

, As soon as the leaves grow big enough to eat (usually about three or four inches in length and two or three inches wide), you can harvest your spinach leaves. It generally takes about six to eight weeks from planting to harvest.









In the springtime, make sure to harvest spinach leaves before they begin to bolt. Once the plants bolt, the leaves become bitter.
Harvest the spinach by carefully removing the outer leaves. Either pinch at the base of the petiole with your fingers or use gardening shears to snip the base of the petiole.
Alternately, you can harvest the spinach by pulling the entire plant out of the ground. Because spinach does not have very firm roots, it is easy to pull a plant out of the ground entirely.
Removing the outer leaves is preferred to uprooting the entire plant as doing so allows the inner leaves to grow larger, ultimately producing more mature spinach than if the plant is entirely uprooted.


, Spinach is a cold-hardy crop that farmers often maintain over the winter for an early crop next year. During winter, protect your spinach plants in a ""low tunnel"" of row cover over a simple PVC frame, with ventilation to prevent overheating on sunny days. The spinach plants will be semi-dormant during the darker months, requiring infrequent watering and no fertilization. Once longer daylight hours trigger growth in late winter, provide water-soluble fertilizer and care for the growing spinach as you would at other times of year.Some varieties are more cold tolerant than others. Check the seed catalog or contact the seed supplier for more information."

Do some research first.,
Consider the types of vegetables you wish to grow.,
Purchase some galvanised or rust-proofed fencing wire, preferably one with a 1 or 2 inch (2-5cm) gauge gap between the wires that is 1 to 1.5m high.,
Insert the stakes into the ground until they are sturdy (they should not wobble when you push them).,
Wrap the wire around the outside of the stakes and tie them securely.,
Once the wire is firmly tied to the columns and there are no large gaps between the layers, start to fill the column with soil.,
When sowing the seeds, plant them directly where they will grow.,
After each season, it is best to dig in more manure into the column's soil to enrich it, or plant a green manure such as legumes that you dig in and allow the soil to improve by letting it be fallow for a year (this of course is a slower way, but okay if you have time).",How to Grow Vegetables in Wire Columns," Consider where you intend to place the column, as well as the type of produce you intend to grow. Most importantly, consider how big you would like the column to be and an estimate of the circumference of the column. This is best done by drawing a simple plan of where the stakes will fit in, with an estimate of the distance between each stake and then measuring the distance around the outside edge of all the stakes, plus a few inches (centimeters) spare to secure it. This way you can estimate how much wire you will need.


Ideally the column should have full sun, or if you are in a hot environment, dappled shade. It should be sitting on soil, rather than on concrete or paving stones, as the soil will stain the pavement.
If you are in an area that freezes, you might not get a winter use out of this method if you have deep frosts as the column has a higher surface area above ground exposed to air and therefore is more likely to freeze.;
, There are quite a few that work well with the column method:


Potatoes are good for this type of gardening; however, to fully harvest them you often need to pull apart the column, which could make a mess. Potatoes grow well in the tyre (tire), pot, or mounded methods.







Tomatoes are excellent for this type of gardening, as are sweetcorn / maize, capsicums / bell peppers, etc.






Climbers such as beans, peas and cucumbers.






Brassicas such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, etc., lend themselves well to this method but only in low volumes.






Annual herbs such as basil, thyme, rosemary, oregano, etc., are great options.







Melons and other such as pumpkins or squashes can be grown by this method as well.






There are many more, such as: strawberries, root vegetables such as parsnip, beetroot, turnip and carrot, and other leafy greens such as silverbeet, spinach, etc.







, If you can only get small height rolls, you can overlap them. Chicken wire is ideal. You don't want to have too wide a gap, as soil may fall out, or pets or other animals may take advantage of the free food (as per the above image!). At the same time, purchase:


Some extra wire to tie vegetables to the stakes, or to tie the overlapping layers together.
Some sturdy wooden stakes. You can purchase two for a small 1-2 foot (30.4cm to 60.9cm) diameter column, three for a triangle shape, four for a square, five for a larger pentagonal shape, etc. Ideally, the stakes should be at least 1 or 1.5 metres (3-6 feet) high. Higher is okay, but small two feet (60cm) stakes will not give the advantages of the bigger stakes.
Good soil. It is recommended to buy a mixed lot of garden soil, compost, aged blended manure and pea hay or straw. A good recommendation if you are lucky to have a local source, is fresh horse manure, however you will need to wait 2-3 weeks or more to allow it to compost in the column first, as the heat it will generate may kill the seeds. If you grow root vegetables such as carrots, select friable soil with few lumps or obstacles as your carrots may grow bent or twisted in coarse soil.
Your seeds or seedlings.
Any tools you may need to construct the column (such as a mallet, etc).

, Place them in the desired shape and width by following your plan.

, You may overlap the layers if you wish to get more height, but tie them very securely to the stakes and the lower layers.


The ideal height is your waist height; that way it is much easier to tend and harvest your seedlings, rather than bending down all the time.

, If you used fresh horse manure or other compostables, expect the height of the soil to drop as it breaks down. You should allow 2-3 weeks for the manure to break down; if fresh, this will happen quickly. Ultimately, the soil should be a few inches or centimeters below the top height of the wire.


The benefit of having the column contact the soil is that good earthworms are likely to make their residence in the column.
It is better to mix the soils, rather than layering them as too thick layers of straw or hay (if used) may dry out layer above it. Water in thoroughly.

, Planting them with companion planting in mind is excellent advice.


If you wish to grow climbers such as beans or peas, you can insert bamboo stakes as a teepee to support them at the top, or simply have a lower level of soil and use the wire fence as the support - this works, however once the beans die, their stems can be difficult to remove and tend to be unsightly - the bamboo teepee method works better as it leaves less mess.
With ground covers such as pumpkins, you can grow them at the base of the column to spread out, while growing other produce in the top of the column to get best use. Pumpkins grow well in this method as the access to moisture and good soil is quite consistent, so they are less likely to dry out, or gain too much water and split the fruits.
You can also cut holes in the wire to fix plants such as strawberries to grow from the side of the column, as well as plant in the top.

,


If the columns are no longer useful (which can be several years after making them) you can use them to grow things in their sides such as ferns, creepers, bromeliads or orchids (if the climate is right) and other plants, or they are easy to pull apart to use the soil elsewhere. The soil also gradually improves underneath the columns as nutrients and moisture slowly filters down.

The ""Boltardy"" variety of beetroot is best if you're sowing early. White and golden varieties take about half as long to grow and don't bleed in salads (the downside being they don't have that beautiful carmine color). Apart from these things, the variety you choose will depend on the look and flavor that appeals to you most.;
, Beetroot likes neutral, moist, fertile soil without too much lime or acidity (pH 6.5-7.0). The soil should be soft and not have too much clay or too much sand; however, since the root develops at the surface, a clay soil can be tolerated if the top has been loosened by the addition of lots of well-rotted organic matter (don't add this unless the soil has much clay). The position needs to be sunny and open but it will tolerate part shade.


If you have the foresight in late autumn or early spring, it's a good idea to use a general granular fertiliser a few weeks before sowing and rake it into the soil to let the nutrients absorb.

, If you're dealing with the round variety (which you probably are – the long, cylindrical varieties are rarely grown), a pot can work just as well, so long as it's at least 20cm (8in) in diameter and at least 20cm (8in) deep.


Fill the pot up to the top with loose, multi-purpose compost. The seeds should then be sown thinly across the surface and covered with 2cm (0.75in) of compost. Then, when the seedlings reach 2 cm (about an inch) in height, remove the weaker of the seedlings to give the vigorous plants room to grow – aim for about 12cm (5 inches) between seeds.

, Remove weeds and any other debris, as well as any stones that might impede root growth. The soil only needs tilling to one spade blade of depth. Roughly level the area and rake over the top to loosen.


If you have heavy soil, it's best prepared in late autumn. If it's lighter, aim for early spring.If you're planting in autumn, leave the top of the soil rough so the winter weather can break it down.
In the northern hemisphere, sow seeds after the last frost. In the southern hemisphere, sow seeds from September through February.

, Sow your beetroot seeds 2cm (3/4""-1"") deep. Keep seeds or seedlings apart at a distance of at least 5 to 10cm (2-4""). It'll be easiest to plant them in rows.


If you're succession planting, sow beetroot every 14 days for a continuous harvest. This is an easy alternative to succession harvesting.

, At the beginning, your seeds need plenty of water to start the germination process. The roots will take moisture from the soil once they're established.


That being said, avoid over-watering. This causes beetroot to produce more leaves and less root, risking them ""bolting"" (flowering and not producing a vegetable). What's more, under-watering creates woody roots.
Once you have sprouts, only water them every 10-14 days in dry spells.Other than when the weather is unnaturally dry, normal rainfall should be fine.

, Once your beetroots have about 2cm (1 inch) of leaves sprouting, cut the weakest seedlings until the remaining plants are at least 10 cm (4 inches) apart.Do not pull them by hand, since this could disturb the roots of neighbouring plants.


Some people recommend a bit more space than 10 cm. If you have the space, you may want to be a bit more generous.Some people also recommend thinning them out twice – once now and once when they're a few centimeters taller. This stage is up to you., Add 4–6 liters (1.1–1.6 US gal) of complete organic fertiliser per 10 square metres of bed. Add a thin layer of compost or well-rotted manure. You may also want to use 30g of high nitrogen fertiliser per square metre if your plants aren't growing well.


Applying too much nitrogen can cause lots of leafy growth and little root development. If you notice large leaves and smaller roots, reduce fertiliser applications or switch to a fertiliser with lower nitrogen levels.

, Depending on your area, you may need to devise some sort of cover for your plants to keep them away from animals. As for weeds, you'll have to take care of those by hand. As soon as you see one cropping up, get rid of it. However, be careful weeding. Avoid using hoes or other sharp objects near the roots or you might cut them. Hand weeding is best.

, When you can start seeing the root, you will have a good idea of its size. The beetroots are ready to harvest when they are approximately the size of a small orange; too large and they won't be as tasty. Do this by holding the top and leveraging the root up with a fork-like tool or spade.


Generally they're ready around 8 weeks after sowing, or when the veggie reaches 2.5cm (1 inch) in diameter. Many people harvest alternately, picking out some of the beetroots now and leaving others to develop to full maturity. This allows the others to grow bigger more quickly. The ones with a diameter of about 7.5cm (3 inches) usually have the best flavor.

, If desired, you can leave some beetroot in the soil until next spring, but you will need to protect it. Cover it in a heavy mulch of hay or straw. Provided the winter cold doesn't go below -18ºC/0ºF, this should allow you to remove the protective layer of straw and dig up more roots through winter.Be aware that this can cause the beetroots to develop a woody texture.

, Do not cut off the leaves; instead, remove them by twisting about 5cm (2"") above the crown. This will help prevent bleeding, which takes away from the flavour and colour of the beet.


This doesn't mean you should throw them away, however. The tops can be saved, cooked, and eaten like spinach. Believe it or not, they usually have loads of flavour., Root vegetables store well, making them ideal for winter stocking up. Beetroots can be stored layered in sand in wooden boxes in a frost-free, dry environment.


To do this, take a container and line the bottom with 5 cm (2 inches) of sand. Place in a layer of beets. Then, repeat until the container is full. The sand keeps them from sprouting and keeps their flavours fresh.

Consider saving the seeds.",How to Grow Gourds," Gourds come in dozens of species, each with its own unique shape, color, and size. Gourds come in three general types: ornamental gourds (cucurbita), utilitarian gourds (lagenaria), and vegetable sponge gourds (luffa). Also consider including a few different kinds of edible gourds.


Ornamental gourds are brightly colored and oddly shaped, typically used as decoration. The have orange and yellow flowers.
Utilitarian gourds are green while growing, and then dry a brown shade. These gourds are most often used for tools and utensils because of their tough shell.
Vegetable sponge gourds have a shell that can be peeled off, revealing a center that can be used as a sponge. These have yellow flowers while growing.
While not all gourds are edible, many are. You can eat Butternut Squash, Cushaw, Festival Squash, Golden Acorn, and more.Some other edible gourds include: balsam apple, chinese okra, hercules war club, and young luffa.;
, Gourds will grow in most climate zones, but they grow the best in hot weather. If you’re in a location that receives freezing temperatures throughout most of the winter, you will have to start your gourds as seeds indoors prior to sowing them outside. Gourds take about 180 days total from planting till they produce ripe fruit, as a result of their extra long germination process. Keep in mind that if you’re in a cold area, you’ll need to start your seeds 6-8 weeks before the last frost of the season.


Gourds grow best in temperatures between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
Starting gourds indoors simply involves planting the seeds in individual containers, setting up a few grow lights, and watering on a daily basis.

, Trellises are wood or wire constructs built to hold plants off the ground, and in the case of gourds, are used primarily to encourage unique shapes. You do not need a trellis to grow your gourds, as they will grow fine on the ground. However, gourds that grow on the ground will have a flat side where they lay, while gourds that grow on trellises will maintain their rounded shapes. If you decide to use a trellis, set it up prior to planting your gourds, and then stake the plants to it over time.


Large, heavy varieties (like bottle gourds) will require a combination wood and heavy wire trellis in order to support them without falling over.
Small gourd varieties can be grown using a large tomato cage as the trellis.
Luffa (vegetable sponge gourds) almost always need to be trellised.
Using trellises can help prevent your gourds from getting diseases., Gourds should be planted outdoors in full sunlight, with plenty of space to sprawl. Although they can be grown in pots, this will significantly limit their size and overall production. If you’re planting your gourds without a trellis, choose a space with plenty of square footage for growth. Otherwise, stake your trellis out in a wide area with plenty of sunlight and little shade.


Plant your seeds a least 8-10 feet apart in order to properly prevent diseases from forming and spreading., It isn’t too tricky to get soil under the proper conditions for gourds, which makes them easy to grow in most locations. The soil needs to be well-drained and warm. They like plenty of moisture with a bit more clay than sand (meaning they may not thrive in sandy soil). Test the pH of your garden plot to see if it is somewhere between 5.8 and 6.4, which is the best range for gourds.


If your pH is too high, incorporate peat moss to increase the acidity.If the air is warm but the ground is still cold, the gourd plants won't grow well.

, Gourds are infamous for their tough outer seed shell, which is partly responsible for their extra long germination period. To prevent your seeds/gourds from rotting because they took too long to germinate, you can scarify them to speed the process. Use an emery board (paper nail file) or a smooth sandpaper to scratch up the outer surface of the seeds. This shouldn’t take too long; the rough paper should just roughen the coating of both sides of the seed.

, After the seeds have been scarified, place them in a bowl of lukewarm water and allow them to soak. This should be done for a total of 24 hours, in order to help speed up the germination process.

, After soaking for 24 hours, remove the seeds from the water and lay them out to dry on a piece of wax paper. Giving them time to completely dry out will prevent them from rotting before even sprouting.

, It’s a good idea to give your seeds a head start (even if you’re in a warmer area) by planting them in starter sets indoors. Fill small seed trays with your prepared soil, and place a single seed in each slot. Give daily watering until you’re ready to transplant the sprouts outdoors, typically after the last frost of the winter.


Make sure the seeds get plenty of light to keep them from getting too leggy (excessively long and straggly stemmed) later on.

, In the location you’ve selected for your garden plot, use a small trowel or shovel to prepare your rows and hills, or small mounds of earth, for the gourd seedlings. If you’re planting many gourds at once, make sure to follow the seed packet spacing directions strictly. Gourds typically need to be planted several feet away from each other in order to thrive.


Keep your rows near your trellis if you’re using one.

, Place each small seedling or seed into its own individual hill; don’t group several in the same space. Cover up the seeds with ½ inch of dirt, and cover seedlings to the base of the new growth.

, At planting, water the gourd seeds heavily so as to reduce the risk of transplant shock. Gourds like plenty of moisture, so make sure the soil is damp by adding water on a daily basis if necessary. Remove weeds as they sprout, as these will steal valuable nutrients and growing space from the gourds. If you’re using a trellis, as the gourds grow in size you can use a bit of string to secure them to the posts and give them plenty of room for growth.


Add a layer of mulch to the garden plot to lock in moisture and block out new weeds.
Consider incorporating an equal-part fertilizer (like a 10-10-10 mixture) to the soil every few months.
Give your gourds extra water when the weather is particularly dry or hot, to maintain a high level of moisture in the soil

, If you’re growing ornamental gourds, it is common for growers to train them into interesting shapes and structures. There are two general ways to train the shape of a gourd: bending over time, and by giving it a mold. You can slowly bend parts of a gourd as it grows, if you want a winding snake-like gourd in the end. You can also create a mold for your gourd by placing the small fruit inside a breakable vessel of some sort (like a vase). When the gourd has grown, it will fill the container and match its shape; you simply have to break the mold to remove it when done., When your gourds have reached their full size, the vine they’re growing on will start to die off on its own. At this point your gourds are ready for harvesting, but you’ll make the job a lot easier on yourself if you leave them to cure on the vine. Give them several weeks to a month for the curing process to occur; as you check in on them, you’ll notice them getting lighter and lighter. Unless you notice animals and bugs eating the gourds, there’s no fear of rotting or going bad.


If you’re harvesting edible gourds, they’ll need to be removed from the vine when they’re still young.
If you have to cut the gourds early, wait till the vine at the top of the gourd has turned completely brown and dry.
Turn the gourds occasionally and move them around to keep them from touching.

, The curing time varies from gourd to gourd depending on its size (and therefore water content). Check the gourds on a weekly basis to tell if they’re ready. Feel the skin and check the firmness of the gourds; if they are at all soft or squishy, they are rotten and should be thrown out. When the skin feels hard and slightly waxy to the touch, they are likely ready to be cut. Shake the gourd as the final test to see if they are fully cured; if they are ready, they’ll sound like a rattle with the seeds banging around on the inside. Use a pair of scissors or shears to cut the gourds from the vine.

, Although it is not required, you can treat the shell of the gourd to change its appearance and to help it last longer. Wash the gourd with a bit of dish detergent and warm water to kill off any bacteria. You can then use a bit of sandpaper or steel wool to shine the outside of the gourd, and add a layer of wax or shellac to finish off the shine. You can decorate gourds by painting the outsides as well.

, Your gourd will last for many years with the seeds inside, but if you would like to save the seeds for the next year’s planting, you may do so. Cut the gourd open to remove the seeds from the inside. Follow the same process of propagating the seeds (as aforementioned) to help speed up their growth. You can keep the shell of the old gourd, and you’ll have the seeds to create plenty of new gourds as well."

The finished bed frame will be 45cm deep (2x 22.5 cm width of scaff plank) - so you leave a 10cm 'foot' at the bottom to help anchor it in the ground.;
, Pre-drill the holes for 2 screws, through the scaff plank and the support 2x4 from the outside. Use a drill bit smaller than the screw width. This is vital, as the screws are so long, they become impossible to tighten without pre-drilling.


Attach the scaff plank to the support 2x4.
Repeat until you have your frame completed frame.

, Measure out a 6x4' area on the ground where you want your raised bed to sit and mark it using sticks and string - this will ensure your edges are straight. (Choose a sunny spot for best veg results.) Make sure you have the required 10cm depth dug at the corners for the frame feet.


Dig over the top layer of soil, piling the dug earth to the centre.

, With the help of a friend, flip your raised bed frame and lay it, feet first, on to the dug area of the same size. Use the spirit level to ensure the frame is sitting level.

Keep the ground moist.,
Hill the soil periodically.,
Weed the leek bed.",How to Grow Leeks2," Plant the leek seedlings at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep and 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart. Pat the soil around the base of the leak so that it covers the roots and reaches the cleft where the leaves spread apart. The process of slightly mounding the dirt in this way is called ""hilling.""Instead of hilling, you can help the leek stems blanch by putting a cardboard tube over each plant, so that it rests around the base. This serves the dual purpose of keeping the sun away and keeping dirt out of the leek's leaves.

, The leeks' roots are shallow, and must be protected so that they stay moist. Water the leek bed thoroughly after planting, then mulch the leek bed with straw to protect it throughout the growing season.

, Water the leeks frequently to keep them growing healthy and strong. Do not let the soil dry out. Leeks need to be given a good soaking at least twice a week, and more often if you live in a dry place with little rain.

, About halfway through the growing season, hill the soil around the base of the leeks again, so that it reaches the place where the leaves cleave apart. The higher the hill, the larger the edible white part of the leek will be. However, hilling too high can cause the leeks to rot.

, Since leeks have shallow roots, it's important to weed frequently so they don't have to compete for nutrients. Weed the leek bed frequently throughout the growing season.

"
"
Harvest leeks when their stems are 1"" in diameter.,
Dig around the leek bases and pull them out.,
Wash the stems.,
Store the leeks.",How to Grow Leeks3," Leeks are generally ready to eat when their stems are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. However, if you have a taste for young leeks, they can be harvested at any time. Younger leeks are less flavorful but they are more tender, and may be eaten like scallions.


You can leave leeks in the ground until they get quite large if you don't want to harvest them all at once. Plan to remove them all before the ground freezes in the fall.

, Keep the roots intact when you harvest the leeks. Use a spade to dig around the base of the leek, then gently pull on the leaves to remove it from the ground.

, The leeks will need a good scrubbing to remove the soil from their stems. Wash away all of the dirt using a vegetable scrub brush.

, Leeks can be stored in the refrigerator if you plan to eat them within the week. Wash and dry the leeks and place them in a plastic bag or in your vegetable crisper. When you're ready to cook them, remove the roots and the green part of the leaves, and process the white portion of the stem to use in a recipe.


For longer-term storage, keep the roots attached to the leeks and trim back the leaves until just 1 inch (2.5 cm) of green remains. Store them upside down in a wooden box, and back them with sawdust. Place the box in a cool cellar for up to 8 weeks.You can also freeze leeks. Remove the roots and leaves and blanch the white stems. Place the blanched stems in freezer bags and store for several months.

Peppers come in many different varieties, and some options might not be available at all times of the year. Shop around until you find a place that sells healthy, organic green pepper seeds.If you have a large garden, make the most of your planting space and look into other types of peppers that can be grown alongside green peppers.
You can also save and reuse seeds from the previous year's harvest if you've grown green peppers in the past.;
, The green pepper seeds require a lot of moisture and warmth to start growing. Wet two folded paper towels with warm water, wring out the excess and sandwich the green pepper seeds between them. Then, slide the paper towels into a Ziploc bag and store it somewhere warm. The plant’s initial growth will take place inside the bag!Green pepper plants need to grow for 8-10 weeks prior to the final frost of early spring before they can be transplanted outside.
You also have the option of buying green peppers that are past their germination stage if you want to begin the process of growing them in your garden immediately.

, After the seeds have sprouted, you should move them to small individual planters such as flower pots. There, they will begin to absorb moisture and nutrients from soil. Keep the soil moist, but don’t overwater. A couple tablespoons of water every day should be sufficient for plants growing indoors.Basic flower pots will do the trick, but you could also look into a germination mat or another indoor planter that encourages seedling growth and takes up minimal space.Young plants that grow slowly and produce droopy, shriveled fruit or foliage may be receiving too much or too little water.

, Take the seedlings you planted in shallow planters and set them on the window sill to soak up light and warmth during the day. It’s important for green peppers to have ample light in order to grow. If weather permits, open the window to expose the pepper seedlings to direct sunlight. Water lightly and store them someplace warm during chilly nights.After seeding them inside, you should gradually begin to expose your green pepper plants to outdoor conditions. Leaving the window open to allow direct sunlight and air flow is a good way to start.Green peppers should get at least 5-6 hours of sunlight per day.

, Transplanting should be done immediately following the last frost of early spring when the weather begins to warm. In hotter climates, this will usually be around March or April. If you live in a location that experiences lasting winter temperatures, you might have to wait until closer to summer to plant viable young peppers. Green peppers can be grown basically year-round in arid regions where the environment is hot and temperate. Just make sure your plants get enough water if you're growing them in a place that's hot with dry conditions.Most people should plan on starting their seedlings indoors around late January or early February and transplanting them after around 10 weeks.Keep row covers on your green pepper plants at night to help them retain heat, even after the last frost of the season has ended.

, Set aside a corner of your garden with plenty of room to continue growing the green peppers. The site you choose should have soil that is well-drained, rich and dark. Try to choose a location that receives direct sunlight, and make sure you plant the peppers far enough away from other hearty fruits and vegetables to avoid competition for nutrients.Green peppers do best if they’re grown in places with temperatures around 70 degrees or hotter.Don’t plant harvesting vegetables like green peppers near leafy plants that may be eaten by rabbits and other foraging animals.

, Use a shovel or hand trowel to dig holes roughly 6-8 inches deep and 10-12 inches wide. Aerate the soil around the holes thoroughly. Plant the green pepper seedlings in the holes and refill them loosely.Green peppers should be planted approximately 12-18 inches apart to have room to grow without overtaking one another.

, Work a little 5-10-10 fertilizer into the soil to keep the pepper plants fed. Don’t use too much: about a teaspoon worth will do the trick. Green peppers take most of their sustenance from the soil they grow in, so overfertilizing can actually leach nutrients from the plants and in severe cases may even kill them.Some gardeners recommend placing a few matchsticks heads-down in the soil around a pepper plant to give them the little bit of sulfur they require., In order to keep your green peppers growing healthy and robust, you need to keep them warm. Shield the plants with insulated row covers on particularly cold nights or whenever a frost is expected. The row covers trap the heat that the peppers need while also providing a barrier from precipitation, runoff and grazing scavengers.It’s okay to leave row covers on heat-loving plants like green peppers in milder climates.
Always wait until early spring to plant peppers. Chill weather can kill them or severely hinder their growth.

, Give your green pepper plants a healthy drink every 1-2 days, depending on what the weather is like. Peppers grown in hotter climates will likely need more water. An inch or two of water per week is best for most green pepper plants of average size in moderate growing conditions. Avoid overwatering, as this can kill the plant or make it susceptible to disease.Make sure plot you pick out is well-drained so that water doesn’t pool around the plants and turn the soil soggy.

, Break up the soil around the plants every few weeks and add a shovelful of mulch or compost. Your green peppers will grow more efficiently if they can feed off the organic matter. Some pepper plants don’t even need a separate fertilizer if a little compost is added to the soil at intervals.Organic materials like mulch also help the soil retain moisture, which is useful for making sure green pepper plants get enough water in hot weather.
Since calcium deficiency can cause the bottom end to rot on peppers, you can increase the amount of calcium in your soil by grinding eggshells and mixing it in with your soil (alternatively, use lime). If you use a fertilizer, make sure it has lower nitrogen content and it is not ammonia-based. Excess nitrogen and ammonium can be a cause of calcium deficiency.

, As your peppers grow, the fruit can become heavy, putting strain on the stalk. Correct this by tying the pepper stalks to wooden garden stakes, which will help the plant support its own weight. Stakes can be bought cheap at most gardening centers.Secure the plant’s stalks to the stakes using pantyhose or rubber bands rather than ordinary plastic ties. The added flexibility will ensure that the tie doesn’t constrict the plant’s growth or cause stress or breakage to the stalk.
Tomato cages are a wonderful alternative to basic wooden stakes. These help support the plant and also protect it from animals., Green peppers are ready to be harvested by the time they’ve reached the desired size, typically 3-4 inches in length. Most of the time, however, knowing whether a pepper is ripe is determined by its color. Mature peppers will exhibit a deep green hue that is darker than the stalk and stem of the plant. Remove ripe peppers from their stems using a sharp knife or gardening shears. Rinse and dry peppers before cooking with them, or store them in the refrigerator until they’re ready to be used.Most varieties of sweet peppers, like green peppers, will be ready to harvest between 60-90 days after they're transplanted outdoors.Green peppers will stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

Look up the frost dates in your area and plant corn at least two weeks after the last frost of the season is expected to happen.The date will vary depending on where you live. If you live in a southern area, you will be able to plant corn earlier than if you live in a more northern area.
Wait until the soil is above 60 degrees F (15.5 degrees C).;
, There are many kinds of sweet and super sweet corn, all of which mature at different rates. In general, if you live in a cooler climate, it's best to plant corn varieties that are early bloomers.Breeder's Choice is a very common sugar corn that has light yellow kernels that are sweet and creamy. It freezes well and grows in a variety of climates.
How Sweet Is It is a variety that resists most diseases that affect sweet corn, though it is a late bloomer and grows best in warmer climates.
Divinity is a white, tender sweet corn that has a high drought tolerance and also resists some diseases.
Sugar and Gold as well as Butter and Sugar are both early-blooming varieties of corn that do well in cooler climates.

, Corn is a wind-pollinated plant, meaning that the wind blows the pollen from one plant onto another. For this reason, it’s important to plant corn in a block formation rather than long rows, because then the pollen can more easily blow onto the other stalks.


Find an area to grow the corn that is at least four feet by four feet (1.2 by 1.2 m) and is also in direct sunlight.
Make sure that you consider the height of the corn compared with your other plants. The corn will cast shade on other plants depending on where you plant it.

, Before you begin sowing the corn seeds, you should clear the square or rectangular area where you're planting the corn of weeds. Weeds can get in the way of the growth of seedlings, and they also sap the soil of the nutrients that delicate young plants need to grow.


Clear the entire area that you are using to grow the corn. Pull the weeds up from the roots so that the weeds won’t eventually grow back.
Also remove any large stones or rocks and break up large clumps of soil.

, Before you plant the sweet corn, spread compost over the entire planting area in a layer that is 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) deep. Compost provides nitrogen and other soil nutrients, and also helps the soil to retain moisture., After you lay down the compost, spread a layer of 10-10-10 fertilizer over the mulch, using about 1 cup (236 ml) for every 10 square feet (3 square meters) of corn you are planting.The fertilizer will enhance the growth of the corn and give the soil an extra dose of nutrients.

, After you have cleared the area where you are planting the corn, you can begin sowing the seeds. Plant the corn seeds in the soil in at least four rows that are four feet (1.2 m) long, putting the seeds 1 ½ inches (3.8 cm) deep into the soil. Plant each seed about 9-12 inches (22.8- 30.4 cm) apart from one another.When putting the seeds into the ground, use your thumb to make the 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) hole. Drop in the seed, then brush over some dirt to cover and protect the seed.
If you want to plant more than four rows, just try to make sure that the plants end up being in a square or rectangular formation, with all the seeds being around 9-12 inches (22.8- 30.4 cm) apart.
Different varieties of sweet corn mature at different rates. If you want a long harvest season, plant a few varieties of sweet corn.
If you are planting different varieties of corn, make sure to plant the same varieties in at least two side-by-side rows so that they can pollinate effectively.
If you can find some pre-started seedlings at your local garden store or nursery, then this is a great option as well.

, Directly after you finish planting, generously water the soil until it is rich and dark. Watering the seeds right after you plant them is vital to the corn’s ability to grow and flourish., It’s important to keep your corn properly hydrated when it is first growing. If three or four days after planting there has not been any rain, be sure to water your corn.Water it enough so that the soil is dark and moist, but not so much that the water starts to pool.

, Sweet corn requires about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week as it is starting to grow, so you may need to water your plants if you live in a dry area where you don’t get a lot of rain. To water your corn, use a soaker hose and spray the water as close to the surface of the soil as you can.Avoid spraying the tops of the plants, as this can cause the pollen to wash away from the silk of the corn.
After the corn silks form at the top of the plant, the corn will need one inch (2.5 cm) of water every five days.

, Whenever you notice new weeds emerging, pull them up by the roots to clear the area. Weeds drain the soil of the nutrients that corn needs to grow. Be careful as you weed to not pull up the shallow roots of the corn plants.


Corn often grows suckers, or offshoots, which can be easily mistaken for weeds if you do not see that they are attached to the corn plant. While some plants benefit from the removal of suckers, cutting suckers off of corn can actually harm the roots, so it’s best to leave them be., After six weeks, the corn should be steadily growing at around 1 ½ feet (45.7 cm) tall, and should have started sprouting tassels. At this point, spread another layer of 10-10-10 fertilizer around the plants, using 1 cup (236 ml) for every 10 feet (3 m) of corn row., Corn is especially susceptible to corn earworms, which develop when earworm moths lay eggs on newly developing corn silks. To prevent these pests from growing in the silks and eating the ears of corn, spray the corn husks every few weeks with a solution made of equal parts vegetable oil and water, with a few drops dishwashing liquid added in., Small animals like squirrels, birds and raccoons can also eat your corn. Avoid attracting these animals by clearing out old cornstalks or other decaying plant matter from the garden.


If you notice raccoons around your corn, consider installing an electric fence around the corn to fend them off. You can also try to plant especially tall varieties of corn so that raccoons cannot access the ears.

, Keep an eye on your corn and note the day when you notice the corn silks starting to emerge from the ears. Three weeks after the day that the corn silks appear, start to test the ears for ripeness. To check if the corn is ripe, pull back part of the husk on one ear of corn and pierce a kernel of corn with your fingernail.When corn is ripe, thick, milky liquid should spurt from the kernel. If the corn is not yet quite ripe, the liquid will be watery. The milk stage, or prime ripeness stage of corn, usually lasts for about a week.
You may be able to tell from the husks and silks which corn should be tested. When ears are ready to be picked, the husks of the corn are usually tightly folded and green as opposed to yellowish, and the corn silk is dark brown as opposed to golden.If you tested an ear of corn that isn’t ripe, make sure to fold the husk back so that it surrounds the cob again. This will stop pests from accessing the cob.

, If you tested an ear of corn and it is ready to be picked, hold the stalk with your non-dominant hand, then use your dominant hand to quickly and firmly push down and snap the ear by its base, then twist and pull it away from the stalk. This should leave you with a full ear of unhusked corn, as well as a small amount of the rod-like base from which the corn grew., After you pick your corn, it’s best to eat it as soon as possible. You can leave it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or overnight, but the freshness will be diminished. To have the best tasting corn, remove the husk and silks, wash the corn, then grill it or boil it directly after picking it.You can also freeze corn by carving off the kernels from the cob, placing them in airtight bags, and storing them in the freezer. You also may Can Corn by hermetically sealing the corn kernels in canning jars.

, After you have removed your first ripe ears of corn, keep checking on the plants. Each cob of the same type of corn should ripen in the same couple of months, and you don’t want to miss any fresh corn!


If you are growing multiple varieties of corn, keep in mind that they will mature at different rates. Keep tabs on all the varieties of corn you are growing so that you will be able to harvest them at the correct time.

Obtain some Moringa seeds from one of the many sources that sell them.,

Decide where you would like to grow your Moringa tree.,

Get the best organic potting soil that you can find.,
Make a hole in the soil, and plant the Moringa seeds about ¾"" to 1"" deep, cover with soil, and tamp it into place.",How to Grow a Moringa Tree," There are several varieties, but the seeds of Moringa oleifera and Moringa stenopetala are the easiest to obtain. In the photo, the Moringa oleifera seeds are the brown, winged seeds in the photo; on the left hand side. The Moringa stenopetala seeds are the tan ones in the photo; on the right hand side. It is readily apparent that they do not resemble each other, but both are Moringa seeds.


 








For a fast-growing tree that will bear leaves, blossoms and seed pods - called drumsticks - the first year, choose Moringa Oleifera. Here is a good illustration, of why it is best to keep your Moringa trees at a manageable height; it makes harvesting the leaves and pods much easier to do. The drumsticks shown, hanging from the Moringa tree, contain the Moringa tree's seeds. They can be planted as soon as the pod is dry, or stored for planting later.
If you want a fast-growing tree with much larger leaves, making the task of gathering them for a meal easier, opt for Moringa Stenopetala.
The flowers and seed pods take longer to develop on the African variety of Moringa - Moringa Stenopetala.
The seeds are very different, but they both grow Moringa trees. In actuality, the seeds are basically the same size; but, you can see they are not alike in appearance. Moringa Oleifera seeds are round, brown, and winged. Moringa Stenopetala seeds, out of their husk, are almond-shaped and light tan.;
, Keep in mind that Moringa trees can grow over 20 feet (6.1 m) tall, their first year. The average growth is about 15 feet (4.6 m), however, in optimum conditions, they can grow much taller. Because the branches will grow, on the average, to about three to four feet wide the first year, you will need to consider whether you want to plant your Moringa tree close to any existing structures. Moringas need much sunlight, warmth, and water, to thrive - so think about where your tree will obtain the best exposure to the sun., Moringas do not like heavy, clay-like soil or vermiculite. They will grow in poor soil, sandy soil, and depleted soil, but they do not like their roots getting wet. Bear this in mind, and if necessary, purchase sand to add to the potting soil mixture, or use whatever soil is available in your area, and add coconut coir, peat moss, perlite, or sand to loosen it. This gives the roots of the Moringa tree room to go deep, and drain well. Moringa has a taproot, which means a single root that goes straight down like a carrot. It has small feeder roots but does not have branching roots. Plant where the taproot has lots of room to go down. If planting in a container, find the deepest one you can. Moringa can be grow as a solitary tree, in rows, or as a hedge.

If you would like to grow it as a hedge, plant the seeds into the ground, about 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. Pinch back every other new leaf growth, to force the tree to grow like a bush, and once they are about 2 feet (0.6 m) tall, cut the branches in half lengthwise, and pinch back the new leaf growth that will sprout out at the top of the Moringa tree.




 Moringa seedlings in rows

If you are going to grow your Moringas in rows, then plant the seeds about 3 feet (0.9 m) apart, in rows that are at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart, for easy weed removal and walking through the rows.
If you are going to grow your Moringa as a solitary tree, just remember to give it plenty of room, so its branches can spread out. Periodically, cut back the top of the tree, to encourage new growth, and cut the branches' length back, by half. This will insure that your Moringas thrive, and give you lots of beautiful flowers, edible leaves, and drumsticks - for years to come.

, Make a note of when you planted the seed or seeds, so you can monitor their growth. Once you have covered the seeds, thoroughly water the soil. Whether you plant the seeds in pots, or right into the ground, they will need a thorough soaking every day, until you see the seedlings emerge from the soil. Once they have sprouted, they can be watered once every other day, until they are about 18 inches (45.7 cm) tall. Then, once a week will be sufficient.

Some people soak the seeds in water until they sprout, and then plant them. This method also works, but Moringa seeds are very hardy, and do not need this additional step.

Introduce the scion.,
Tie the scion to the rootstock.,
Remove the tie.,
Follow up on your bud.,
Remove other material.",How to Graft a Tree1," In order for your budding to be successful, you must cut a scion (small piece for grafting) from a healthy, disease-free cultivar (origin tree) as well as a suitable growing tree (rootstock). The rootstock in this case is an established tree that the scion can be spliced into. For T-budding, the bark of both trees must be ""slipping."" This means the bark is easily peeled off and the green layer underneath is moist, which usually occurs in the spring. Try irrigating them well to help them along.


T-Budding is typically used for fruit tree propagation.;
, For T-budding, you must cut into the branch 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) below the bud to 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) beyond the bud. Make the cut as deep as needed to include the soft, green layer beneath the bark but not any deeper. This green material must be exposed on your scion for a successful graft. If you must store your scion bud, wrap it in a damp paper towel, place it in a polyethylene bag, and store it in a refrigerator., Choose a space on a branch or sapling that is 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. The space must be free of any buds, ideally far from any buds. Make a vertical slice in the bark about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long and deep enough to expose that green layer. Make a horizontal slice of the same depth that is about one third the distance around the rootstock. Twist the knife in the juncture of the slices to create flaps of the bark, making the green layer visible.

, Slip the scion containing the bud under the flaps you've just created on the rootstock, taking care not to introduce any dirt or germs. If part of the scion's bark sticks out above the T-cut, slice it off so that everything fits together snugly.

, Wrap a stretchy rubber material such as grafting rubber around the rootstock to hold the scion in place. Be careful not to jostle or cover the bud.

, In about a month, the rubber you wrapped around the rootstock may loosen and fall off. If it doesn't, gently remove it yourself so that the area will not be constricted.

, If the bud looks plump and healthy, it is probably alive. If it looks shriveled, then it has died and you'll have to start again.

, The next spring, once the bud has begun to sprout leaves, make a sloped cut 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) above the successful bud. Remove all other side shoots below the bud. This will promote growth of the grafted bud since it will be the only thing bing nourished by the rootstock.

Plan your cut.,
Cut the limb from the underside about 1/2 way through but stop before the saw binds.,
Make a second cut at ‘B’, slightly further out on the limb and from the top.

,
Allow the branch to break free and fall under its own weight.

,
Cut the remaining stub off from ‘E’ to ‘F’,(to prevent tearing the bark make a small cut at 'F' first) make the cut close to the main trunk.,
Cut flush with the outer edge of the branch collar, and healing will proceed much faster.",How to Cut a Limb from a Tree," Decide which branch(es) you will cut and where. You may wish to cut a branch for aesthetic reasons (because it overhangs something or grows in a direction it shouldn't) or because branches are rubbing or damaged.


If you have any doubts about which branches to cut or how to cut them safely, hire a tree service.

Prune branches smaller than about 5cm (2 inches) in diameter with bypass loppers. Use the technique below for larger branches.;
, This cut should be made at ‘A’ in the picture above.

,,,


Don't cut into the ""branch collar"" of the limb being removed. This will actually inhibit healing.
Search ""branch collar"" images on your browser if you have trouble seeing it. The branch collar can be identified on most trees as a bulge where the limb meets the trunk but can be hard to see on young trees or trees that grow slowly.

,

Save your money, use clean, sharp tools and don't paint the cut. At one time it was common practice to paint tree cuts, but it's been shown to harm trees more than help.Leave the wound free to dry naturally.

Chip Budding is one of the easiest ways to graft, and is particularly good for fruit trees.

, Make a small angled cut about 1/5 to 1/4 the rootstock's diameter into the rootstock. Slice your knife downward at this depth for 1 1⁄4 to 1 1⁄2 inches (3.2 to 3.8 cm). Remove your knife without severing the bark. Move the knife upward a small amount and then cut back in and downward to meet the end of the initial slice to create a small notch. Remove the chunk of bark from the rootstock.

, Use the chunk cut from your rootstock as the model for your scion, using the scion bud as the center point of the new cutting. You want the scion to fit into the space made in the rootstock as neatly as possible.

, Slip the scion down into the notch at the bottom of the rootstock cut. Make sure that the green layers of the scion and rootstock are touching all the way around the edges. If they are not, the graft will fail.

, Wrap a stretchy rubber material around the rootstock to hold the scion in place. Polyethylene tape is preferable. Be careful not to jostle or cover the bud.


Some of the specifics of this process will depend on what kind of tree you are growing and what kind of material you're using. For example, if you use grafting tape and grafting an apple tree, you had better cover the whole thing with the tape, as the tape will protect the bud from drying, and it will be torn by the bud as it grows. But other materials may not give the same protection, and may be more difficult to tear. Large buds are difficult to fully cover, and can be exposed to air. It depends on the fruit.

, In about a month, the rubber you wrapped around the rootstock may loosen and fall off. If it doesn't, gently remove it yourself so that the area will not be constricted.

, If the bud looks plump and healthy, it is probably alive. If it looks shriveled, then it has died and you'll have to start again.

, The next spring, once the bud has begun to sprout leaves, make a sloped cut 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) above the successful bud. Remove all other growth below the bud to promote growth through the grafted bud.

The graft must be made after the threat of cold but before the bark of the stock begins slipping (peels off easily).
The scion must be dormant (not sprouting) at this time, and should be a twig about a foot long containing three to five buds.

, Remove the terminal end of the scion. At the base of the scion, make a sloping cut to remove that end.

, Make a sloping cut across the chosen branch that mirrors the one you made on the scion. They should fit together precisely.

, Make matching slices down into both the rootstock and the scion in such a way that they can hook into each other.

, Place the scion slightly offset from the rootstock and slide it down so that the tongues overlap. Make sure that the layer of green wood beneath the bark of both parties aligns or the graft will not take.

, Wrap a stretchy rubber material around the graft site to hold the scion in place. Grafting tape works well. If using a different material, be sure to remove it in about a month.

, Once the graft is planted, keep an eye out for new growth below the graft, as you may need to remove it. At first, you can leave some leaves on the rootstock so that nutrients keep flowing up the tree until the graft is successful. However, if you see an actual young branch/shoot forming on the trunk of the rootstock, remove it; this will help encourage the scion to grow.

Once the scion really starts to grow and a few new leaves appear above the graft (5 or so healthy leaves), remove any further growths from the rootstock, below the graft. This removal will help the plant thrive with growth on the scion, rather than the rootstock, and has to be done as long as the tree is alive. Otherwise, the rootstock will try to make its own branches; you'll need to remove them whenever they grow.

Rootstock should be straight, smooth, vertical branches 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) in diameter.
Bark grafts should be performed once the rootstock bark has begun slipping (when the bark is easily peeled off in spring).
This graft is usually used for instances in which the rootstock is too big for whip grafting.

, Above a crotch out of which several branches grow, cut straight across one branch with a very sharp saw so as not to crack or rip the bark or wood of the branch. Make sure you leave a branch nearby to keep nutrients moving up the tree.

, Cut the scions down to around 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length while still retaining about 5 buds per scion. Around three inches from the base of the scion, make a sloping cut inward until you reach the base.

, Hold each scion up against the rootstock so that about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) of the cut surface of the scion shows above the rootstock. With a sharp knife, outline each scion on the rootstock. Remove the scions and finish cutting away this bark so that each will fit snugly into its space.

, Place each scion in its space on the rootstock, taking special care to ensure the green wood of both parties aligns exactly. Once in place, hammer two wire nails into each scion to hold them into the tree.

, Pour grafting wax or asphalt water emulsion over the area to seal all cut surfaces from drying and bacteria. Check the seal again the next day to make sure no holes have formed.

, Keep removing all growth below the graft. Once one scion shows more promise than the other(s), leave that one as is while pruning the less successful graft(s). Two summers after grafting, remove all but the strongest scion.

Cleft grafts should be performed right before the bark of the rootstock starts slipping (being easily peeled off) in spring.
This graft is usually used for top working (changing the type of fruit) of a mature tree by being performed on a number of branches.

, Choose a point below which the branch is straight and blemish-free for six inches and then make a clean perpendicular cut, removing the rest of the branch. Be careful not to tear or split the branch or bark. Be sure to leave a branch that has sprouted nearby to keep nutrients moving up the tree.

, Use a cleft-graft knife or a hatchet to split the branch straight down the center for about 6 inches (15.2 cm).

, Remove the tip and the base of the scion. Beginning just below the bottom bud, make a sloping cut on either side of the scion that reaches all the way to the bottom.

, Using a large screwdriver or small chisel to hold open the cleft in the rootstock, insert a scion into either side of the cleft. Make sure once again that the green layer of the wood, not the bark, is aligned. No cut surface on the scion should be visible above the top of the rootstock.

, Pour grafting wax or asphalt water emulsion over the area to seal all cut surfaces from drying and germs. Check the seal again the next day to make sure no holes have become exposed.

, Keep removing all growth below the graft. Once one scion shows more promise than the other, leave that one as is while pruning the less successful graft. Two summers after grafting, remove all but the strongest scion.

The soil should be at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius) before you plant your corn.To measure the temperature of the soil, buy a soil thermometer at a local greenhouse or online. Make a hole 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) deep in the soil using a screwdriver and then insert your thermometer. Refer to package instructions to figure out how long to leave your thermometer in the ground.Different thermometers may have special instructions or recommendations, so always read the package before using a soil thermometer.;
, Corn thrives in a sunnier area that's somewhat protected from the wind. An area like a valley that collects a lot of sun can be a good place to plant corn.Corn needs protection from the wind to thrive. If you have an area that's surrounded by taller trees, plant your corn here. Trees can serve as a natural windbreaker, protecting your corn from wind as it grows., Gem corn should not be planted in rows. It does better in blocks about three by three feet (approximately one by one meters). Make sure the space you choose is big enough for your corn.When placing the seeds in the soil, make sure you plant them one inch deep into the ground.

, Do not plant corn seeds too close together. Corn needs space to grow. Seeds should be planted about a foot apart. Any closer will affect corns ability to grow, and can affect pollination., Not all your seedlings will be able to grow into corn stocks. Corn should start growing in 7 to 10 days. Even if you planted the seeds a foot apart, some corn may grow too close together. In general, you want one stock of corn per foot. You will have to remove seedlings that are growing too close together.You do not have to uproot corn seedlings. You can cut off unwanted seedings at soil level.
It does not matter which seedlings you cut. However, if one seedling is growing bigger and faster than another, it may make sense to cut the shorter seedling.

, Wind is a major problem for corn and can affect growth. In order to encourage gem corn to grow, take measures to keep your plants safe from the wind.You should invest in windbreaks, which are six foot tall fences designed to protect stalks from the wind. If your corn is not already in a fence or near trees, have windbreaks put up.Windbreaks should allow some airflow, as this will diffuse wind without causing harm to the structures. Leave small spaces between different pieces of fence.
You can also install a fence that is partially opened, like a lattice fence.

, Corn does not actually need a lot of water. Do not give your corn more than an inch of water each week. You should sprinkle water about an inch deep into the ground when you notice the soil is getting dry.Water should be applied at the surface using a soaker hose. You should never water plants from above as this could strip flowering stocks of pollen., You can get this kind of fertilizer at a local greenhouse. Opt for a fish-based fertilizer, which you can get at a local greenhouse.Pay attention to the balance of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, which should be somewhere on the label of a fertilizer. They are written in a series of numbers.For example, a fertilizer with equal parts nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium would have a 10-10-10 balance. Corn requires a lot of nitrogen, so go for a fertilizer where the first number is equal to or greater than the second and third.
Apply fertilizer by sprinkling it evenly over the patch of soil surrounding the corn.
You should use four to five pounds of fertilizer per 100 square feet of corn.

, Before harvesting your corn, make sure the ears of corn are ready to remove from the stalks. Three weeks after the corn appears silky, peel back some of the corn husk. With your finger, gently prick a kernel of corn. Watch for a milky liquid to leak out. Corn that emits such a liquid is ready to harvest., If possible, only harvest corn shortly before using it. This way, corn will be at its sweetest and freshest when you eat it. However, if you prefer less sweet corn, you can wait about two days after the corn ripens to harvest it.If you're using gem corn for decorative purposes, however, you can pick it as soon as it's ripe.

, To remove corn from the stocks, grab onto an ear of corn. Twist the corn while moving your hand downward. It should come off of the stock. Examine the ear of corn for any bugs before bringing it into your home., Not all of your ears of corn will be safe to eat or use as decoration. After harvesting the ripe ears, examine each of them. Peel back the husks. Duller corn, or corn that is bruised or rotting, should be discarded. Some ears may also be very small and stubby. Smaller ears may not be worth cooking or using as decoration as they have so few kernels."

Research the area you plan to plant.,
Know how to plant sweet corn.,
Learn about dent corn.,
Understand the basic type of flint corn.",How to Grow Corn from Seed1," It is important to know about the climate and soil type, so as to make preparations for each different kind of corn. Some types of corn prefer warmer/cooler soil and different soil pH levels., Sweet corn is the classic variety typically eaten on the cob or from a can. It is known for a golden yellow kernel and a light, sweet flavor. Sweet corn is most commonly used in home gardens.


Standard sweet corn (labeled as ‘su’ on seed packets) is the most mild of the sweet corns. Over 50% of the sugar contained in standard sweet corn is converted to starch within 24 hours of being picked, so it must be consumed or canned soon after being harvested.
Sugar enhanced sweet corn (labeled as ‘se’ on seed packets) is genetically modified to slow the sugar to starch conversion rate, increasing the sweetness and tenderness of the kernels.
Super sweet corn (labeled as ‘sh2’ on seed packets) is the sweetest variety available. It’s kernels are slightly smaller than other sweet corn varieties, and shrivel when dried., Dent or field corn is not typically grown to eat raw. It is used primarily as feed for animals or for use in making many processed foods. Growing dent corn is beneficial for use on a farm or for selling to other farms.

, Flint corn, also called Indian corn, is characterized by hard, multi-colored kernels. It has uses similar to dent corn, but is not grown as widely in the United States as its preferred habitat is in central and South America. It is often used for its decorative purposes."

Know when to plant.,
Choose a location.,
Prepare the soil.",How to Grow Corn from Seed2," Depending on your region, you will need to plant seeds at a different time. Typically, the best time to plant is between May and June. Be wary of planting too early, since the seeds will rot if the soil is too cold.If you have a soil thermometer, check the temperature regularly and wait to plant until the soil reaches 65ºF (18ºC).

, Corn likes to grow in areas of full sun, so select a garden plot that is out in the open. Try to choose an area relatively free of weeds, as corn as a difficult time competing with them in a bed., Corn prefers soil that is nitrogen rich and well manured.


If possible, plant in soil that you have already grown beans or peas in, as they help to enrich the soil with more nitrogen.
Remove all weeds from the area.
If the soil is below {{convert|60|F}, increase the temperature by covering the ground in black plastic and cutting holes to plant the corn through.Add compost or manure to the soil two and four weeks before planting so that it has time to incorporate with the soil.

Plant your corn.,
Water the corn.,
Weed around young plants.,
Wait.,
Pick your corn and enjoy.",How to Grow Corn from Seed3," For every one person who intends on consuming corn, plant ten to fifteen plants. If each plant is 100% successful, they should produce two ears of corn apiece.


Corn is wind-pollinated, so it is best to plant it in blocks rather than individual rows so that the pollen has a better chance of germinating.
Plant the seeds every 3 inches (7.5 cm) along rows, with 24–36 inches (61.0–91.4 cm) of space between rows. Plant at least four rows so the wind can spread pollen between them.Plant the seeds 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) below the surface of the soil, with each plant
To increase the odds of the seeds germinating, plant 2-3 seeds together at each placement.
If you grow multiple varieties of corn, be sure to grow them in separate plots to reduce the risk of cross-pollination. Should cross-pollination occur, it would produce tough, starchy kernels., Corn requires about one inch of water a week, and lax watering can produce ears with many missing kernels. Apply water to the base of the plants to prevent washing away pollen at the top of the plant., Keep the corn weed-free until it is about knee high. After that, your corn should out-compete the weeds on its own., As the saying “knee-high by the fourth of July” goes, your corn should be 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) tall by the beginning of July. The corn is finished growing about three weeks after it develops “tassels” - a dry, brown silk tail at the top of the ear.








, The corn is ready to be harvested when the kernels are tightly packed and produce a milky fluid when punctured. Eat immediately after picking for the best flavor and optimum freshness.

Leave the cut pieces on a hard surface to dry.
Position the pieces ensuring the wet, skinless sides are in the air.
It may take up to 1-2 hours for the potatoes to properly dry. They are ready when the cut pieces are no longer wet when touched.

, Just make sure they aren't cramped together.

,


The cut side is facing down, the tubers are facing upwards.

,


Sometimes when watering the potato is exposed, cover the potato with more soil.

, After a few days, green sprouts will appear from the ground.

, The soil must always be wet.


When the tubers branch out into green stems, water with about 1-2 inches of water.

, Aim for a sunroom, large window, preferably facing south or west, or under a large skylight.

, Corn will generally take as much light as you can give it, so consider supplementing the light, especially if you're serious about getting corn out of this experiment. You may have to supplement the light if you don't have enough natural light. Try fluorescent bulbs.

, Try a washtub or something of a similar size.


As with any houseplant, protect the surface underneath. Use a large plant saucer between the container and the floor.

, Use a rich potting mix with plenty of organic matter and nutrients. Optionally, add additional fertilizers according to package instructions.

, Plant seeds one inch deep in the soil, 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) apart.

, Wait until the top of the soil dries out, and avoid watering so much that the roots are in standing water. Check for moisture before you water. Check at least weekly and remember that indoor containers will require less water than outdoor ones.

, Choose the strongest growers and pull the rest.

, The best pollinator for corn is wind, and that's not available indoors. Instead, try gently shaking the plants as tassels start to appear. The tassels produce the pollen and the silk receives it. Each strand of silk corresponds to one kernel., Corn is ready to harvest when a the juice from a kernel is milky, not clear. Other signs are brown silk but a green husk.When you've determined that an ear is ready, snap it off the stalk with a twisting motion and cook it as soon as possible.

Be aware that the disease can remain in the soil for years.,
Take care with watering.,
Keep the soil pH at 5.8 or lower.,
Prefer disease-resistant tubers.",How to Prevent Potato Scab," This means that it's important to try your best to avoid planting other root crops before or after a potato crop. However, given the size of gardens, this advice may be impractical.


This disease is more of a cosmetic problem than a production one.;
, This is probably one of the most practical things you can do. Keep the soil reasonably moist but don't over-water.

, This should only be done if the disease is really difficult to control though, as it'll impact the production ability of both potatoes and any other root crops.

, That way, you're less likely to have a problem.

Buy seed potatoes.,
Know when to plant what potatoes.,
Select a large container.,
Make sure your pot has plenty of drainage holes.,
Prepare your growing medium.",How to Plant Potatoes in Pots1," Unlike the potatoes you purchase at the grocery store, seed potatoes, also known as ""tubers,"" are grown for the purpose of replanting and are not meant for consumption. Some “table stock” potatoes can also be used for planting purposes, but they do not usually produce a strong crop.;
, There is a wide range of potato varieties to choose from, but they generally fall under five basic categories: first early, second early, early main crop, main crop, and late main crop. Know what category your selected potato variety falls under will tell you when to plant and harvest it.


Plant first early varieties toward the beginning of the year, as early as February, and harvest them around May.
Plant second early varieties a few weeks after first early varieties, around March, and harvest them around June or July.
Plant early main crop potatoes around April and harvest them around August or September.
Plant main crop varieties in the middle of spring, around May or June, and harvest them around October.
Plant late main crop potatoes as late as July and harvest them in November or December.

, A potato plant needs roughly 2.5 gallons (10 liters) to develop. The larger your pot, the more potatoes you can grow.

, The seed potatoes will rot if they sit in excess water for an extended period of time, and drainage holes are necessary to prevent this from occurring. If the pot or container you choose does not have any holes, drill two or three into the bottom.

, A mixture made of equal parts potting soil and multi-purpose compost will provide your tubers with a nutritional medium rich in organic material. You can also mix in a few handfuls of fertilizer for added nutrition. Consider an organic fertilizer, like chicken pellets, bone meal, fish meal, or seaweed.

Leave your seed potatoes in a cool, dark place.,
Move your potatoes to a light yet cool location once a few eyes have developed.,
Trim off excess eyes.,
Cut the potatoes in half.",How to Plant Potatoes in Pots2," A cupboard or closet in the basement works nicely. Keep them in an egg carton or other container to support them and check back each day to look for eyes.

, Keep the potatoes in this location, with the majority of the eyes facing upward, until short, dark green shoots form.

, The more eyes you have, the more spuds you can grow; however, the more potatoes you grow off one tuber, the smaller the potatoes will be. Select the three strongest eyes and rub the rest off with your finger or dig them out with a sharp knife.

, If you do not want to trim the eyes off the potato, cut the potato in half and treat the halves as two separate seeds. Each half should weigh between 1.5 and 2 ounces, and each should also have two or three eyes on it.


Allow the cut halves to callous over. The exposed portions should dry out and callous over if you set them out for a few days to dry.

Cover the bottom of your pot with crocks (broken clay pot pieces) or small stones.,
Fill your pot with 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of your growing medium.,
Place your seed potatoes in the pot.,
Cover your tubers with an additional 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 centimeters) of growing medium.,
Water lightly.",How to Plant Potatoes in Pots3," These materials aid the drainage process by drawing water away and preventing it from sitting in the soil too long.

, Lightly pat the medium down with your hands to make sure that the soil is solid and firm enough to hold the potatoes in place so that they do not sink as they get heavier.

, The majority of the eyes should face upward. Space the tubers apart evenly and do not overcrowd the pot. As a general guide, a pot with a diameter of 12 inches should only contain about 3 seed potatoes.

, Use your hands to pat the soil down firmly, but do not press so hard that you crush the seed potatoes.

, The soil should be moist to the touch but not soggy.

Add more growing medium as the plant shoots up.,
Keep your potatoes consistently watered.,
Set your potatoes out in an area that receives partial sun and partial shade.,
Check the pH of the soil with litmus paper or another pH test.,
Fertilize your potatoes once every two weeks with a liquid fertilizer.,
Watch out for pests.,
Keep an eye out for disease.,
Rummage around the dirt a few weeks after your plants flower.,
Stop watering two weeks before your final harvest.,
Pull out the dead stems and leaves.",How to Plant Potatoes in Pots4," Only the top 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) should be peek through. Keep adding medium until you reach the rim of the pot. Ideally, the soil will be about 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 centimeters) deep.

, The soil should be moist, but never soggy and never completely dry. You can usually test it by sticking your fingertip into the soil.


During the summer, you may need to water your potatoes twice a day, especially if you live in a hot, dry climate.
During cooler weather, most potato plants only need about 1 inch of rainfall per week to thrive, but if your area goes for an extended length of time without much rain, you may need to water your potatoes manually. Place a rain gauge near your potted potatoes to determine whether they receive enough precipitation from week to week.

, Potatoes need sunlight but do poorly when exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period of time.

, This should be done around mid-season, especially if the leaves look yellow or weak. Potatoes thrive in a soil with a pH of about 6.0.


Add more compost or manure if you need to decrease the pH.
Add agricultural lime if you need to increase the pH.

, Providing your potato plants with food will lead to a larger, richer crop.

, Many pests, like the potato leaf hopper, can be plucked off by hand. Others may require the use of an organic pesticide to ward off or kill.

, Many diseases, like blight, are contagious, so if your potatoes show signs of disease, you should immediately move them away from other plants.

, The first few potatoes will be ready at this time, and you can pluck or twist them off the root. Generally, potatoes that are at least the size of an egg will be ready, but you should pull each spud above the soil and check its color before removing it. Green potatoes are unripe and poisonous.

, You will be able to tell when the remainder of your potatoes is almost ready by observing how much the foliage has died back. Once the leaves and stems are completely yellow, your potatoes are ready.

, Wear gloves to protect your hands. Remove any potatoes hanging onto the dead foliage and dig around the soil for any that may have gotten lost in the pot.

Hill the plants when they’re about 6-8 inches (15-20cm) high.,
Use a hoe to scoop dirt from between the rows.,
Keep going down the row, scooping dirt.,
Pack the dirt tightly with your hands.,
Add mulch.,
Wait a few weeks after the first hilling.,
Work small handfuls of straw around the plants.,
Sprinkle soil on the straw.",How to Hill Potatoes," The purpose of hilling is to cover potato tubers as they start to poke out of the ground. Several conditions can affect the growth of your potato plants, such as whether you’re planting during a wet or dry year. You may have to wait several weeks before it’s time to hill your potatoes., You shouldn’t need to scrape too deep, as you only need enough dirt to make mounds a few inches high. Start in the middle point between two rows of potato plants, and hoe the dirt towards one row first. You want the dirt to fill up around the plant as you do this., Do this until all potato plants have a good mound of dirt around them, then repeat for the other rows. You want to make sure you bring dirt from either side of each row.

If you don’t own a hoe, you can use a rake to pile the dirt by your plants.If you’ve planted your potatoes in a raised bed, you’ll need to add dirt to the bed in order to hill your potatoes. You can combine top soil and compost and add it to the bed, making small mounds on each side of your potato plants., Using a hoe might not be quite enough to completely cover potato tubers peeking out of the ground. Use a good amount of pressure to pack the dirt until only the very top leaves of the plant are visible. Keep an eye out for any spots with exposed potatoes you may have missed with the hoe., Topping your new soil with a thick layer of mulch will keep the soil cool and prevent weeds from sprouting. No specific type of mulch is needed here, but you’ll want to get enough to layer it thickly over the mounds of dirt around your plants., After hilling your plants for the first time, the potato tubers will keep trying to grow their way to the top. You should wait until the potato plants should grow another 8-12 inches (20-31cm) before you consider hilling them again., Using straw for the second hilling will make the potatoes much easier to harvest; you won’t have to dig through more than a foot of dirt to find your potatoes. Using small handfuls at a time, fill the area around the plants with a thick bed of straw. You want the straw to be packed as tightly as possible, completely covering any exposed potatoes.

If your potatoes are planted in a raised bed, you can add straw until you’ve filled the whole bed., Really any soil will do, all you’re looking to do is fill up any holes left by your straw bed. Don’t worry about trying to pack the dirt into the straw. As you sprinkle it on, the dirt will fill any open spaces. This will help protect the potatoes from the sun even more.

After adding dirt, water the straw bed thoroughly."

Place your potato in the water.,
Add some light and heat.,
Let your slips grow.,
Harvest the slips.,
Put your slips in water.,
Get your slips out for planting.",How to Grow Sweet Potatoes1," Slips are small sprouts that are grown from pre-existing sweet potato plants. You can choose to order these online or from a garden center, but you can also grow them at home easily. Find a mature, healthy sweet potato plant from the store or a friend’s garden.The most common and popular sweet potato varieties (available at most stores) are Beauregard, ‘bunch’ Porto Ricos, and centennials.;
, Sweet Potatoes are a tropical plant. This means that they grow well in USDA hardiness zones 9, 10, and 11. This area includes most of the southern and south-western United States. If starting your own slips, start sprouting them in March or April. Slips should be planted in the ground in May or June., When you’ve gotten your hands on 1-2 healthy sweet potatoes, stick them in the sink and wash them well. Then, cut your potato in half. If the potato is particularly large, consider cutting it into thirds or fourths.

, The way your slip-growing works, is that you’ll place your potato half in/half out of a container of water. Use a jar or a glass cup with an opening large enough to fit your potato, and fill the whole thing with water.

, Stick 4-5 toothpicks out of the sides of your potato equidistant apart and near the middle, like spokes on a wheel. Place the potato into the jar/glass of water with the cut side down, with the toothpicks holding half of the potato out by balancing it on the rim of the glass.


Do this for every slice of potato that you have, with each section in a different jar.

, Move the jar with the potato onto a windowsill that gets a lot of sunlight.

, Wait for 2-4 weeks for the small leafy slips to begin sprouting out of the top of the potato.

, When the top of your potato is covered in slips, carefully twist each one off individually. They won’t have roots yet and will resemble small leaves with a short stem.

, Fill a shallow bowl with a bit of water, around 1” or less depending on the number of slips you have. Set the slips in the bowl so that the stem is submerged in the water. Leave them like this for several days, until roots have formed from the bottom.


Add fresh water once a day or so to keep the slips healthy.
If any of the slips are not forming roots or begin to wilt, throw them out.

, After 2-3 days, your slips should have developed roots at the bottom. At this point, dump out the water in the bowl and bring your slips out for planting. These are best placed directly into your garden rather than in individual planters to keep the roots intact."

Choose a garden plot.,
Till the earth.,
Prepare the soil.,
Know when to plant.,
Choose a mulch.",How to Grow Sweet Potatoes2," Sweet potatoes grow primarily underground, but their vines grow above the ground. Each vine can grow to be over ten feet long. Make sure your garden plot has plenty of room for the vines. Sweet potatoes prefer a warm environment, so try to choose an area that gets a lot of sunlight (especially if you live in the north) and is well drained.

, Being tubers, sweet potatoes will grow deep in the earth. Make sure they’ll have an easy time of it by tilling the soil about 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep. Get the soil as loose and light as possible, incorporating gardening soil if necessary.

, As will all fruit and vegetable planting, having nutrient rich soil is necessary for a bountiful harvest. Add a layer of good planting soil or compost. Remove any large rocks that might be present. Check the pH of your soil. If the pH is not neutral, adjust the pH with peat moss or wood ash to compensate for acidity or alkalinity until it is neutral. This is called amending the soil.


You can buy pH testing kits for your garden at a garden center or store.

, Because of their heat-loving tendencies, sweet potatoes need to have warm soil in order to flourish. Wait till at least a month after the most recent frost, in the beginning of spring, to plant your slips.

, Help your sweet potatoes to grow by adding mulch over the top to trap heat. If you are in a particularly cold area, get some black plastic mulch or a similar heat-trapper to place over the potato plants after planting."

Dig your holes.,
Plant your potatoes.,
Add your mulch.,
Water the plants.,
Wait for the tubers to develop.,
Harvest the sweet potatoes.,
Cure the sweet potatoes.,
Store your sweet potatoes.",How to Grow Sweet Potatoes3," Sweet potato slips need a bit more space than some other garden vegetables, so dig your holes 12–24 inches (30.5–61.0 cm) apart each. They need be only as deep as the root ball on the bottom of the slips and about ½ an inch up the base of the plant., Place each small slip in your pre-dug holes and cover the stems with soil about ½ of an inch up the base. The leafy part of the potato plant will begin to sprawl in vines outwards while the roots will produce the tubers between 6–12 inches (15.2–30.5 cm) deep in the soil.

, Protect your sweet potatoes from cold weather by adding your chosen mulch to the top. This will also help to block out weeds and prevent too much vine growth, which steal energy from tuber growth.

, At first planting the sweet potatoes will require a lot of water. Over time, you should reduce the amount that you water them until they receive moisture only about once a week. Begin watering daily, knocking off days from your watering schedule as each week progresses.

, Sweet potatoes have a relatively long fruiting period, becoming ripe and ready to harvest in the early fall (hence their association with Thanksgiving). Continue watering on a weekly basis, and weeding the beds if necessary to keep the plants healthy.

, After about 120 days after planting, the sweet potatoes should have reached full maturity. When possible, wait until the last possible time (the last warm weather before a frost) to harvest the sweet potatoes, as this will result in larger and more tasteful tubers.

, One of the most important steps, sweet potatoes must be cured after harvest. This will help them to develop their flavor (they won’t have much immediately after being dug up) and to grow a tougher skin - literally. Place the sweet potatoes in an area with a temperature of 85–95 °F (29–35 °C) with 80-90% humidity for 5-10 days. After this, they should be ready to eat!Consider using a small space heater and a humidifier in a large closet or small room to cure the potatoes.

, One of the best things about these lovely tubers is that they will remain fresh and good to eat for many months if stored properly. Keep the potatoes in temperatures hovering around 70 degrees (that means no refrigeration!) in an open, dry area. Never store your sweet potatoes in a plastic bag or tightly sealed container."

Start growing the sprouts.,
Keep the sprouts warm.,
Let sprouts develop.,
Root the slips.",How to Grow Yams1," Yams aren't grown from seeds like most other vegetables - they grow from slips, which are derived from the sprouts of adult yams. To grow sprouts, cut a yam in half and submerge one portion in a glass of cool water. Insert toothpicks at three points around the middle of the yam and suspend it over the container, half-submerged in the water., The growth process requires warmth, so place the glass near a heat source. If possible, position the glass near a window so that the sprouting yam gets sunlight as well. Otherwise, place it near a heater to absorb warmth that way., Refill the water in jars or glasses if necessary to keep the submersion level of the yam consistent. Wait for sprouts to form on the yam; this will take a few weeks. Once sprouts are leafy, take each one and gently twist it off of the yam.Each yam can produce up to 50 sprouts.

, Lay each sprout in a shallow container, with the bottom half of the stem submerged in water. Allow the leaves to hang out over the rim of the container. Over the course of a few days, you should see roots emerging from the bottom of each sprout. When the roots are about an inch long, they are then slips that are ready to be planted.Slips can also be purchased online.

Check the leaves.,
Check the tubers.,
Prevent pests from entering the potatoes.,
Cover up tubers if they're exposed.,
Remove aphids by squashing them or by spraying with soapy water.

",How to Troubleshoot Potato Problems," If you find black patches on the leaves of your potatoes, suspect blight. This should be sprayed with copper at the first sign.;
, If they're turning green, they're exposed to sunlight. Once they're green, they're toxic and no longer edible. Cover up with more soil to prevent this from occurring to remaining potatoes. And check that Fido isn't causing a problem; you might need to keep your dog away from the veggie patch.

, Soil nematodes can be a problem for potatoes. If you find them in your potato crop, shift the crop around to another part of the garden. Another alternative is to plant the potatoes in fresh potting mix in the bag and to plant the entire bag in the ground.

, Not only will they turn green as mentioned in an earlier step, but the risk of the tuber moth increase when potatoes are exposed at the surface.

Loosen the soil.,
Make space.,
Wait for the right temperature.,
Bury the slips into the soil.",How to Grow Yams2," To ensure that the roots don't meet resistance as they expand, make sure that the soil is very loose and well-drained where you want to plant the yams. When the ground starts to dry in the springtime, till the soil approximately 8 to 12 inches deep and remove debris (i.e. rocks, root pieces, etc.). Spread compost or manure over the soil and till it approximately 8 inches into the ground, to improve the soil's structure.Rake the area, spray it with water, and let it sit for 2 or 3 days before planting., Ensure that you have enough room to accommodate the slips that you'll be planting. Large tubers need a lot of space to grow, as do the vines of the plants, which grow vigorously. Ideally, you should leave approximately a meter of space between each plant., Yams do not grow well in cold temperatures, so it's best to wait until a few weeks after the last frost to plant your slips. Mid spring is the ideal time to do so. Yams require a long growing season, so don't wait too long into the spring or summer to get started., Dig holes about 4"" or 5"" deep and 3"" wide (approximately 10 or 12 cm deep and 7-8 cm wide). Place slips in the holes (dug about 8 to 10 inches apart), positioned with the roots pointing down and the leafy tops above the soil. Very gently fill the holes with soil, being careful not to jostle or bruise the slips too much.Press soil down lightly to get rid of any air pockets.

"
"
Water the plants generously.,
Fertilize the plants.,
Stake the plants.",How to Grow Yams3," Newly planted slips should be watered every day the first week, every second day the second week, and less and less as they grow. Be generous in hydrating them but pay careful attention to the crop to avoid waterlogging. Yams thrive in sunlight, so if the soil gets dry, adjust the watering schedule accordingly., Use a fertilizer during the growth period to help improve the state of the produce. Purchase a fertilizer that is low in nitrogen, an element which can compromise root development, and is high in phosphorus. It is best to fertilize the crop every two to four weeks., Yam plant vines are not sturdy and require support in order to produce a large yield. Keep an eye on the plants and stake the mounds approximately 4 weeks after the vines first emerge. Use bamboo canes as support for these yam vines, which can grow up to 10 ft."
"
Keep an eye on the plants.,
Remove yams from the soil.,
Cure your yams.,
Store your yams.",How to Grow Yams4," Yams typically take about 14 weeks to mature. They should be harvested when the tops of plants start to go yellow and wither. Harvesting generally occurs in autumn., Use a pitchfork or similar gardening implement to gently dig into the soil and remove the tubers from under the surface. Start digging a safe distance from the stem. Be careful not to pierce the skin of the yams when removing them from the ground., Refrain from washing yams after harvesting. Instead, sort yams into boxes or baskets to cure them before storage. Curing can be done in approximately 2 weeks. To do so, place yams in a warm, dark place with some ventilation and leave them undisturbed. This process will allow bruising and wounds on the yams to heal, and seal out rot bacteria., Once harvested, yams can be kept for several months. Store yams in a cool, dry spot like a kitchen cabinet. Look up yam recipes and enjoy the fruits (or root vegetables) of your gardening."

One potato with 6 or 7 eyes can yield up to 2 pounds (900 g) of potatoes. If you want to harvest more than that, buy at least 5 seed potatoes.;
, Use a vegetable brush and scrub each potato under running water. This will also remove pesticide residue if you aren't using organic potatoes.

, The mouth of the jar has to be wide enough to support the potato on toothpicks.

, Be careful not to cut through an eye, because that is what will be germinating. You may have to cut large potatoes in quarters so that they can fit over the opening of your jar.

, Place the toothpicks evenly at about halfway between the cut end and the top of the potato.

, Allow the toothpicks to rest on the lip of the jar. Readjust the toothpicks if the potato doesn't rest evenly on the lip of the jar. Make sure the potato's eyes are covered with water, or else they will not sprout.

, A south facing windowsill is perfect. You can also place the jar underneath grow lights.

, Add water if necessary to keep the potato’s eyes covered.

, Most potatoes take about a week for the sprouts to appear.

Choose a deep pot that has drainage holes.,
Place some small stones in the bottom of the pot to help with water drainage.

,
Fill the pot about 1/3 of the way to the top with potting soil.,
Place your potatoes, root side down, 6” (152.4 mm) apart.,
Cover the potatoes with 2 to 3” (50.8 to 75.2 mm) of soil.

,
Water your potatoes deeply.

,
Add more soil when the plant has grown 6” (152.4 mm) above the surface.,
Harvest your potatoes when there are small tubers on the vines; these tubers aren’t edible as sunlight causes potatoes to produce toxins, but it acts as a sign that there are potatoes underground out of sunlight which are ready to be dug up:


Gently dip into the soil with a small gardening tool.",How to Grow Potatoes Indoors2," If you aren’t using a brand new container, be sure to thoroughly wash and rinse your pot before you begin the planting process.

,, You will need to keep adding soil as the plant grows, so don’t overfill the pot at this point.

, Don’t place any of the potatoes next to the edge of the pot.

,,, When the potato vine reaches the top of your pot, mound the soil around the plant.

,
Lift the potatoes out of the soil.
Rinse them thoroughly before cooking or eating them.

Obtain a half barrel.,
Drill a drainage hole in the base.,
Fill the barrel halfway with compost.

,
Put your seed potatoes into the compost layer.

,
Cover the potatoes with 3–4 centimeter (1.2–1.6 in) of soil.

,
Add soil as the potatoes grow to create the mound effect that potatoes like.

,
Keep the soil moist.,
Harvest.",How to Grow Potatoes in Barrels," These can be found in garden centres and hardware stores.;
, Layer the base with pebbles or other filer to prevent the soil falling through.

,,,,, Potatoes need to be moist to produce potatoes.

, This is the really fun and easy part. After flowering has finished and the tops of the plants start dying off, all you need to do is tip the whole barrel soil out into a garden bed and grab your potatoes. A lot easier than digging them out!

Take a piece of wire stock fence or similar sturdy wire fence.,
Prepare the soil.,
Plant the potato seedlings as you normally would.,
Place the wire hoops so that they are standing upright.,
Keep the space filled.,
Continue to fill in the cylinder as the plants grow.,
Harvest the potatoes when ready.",How to Grow Potatoes in a Wire Cage," Make it about ten feet (approx. 3 meters) long, and roll it into a cylinder about 3 feet (approx. 91 centimeters) wide. Fasten the end to the fence with wire to hold it together. It should form a strong but easy to open cylinder that stands about four feet (1.2 meters) tall.






;
, Loosen it, and add a bit of fertilizer. This will get the potatoes off to a good start.








, Place them about three to four inches (approx. 7.5 cm - 10 cm) deep, hand tamping the soil around them.








, Place them around the planted seed potatoes, centering the future plants.








, Your potato plants will soon be popping out of the soil; as they grow, fill in the space inside the fence with leaves, straw and additional dirt. Do not bury the plants; only bring the soil level up inside the cylinder two to three inches (5 cm - 7.5 cm). Once the potato shoots grow to about 1 foot, do cover completely with leaves, straw or a similar material. You want to keep the light off the developing tubers, as it can cause them turn green.








, The plants will use this extra soil to grow even more potatoes in. Soon, the cylinder will be filled with leaves, straw dirt and potatoes. Potatoes do not need a lot of additional rich organic material, but they do need additional water, at least 1 inch per week. Enough to soak them thoroughly without drowning them.








, When the plant tops dry and wither, the potatoes are ready to harvest. Simply undo the wire fasteners and pull away the fence.Your potatoes will be ready to harvest, without digging, right in the cylinder of soil. Gently spread out your new potatoes and allow them to air dry for at least a day, to help ""toughen"" the skins. If rain is threatened move them to a covered area. Once they are matured, they can be stored in a cool dry place until you're ready to feast on them.

Find out when to plant potatoes in your region.,
Choose a planting spot for your potatoes.,
Source seed potatoes.",How to Grow Potatoes1," Potatoes do best in cooler weather, but they should not be in the ground during a frost.


If you live in a cool region, plant them after the first frost of spring.
If you live in a warmer region where frost isn't a problem, plant potatoes in the fall, since they might get too hot over the summer.;
, Potatoes are tubers that grow underground with a stalk of green leaves extending above the soil. Choose a spot in your yard with the following qualities:


Full sun. While potatoes shouldn't get overheated, they do need plenty of sun. Choose an area that gets sun for the majority of the day.
Loose, loamy soil. Potatoes like to grow on hills, which you'll create by shaping the soil. Clay-based soils do not work as well for growing potatoes.
An area with excellent drainage. Potatoes should not be planted in waterlogged soil, as it will cause them to rot. Choose an area in your yard that gets good drainage, and make sure the soil is not too wet when it's time to plant the potatoes.

, Seed potatoes are simply potatoes that have sprouted. You can order certified seed potatoes or buy them from your local farm supply stores.


Don't use potatoes from the grocery store, since they may carry diseases that will affect your crop.
Choose a potato variety based on your preferences. The following varieties are popular choices for home gardeners:

Yukon gold potatoes, which are ready to harvest by mid-season.
Superior potatoes, which are ready to harvest by mid-season.
Red Pontiac potatoes, which are ready to harvest later in the season.
Kennebec potatoes, which are ready to harvest alter in the season.

Get the seeds ready.,
Get the soil ready.,
Plant the seeds.",How to Grow Potatoes2," About a week before you plan to plant the potatoes, set the seeds in a sunny, warm spot in your home. This will help them start to sprout and prepare them to grow into potato plants.


A couple of days before planting, slice the larger seeds into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Each piece should contain two eyes. The smaller seeds can be planted whole.
If the seeds are viable, a thick callous will form over the cuts to protect them once they have been planted.

, Cultivate the soil in your potato patch by using gardening tools to turn it and remove any rocks and roots. When it is nice and loose,


Mix in some organic compost to make the soil especially hospitable for the potatoes.
Create rows. Dig a trench 4 inches (10.2 cm) wide and 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep, then a second trench of the same dimensions a couple of feet from the first trench.
Create a mound. If you don't have space for rows, you can plant potatoes in mounds. Dig out a circular area about 3 feet (0.9 m) wide and 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep.

, Press the seeds into the trench you dug cut side down, leaving about 12 inches (30.5 cm) between seeds.


Either line them up along rows or place them around the circular trench, depending on the method you are using.
Cover the seeds with 4 inches (10.2 cm) of soil. Don't fill in the trench entirely; it should still be lower than the surrounding area.

"
"
Water the plants.,
Hill the potatoes.",How to Grow Potatoes3," Keep them well watered, but not soaked. The soil should always have a little moisture.


Water the plants early in the day so the leaves have time to dry in the sun before nightfall. Leftover moisture on the leaves can lead to diseases.
Make sure the plants are especially well-watered when they are in flower.

, After about five weeks, the potato stalks will have grown several inches above the soil. Create ""hills"" by mounding soil over the stalks. You can cover them completely or allow the very top of the stalks to peek through. New potatoes will grow just under the soil, above the seeds potatoes that were planted earlier.


If you planted the potatoes in rows, your ""hills"" should be connected to make long ridges. If you planted the potatoes in one circular mound, you should end up creating one big hill.
As the stalks continue to grow, hill the potatoes every 2 - 3 weeks. Each time you add another layer to the hill, another layer of potatoes will grow just underneath the surface of the soil.

"
"
Harvest new potatoes.,
Harvest mature potatoes.,
Dry the potatoes.,
Eat or store the potatoes.",How to Grow Potatoes4," New potatoes, which are simply young potatoes that have not reached maturity, can be harvested 2 - 3 weeks after the plants have begun to flower.


Dig carefully into the side of the potato hill. Pick out the largest potatoes and leave the small ones to continue growing.
Replace the soil on the side of the potato hill.
Continue doing this as often as you'd like while the potatoes are growing.

, The potato plants are finished growing when the leaves begin to turn yellow or brown and wither.


Cease watering the plants and allow them to dry in the soil for about a week.
Carefully dig into the hills, making sure not to damage the potatoes, and pull out the mature potatoes as you find them.

, Mature potatoes should be dried for a couple of days before you store them. This gives them time to develop a tough skin that will protect them from rotting for months.


Let the newly harvested potatoes sit on the surface of the soil for a day or two to dry out in the sun. Don't wash them before allowing them to dry out.
If its rainy outside, allow them to dry out indoors for a few days instead.

, Wash the potatoes and either store them in a cool, dry place or enjoy them immediately.

Drill holes in the bottom of the trash can for drainage.,
Add a layer of potting mix to the trash can.,
Prepare your potatoes for planting.,
Plant the potatoes.,
Add more potting mix as the plants grow.,
Harvest the potatoes when they're ready.",How to Grow Potatoes in a Trash Can," If your can does not allow water to drain, the potatoes will rot. Holes can be drilled or cut with a small saw. Drill as many holes as possible without making the trash can bottom too weak to hold in soil.;
, Once the drainage holes are drilled, you can begin adding soil. It is best to use potting mix rather than soil from your garden, as potting mix produces the best results when container gardening. Begin by adding a layer about 10 inches (25 cm) deep.


You can mix in fertilizer if desired. A low-nitrogen fertilizer should be used, as high levels of nitrogen promote leaf growth at the expense of potato size. A ""5-10-10"" mix works well; this indicates that the fertilizer contains 5 parts nitrogen to 10 parts each phosphorous and potassium.

, Small potatoes can be planted whole, but larger ones should be cut into smaller pieces. Each piece should have at least 3 ""eyes,"" or dimples. After cutting the potatoes, allow the cut edges to air dry before planting.

, Bury the seed potatoes about 4 inches (10 cm) under the potting mix. In a 32 gallon (120 L) garbage can, you should only need about 4 potatoes, spaced evenly apart. Place the garbage can into an area that receives direct sunlight for 4 to 6 hours a day.


Keep the soil moist as the potatoes grow. In mid-summer, you may have to water the potatoes once a day to keep the soil from drying out.

, When the potato plants start growing, you should continually add potting mix to the garbage can to cover the plants' stems, making sure to leave the leaves exposed to the sun. This allows more room underneath the soil for new potatoes to grow.


You should continually build up this hill of soil throughout the growing season. This is why the trash can is such an effective vessel - it allows for plenty of vertical room to continually bury the plants' stems.

, At the end of the growing season, you simply have to lay down a tarp and overturn the trash can onto it. You can then pick the potatoes off of the tarp. Do not reuse the potting mix for growing potatoes again, as this will make the plants more susceptible to disease.

Decide when to chit the potatoes.,
Buy seed potatoes.,
Gather potatoes from your last crop (optional).,
Arrange the seed potatoes in an upright position.,
Store the carton of potatoes in a cool, light room.,
Wait 4 to 6 weeks for the potatoes to sprout.,
Rub off excess shoots from the potatoes.,
Plant the seeds shoot-side up.",How to Chit Potatoes," The potatoes will need 4 to 6 weeks after chitting before they're ready to plant. This will give them a chance to sprout and start putting on growth. At this point, you can plant the seed potatoes in warm soil. Most people chit their potatoes in January or February so they can plant in March or April, when soil temperature's reach about 50 degrees F (10 degrees C).Check an almanac or ask an expert at your local nursery to find out when the soil will be warm enough for planting the potatoes.;
, Seed potatoes are potatoes specifically sold for planting, rather than cooking and eating. You can buy them by the sackful from a nursery or order the type you like online. Unlike grocery store potatoes, seed potatoes aren't sprayed with chemicals and they're guaranteed to be free of viruses.If you want to chit organic potatoes or potatoes from a farmer's market, keep in mind that these may carry viruses that will prevent your potatoes from growing well.

, If you have potatoes left over from your last year's crop, you can chit them for this season's crop. If you don't have potatoes left over, remember to set aside a bin full of this season's potatoes to use for next year's crop., Get out an empty egg carton and place one seed potato in each hole of the carton. The eyes (little indentations where the potato sprouts) should facing the top and the heel of the potato should be sitting in the carton. The heel is the narrow end of the potato where it was cut from the vine.If you don't have an empty egg carton, you can use any container with dividers that gives the potatoes a little space. It's important to let some air circulate between the seed potatoes.

, Place the container of seed potatoes in a space that is cool, but has plenty of light. Try to choose a space that's around 50 degrees F (10 degrees C) which will force the seed potatoes to sprout. You might place the seed potatoes on a porch or in a garage that gets lots of light.Avoid storing the seed potatoes in a dark or frosty space since these could prevent the seed potatoes from sprouting.

, Give the seed potatoes a chance to sprout little shoots. You should see strong, green shoots on each of the potatoes after 4 to 6 weeks. Once these shoots are about 2 to 3 centimeters long, the seed potatoes are ready to plant.The sprouts should be coming from each eye on the potatoes.

, If you'd like to grow large potatoes, take a seed potato and rub off most of the shoots. Leave 3 or 4 of the largest, strongest shoots. Each of these will grow to be a large potato.If you'd prefer to have a crop of smaller potatoes, you don't need to rub off the excess shoots.

, Once the soil is consistently 50 degrees F (10 degrees C), you can plant the seed potatoes. You can plant the seed potatoes whole or cut them into pieces so each piece has a shoot. Plant each potato or shoot about 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm) deep with the shoot facing up. They should be spaced 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45 cm) apart.If you'd like to space the potatoes out in your garden to cover a large space, you should cut the seed potatoes into pieces. This will maximize your coverage.

In cold climates, wait for the soil to warm before planting.,
Keep the moisture level in the soil consistent throughout the growing season.,
Maintain soil pH at or near 6.5.,
Remove fruit when signs of blossom end rot appear.,
Experiment with different tomato varieties.",How to Prevent Blossom End Rot in Tomatoes," This will help with nutrient uptake, so that there is less of a chance of calcium deficiency.;
,

When the weather is dry, water more frequently to moisten the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches (15.2 cm).






Use watering cones if necessary to help get water down into the root zone. You can also work the soil from time to time around the root zone insuring proper water retention and drainage, and apply compost mixed with egg shells that have been microwaved for 3 minutes and mashed up into a powder, then water in with a tablespoon of epsom salts to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water. ( this is very helpful, especially when done when the yellow flower begins to form of the fruit. )






Use mulch to prevent the moisture in the soil from evaporating.







, Also check the NPK number of your soil, which is a simple kit you can purchase at garden stores.

, The process usually becomes visible when the plant is half size. The blossom end rot looks like a brown spot that turns leathery. Remove these tomatoes from the plant so it can focus its energy on remaining tomatoes that do not have blossom end rot.

, Some are more susceptible to blossom end rot than others.

This will allow you to keep track of your progress and you'll be able to clearly see what needs to be removed as you work. Carefully work your way up the plant, pruning any non-essential growth away from it.Most of the pruning will take place at the bottom of the plant.
Newly formed stems will need to be removed. These stems take nutrients away from your tomato fruits.
Many stems on the lower portion of the plant will not yield fruit.;
, Most tomato pruning can be done by pinching off whatever part of the plant needs to be removed. Hold the part of the plant between your thumb and index finger before gently snapping the piece away. You may need to move the piece back and forth until it loosens enough to break off.








Most sections of the plant should be easily pinched off.
Pruning shears are not needed unless a piece is too big to break away by hand.
Using pruning shears can open the plant up to possible infection.
If you must cut something from your plant, it's best to use a razor blade.

, It's important that you leave enough leaves and stems for the plant to function properly. Cutting away too much of the plant can cause it to grow slowly or possibly die. Removing too many leaves can expose the fruit to the sun and ruin the tomatoes. If you are in doubt about pruning something, it's best to leave it on.It can be a good idea to leave at least one stem on each time you prune. These stems can eventually produce extra tomatoes.
You'll want around 4 or 5 stems on your plant that are producing fruit.
If tomatoes would be exposed to the sun, it's best to leave stems and leaves on that area to provide shade.
Don't remove more than 1/3 of the total plant while pruning.

, Pruning your tomatoes will be an ongoing process. New growth will constantly be underway and you'll want to direct that growth to produce the most tomatoes. Keep up with your pruning by removing unwanted growth around once a week.Pruning too often might remove more of the plant than is necessary.
Leaving your plant without pruning could allow for unnecessary growth to occur.
Harvesting tomatoes often can result in greater yields throughout the life of the plant., There are two main things that will help your tomato pruning efforts: the time of day and the weather. It's recommended that you prune in the mornings, as unwanted stems will break away easier. It's also important that you prune when the plant is dry to prevent any diseases from affecting your tomato plant.







, The goal in pruning your tomato plant will be to remove any non-essential foliage or growth. To do this, you will need to know which parts of the plant can be removed and which parts need to remain intact. When pruning your tomato plant, focus on removing these extra parts to help increase the amount of tomatoes produced:Most lower branches can be cut away from the plant.
Cut away any new stems that are starting to grow from old ones.
Any stems that don't have either flower or fruit can be removed.
Snap off any dead or discolored leaves.

, It's common for tomato plants to grow upwards instead of of outwards. If your tomato plant has grown too high, you may consider pruning the topmost growth stems. This will prevent the plant from growing upwards, redirecting growth outwards to the tomatoes themselves.Cutting off the top of the plant will prevent all upwards growth. It's a good idea to only do this late in the growing season, before the first frost.
Without the top stem in place, your tomato plant will focus growth into the fruit instead of the stems or leaves.

, If you are going to grow tomatoes on your patio, you will need to make sure they are the variety you want. There are two main varieties of tomatoes plants: determinate and indeterminate. Determinate tomato plants will grow in a small bush and are generally well suited to planting in a container. Indeterminate tomato plants will grow larger than determinate tomatoes, but can be more challenging to grow in a container.Determinate tomatoes are usually the best type of tomatoes to grow on your patio.
Determinate tomato plants will likely not need to be pruned.
Indeterminate tomatoes will usually require a wire or wooden stake to grow properly.
Indeterminate tomato plants can benefit from pruning.

, Your tomato plant will need enough room to grow into. If the container is too small for your plant, it may have difficultly reaching maturity and producing tomatoes. Think about how many tomato plants you want to grow on your patio and select the right size containers for them.The exact amount of room required may vary between types of tomato plants. Always check the recommended space requirements for your tomato plant when considering a container.
Most single plant containers will accommodate one tomato plant.
Smaller planters will generally result in smaller tomato plants.
You can plant multiple tomato plants in one container. However, you will need to make sure each plant has enough room to grow.
Larger containers can allow the plant to grow more and may hold more water in the soil.

, Not all soil will be ideal for your tomato plant. You'll want to provide the right type of soil for your plant to help it grow quickly and fully. Having the proper soil can also have an effect on the quality of the tomatoes that the plant produces. Keep some of these tips in mind when looking for the best soil for your tomato plants:Use potting soil mixtures when adding soil to your container.
Adding in compost can give your plants extra nutrients.
Peat moss can be a good addition to your soil mix.
Avoid using dirt or soil from your yard, as it may not contain the necessary nutrients or composition.

Learn about your area.,
Choose a type of tomato.,
Select a seed variety.,
Know when to plant.",How to Plant Tomatoes from Seed1," Tomatoes, like any type of plant, have ideal environmental conditions that they require for growing the strongest plants and tastiest fruits. Some species of tomatoes are better suited to certain areas and don’t grow as well in other places around the country and world. Research the best tomatoes for your specific environment and location by contacting your local agricultural extension office. There may be some unique hybrids that grow perfectly in your type of soil and weather that you’ve never heard of or thought of planting., There are many different breeds of tomato, each with a unique color, size and flavor. Tomatoes can range from small grape sized fruits to large fruits the size of a softball, and come in every color except for blue. The type of cooking you want to do, the flavor you are going for, and the growth style of the plant are all things to consider when choosing the types of tomato seeds to plant.


There are two different growth styles of tomato plants: determinate and indeterminate. Determinate plants grow upwards and produce fruit quickly, but for a short period. They also require less pruning, staking and maintenance. Indeterminate are more sprawling and vine-like, and produce fruit over a longer season. They also get very large and never stop growing, so they require staking or trellising.
Red globe or beefsteak tomatoes are the traditional style and often eaten whole or sliced for sandwiches. Plum or roma tomato varieties are used for cooking, canning, and making sauces. Small cherry or grape tomatoes are full of seeds and juice and used whole or halved in salads and pastas.
The color of your tomatoes can change the flavor they produce. For a classic taste, go with large, red tomatoes. Purple or brown tomatoes have a very rich, hearty flavor while yellow and orange tomatoes are on the sweeter side. Green tomatoes are great for cooking in savory dishes., Tomatoes can be grown from dried packaged seeds, fresh seeds preserved from a cut tomato, or seedlings that are available in local gardening centers. Dried and fresh seeds require the most work to grow, but can be the most fulfilling. Planting seedlings is the easiest way to grow tomatoes.

, Planting tomatoes must be done at a specific time of the year for the best results. Because tomatoes are sun loving plants, they grow the strongest in late spring and summer. Plant tomatoes at least two weeks after the most recent frost, or when nighttime temperatures do not drop below 50 °F (10 °C) and daytime temperatures stay below 90 °F (32 °C).


If you are starting your seeds indoors, plan to do this 6-8 weeks before your expected transplant date.
If you want, you can purchase a soil thermometer to check the soil of your garden for the ideal planting time. Soil that is about 50 °F (10 °C) is ideal for planting, but this may not happen in conjunction with better weather; test your garden to play it safe.
A farmer’s almanac is a handy tool for finding out the best planting time. You can look at the farmer’s almanac online or purchase a copy for your area.

Dry the seeds.,
Check the seeds.,
Store your seeds.",How to Plant Tomatoes from Seed2," The seeds of a particular tomato will lend fruit that are nearly identical to the parent. If you have an extra delicious or juicy fruit that you want to preserve, cut it up and save its seeds.


Make sure that the fruit you select is healthy; an unhealthy tomato will produce fruit that are similarly unhealthy. It is okay fi the fruit is bruised or has insects in it, just be sure that the plant the tomato came from is healthy.
Wait until the fruit is at its very ripest before cutting for preservation.

, Use a sharp knife to cut your tomato in half down the equator (running through the stem). Do this over a cutting board or bowl so that you can easily gather the seeds and juicy innards from the fruit for preservation.

, Use a spoon to scoop out all the little seeds, juice, and soft, fleshy goop inside the tomato. Place all of this in a small bowl or cup.

, The seeds need to go through a fermentation process before being dried, and do this by sitting in their own liquids. Cover the container with your seeds and flesh in it with a bit of plastic wrap. Poke a few holes in the plastic wrap for the air to circulate.


Do not add water to the seeds and pulp., Now the seeds need some time to ferment. Place the covered dish someplace that is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave the seeds in this location for two or three days and make sure to open the contain and stir them with a stick twice per day., After several days, you will notice that the juice and flesh from the fruit has created a scum at the top of the water, while the seeds have sunk to the bottom of the dish. When this has happened, scoop off the stuff floating near the top and then pour the seeds and water into a sieve. Rinse with lukewarm water, making sure that the seeds are completely clean.

, Sterilizing your seeds will help to kill off any diseases and bacteria that might be growing, and help your plant to be stronger and produce more fruit when placed outdoors. Soak the seeds in a mixture of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of apple cider vinegar or bleach and 1 US-quart (950 ml) of water for 15 minutes.


You can do this with pre-packaged store bought seeds to make sure that they are bacteria and disease free as well.

, Post-rinse, shake the seeds in the sieve a bit to remove as much excess water as possible. Then, lay them out on a tray covered in coffee filters or wax paper. Place these somewhere they will not be bumped or exposed, with temperatures in the 70’s. Use your fingers to move the seeds around once a day to keep them from sticking to each other or the paper.

, When the seeds are completely dry to the touch and do not stick to each other, they are ready to use. Be careful not to pull seeds too early though, because if they are slightly damp they will grow mold, mildew, and bacteria that will spoil them., After they have finished drying, store your seeds in a paper envelope until they are ready to use. Avoid storing the seeds in a plastic bag or container, as these don’t allow as much air ventilation and are more likely to produce bacteria and mold in your seeds.Make sure to label your seeds with the plant variety and year as soon as they are dry.

Ready your plants for planting.",How to Plant Tomatoes from Seed3," Get planting trays from a local gardening center and fill them with sterile gardening soil. Use soil that is advertised as a seed starting mix for the best results.

, Create rows in your soil for seeds to be dropped in. Each seed should be planted two inches away from the next nearest seed. Lightly cover each planted seed with a bit of soil pinched together over the top, and follow with a bit of gentle watering.


If you are planting more than one variety of seeds, plant each type in its own individual row and label each row. When the plants begin to sprout, it will be very difficult to tell them apart otherwise.

, In order to germinate, the seeds need a source of light and heat. Place them in a large south facing window or use a heat or fluorescent lamp placed a few inches above them. The seeds will need at least 6-8 hours of light and warmth per day prior to sprouting.


You can also place a heating mat under the tray to heat up your soil, which will increase the germination rate.

, Water your tray of seeds daily, making sure that they get adequate light and heat. Keep them in an area that doesn’t drop below 70 degrees at the coldest point. When the seeds have sprouted and formed true leaves, they are ready to be picked out. The seeds will sprout baby leaves after about a week, but won’t form true leaves until about a month after germinating.

, Transplant each seedling into its own container in order to give it the space it needs to develop fully. Use a fork to scoop out the soil under each seedling, and gently pull them from the seed tray using your fingertips.

, Place each seedling into its own individual quart size container of potting soil. The separated plants will still need about 8 hours of heat and sunlight on a daily basis in addition to daily waterings.

, After about two months, your tomato seedlings should reach maturity and look like small, fully formed plants. Before these plants can be moved to your garden, they need to be hardened off - made used to the weather outdoors. Start by placing your plants outside in sunlight for 2-3 hours, and then bringing them back indoors. Continue this process by adding more time each day, until they are left outside for an entire day by the end of a week.

, When your plants are hardened off and ready to be planted outdoors, prepare them to be introduced to your garden. Plants that are over 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall need to be trimmed down. Use gardening shears to cut off the lowest level of branches around the plant. If your plants are smaller than 6 inches (15.2 cm) high, then they are ready to go and don’t require any further maintenance.However, you can also cut off the lowest branches on small plants, which allows for deeper planting and promotes a stronger root system.

Harvest your tomatoes.",How to Plant Tomatoes from Seed4," Finding the best place in your yard to plant tomatoes is an important step in the planting process. Tomatoes are sun-lovers who require exposure to direct sunlight 6-8 hours a day. When possible, look for areas that have good drainage, as buildup of water will weaken the flavor of your tomatoes and produce weak fruit.

, Create the best soil conditions for premier tomato growth. Test your soil pH to determine if any additives should be mixed into the soil; tomatoes have a preferred pH level of 6-6.8. Mix in compost and fertilizer to add nutrients to the soil, and break apart any large clumps. The soil should be well mixed and loose for 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) deep.


If you know you are going to be planting tomatoes several months in advance, then add compost and adjust the pH level several months prior to planting. This will give time to allow everything to absorb into the soil.

, Space your plants apart based on your preferred maintenance; if you are going to cage or stake your plants, each hold can be dug 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) apart. If you prefer to let your plants sprawl, the spacing should be a bit wider, closer to 4 feet (1.2 m) apart each. Dig the holes to be about 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep so that the entire root ball and bottom of the stem are buried.

, Sprinkle the bottom of each hole with a tablespoon of epsom salts to increase the magnesium levels, which helps to produce healthier plants. You can also choose to sprinkle in a bit more compost at this time.

, Transplant each tomato plant from its container to the holes you have dug. Squeeze the carton it is in to loosen the soil and root ball, and gently lift the plant out by flipping it upside down over your hand. Bury each tomato plant in the soil, pressing firmly to remove any air bubbles. Cover the plant up the stem to just underneath the first row of branches, but don’t worry about planting your tomato plants too deep. This allows for a stronger root system and gives your plants a healthy start.

, If you plan to have your tomatoes caged, add them at this point. Make a tomato cage out of the wire used for laying concrete, or a similarly large-spaced wire grid. Avoid tying the plant to the cage or stakes until after it has flowers.

, Water your tomatoes more frequently at first (daily), and reduce the watering frequency as they mature. Always give them a thorough watering so that water penetrates the soil. Frequent, shallow waterings will lead to shallow roots and a weak plant. Watch your plant's leaves for signs of drying out and water accordingly.If you don’t have time for daily waterings, look into installing a sprinkler or drip system in your garden.

, As your plants grow, keep them healthy by pruning regularly and harvesting the fruit. Use pruning shears to cut off any suckers (small branches that come out of major branch intersections) and any branches that are hidden underneath and in near constant shade., As fruit begins to appear, you are ready to harvest! Pick your tomatoes when they reach full ripeness, often on a daily basis. The fruits can be picked early and allowed to ripen indoors in sunlight if you are expecting bad weather or you have too much fruit. Eat your tomatoes fresh, can them, or freeze them whole to use in the future.

Pick potatoes according to their growth period.,
Obtain the seed potatoes of your choice.,
Prepare the potatoes for planting.,
Consider using the potato fruit to cultivate seeds.,
Spout your potato tubers in a greenhouse or windowsill.,
Prepare the soil.,
Pick an appropriate time for planting in your climate.,
Pick an appropriate spot in the garden.,
Put your seed potatoes about four inches deep.,
Care for the plant.,
Water the potatoes sparingly.,
Harvest your potatoes.",How to Plant Potatoes," Potatoes are classified according to the length of time they take to mature, which can be influenced by weather.


Early seed potatoes mature in 60-110 days. Planted towards the end of March, they are typically ready for lifting from late June or early July. A few varieties of new potatoes include Pentland Javelin, Arran Pilot, and Dunluce.
Maincrop seed potatoes mature in 125–140 days and if planted in late April can be harvested by mid-August, and this can continue through to October. These varieties are higher yielding and usually have larger tubers, which can be used fresh or stored for winter use. King Edward, Kerrs Pink, and Harmony are all good examples of this variety.;
, You can purchase a seed potatoes through the mail or at your local garden shop, or you can use leftover potatoes you purchased from the supermarket. These however, will not be certified as disease free, which can create a perpetual problem if you plan to raise potatoes in the same place again, as many diseases can be carried in the soil year by year.


Try to always use certified seeded stock. This is to control and reduce the risk of potato diseases and viruses. You can get certified potato stock from good garden centre, or online quite cheaply. Potatoes come in different growing times for example.

, With a sharp, non-serrated knife, slice the potatoes roughly into quarters, making sure each piece has no more than three ""eyes,"" which are the small pits or indents on the surface. Place in the sun and let it sit for a day or two, or until you begin to notice the eyes growing sprouts.









Don't soak your potatoes, as some might suggest. Potatoes have no tough shell to need softened by soaking as some seeds do and they have all the moisture they need for sprouting in the flesh of the potato itself. Soaking creates more risk of rotting than anything it might accomplish! You want the cut sides to ""heal""- form a dry ""skin"" over the area to discourage rotting.

, Some potato varieties will grow small, highly-toxic green fruits above the ground that each contain up to 300 ""true"" potato seeds. Chop the fruit finely and put the pieces in a dish of water; after about a day, the seeds will separate and sink to the bottom.








, You can use empty egg boxes or you can use empty seed trays to place them upright in. Once the shoots start growing about one half-inch, they're ready to plant.









Only leave 2 - 3 shoots on each potatoes, removing the rest.

, You can plant your potatoes in a patch of land, or you can put them in a planter on your patio. Large pots, a stack of tires and old chimney pots all work well. The most important thing is making sure your soil is as weed-free as possible. Additionally, you might want to till some compost or manure into the soil to make it nutrient-rich.









Prepare the ground with well rotted compost add a potato fertiliser high in potash.
Be sure to spade or loosen the soil extremely well. Potatoes will not grow in hard or compact soil.

, Time your planting so that it falls a week or two before the last frost of the season for your area, which you can figure out here. The colder nights will kill potential pests, and your potatoes will need more sunshine as the days get longer. For example, in coastal Virginia, potatoes planted on St. Patrick's day in March are harvested in July.

, Pick a loose and sunny part of your garden, because potatoes need high heat and lots of sunlight to grow properly. Never plant potatoes in the shaded areas of your garden.









Be sure to plant potatoes in a different part of your garden each year, so that soil can ""rest"" a season and replenish the nitrogen. Either that or replenish the soil with plenty of liquid fertilizer (05-10-10) during growing season and after your potatoes are harvested.
Potatoes can also be panted in potato bags or large pots. Carefully plunge a single chitted (sprouting) tuber into the compost with the shoots pointing upwards, to a depth of 12cm (5"") from the soil surface. Gently cover the tubers with compost. All they require is water and a bright, frost free position to grow in.

, Potatoes should be planted in rows about 12 inches apart and at a depth of about 4 inches. Build up the soil along the rows, forming a mound. Potatoes should be far enough apart that they shouldn't run into each other underground as they grow.









Another way to plant potatoes is to cut them into chunks so that each chunk has at least 1 or better 2 sprouts shooting up. Carefully dust the potato chunks with agricultural sulfur taking care not to break off the sprouts if at all possible as this slows down growth. Plant the potato chunks with the cut side of your chunk facing down into the soil and the sprout or ""eyes"" pointing up and about 3-4"" below the soil level in your mounds.
As the leaves start to push themselves above the soil, keep earthing up the soil around the plants to prevent any of the potatoes showing. Otherwise, these will turn green and be inedible, as well as poisonous.
Once the plants are well established and are in flower can give them a liquid feed. Once the plants start to die back that is normally the time to start lifting and harvesting.

, Nurturing your potato as it grows will ensure a healthy, edible product come harvest.


Pull any weeds around your potato plant.
If you notice holes or yellowing in your potato plant's leaves, you might have pests. If you don't want to use a pesticide on your potatoes, ask the employees at your local garden shop for tips on how to get rid of pests naturally.


, Potatoes like the soil to be not only loose but very well drained so only water them when they are getting dry, do not keep them moist once the tubers have formed. Be sure to plant them in soil that has been ""hilled"" or in mounds so the potato is at the top of the mound and water will run off easier. If you plant on level ground they will not thrive.









Once a week should be fine during summertime, as long as it is a thorough watering, but do it more often if necessary. If the leaves of the plant look like they're wilting, then your potatoes need more water. Be careful not to over water, though, or you'll end up with black potatoes.

, When it is near the first frost, harvest and eat. You can harvest potatoes in stages - ""young"" or ""early"" potatoes should be ready about 7-8 weeks after planting (when the flowers first appear). Take a few without pulling up the stems, and leave others to continue growing into full-sized potatoes. You will know when your potatoes are ready to harvest when the vine leaves turn yellow and wither."

Choose seeds from a tomato that has been open-pollinated.",How to Save Tomato Seeds for Next Year1," These plants have grown from true seeds, whereas hybrid tomato plants have been produced by seed companies. They are a cross between two parent plants and their seeds will not breed true.


If you don’t have any open-pollinated tomato plants in your garden, you can buy some heirloom tomatoes from your local grocery store or farmer’s market. All heirloom tomatoes are open-pollinated.;
"
"
Collect the seeds from the tomato.,
Scoop out the inside of the tomato.,
Spoon this mixture into a clean cup, bowl, or other container.,
Label the container with the name of the tomato seeds you are saving.,
Add enough water to the container to cover the seeds.,
Cover your seed container with a paper towel, cheesecloth or with plastic wrap.,
Place your covered seed container in a warm location out of direct sunlight.,
Once a day, remove the covering, and stir the seed mixture.,
Allow your seed container to sit.",How to Save Tomato Seeds for Next Year2," To do this, slice your ripe heirloom tomato in half with a knife.

, You'll get both the seeds and the gel surrounding the seeds.

, You don't need to separate the seeds from the gel, as this will happen naturally later on in the fermentation process.

, This is especially important if you are saving different types of seeds.

, The amount of water you use doesn’t matter as long as the seeds are covered; the mixture can even be soupy.

, Make sure to leave enough room so that air can get to the seeds. The air transpiration encourages seed fermentation.


If you use plastic wrap for a cover, be sure to poke a few holes in it.

, If possible, choose an indoor location instead of an outdoor one so nothing can interfere with the fermentation process.

, After you're done, replace the covering.

, This could take up to four days or until a film forms on top of the water and most of the seeds have sunk to the bottom of the container. Any seeds that are still floating on top of the water are not useable.

Use a spoon to remove the moldy film and all of the floating seeds.,
Clean out your container and fill it with fresh water.,
Wash the seeds by gently swishing them around in the fresh water.,
Carefully discard the rinse water.,
Place the seeds in a strainer.,
Spread out all the seeds in a single layer on a paper plate.,

Earth up the potatoes at the right time.,
Using your hoe, draw the gathered soil into mounds around the stems of your potato plants.,
Maintain the mounds.",How to Earth Up Potatoes," Do it before the tubers turn green, because once they have turned green, they become poisonous and inedible. Begin earthing up once the shoots of your plant reached approximately 20 cm (8 inches).;
, Use enough soil so that just 5cm (2 inches) of stem are left visible above the mound. This will ensure enough foliage is left to allow the plant to carry on growing strongly, but will starve the developing tubers of light so that they are prevented from turning green and poisonous. Whilst doing this, take the opportunity to remove any weeds or debris that have returned since planting.

, Keep an eye on your potatoes over the coming weeks in case the earth has been washed away by heavy rain. To avoid this occurring, do not make the mounds too steep. As the plant continues to grow, repeat the process every time it reaches 10-15cm (4-6 inches) of new growth above ground. This could mean repeating the process 3 or 4 times per season.

Look at your gardening area.,
Consider what you want out of a tomato.,
Make sure your garden is ready for a tomato plant.,
Go to the local gardening store with your list of questions in mind.,
Here is a list of classic well-loved tomatoes that do well in gardens:

For small areas (like a pot on the patio), try cherry tomatoes.,
Head to your nearest gardening store.,
Drive to your house, and plant your plant in a gardening area.",How to Pick the Right Tomato Plant for Your Garden," Ask yourself these questions: Is it a small pot in the patio? A raised bed in the backyard? A garden in an extremely humid or cold place? Is it in the shade or the hot sun? These questions will benefit your choice.;
, Do you want giant tomatoes to show off? Do you want a large or small harvest? Do you want to use them in sandwiches, salads, salsas, or sauces? Do you want an old-fashioned, classic taste?

, One tomato plant needs at least one square foot of area, but depending on its type and growth rate, may stretch even further.

, (Try Home Depot, Ace Hardware, or even Walmart.) You may even want to research online for the final decision.

, You may be surprised at how well they do in your pot and how sweet they taste in salads and off the vine.






For an old-fashioned, classic taste, try heirlooms such as Brandywine, Black Krum, or more. These have a delicious taste and do well in almost anything, but can be more susceptible to disease than hybrids. These do best in a larger area.






For giant kinds, try Big Boy and/or Beefsteak. These kinds take up a lot of space and if you want them to be big, you should prune some of the tomatoes off it so it focuses on making them bigger, not making more. These kinds can attempt to overgrow your garden, so be aware! They taste best in sandwiches and sometimes salads.







, (Ace Hardware, Walmart, Home Depot) Then, pick out plants or a seed packet that fits your expectations. Finally, buy some pots, fertilizer and soil.

, The area should get at least six hours of sunlight each day. Your transplants should fruit in one or two months, seeds in three or four months.

Find a five gallon bucket with handle.,
Drill a one to two inch hole in the bottom center of the bucket.

,
After frost in your area, carefully stick a small tomato plant through the hole, leaving the root ball, soil intact in the bucket.

,
Without squashing your plant, carefully fill the bucket with a bag of potting soil.,

Gather your harvest.",How to Grow Tomatoes Indoors," You have some choice when it comes to tomatoes, especially between determinate (bush) and indeterminate (vining) varieties. Both will have advantages for indoor gardens, so think about which kind is best for your purposes.Indeterminate tomatoes can be ideal for indoor gardens. Unlike determinate varieties, they will naturally climb and need a cage, trellis, or stake. But they’ll continue to grow and produce fruit all season long. If you are looking for a variety of tomato that will bear a lot of fruit and ripen quickly, choose a plum or cherry indeterminate.
Indeterminate tomatoes aren’t compact and need more space than determinates, though. If your space is limited, try smaller, dwarf determinate varieties. These should fruit over a 4-6 week period.
Heirloom indeterminates include Pink Ping Pong, Siberia, Silvery Fir Tree, Tommy Toe, and Yellow Pear. Hybrid indeterminates include Micro Tom, Orange Pixie Tomato, Patio, Ref Robin, Small Fry Tiny Tim, and Totem.Determinate cherry tomatoes include Washington Cherry and Gold Nugget. Hybrid determinates include Cherries Jubilee and Terenzo Hybrid.;
, Wet your seed starter mix or potting soil with fresh water until it is moist. Fill a seedling starter tray with a moist mix or soil. Poke one hole in the soil of each cell—the hole should be ¼ inch deep. Insert up to 3 seeds into each hole with a tweezers or your fingers. Cover the holes with moist soil or mix.









Sow the seeds 60-80 days before you intend to harvest your tomatoes.
If you don’t have seed trays, you can use plastic yogurt containers or cans.
If you are planting the seeds in a used container, clean the container with a 1:10 bleach:water solution., Germination is the process of transformation from a seed to a seedling. Tomato seeds will germinate within five to ten days. There are several actions you can take to speed up this process and to ensure its success.


Immediately after planting the seeds, cover your seedlings with a lid or a sheet of plastic wrap—this will prevent the soil from drying out.
Move the cells to a warm location. Throughout the germination, maintain a daytime soil temperature between 70 to 80℉. If you can not heat the space to at least 70℉, consider purchasing a heat mat or placing the plant cells in a sunny location.
Everyday, lift up the lid and water the seeds as needed., Tomato seedlings and plants require at least 8 hours of light each day. Without adequate light, tomato plants will become weak. As soon as the seeds have sprouted, discard of the cover and provide your seedlings with ample light. If you have a south-facing window, place the cells directly in front of the window. If you do not have a south-facing window, shine a grow-light or a fluorescent light on the seedlings.


Artificial light sources should be placed a few inches from the tops of the seedlings. As the plants grow, you will need to adjust the height of the lamps.
If you are keeping your plants on a windowsill or in front of a window, rotate them frequently to ensure that every side is exposed to light., As soon as your seedlings grow one to two sets of leaves, they are on the verge of outgrowing their cells. At this time, transplant the seedlings into a pot that is large enough to hold a mature plant—a five to ten gallon container is ideal.









Remove the seedlings from their cells without breaking the roots. Hold the seedling between two fingers and place your palm over the soil. Flip the cell upside down and gently tap the bottom of the cell until the seedling emerges.
Loosen up the roots by “tickling” the outer roots.
Bury the seedling up to the little fuzzy hairs at the base of the plant. These fuzzy hairs will become roots.
Water the seedling generously after transplant., After you transplant your seedlings, it is imperative that you continue to water the plants regularly. Assess the soil everyday for dryness by sticking your finger into the soil. If the soil is dry, water the the plant. If the topsoil is dry but the rest is moist, water at a later time.


Allowing the soil to dry out completely will yield rough-bottom tomatoes., While tomato plants require plenty of light, they also need a period of darkness. If you are using artificial lights, you need to mimic the natural rising and setting of the sun. Turn on your lights in the morning. After twelve to sixteen hours, turn off the lights and allow the plants to rest in the dark.


You can set your lights on a timer., Indeterminate tomato varieties continue to grow and produce all season. To sustain this intense cycle, you must provide your tomato plants with adequate nutrients. Within two weeks of transplanting, apply your first fertilizer treatment. Following the initial application, continue to fertilize your plants every few weeks until it is mature.


Use a fertilizer that is high in phosphorous.
Follow the instructions on the product., Indeterminate tomato plants require support from a stake or trellis for their vines. It is possible to “train” your tomatoes to grow up a trellis, stake, or cage. You can begin to train your tomato plants approximately one month after transplanting.


If you are using a single stake or a single-string trellis, you will train the main stem. Attach the stem to the support device with twine every six to eight inches. Tie the twine in a loose knot to avoid damaging the plant. As suckers grow (vines that appear between the main stem and branches) prune them by snapping them off with your fingers at the joint.
If you are using a cage or multi-string trellis, you will begin by training the main stem. Place a cage over the plant while it is small – it is harder to get cages over mature plants. Tie the main stem to the support device with twine every six to eight inches. Allow the first three or four suckers that appear to remain on the plant. Train these suckers in the same manner—tie the suckers to the trellis or cage every six to eight inches as they grow. As new suckers appear, prune them., When tomatoes are grown outdoors, bees, birds, and the wind distribute their pollen and develop fruit. When you grow tomatoes indoors, you must simulate this process. You may achieve this by:


Directing a fan towards your plants to mimic the wind.
Tapping or shake the main stem of each plant gently with your finger.
Pollinating the plants by hand with a paintbrush or cotton swab. You can gently rub these on the flowers, distributing pollen to each. , Indeterminate tomatoes produce fruit within sixty to eighty days after planting. They will continue to produce fruit all season long. You will know that your tomatoes are ripe when they have turned a vibrant and even red, yellow, or pink. The tomatoes should be slightly soft when squeezed.


To pick the tomato, grasp it near its stem and twist it until it snaps off."
"
Water the tomatoes adequately and regularly.,
Provide shade.,
Use compost rather than prepared fertilizer.,
Mulch.,
Look for a tomato variety less prone to splitting.,
Harvest as soon as splits occur.",How to Keep Tomatoes from Splitting," Tomatoes respond best to receiving the right amount of water during the entire growing phase; too much or too little water will harm the growing rate. The best way to achieve this is to put the tomatoes on a drip watering system that measures out equal quantities of water daily. See How to Build a Drip Watering System for Outside Plants.;
, Tomatoes are more prone to splitting in intense heat. If you live in a growing zone subject to high heat levels during the growing season, it is vital to shelter the growing tomatoes. Put up shade cloth, or plant the tomatoes in an area that gets shading from other plants or a building during the hottest part of the day.

, Too much of a good thing can cause the tomatoes to grow too quickly and split. Compost provides a more steady and slowly released form of fertilizer.

, Mulch helps to keep the water levels sufficient and not too clogged, nor too dry. This can be an excellent way to keep moisture in and prevent the tomato plant from drying out. Top up as the growing season progresses.

, Ask your local garden center for guidance. Older varieties tend to be more prone to splitting than newer ones, but ask about the tomatoes available.

, The tomatoes are very susceptible to bacteria and viruses once split and the flesh begins to change as soon as there is a split. Cut away from the split area; the rest of the tomato should be fine to consume.

Stir the container daily until a layer of white mold forms on the surface.,
Harvest the seeds.,
Pour water into the container to dilute the mixture.,
Spread the seeds over a non-stick surface and allow them to dry for several days.,
Store the seeds in a cool, dark place.",How to Grow Tomatoes from Seeds1," You can buy seeds online at seed exchange sites, from your local nursery, or from other gardeners. You can also buy seeds from the garden section of a department store. If you want to collect seeds from a plant, then you will need at least one tomato from that plant. Make sure the tomato is from a plant that was grown from an heirloom or open pollinated seed. If you choose tomatoes from a hybrid, or a plant with chemically-treated seeds, the results may not be as impressive. A tomato plant may be categorized by:



Heirloom or Hybrid: Heirlooms are tomatoes that have been genetically reproduced for several generations without any cross-breeding. Essentially, they're pure-bred tomatoes. Hybrid tomatoes are a cross between two varieties.

Determinate or Indeterminate: This method of classification describes the length of time for which a plant produces fruit. Determinate plants produce for a few weeks, while indeterminate plants produce fruit throughout an entire growing season until climate conditions become too cold. Indeterminate plants also grow larger and require more care in terms of pruning and staking.

Shape: Tomatoes are also classified into four categories of shape: globe, beefsteak, paste, and cherry. Globe is the most popular shape, beefsteak is the largest, paste tomatoes are used to make sauces, and cherry tomatoes are small, bite-sized tomatoes often used in salads.;
, You will want a container with a loose-fitting lid as the tomato pulp and seeds will be sitting in the container for a few days. A layer of mold will develop on the seeds. This process can destroy many seed-borne diseases that could affect the next generation of plants.

, If you are fermenting several different types of seeds, be sure to label the container with the correct variety to avoid any mix-ups. Set the lid on top of the container but do not seal it to allow oxygen to reach the pulp.

, The fermenting process can look off-putting and smell unpleasant, so set the container somewhere out of the way. For example, you could place the container under a sink, or in your garage (as long as it is warm enough).

, It usually takes about two to three days for the mold to form. Be sure to harvest the seeds shortly after the mold forms so that the seeds do not germinate in the container.

, Wearing gloves, scoop off the moldy layer. The seeds will have sunken to the bottom of the container.

, Let the seeds settle at the bottom and continue to pour off the unwanted parts of the solution over a strainer. Be careful not to throw away the seeds. After you have collected all of the seeds in the strainer, rinse them thoroughly with water.

, A glass or ceramic flat dish, baking sheet, a piece of plywood or a window screen all work well. It can be very difficult to remove dried seeds from paper or cloth. When they are dry, you can package them in a sealed plastic bag until you are ready to plant them. Be sure to label the variety of seeds on the package.

, You can also place them in an airtight container in your refrigerator to simulate a winter climate. Do not place the seeds in the freezer, doing so will damage them.

Store the containers in room of 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C) until germination occurs.,
Mist the seeds daily for the first 7 to 10 days.,
Check your pots every day.",How to Grow Tomatoes from Seeds2," To prepare your tomato plants to be transferred outdoors, start your seedlings indoors while it is still cold outside. Cool temperatures in early spring can stunt growth or even kill young seedlings. Start your seedlings indoors to improve your production chances.

, You can find these pots at your local nursery or garden supply store.
, For example, one mix could be made using 1/3 peat moss, 1/3 coarse vermiculite, and 1/3 compost. Just make sure to water it before you sow your seeds.

, Cover with soil and pat down lightly.

, When the seeds germinate, move them into full sun or under grow lights.

, When you start to see sprouts, you can water less frequently. More plants are killed by too much water (that rots the roots) than too little water so water sparingly after the plants sprout.


You can also soak the seeds flat in water, so the roots are watered from the bottom up. Misting may not get enough water to the roots.

, Once the plants peek out of the soil, they will grow pretty fast."

Dig a hole about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep.,
Take the plants out of their pots carefully and place them in the ground.,
Fertilize the plants.,
Place stakes or trellises next to the plants.",How to Grow Tomatoes from Seeds3," When there is no danger of frost outdoors and your plant meets the height requirement, they are ready to be transferred outdoors.

, About a week before you plan to transfer your plants outdoors, you need to gradually adjust them to outdoor temperatures. Gradually expose the plants to the sun, starting in a partially shaded area and slowly extend the number of hours the plants stay outside each day. Start with an hour or less per day and gradually increase from there.

, You want to use well-drained soil with a good amount of organic matter present.


Consider mixing peat moss into the soil to improve drainage. You can also mix in leaf mold or compost.
To use peat moss, remove no more than half of the soil and mix the removed soil with an equal ratio of peat moss. Mix the peat moss/soil mixture back into the planting area.

, Tomatoes grow best when planted in soil with a pH between 6 and 7.


Your local agricultural extension office should have soil testing forms, bags and instructions available. After making adjustments to the soil, test its pH level again.
If the pH level is below 6, add dolomite lime to the soil to raise the pH level.
If the soil pH is above 7, mix in granular sulfur to lower the pH level.

, It needs to be deep enough that you can plant your seedlings and only the top 1/4 of the plant will be sticking out of the ground. Place a scoop of organic matter such as compost into the bottom of the hole. This will give your plant an extra boost, and also help keep the plant from going into shock from transplanting.

, Try not to disturb the roots during the transplanting process. Set the transplants deep enough so that the soil touches the first set of new leaves when you cover the plant with soil. Pat the planted area lightly.


Be sure to remove all of the leaves that are at or below soil level. Tomatoes can catch diseases from their leaves making contact with the soil.

, You can fertilize the plants with fishmeal, chicken manure, or a premixed low-nitrogen, or a high-phosphorus organic fertilizer. Then, water the plants thoroughly. You will need to repeat the fertilizing process each month.

, This will give the plants a support to latch onto as they grow and makes it easier to pick the fruit from the vines. Be careful not to disturb the roots.

Feed and water your plants often.,
Pluck suckers off of your plants.,
Harvest the fruit at its peak.",How to Grow Tomatoes from Seeds4," Water at the base of the plant to avoid developing mildew on the leaves. Sprinkle your plants with liquid seaweed and layer the compost directly on the soil around the plant. Do this weekly to increase fruit production., If you want to promote better growth and a higher fruit yield, pluck the suckers off of your tomato plant using your fingers when they appear. Suckers grow in the crotch between a side stem and the main stalk. Leave a few near the top of the plant to avoid sunscald.

, Fruit should appear about 60 days after transplanting. Check the plants daily once they begin to ripen to ensure peak flavor. Gently twist the fruits and avoid pulling at the vine.

Growing from seedling will produce cherry tomatoes faster than growing from seeds. You can purchase seedlings or tomato plants from a farmer’s market or nursery. Seeds can be purchased from a nursery or seed catalogue, and there are several types of seeds to choose from. A few varieties of cherry tomatoes are:The Sungold plant. This type of cherry tomato grows large and is typically the first to produce fruit. It is a delicious choice.
The Sun Sugar variety. The Sun Sugar variety is very much like the Sungold plant, but the skin does not crack as easily.
The Chadwick and Fox are heirloom varieties that grow very fast and have a tangy flavor.
The Sweet Treats variety has a deep red color, sweet taste, and it is resistant to many diseases.;
, The cherry tomato plant grows rapidly, so you will need to have something to support the vines once they begin to grow long. You can use either a tomato cage or wooden stakes. For a tomato cage, you should purchase a large tomato cage from a nursery or home improvement store. You should buy the largest metal cage you can find. Wooden stakes can also be found at nurseries or home improvement stores. You will need to tie the vine around the stake as it grows. Cages do not require as much tying.Do not use a plastic or vinyl cage. It is toxic to plants and can expose them to lead.Keeping the plants off of the ground promotes air circulation for cleaner and healthier fruit.You can also use cages and stakes together. The stakes should be placed in the center of the cages.
It is important to find a large metal cage because the vines grow quickly and may outgrow a smaller cage quickly.

, You can grow cherry tomatoes in a garden or from containers. No method is better than the other and a lot depends on your location. If you choose to grow it in a pot or bucket, a pot or bucket that holds four to six gallons is ideal.A foam, plastic, or fiber glass pot works well, but anything from a terra-cotta planter to a garbage can will do.

, Cherry tomatoes require a lot of sun. Choose a location that will receive at least eight hours of direct sunlight every day. The plant should not be shaded by other plants. A plant that does not receive enough sun will wither and not produce good fruit., If using containers to plant, you should not use dirt from the garden. Dirt from outside risks transferring pests or diseases to the plant. Instead, buy an organic potting mix. You should buy one 20-quart box to start out with.Fertile soil is usually darker and will crumble when held. A soil that is not fertile will clump.Organic Mechanics is a well known and liked brand., If you’re using a garden, do a soil test of the area where you want to plant your tomatoes. This will help you see if you’ll need to change the soil’s pH, nutrient level, and tilth. It’s best to make these changes at least two weeks before planting.Dig a 6- to 10- inch hole in the spot you’ll use for planting. To test tilth, separate a clod about the size of a soup can and break it apart with your fingers. The soil should be made of different sized crumbs. It shouldn’t be powdery or clumpy.
Check for living organisms. Healthy soil will have living things like insects, worms, centipedes, spiders, and others. Watch for about 4 minutes and count – less then 10 organisms and your soil may not be ideal.
You might also need a testing kit to check pH. You should be able to find one at your local home and garden store. Scoop some soil into a plastic or glass container and then follow the instructions.

, Cherry tomatoes need warm weather to grow and they will die when exposed to frost. The last frost date should pass a week before you begin planting. The weather should be around 70 in Fahrenheit and around 21 in Celsius when planting seedlings.If planting from seeds, you can start them indoors 8 to 10 weeks before the last average frost date. They’ll need two or three months of warm or hot weather to grow and harvest tomatoes.

, If planting in a pot, it needs to have holes in the bottom for drainage. If it does not, drill ¼ to ½ holes every few inches around the bottom edge and a few holes in the center as well. Planting in a garden may need a little preparation before planting, given the results of your soil test. If you plan to keep the container inside or on a balcony, you will probably want to put a saucer underneath it so that the drainage doesn’t run everywhere. You can find a saucer at a nursery, home improvement store, and some supermarkets.
If using a garden, be sure you choose a consistently sunny place. It also won’t hurt to add some compost to the soil before planting.

, This step is only if you will be using a cage in a container. If using a stake or planting outside, you will not need to put them into position until you’ve planted. Do not put the potting mix into the bucket before inserting the cage. Instead, put the pointy end of the cage into the pot and then fill in the potting mix., Pour the potting mix into the container. Water the mix until it is evenly moist. Then, fill in more mix until it comes ½ inch below the rim of the container. The surface of the soil should be even.You can use a cup or watering can to water the mix.

, You should dig a small hole into the center of the soil if planting in a container. If planting multiple plants in a garden, you will need to dig holes two feet apart from each other. Put the plants into the small holes. Planting from seedling requires inserting it deep enough in the hole so that only four or five leaves are left showing once the hole is covered.The hole only needs to be a few inches deep.

, Use the soil that you removed to fill in the hole. The seedling should only be showing about four leaves. Make sure the surface of the soil is even when you have finished covering., Put the point end of the cage around the area where you planted. The seedlings should be in the middle of the cage. If using stakes, you can wait to put in the stakes until the seeds have sprouted into seedlings. Put the stakes three inches from the seedling. Use a hammer to secure the stake into the ground.Waiting until the plant is larger to cage or stake may result in a damaged plant.

, You should water the plants every two or three days. The soil should be moist at all times. If at any point it does feel dry, water the soil or mix until it is moist again. The soil should seem saturated, but not drowning in water., The fertilizer gives the plants the nutrition to grow and thrive. Essentially, it acts as food. Use an organic fertilizer once a week. To use the fertilizer, work it into the first few inches of soil with your fingers or a plastic fork. Make sure the fertilizer stays a few inches away from the stem.A few well known brands of organic fertilizer for tomatoes are Gardener’s Supply, Tomato-tone, and Burpee Organic Tomato Fertilizer.
Directions vary according to the product. Follow the directions on the label when applying fertilizer.
Organic fertilizers release nutrients slower than chemical fertilizers. Using a chemical fertilizer risks burning the roots, though they are often cheaper. , Once the plant has grown larger, you will need to prune every so often. Prune when sprouts and branches start to grow off of the central stem, and when leaves look dry or dead. Use small pruners or scissors.You should also push back any branches that poke out of the holes of the tomato cage. The plant will drop if you do not., Cherry tomato plants do get pests, but fungus is often a larger problem. Symptoms of a fungus problems include yellowing leaves, moldy blotches, and dark spots. Stems may be affected as well. Pick the leaves off and spray your plant with fungicide immediately if you notice any of these symptoms. Potato beetles and stink bugs are common pests. Pick them off or use a natural insect spray to repel them.Plant Doctor, Daconil, and Garden Safe are a few brands of fungicide.EcoSmart and Safer are a couple of brands of organic pesticide.
Fungus that spreads throughout the entire plant can most likely not be saved. To avoid infections, try watering your plants in the morning directly into the soil. Watering leaves, especially later in the day, encourages fungal growth.
Fungus can survive in soil for years. Remove the cherry tomato plants from the soil if fungus is a recurring problem. Plant a different type of plant or flower in that area.

, A seedling will begin to flower in about a month. If you used seeds, you should add about two weeks to that amount of time. Flowers will turn into small, green fruits. Ripe and ready to pick cherry tomatoes will be ready a few weeks after that. The tomatoes should come off of the stems easily. Do not pull or twist the vine to pick a tomato. Pick individual fruits off of the vine every day.The plant should continue to produce tomatoes until the first frost.
Freshly picked tomatoes should be stored at room temperature; they will rot if refrigerated. They can also be canned or dried."
"
Plant many species of tomatoes seeds which grow into many sizes: large, medium, cherry (grape - large marble size) and different colors.
,Plant some in earthen pots and keep them inside for temperature control.,
During this season of the year, it's not very hot so the sun doesn't evaporate the water quickly.,To protect the roots in the soil from becoming too cold, when you transplant each plant, place wood chips around the base.,
After they get up to about 10 inches (25.4 cm) tall, which might take about 2 months total, withdraw the chips if they are beginning to look blighted.",How to Grow Tomatoes in Central Mexico in the Winter Months,",, Watering should only be done every third day and not heavy them.,, The wood chips hold moisture and may become coated with a ""mold"" looking substance, so discard it. Some plants might die almost immediately. Most should survive and thrive."
"
Determine which variety you're growing.,
Check the plant for signs of yellowing.,
Check for suckers.,
Look for flowers.",How to Prune Tomatoes1," Before you make any cuts, figure out whether you're growing an indeterminate or determinate variety of tomato plant. Indeterminate varieties grow like vines, and they must be trained upright on poles and pruned in order to grow correctly. Determinate varieties contain themselves before they grow into a bush, and they naturally direct their energy toward fruiting without needing as much intervention. Here are the common varieties of each:



Indeterminate: Big Boy, Beef Master, Black Prince, German Queen, most cherry tomato varieties and most heirloom varieties.

Determinate:Ace 55, Amelia, Better Bush, Biltmore, Heatmaster, Heinz Classic, Mountain Pride and Patio.;
, One way to know when it is time to start pruning is to wait for the stems and leaves below the first set of flowers to turn yellow. When you notice this color change, you can start pruning.

, Look for the tiny new branches sprouting in the spot where a branch meets the stem on an indeterminate plant. These are called ""suckers"" and they're what you want to remove. Suckers left to grow will take energy from the rest of the plant and cause the plant to bear fewer fruits. This isn't always a bad thing, but strategically removing suckers will help your plant bear large fruit all season long.

, It is a good idea to start pruning your tomato plants early, as soon as there are flowers on the plants. At this point, the plants should be between 12 and 18 inches."
"
Remove all suckers and their leaves below the first flower cluster.,
Leave the thicker shoots.,
Pinch off all but four or five fruit bearing trusses for indeterminate varieties.,
Remove yellow leaves.,
Top the plant.",How to Prune Tomatoes2," Do this no matter what kind of tomato plant you have. This keeps the plant strong by helping it grow a sturdy central stem. This should ensure that the majority of the nutrients are sent to the fruits, instead of being wasted on the unwanted growing tips.


To remove a sucker, grab a growing tip by the base between the thumb and forefinger and bend it back and forth until it snaps cleanly. This should ideally be done when the shoot is young and supple. The small wound will heal quickly. This is called ""simple pruning"".
As for stems and leaves, not the suckers, growing below the first flower cluster: If you live in a warmer zone such as Zone 9, you should leave them on until they turn yellow. They are important for helping to shade the ground until the plant matures. On the other hand, if your plant is in a humid environment (such as a greenhouse), remove everything below the first flower cluster to improve ventilation. Humidity can make it easier for sicknesses to flourish, and it also causes the wounds that are created while pruning to dry up more slowly making the plant longer vulnerable. By improving ventilation, you're helping to protect the plant.

, Thicker suckers should not be snapped off, since this could damage the whole plant. If it's thicker than a pencil, use the ""Missouri pruning"" method and pinch out just the tip of the sucker, leaving one or two leaves behind for photosynthesis and to protect developing fruit from sun scald. The drawback is that suckers will develop from the stem that you leave behind, which will require additional pruning. This technique is better when you're dealing with large suckers; if the wound becomes diseased, it will be further away from the main stem. This method also leaves a few inches on the sucker to reduce the shock to the plant.


Prune suckers all summer long to keep the plant healthy. They grow quickly, so you may need to prune once or twice a week., These are the branches that grow from the main stem above the first flower cluster. Four or five will produce large, healthy fruit, but any more than that and the fruit will be small and scant. Choose four or five sturdy trusses to keep, then pinch out any additional side shoots, leaving the plant's top shoot intact, known as the terminal shoot.


Make sure the vine-like plants are tied to supports after flowering occurs. Otherwise, the vine will grow along the ground and won't produce healthy tomatoes.Determinate plants already have a predetermined number of stems that will naturally grow, so there's no need to do any pruning above the flower cluster. If you prune above the flower cluster, you'll be removing fruit-bearing branches without helping the plant., Yellow leaves are leaves that use up more sugar than they produce. As the plant begins to mature, the lower leaves will naturally begin to yellow and wilt. This is perfectly normal, so pull these from the plant when they appear. It will keep the plant fresh and help ward off disease.

, To get the best out of the last growth of the season, it is necessary to ""top"" the plant. About a month before the first expected frost, or when the plant hits the roof of your greenhouse, remove the plant's terminal shoot. At this point in the season, the tomatoes currently growing will have a limited time to reach maturity, so all nutrients must be directed straight to the fruit.

Decide which type of tomatoes you want.,
Decide how many plants you want to grow.,
Know what your growing zone is.",How to Buy Heirloom Tomato Seeds," There are over 600 varieties of heirloom tomatoes; each has its own unique flavor and appearance. In choosing the variety to buy, consider the following:

How much fruit do you want your tomato plants to produce? Some varieties do not produce as much fruit as modern hybrid varieties.
Do you need tomatoes that transport well? Some just aren't good travelers, which explains why they fell out of favor over the years.;
, Heirloom tomato seed packs may contain anywhere from 25 to 75 seeds, depending on the variety of tomato, the experience of the gardener and the seed company.

, The growing season differs quite a bit from one area to another, and you’ll have a better crop—and taste—if you learn which variety grows best in your area.

Finished.

",How to Grow Tomatoes Upside Down," Choose a sunny place indoors to hang the tomato plant's container. Your plant can be hung from a hook in the ceiling or tied around a beam––use what works for the space you've allotted.


If you're using a basket around the bottle, using string or twine, knot the basket to create hangers for attaching to the hooks or around the beams. Attach the basket to your ceiling or beam, ready for the adding the plant. When selecting the basket, choose one that will hold the upside-down milk or juice bottle that you'll be using without slipping out or toppling sideways. Be sure to check this before hanging the basket up! This step is prettier but optional, as you can also use the bottle direct (see below).;
, Plants bought or grown from seed are both fine choices. Water this plant well and set it to one side.

, Remove the lid. See the image for more details.


Tie string or twine to the edges of the cut end of the bottle for hanging. Punch out the holes using a hole puncher, or use a sharp tool to insert holes through which the string can pass. Knot the string in place with loops to attach to the hangers you've made. While the image shown later in this tutorial shows two holes, you may find three holes produces a better balance––experiment to see what works best.

, Gently set it upside down in the milk or juice bottle. Gently feed the plant through the pouring hole, so that the tomato plant is hanging out of the hole, with the roots still inside the bottle.

, Then water it. (Now you see why the hanger was put up first - it's impossible to put the plant on a surface without covering it in soil or damaging the plant.) If using a basket, insert the bottle into the hanging basket for hanging; if not, simply hang the bottle direct to the hangers. You're now ready to begin growing your upside-down tomato plant.

, The easiest way to water is to purchase a plant watering bottle which contains a hooked tube that sucks up the water and delivers it via the hook into the top of the container; you simply hold up the bottle, tuck the hook over the top of the container and squeeze the water in. These can be purchased from garden and hardware stores.


Be aware that the water tends to dribble out of the neck of the bottle; this will gradually reduce as the root system develops.
Try putting another plant underneath your hanging tomato plant to catch the extra water that escapes, or place a container under the plant to catch the water and use it to water your other hanging tomato plants. Another option is to hang the plant where it doesn't matter as much where the water drips, such as on your balcony.

Grow plants that attract beneficial predators.",How to Grow a Tomato Plant," You can plant almost any variety and don’t have to water your plants as often as you would if they were in containers. This is also a method to consider if you want a large yield of fruit.


You’ll have to find a spot that receives 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day. If soil-borne diseases break out, you’ll have a difficult time sterilizing the entire area or replacing the soil. These gardens are more vulnerable to moles, gophers, birds, squirrels, and deer.;
, This is a great option if you’re concerned about pollutants in your soil. You could even replace the soil if disease breaks out or if necessary. The non-compact soil allows for better drainage and aeration than in-ground gardens. If you suffer from back or leg pain, you have the advantage of not having to bend over as much.









As for disadvantages, you’ll have to leave enough space between beds for efficient maintenance and harvesting. You’ll also have to pay up front for materials, such as untreated lumber and soil.Raised beds also dry out faster than planting in the ground.

, Some containers are more portable than others. They’re great if you don’t have much yard space. However, they require more frequent watering, since the soil dries out quickly. You’ll also need to invest in additional support structures if you live in a climate that gets high winds. Some popular forms of containers are:









Upcycled buckets are cheap and easy to acquire. They’re usually lightweight enough to transport, but you have to drill your own drainage holes. Dark plastic can overheat and leach toxic chemicals into the soil. Metal buckets can rust and stain your patio or deck.
Barrels are attractive and provide enough space for roots to flourish. Just keep in mind that they’re difficult to move and will eventually rot. You’ll also have to drill your own drainage holes.

, You can water and harvest your tomatoes simply by opening your window. You’ll also have to deal with fewer pests the higher up you live. Stick with small varieties like cherry tomatoes to avoid toppling. You’ll also have to anchor the boxes to your window(s).







, Choose this option if you want to avoid stooping over your plants. Because they’re not in or close to the ground, you’ll have to water them more frequently. They also need strong hardware to anchor them in place.









Hanging baskets can be adapted to upper-story apartments by hanging them from the window sill. Just keep in mind that your options will be limited to small varieties like cherry tomatoes.
Upside-down planters can be made from upcycled buckets. In this state, tomato plants don’t need to be staked. Birds are less likely to pick at tomatoes because they have nowhere to perch. However, the unabsorbed water may drip onto leaves and fruits, increasing the risk of disease. Inverted hangers also produce small yields., You can find tomato plants at nurseries, garden centers, and even at farmers’ markets. Choose healthy looking plants and make sure to buy the tomato plants close to when you plan on planting them., Tomatoes demand a growing medium rich in organic matter. If you don't make your own compost, use store-bought compost that includes granite dust and topsoil. You'll need about 5 to 8 pounds per square foot (25 to 40 kilograms per square meter). Turn compost into the top 3 inches (6 to 8 cm).Before setting your seedling or plant in the soil, toss a couple handfuls of organic material or egg shells in the bottom of your planting hole. As the roots grow deeper, they'll hit this layer of nutrients just in time to really boost your fruit output.

, Tomatoes thrive in mildly acidic soil. Highly acidic soil can leach calcium from the plant and lead to blossom end rot. Keep the soil pH between 6.0 and 6.8. If your soil tests above 6.8, water your tomatoes with a mixture of equal parts cold coffee and water. You could also add a mulch pf pine needles. If your soil tests below 6.0, use either dolomite lime or calcium sources like crushed eggshells or calcite.







, Place tomato plants in full sun. If you live in a cooler growing zone, aim for at least 6 hours of sunlight each day. If you live in a warm to hot zone, pick a spot that gets some shade in the afternoon.








Keep in mind that tomato plants can take full sun even in warmer climates. You will just need to keep the soil well-mulched and watered.

, This is usually enough space to allow you to get in between the plants to water, weed, and harvest. If you live in a hot climate, space plants 9 to 18 inches (23 to 46 cm) apart. This distance allows plants in cages to shade each other’s fruit, preventing burn., Bury about 50 to 80 percent of the plant. Pack the soil firmly around the roots. Make sure the roots are completely covered.Make sure to trim off the lower leaves of the plant and do not bury them. If you bury them then they will rot.









When removing the plants from their pots, tap the bottom of the pot and try to get the roots and soil all in one piece. This is important because ripping the roots apart could damage the plant.

, This supports the tomato vine. Set them up at the time of planting. Don’t wait more than 14 days.If you prefer, you could make your own tomato cages.









A cage should be at least 48 inches (1.2 m) tall. Cages can bend if the plants get heavy and sometimes collapse in summer storms. Remove leaves and secondary stems as the plant grows.A stake should be at least 0.5 x 2 inches (1.3 x 5 cm) wide and 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters) long. Pound stakes about 12 to 24 inches (30 cm to 60 cm) deep, at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from the plant. Secure the plant to the stake using loosely knotted, double-looped strips of cloth or garden twine that won't strangle the plant. Stakes can be made of bamboo, scrap wood, electrical conduit, or iron bar., Do this after the first week. Give them about 16 ounces (about 500 mL) of warm water per plant every day. Drip or soaker hose watering aimed at the roots is better than overhead watering, which can encourage diseases.To prevent mold or fungal diseases, water plants in the morning.
Water less frequently after 10 days. Ensure plants are receiving 1 to 3 inches (2.5 cm to 7.6 cm) of rain weekly. If not, give each plant about 2 gallons (about 7.5 L) per plant per week, beginning by about the end of the second week after transplanting.Increase water as the plants get larger and when weather is hotter. Water deeply 2 to 3 times weekly, about ..75 to 1 gallon (2.84 to 3.79 L) (about 3 to 4 L) each time. Make sure that the soil is moist, but not drenched., After one or two weeks, surround the plants with a mulch of straw or dried grass. This should control weeds and keep the soil moist during dry weather. The mulch should be about an inch (2.5 cm) thick and surround at least a circle 12 inches (about 30 cm) in diameter around the stem., Tomatoes can grow very well organically if the soil is enriched with organic matter. If you choose a chemical fertilizer, look for a vegetable fertilizer. Use half the recommended concentration of chemical fertilizer per gallon








Do not use lawn fertilizer. The ratio of minerals in lawn fertilizer is for growing stems and leaves.
Over-fertilization can cause plants to grow too quickly, leaving them more susceptible to disease and insects.

, This increases fruit production by evenly distributing pollen. Do this once or twice each week for about 5 seconds. Start this practice when flowering begins.







, These are branches that grow in the joint between the main stem and other branches. They use some of the plant's nutrients as they grow. Leaving suckers will produce more, but smaller, fruit. Pinch them off for larger fruits., If you live in a hot climate, grow heat-tolerant varieties like Phoenix, Heatmaster, and Solar Fire. Find a spot that receives full sun in the morning and filtered sun in the afternoon. Between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM, protect your plants with shade cloths.


If your fruit starts to ripen during an intense heat wave with nights over 75 °F (24 °C) and days over 95 °F (35 °C), harvest the fruit early. It will stop ripening in intense heat., Tomato plants require high humidity (80-90 percent) during the day and moderate humidity (65-75 percent at night) to produce fruit. Humidity over 90 percent and below 65 percent can trigger blossom end rot. If you’re growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, use a sling psychrometer to measure humidity. To increase humidity outdoors or in the greenhouse, try misting the plants. Decrease humidity in the greenhouse by increasing ventilation.If you live in a very humid climate, your best bet for outdoor tomatoes is to grow humidity-tolerant varieties, such as Ferline, Legend, Fantasio., Blossom-end rot is the blackening and eating away of the bottom of a tomato fruit. Once you see it, it’s too late to save the plant. Prevention is your best bet. Calcium deficiency causes blossom-end rot.To prevent this problem:


Bring about one gallon (about 4 L) of water and a tablespoon (15 mL) of lemon juice to a boil.
Add 6 tablespoons of bone meal to the water. Stir well. Don’t worry about completely dissolving the solution.
Cook covered for 30 minutes.
Allow it to cool.
Feed 1 quart (about 1 L) of solution to each plant at the leaves and roots.
Repeat the treatment a second time in 3 to 5 days.You can also sprinkle crushed eggshells around the plants to add calcium to the soil.

, Put red ornaments around the top of the tomato cages. Birds will think they’re tomatoes and peck at them. The ornaments’ hard, tasteless surfaces will confuse the birds. This will make them leave your tomatoes alone.Keep in mind that this will only work temporarily. Before the fruit ripens on your tomato plants, drape netting over the plants to keep the birds away.

, You can do this if you live in the country or in a city that allows it. Chickens and ducks enjoy eating slugs and tomato hornworms. Without control, slugs and hornworms can kill your plants by eating the leaves., Use the cardboard rolls from toilet paper or paper towels around the bottom the stem while the plant is still young. The texture of the cardboard makes the stem impossible for slugs to climb., Some good choices are calendula, zinnias, marigolds, and nasturtiums. The ladybugs and braconid wasps they attract get to eat the aphids and hornworms that would otherwise destroy your tomatoes."

Harvest loose-leaf lettuce as you need it or all at once.",How to Grow Lettuce Indoors1," Loose-leaf varieties are the easiest to grow indoors, especially if the name includes ""baby"" or ""little."";
, Lettuce does not have a particularly deep root system, so a medium container should offer plenty of room. Plastic works better than terracotta clay pots, since clay absorbs water and dries out the soil faster than plastic.


If using a clay pot, line the pot with a plastic shopping bag before you plant your lettuce seeds. Make holes in the plastic bag to allow water to drain.
Make sure that the container has drainage holes. These holes will allow excess water to escape if you water the plant from the surface. Holes also allow you to use a watering tray technique which is especially beneficial for lettuce plants.

, Bacteria and insect eggs could be lurking inside the pot, waiting to destroy your plants. Standard soap and warm water should kill most potential threats, but you can also wash your container out with a solution made of nine parts water and one part bleach for a more thorough cleansing.

, Loose-leaf lettuce is about as ""no fuss"" as a vegetable can be, so you don't need anything fancy. A standard all-purpose potting mix should work just fine. Avoid using dirt from your garden, however, since this may contain bacteria and insects that could damage your crop.

, Fill it high, but not to the very top. You should leave about an inch (2.5 centimeters) or so of empty space in between the surface of your soil and the rim of the container.








, Lettuce seeds are small, so the pile of seeds in your hand should look relatively small, as well.

, You do not need to get all the seeds with your first pinch. A small amount is enough to start with.

, Try to avoid dropping too many in the exact same spot, but you do not need to worry too much about how far apart the seeds are spaced at this point in time.








, Pinch the seeds in between your index finger and thumb and sprinkle them over the soil.








, Only cover the seeds with 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch (1/3-centimeter to 2/3-centimeter) of soil. If you use any more soil than that, the seeds will not be able to receive the light they need to germinate.








, The soil should be thoroughly moist, but not soaked.








, The soil needs to remain continually moist in order to germinate. Germination should occur within one or two weeks.

, The lettuce may need more or less frequent watering, depending on how warm and sunny your home is. Check the soil frequently by sticking your fingertip into the top 1/2-inch (1 1/4 centimeters). If it feels dry, the lettuce may be due for another watering.


Consider tray-watering the lettuce. Place a tray or saucer of water beneath the container and allow the water to travel into the soil via the drainage holes. By watering from the bottom up, you may have more success in preventing root rot and fungal disease.

, A room temperature set at 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 21 degrees Celsius) is ideal. Drop the temperature by 10 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees Celsius) at night to mimic natural conditions.

, Lettuce seedlings need 14 to 16 hours of bright light in order to grow full, bushy leaves.

, If you cannot provide the lettuce seedlings with enough natural light, place the container 4 inches (10 centimeters) beneath a grow light and keep the seedlings there for 14 hours. Turn the light off once this amount of time passes, however, since lettuce plants will not do well under 24-hour light.

, Pull out the weakest seedlings, keeping a 3-inch (7.62 centimeters) space in between the remaining plants to give them adequate room to mature.


Instead of throwing away the ""reject"" seedlings, transplant them into separate containers or harvest them for consumption. Lettuce seedlings are edible and taste very similar to mature lettuce leaves.

, Lettuce is a hearty enough plant to thrive on its own, but a mild fertilizer, mixed with equal parts water to cut it down to half-strength, can increase your yield even more. Apply the fertilizer solution to the seedlings once a week for three weeks, and then discontinue use.

, Immature leaves are just as safe and delicious as mature leaves.


Immature lettuce tastes just as good as mature lettuce. As soon as the leaf size is to your liking, you can begin to harvest the outer leaves. Leave the inner leaves alone so that they can develop further.
You may need to wait about 4 to 6 weeks for the lettuce to mature if you prefer to harvest a fully mature head of lettuce. Collect the leaves individually, pulling the outer leaves out first and gradually working inward. Mature lettuce ""bolts"" or produces seed quickly, however, and must be harvested before this occurs. Bolted lettuce has a bitter taste.

Open the bag after the seeds germinate.,
Harvest the leaves individually as they start to get large.",How to Grow Lettuce Indoors2," The holes should be small enough to prevent potting soil from falling out, but large enough to let water escape.

, The bag should only be about 3/4 full, and the potting soil should be pre-moistened to help keep it inside the bag with its snipped-off corners.

, Excess soil and water can escape through the corner holes, which could create a mess if you allow it to sit out on the counter or windowsill by itself. Placing it in a tray will help you to capture and contain the mess.

, Pinch a few of the seeds in between the index finger and thumb of your dominant hand, and sprinkle them over the surface of the soil.

, Use no more than 1/8-inch (1/3-centimeter) of soil so that the seeds can absorb sufficient light.

, You only need a light spritz; anything more than that will cause the seeds to drown and cause muddy water to come gushing out of the cut-out corners of the bag.

, Leaving the bag completely open will allow too much heat and moisture to escape, but sealing it completely shut will cause the air inside to grow stale. Leave at least 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) open, ""zipping"" or sealing the rest of the bag's opening.

, Alternatively, you may also use a fluorescent grow light to provide supplementary light. Even using this method, the lettuce seeds need around 12 to 14 hours of light each day.

, Germination should occur within a few days to a week. Continue spraying the soil to keep it moist, and provide the seedlings with the same amount of light as before.

, This should only take a few weeks. Pick off the outer leaves first before gradually moving inward. Do not wait for the lettuce to mature into a full head when growing it in a plastic bag, since this short-cut method is not intended to nurture fully mature lettuce.

Prepare the soil for planting.,
Dig a trench in the soil, and plant the lettuce seeds.,
Cover the seeds with .5 inch (1.3 cm) of soil.,
Thin your plants once the seedlings have formed their first real leaves.,
Harvest your organic lettuce when the outer leaves are about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long.,
Keep pests at bay through organic methods.",How to Grow Organic Lettuce," Ensure that the soil has a pH balance between 6.0 and 6.8. The ground needs to be well-drained and full of nutrient-rich soil that is full of compost or aged manure. Lettuce plants do well in steady amounts of nitrogen, so apply blood meal or compost tea to the soil before adding the seeds.


If you are unsure what your soil's pH is, you can purchase a soil testing kit from your local garden supply store. You will need to scoop up soil, place it in the provided container, and add a specific number of drops of the testing chemical. Shake the container for a certain amount of time, and compare the results with the test's color-coded chart.
You can also contact a local university's extension office to get your soil tested at its facility. This typically is a fee-based service, but you may receive more in-depth results.;
, Lettuce plants have a short root system, so you don't need to dig a deep trench. Insert the seeds .25 to 1 inch (.6 to 2.5 cm) deep.

, Place an additional 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of organic compost or mulch. This will keep the seeds moist and prevent weeds from forming.


If you are planting several varieties of lettuce in your garden, make sure you plant the varieties a minimum of 12 feet (3.66 m) apart to prevent cross-pollination.

, Thinning is simply removing certain seedlings to allow your plants to spread out. Leaf lettuce seedlings should be 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart while heads of lettuce should be 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) apart.


If you're growing organic lettuce heads, such as iceberg, aim for 12 to 14 inches (30.5 to 35.6 cm) apart. Single-leaf lettuce plants should be 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart.

, This ensures that the plant will survive after the leaves are removed. You can use your hands to tear off the leaves anywhere on the stalk once the leaves are long enough. Continue to harvest lettuce leaves until you are left with a center stalk. It may take as long as 80 days after planting to harvest.


If you're harvesting heads of lettuce, cut the head 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the soil. A new head will form in its place.

, Lettuce is prone to a rabbits as well as few insects, including slugs, aphids, and cabbage worms. You need to reapply the sprays after each watering or rainfall.


For rabbits, mix 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml). of cayenne pepper, 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml). of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of liquid detergent, and 20 oz. of warm water. Shake the mixture, and let it sit outside for 1 day. Spray the mixture to the lettuce leaves.
To treat these insects, you can use traps for slugs and purchase ladybugs to eat the aphids. Slug traps can be made by filling a small bowl with stale beer; the slugs are attracted to the beer and drown. For cabbage worms, you can apply a spray that is 1 part vinegar to 3 parts water. Add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml). of liquid detergent, and place all ingredients in a spray bottle. Spray the leaves all over to get rid of the worms.

Harvest.",How to Grow Lettuce in a Colander," Most kinds of colanders will work, including enameled metal, pottery and stainless steel. Choose a colander that has a base if possible (if it does not have a base, ensure that it sits flat and sturdily) and that is fairly wide across. The colander can be small or large but you'll obviously have less space for lettuces in a smaller colander than a larger one.;
, Turn the colander upside down on the thin cardboard sheet. Trace around the colander circle. Remove the colander. Finish the template by drawing another circle a little way in from the first circle, about 2 to 4cm (3/4 to 1 1/2 inches) smaller than the first circle, depending on the colander size.

, For a smaller colander, quarters is best, while a larger colander may divide into either sixths or eighths. Remember that the lettuce needs sufficient space to grow, so don't make the divisions too small. Mark the divisions in place.

, Cut out the shapes from the inner circle and set them aside. It is the inner circle shapes that you'll use to make the divisions once the soil is in the colander.

, Push the hanging basket lining into the colander to cover all of the holes. Trim around the top so that it is flush with the top of the colander all the way around.

, Add a little compost suitable for container mixes. Fill to almost the top but not quite, then shake a little to help the soil settle evenly.

, Do this generously as it is going to form the basis for not watering directly over the coming days because the seeds will obtain sufficient moisture from this watering.

, This is the variety that can handle being cut several times and will regrow after each harvesting.

, Put all of the templates in place, then remove one and plant the first seeds. Replace that template, then remove the next one and plant the next seeds, this time choosing the alternative color to the one you've just planted. Continue in this manner, alternating lettuce colors, until all of the segments have been planted with the lettuce seeds. The alternation is important because it provides a very colorful and clearly divided display once the lettuces start to grow.

, Gently level the top to leave it even.

, Spray mist the soil for the first few days. The initial soil watering should be sufficient for the seeds to start germinating. Once the seedlings appear, water regularly but not too much––aim to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.

, Too many seedlings can make it too crowded for good results.

, Use a vegetable-suitable light liquid feed.

, When the lettuces have all grown together to form a tight-knit and abundant array of leaves, harvest as needed. Follow the directions specified for the variety of lettuce you have chosen, to ensure that the lettuce will regrow several times.

Transplant into the garden.,
Fertilize the lettuce three weeks after transplanting.,
Cut mature leaves.,
Store harvested lettuce in the refrigerator.",How to Plant Lettuce1," Head lettuces take longer to mature. If you start the seeds inside, the plants can benefit from an earlier planting date, and therefore a longer growing season. Iceberg and romaine are two common types of head lettuce.


If you're planting loose leaf lettuces, skip down to these instructions.
If you are planting in late spring or summer, you may need a heat-resistant variety such as Jericho. This is especially important if you live in a hot climate.;
, You can start your lettuce seeds in store-bought seed trays or make your own out of an old egg carton, box or newspaper. Fill the seed trays to within 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of the top with a soilless growing medium. Moisten the medium in preparation for sowing the seeds.


Seeds already contain the nutrients they need to germinate, so you can plant them in a soilless growing medium. You can buy a growing medium or make on from an equal mix of vermiculite, perlite, and milled sphagnum moss.
Since the seeds will be moved to the ground once they sprout, the aesthetics of your seed trays aren't as important as their functionality.

, This will give them time to germinate and sprout before the ground gets soft enough to plant them outside. Scatter seeds evenly into the compartments in the seed tray. Use your fingers to gently press them into the growing medium.

, Place the tray in a sunny window and keep the growing medium moist at all times. If you let it dry out, the seeds may not be able to grow.


You can cover the seed trays with a few layers of newspaper for the first week or so, until the seeds sprout. Keep the newspaper moist with water at all times, and remove the newspaper when you see green shoots coming up.
Don't overwater the seeds. If they get waterlogged they may not be able to grow.

, The earliest you can transplant your seedlings is two weeks before the last spring frost date. Dig holes in rows 16 inches (40.6 cm) apart, just deep enough to plant the root balls underground. Lift the lettuce seedlings from the seed tray and place them into the holes. Gently pat soil around the roots so that the seedlings stay upright, planted to the same depth they were in the trays. Water the seedlings thoroughly.For best results, ""harden off"" the seedlings first by placing the tray in a sheltered outdoor area part of the time. Do this for two or three days, increasing the amount of outdoor time each day.You can continue to grow indoor seedlings and transplant them outside throughout the growing season. Select heat-resistant varieties for summer transplanting.
Use a watering can or a hose with a diffuser spray nozzle to water the lettuce garden. Don't completely drown the seedlings in water; just make sure the soil is damp.

, Use alfalfa meal or slow release fertilizer that is rich in nitrogen. This will keep the lettuce growing fast and strong., When the leaves look mature enough to eat, resembling lettuce leaves you'd buy in the grocery store, cut them with a harvest knife or scissors. After a few weeks, when the plant is mature, you'll want to cut the whole plant from the ground. If you leave it in, the lettuce will eventually go bad.


Harvest leaves in the morning. They acquire a crispness overnight, and they'll retain it if you harvest early.
Lettuce starts to ""bolt"" in hot conditions toward the end of the growing season. It begins producing seeds and acquires a bitter taste. You can keep this from happening by pinching off the center of the plant. If a lettuce plant does end up bolting, go ahead and pull it up.

, If you don't eat your lettuce right away, you can store it. If you put it in a plastic bag with some paper towels, it should keep for up to ten days.

Varieties that are heat-tolerant and fast growing are particularly good for areas that where the temperature rises quickly.;
, Fill seed-starting trays with pre-moistened, sterile seed starting mix, allowing approximately one inch (2.54 cm) of space from the top rim. Gently tamp down the soil so that it is firm in the container, but not hard packed., Place one or two seeds in the center of each section of the seed tray, and gently cover them with a thin layer of the seed starting mix.


Iceberg lettuce seeds should be sown approximately four to six weeks before the last day of frost in your area.
You can stagger the growth of your lettuce by planting trays one to two weeks apart.

, Place the seed trays in a location where they will receive at least six hours of sunlight daily and maintain room temperature. Water the trays with a spray bottle periodically to keep the soil mix moist without flooding it.Until the seeds begin to sprout, you can cover the seed starting trays with a layer of plastic film with small holes punched throughout to help trap moisture and keep the soil warm.
The seeds should start to sprout within a week or two.
If more than one seed sprouts in each section, thin out the weaker looking plants by carefully pinching them at their base.

, Once your iceberg seedlings have grown to a sturdy four to five inches (10.16 to 12.7 cm) in height, harden off the plants by placing them outdoors to a wind-protected, shady area for a few hours each day, gradually lengthening the time each day.Hardening off helps prepare the seedlings for outdoor conditions, but be sure to bring them in if temperatures are still dropping below 32˚F (0˚C).

, Once soil temperatures are above 60˚F (15.6˚C) select an area of your garden that drains well and receives about six hours of sunlight a day.


Raised garden beds help keep soil temperatures warmer and improve the growing conditions for iceberg lettuce.

, Water the garden bed well enough to moisten the top six inches (15.24 cm) of soil. Dig planting holes equal to the depth of the seedling tray that are 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart in 20 inch (50.8 cm) wide rows.Add a small spoonful of organic fertilizer or compost to the bottom of each hole and cover it with a small amount of soil to avoid burning the seedlings.

, Water the seedlings well and then carefully remove them from their trays and place in each hole. Gather the soil around the seedlings and gently tamp down the soil so that they are secure and even with the soil surface. Water the plants thoroughly without drowning them.


You can use seedlings that you have grown from seed or purchase seedlings from a nursery or garden supply store.
Add a thin layer of organic mulch around the seedlings without letting the mulch touch the seedlings. The mulch will keep the soil moist and cool, and discourage weeds and pests from damaging your seedlings.
You may want to trim the outer leaves of the seedlings to help the root system handle the transplanting and growth.

, When the top inch (2.54 cm) of soil around the Iceberg seedlings is dry water the plants deeply, usually every five to ten days.


Avoid flooding the plants and keep soil from splashing against the leaves during waterings.

, After a few weeks of growing, add a side dressing of organic fertilizer around the base of the plants. Continue to keep the soil moist and ensure that your plants are shaded from the hot, late-afternoon sun as the season goes on.


Remove pests such as slugs and snails by hand or use an organic deterrent.

, When the heads are fully formed and firm, and before temperatures rise above 75˚F (23.88˚C), carefully cut the plant at the base with a sharp knife and remove the entire head.Harvest the lettuce heads in the early morning when they are firmest.
Begin harvesting when lettuce heads are just larger than a softball, usually about two to three months from planting, and stagger your harvest so that you are only harvesting one or two every week or so.
The inner leaves may feel slightly loose and appear light green, but the inner leaves should be tight and firm.

Prepare the planting bed.,
Fertilize the bed.,
Broadcast the seeds.,
Keep the lettuce watered.,
Cut away mature leaves.",How to Plant Lettuce2," Loose leaf cultivars are the brightly colored, nutritious lettuces often sold in a ""spring mix."" These lettuces tolerate warmer temperatures and a shorter growing season than other varieties, so they are usually scattered directly in the garden.Head lettuce should generally be planted indoors instead.
Hot weather triggers ""bolting"" in lettuce, halting leaf growth and introducing a bitter flavor. In hot climates, such as the southern U.S., you'll need to plant the lettuce as soon as possible, or look for a heat-resistant variety.

, You should plan to plant the lettuce as soon as the ground is workable. Choose an area with soil that drains well and gets plenty of sun. Use a soil tiller or a spade to break up the soil and remove rocks, sticks and roots from the area.


Lettuce is hardy, but there are certain conditions that won't allow it to grow properly. Make sure the soil isn't too soggy, and that it has plenty of nitrogen.
Make sure the soil is humus rich as well. Talk to someone at your local nursery to discuss ways to enrich the soil in your particular region to make it excellent for growing lettuce.

, Mix in compost or a balanced fertilizer into the bed at least one week before planting. Optionally, you can apply a nitrogen-heavy fertilizer alongside the plants after about three weeks, when leaves are four inches (10 cm) wide., Lettuce is cold-hardy, so you can usually plant them directly in soil about two weeks before the last expected spring frost, or up to six weeks in advance if protected by cold frames or tunnels.Broadcast the seeds over tilled soil, then scatter about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of soil on top of them. One seed packet will cover about 100 feet (30.5 m). Water the seed bed thoroughly after planting.


Stagger the planting at one or two week intervals to get harvests throughout the season. Keep in mind that most lettuces do not grow well in hot temperature, so the last planting date depends on your local climate and the needs of your lettuce cultivar. For best results, use heat-resistant varieties or plant in shade for the final sowings., If the leaves look wilted, they need to be watered. Give the lettuce a light sprinkling every day, and any time the leaves look a little limp.

, When harvesting looseleaf lettuces, use scissors or a knife to remove the mature leaves without harming the rest of the plant. You can start doing this as soon as the leaves reach the size you'd see in a grocery store. Remove the whole plant after a few weeks, or the plant will turn bitter and start to seed.


Harvest in the early morning for the crispest leaves.
Pinching off the center of the plant will extend the harvest period.
Store lettuce leaves in the fridge for up to ten days, keeping them in a plastic bag with a couple paper towels.

Move the rooted crop to a cold, humid environment to keep it fresh.",How to Grow Hydroponic Lettuce," You can grow most varieties of lettuce hydroponically. Tom Thumb is a good option if you’re trying to take up a little less room, Bibb lettuce is a little bit of an easier variety to grow, and Romaine works well but takes a bit more time.Pick whichever variety you prefer, and consider the slightly different requirements and tendencies that your particular type has.
, There are many different kinds of hydroponic systems that you can grow plants in, including drip systems, NFT systems, ebb-flow systems, aeroponic systems, and many more.Water culture systems, in which plants float directly on top of water while their roots grow down and absorb nutrients, are the most effective and simplistic., You have a lot of different media options to choose from, including: rockwool, coco fiber, vermiculite, pine shavings, river rock, sand, and many more. All of these options have positive and negative aspects, but picking any one of them will allow you to grow lettuce without a problem.


Rockwool is the most popular medium choice and is both sterile and porous. If you go with rockwool, be careful to keep it from becoming too saturated. This can lead to root suffocation, stem rot, and root rot.
Grow rock is another popular option that has a neutral pH and holds moisture well. This medium is reusable if cleaned thoroughly, which can be beneficial for growing hydroponically in your home, but might be tedious on a larger scale., Purchase a large storage container or fish tank to use as a nutrient reservoir for your lettuce. Choose a container with a large surface area, but also make sure it’s at least several inches deep so that the plant roots can grow downward without trouble., There are several different materials, such as styrofoam or the container lid, that you can use to set up a stable way for your plants to sit above the water with their roots submerged.Drill holes into polystyrene planks that are about twelve inches apart. Drill as many holes and get as many net pots as will accommodate each seedling that you have., You’ll need to have a system in place that creates air bubbles or recirculates the water in your reservoir so that the plant roots don’t suffocate. Keeping an aquarium pump in your reservoir will prevent this issue., You can buy nutrient combinations at gardening stores that are specifically for growing hydroponic plants. Lettuce typically requires high levels of potassium, calcium, and magnesium.Follow the nutrient kit directions for mixing the nutrients with water and put the mixture in your container.


Some lettuce types are more sensitive to nitrogen that others, so make sure that the nutrients that you purchase are for the right kind of lettuce.

, Before putting your hydroponic system to use, you’ll need to use an egg carton or plugs, which are small cells, to create a stable initial environment for your plants. Fill your plugs with your medium of choice and with your hydroponic seeds., In order to get your lettuce started, water your nursery every other day and keep it in a well-lit or naturally sunny area where it is between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3-26.6 degrees Celsius). Grow these until the seedlings are a couple inches tall and have about four leaves., Carefully, without tugging, take your individual seedlings from their cells to the net pots. Align each net pot with the holes you drilled into the floating platform or lid of the container, and then place them in your reservoir., Unlike other plants, lettuce neither requires a long duration nor intense amount of exposure to light in order to grow. You have other options, but fluorescent lighting is the best because it requires a low initial investment, consumes a small amount of power, and produces a low amount of heat., Lettuce is a crop that grows better in a cooler environment. For the best results, keep the temperature around 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.7 degrees Celsius) at night and around 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23.8 degrees Celsius) during the day. If the lettuce gets too hot it will bolt, or flower, which isn’t good because this will create a bitter taste in the lettuce leaves., A plant’s pH level refers to how acidic or basic it is, and determines whether or not it can properly absorb the nutrients available to it. Frequently test the pH with an inexpensive paper strip test and make sure it’s slightly acidic and almost neutral for the best possible production.

Purchase both up and down pH adjusters that when added to your reservoir will be able to bring the pH back to the correct level., After 5-6 weeks, your lettuce should be fully grown and ready to pick and eat! To make sure that your lettuce plants continue to produce large amounts of healthy lettuce, pick the outer leaves and leave some of the inner ones attached to the plant. It won’t take much time for those inner leaves to replace the ones you picked., Avoid picking all of the leaves from each plant at once. Pick leaves from one plant one day and another plant a few days later. This will allow you to enjoy the right amount of lettuce at a time, instead of going through periods of not enough production or too much production., If the lettuce is fully grown and you don’t want to eat it right away, keep the plants rooted and store them in a humid, nearly freezing environment to ensure freshness for up to a month."

Your best bet is to pick out a fresh packet of seeds to start your pumpkin patch.



Pie pumpkins are used for making pies or roasting. Good varieties to start with include Baby Pam, Winter Luxury or New England Pie.

Jack-O'Lantern pumpkins are larger and less flavorful than pies. If you want to grow pumpkins large enough to carve, try Howden, Rock Star or Connecticut Field.Miniature pumpkins are grown for decorative purposes. Jack-Be-Littles are a good choice if you want some tiny orange pumpkins in time for fall holidays.;
, Pumpkins take 75-100 days to grow from a seed before you can harvest them. Count backwards from the date you'd like to harvest, and plant at that time. Most pumpkin gardeners aim to have their pumpkins ready for harvest in time for fall. In order to do this, you'll need to figure out the right time to plant your seeds according to what climate you live in. Pumpkins grow more quickly in hotter weather, so if you plant them too early in the year, they'll be here and gone long before Halloween.


If you live in a place with cold winters and mild summers, planting in late May after the last chance for frost has passed is your best bet. This way your pumpkins will be ready in time for fall.
If you live in a place with long, hot summers, you can put your pumpkins in the ground in July and have them ready for Halloween.
If your primary reason for growing pumpkins is to have them as a food crop, and you don't mind having them ready to eat before the fall, you can start the seeds indoors 3 weeks before the last frost date in your area, so they'll be ready to put in the ground as soon as it warms up. To start seeds indoors, simply sow single seeds in four-inch peat seed pots filled with seed starting mixture (not soil). Keep the pots well watered and place them in a sunny window. The seedlings will be ready to plant outside in a few weeks.

, Choose a place that gets full soon, since pumpkins won't thrive unless they get plenty of it. Pumpkins grow on wide-reaching vines that need 20 or 30 feet (6.1 or 9.1 m) of open space to stretch out. Choose a place that has good drainage, so that the pumpkins' roots aren't sitting in water all day long.The ideal soil pH for pumpkins is 6.0 to 6.8. If your soil hasn't been tested in awhile, get a soil testing kit and determine whether your soil falls into this range or is a little high or low. You can amend it by mixing in lime, bone meal or compost as needed.
To test whether the soil has good drainage, dig a hole and fill it with water. Allow it to drain overnight, and then re-fill the hole to conduct the test. Measure the water level with a yardstick or measuring tape each hour to see how much it has gone down.Draining 1-3 inches per hour is ideal. If your soil drains too quickly or too slowly, try adding compost to improve the drainage.
To give pumpkins a boost, amend the soil by tilling it to a depth of 4 inches (10.2 cm) and mixing in organic compost.

, Choose a spot toward the center of where you want the vines to grow. Build a small mound to help warm up the soil, improve drainage, and reduce pests. Plant 2 or 3 seeds in the center of the mound about 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep. Pat soil over the seeds and water them well after planting. If you aim to grow more than one pumpkin plant, space them at least 4–8 feet (1.2–2.4 m) apart.Mini varieties can be spaced 3 feet (0.9 m) apart.


If you live in a place with strong winds, you can plant the seeds in a trench about 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep. This will protect the seed from wind as it gets established.
If you're transplanting seedlings, space the holes 5 feet (1.5 m) apart.

, Don't ever let the soil completely dry out. Pumpkin plants need a lot of water. When the soil seems dry and dusty, water the pumpkin bed thoroughly using the spray attachment on your garden hose. Give the area a good soaking, since pumpkin roots run deep into the soil and the water needs to be able to reach them.


Don't soak the soil if it's already wet, since this can lead to rot.
Water in the morning, so the water that gets on the pumpkin leaves has time to dry. If you water in the evening, powdery mildew can form on the wet plants.
When the pumpkins begin to grow and turn orange, you can stop watering as frequently. Stop watering altogether about a week before they're ready to harvest.

, Spread compost around the base of the plants or treat the planting bed with a suitable organic fertilizer. Do this just after the seedlings sprout, to encourage healthy growth and prevent weeds from taking over.


If you notice your flowers dropping off and no pumpkins growing, you may need to hand fertilize. Use a small paintbrush or Q-tip to transfer pollen from a male flower to female flowers.

, If you planted more than two seeds in one mound, choose the two strongest plants and leave them to grow. Remove all of the weaker plants. This will provide more nutrients for the stronger plants to grow.

When the vines reach about 5 feet (1.5 m), clip off the tips of the vines. This will encourage more side shoots to grow, and it will improve pumpkin production.

, Pumpkin plants are susceptible to a number of pests that eat the leaves and vines. Spotted and striped cucumber beetles, four line beetles, aphids, and squash bugs are all common pests you might find crawling over your plants. Luckily, most pest populations can be controlled by either picking them off the plants by hand or spraying them off with a stream of water.


If plain water doesn't seem to be working, try wiping down the leaves with soapy water, or a solution of water and ammonia.
If necessary, you can treat the plants with pesticides. However, these will harm beneficial bees, which pollinate the pumpkin flowers and help the plant stay healthy. To minimize the damage to bees, treat the pumpkin plants at night, when the bees are away in their hive.

, The pumpkins should be uniformly bright orange in color (unless you're growing a white or mottled variety). The vines will begin to shrivel and dry out. Most importantly, the pumpkins' skin will be tough. If you can indent it easily with a fingernail, the pumpkins need more time on the vine.

, Leave several inches of stem at the top of each pumpkin, since this keeps them from rotting too quickly. Don't pick up the pumpkins by their stems, since if the stems break their bases will rot.

, As soon as you cut them, they're ready to be removed from the pumpkin patch and used in whatever way you like. Rinse them off (you might need to scrub the dirt off the bottom) and either cut them to make pie or carve them into jack-o'-lanterns. If you store pumpkins in a cool, dry place they'll keep throughout the winter months.
