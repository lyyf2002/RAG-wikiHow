Plant once the soil has warmed.,
Choose a warm, sunny spot to plant the squash.,
Enrich the soil if necessary.,
Plant the seeds in small hills.,
Lightly mulch the squash beds.",How to Grow Butternut Squash1," Butternut squash seeds won't germinate in cold soil, so it's necessary to plant them once you're certain the last frost has passed. In warmer climates this could be in mid-spring, and in cooler climates you might have to wait until late spring. If you plant your squash too early, it won't survive.


If you want to get a head start, you can start the seeds indoors up to 3 weeks before the last frost. Plant the seeds 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep in seed starter mix in small pots. Keep them moist and warm until the last frost has passed, after which you can transplant them to the garden.;
, Butternut squash needs full sun and warm conditions to thrive. It will do well in the sunniest spot in your garden. Avoid planting it in the shade, since the squash won't fully ripen without full sunlight.

, Butternut squash needs rich, well-draining soil. If your soil is poor, till it to a depth of several inches and mix in plenty of compost. Depending on how many squash plants you're putting in, you may need to prepare a large area to serve as your planting bed. Plan to allot 3 square feet of space per squash plant.

, Squash grow best when they are planted in soil that has been hilled. Create hills about 3 inches (7.6 cm) high for each squash plant, leaving at least 3 feet (0.9 m) of space between hills in the same row, and 6 feet (1.8 m) between rows. Dig a hole 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep in the top of each hill and drop in 4-5 squash seeds. Cover the seeds with soil and pat the area lightly.

After the seeds sprout, thin them out to leave 2 - 3 sprouts per hill.
If you're transplanting squash plants that you started indoors, plant each one on its own hill.
Squash vines can either grow along the ground or on a trellis. If you wish to train your squash plants to grow vertically, place a trellis or stake near each hill. When the vines sprout, wrap them gently around the base of the trellis or stake, and they'll begin growing upward.

, Spread some pine straw or another light mulch over the squash beds to protect the growing plants.

Water the squash plants regularly.,
Eat the early squash blossoms.,
Keep pests away.",How to Grow Butternut Squash2," Keep the soil moist throughout the summer by watering the squash every few days. When the soil looks like it's getting a little dry, give the squash beds a thorough soaking. Water at the base of the plants, rather than getting the leaves wet, to prevent powdery mildew and sunburn.

, The first blossoms the squash plants produce are male, and eating them won't affect the health of the plants. If you'd like, pinch off the yellow blossoms and add them to salads or stir-fries. Otherwise, they'll naturally fall off about a week after they bloom.


The second set of flowers produced by the plants are female, and they grow just above the tiny squash fruits. Leave the female flowers on the vines., Squash plants don't usually become attractive to pests until the end of the growing season, when the plants have almost reached the end of their life cycle anyway. If you know pests are a problem in your area, take measures to prevent an infestation:


Protect young squash plants by covering them with floating row cover. Remove the cover once they begin to flower to allow pollination.
Planting a row of nasturtium flowers alongside your squash can help deter insect pests.
If you see squash bugs or cucumber beetles on the leaves of the squash plants, pick them off by hand.
Squash vine borers attack the plants inside the stalks. Unfortunately, once they attack, there's not much you can do to save the plants."

Wait until the squash are fully ripe.,
Harvest before the first frost of the season.,
Cut the squash from the vines.,
Store the squash.",How to Grow Butternut Squash3," When you can press your fingernail into a squash without denting its surface, that means the squash are ripe. It's important to wait until the surface is tough - otherwise, the squash will go bad quickly.

, If you wait too long to harvest the squash, and they get exposed to a frost, they will rot more quickly than they would have if you harvested them before the temperature dropped. Plan to harvest them before the weather turns.

, Use a sharp knife to cut them from the vines, leaving a few inches of stem intact. Take them inside right away and rinse the dirt from their surfaces. There's no need to leave them outside to cure.

, Fully mature butternut squash will keep for months in storage. Store your squash in a cool, dry place and enjoy it all winter long. When you're ready to enjoy your squash, read the following articles to find out more:

Purchase pumpkin seeds.,
Find a plastic, disposable cup.,
Place three seeds about half an inch down.,
Water the pumpkin seeds every other day.,
Wait a few weeks until all the pumpkin seeds have sprouted.,
Next to the pumpkins in the clay plots, put in six foot dowel rods.,
Pollinate the blossoms.,
When fruit develops from the blossoms, make sure your plant gets enough light and water.

,
Once the pumpkins have turned the mature color, they are ready to harvest.",How to Grow Pumpkins Indoors," Places you can buy them are eBay or Home Depot. You could also simply pick the seeds out of a pumpkin.;
, Fill it with compost or natural fertilizer. Using your fingers, dig a small hole into the compost/natural fertilizer.

, Make sure they're not in too deep before covering the hole with the fertilizer once more.

, However, make sure the soil doesn't get too wet. Otherwise, the seeds will die.

, Then, transplant them into clay pots. However, be careful not to disturb the pumpkin roots - they might go into shock and die.

, The tendrils of the pumpkin plants will then coil around the dowel rods. After a while, the pumpkins will produce blossoms, which is a sign that they will be ready soon.

, Since your pumpkin plants are indoors and have no access to pollination by bees or other insects, you are in charge of pollinating blossoms so that your plants can produce pumpkins.


Learn how to identify female and male blossoms. Pumpkins produce both male and female blossoms on the same vine. Male blossoms are longer, thinner, and look like trumpets. They have a stamen (little stem with pollen on it) on the inside. Female blossoms are wider, shorter, and more open, like little bowls. They do not have stamens in them.
Watch (and possibly collect) your male blossoms carefully. It is possible for the vine to produce male blossoms first. They might wilt before a female blossom develops. If they wilt, don't throw them away, but save them until a female blossom is open.
Pollinate the female blossoms. This can be done in two different ways: if your male blossoms are still on the vine and alive, use a clean paintbrush (or baking brush/basting brush) to carefully pick up some pollen (yellow powder) off of the stamen (little stem in the inside middle of the blossom) of the male blossoms. Use your brush to gently touch the pollen to the base (inside) of the female blossom(s). If your male blossoms are wilted, open them up carefully and pull out the stamen (stem in the middle of the blossoms with the pollen on the end). Take the stamen and gently push it with the pollen end into the female blossom until it touches the bottom and some pollen comes off. You can just leave the stamen in there, if you want, or remove it afterward.

,, Cut off the pumpkin about two inches above the pumpkin's top.

Ensure you have at least a three and a half month growing season in full sun.,
Purchase a packet of acorn squash seeds at your local gardening supply store.,
Start seeds inside three to four weeks before you expect the last frost of the season.Check your state’s almanac to see when that will be.,
Cover the seeds in a warm damp paper towel for a few hours, while you prepare your soil.

,
Plant six seeds in three-inch (7.6 cm) pots.,
Place the seeds in a sunny window that you can supplement with fluorescent light.,
Thin the seeds to three per pot when they start to crowd.,
Prepare your beds.,
Amend your soil with compost in the winter, if possible.,
Aim to plant your seedlings when the soil has warmed to approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius).

,
Loosen the soil to a depth of at least 12 inches (30.5 cm).,
Place mulch around your squash for the first few weeks if you have a weed problem.,
Water your squash mounds when the soil begins to dry out.,
Look out for squash vine borers that leave “sawdust.” You can remove them by hand.,
Test the acorn squash individually after two to three months.,
Cut the squash from the stem, leaving approximately one inch (2.5 cm) of stem on the squash.,
Rinse and dry the surface.,
Place them side by side rather than stacking them.",How to Grow Acorn Squash," Acorn squash takes two and a half to three and a half months to mature, and, like most types of winter squash, can’t be picked before they are ripe.


Extra acorn squash seeds can be saved for six years.;
, If you’d rather not plant your own seeds, you can wait until spring to find seedlings and starts at your farmer’s market or garden center.

, If you have a longer growing season, start your seeds outdoors about two weeks after the first frost.

,, Seedling trays are not generally big enough for squash seedlings. Fill the pots with seed mix and sprinkle with warm water before planting each seed one inch (2.5 cm) deep.

, Cover the pot with plastic wrap for the first few days to improve germination. Generally, the seeds sprout within 5 to 12 days.

, They should be ready to transplant into your garden soon.

, You need at least a three-foot (0.9 m) plot in all direction to grow winter squash without overshadowing other vegetables. Your bed should be in full sunlight.


If you don’t have three feet (0.9 m) to spare, build a trellis or use a fence to grow the squash vertically. They can be separated two feet (0.6 m) apart and trained to grow up the support system.

, Aim for a pH content between 5.8 and 6.8 for best results.,, Then, plant in three-foot (0.9 m) mounds with approximately three seedlings per mound. Planting atop a mound ensures that the roots will not rot, since squash require a lot of watering.


If you are planting seeds directly into the garden, plant them in a mound with six seeds per mound. Thin to three plants after germination.Acorn squash that are planted near a fence or trellis will not need to be mounded.







, After the broad leaves start to form, you should weed by hand regularly. The large leaves will shade out some weeds.

, Let it soak for a few minutes to reach the whole root system. Water below the leaves to avoid powdery mildew and scab.

, Cover your plants with netting cheesecloth while they are young, if you have a problem with cucumber beetles., They will have a dark green shell when they are nearing maturity. When the skin is strong enough to resist being pierced by your fingernail, they are ready to pick.

, Use a sharp pair of kitchen or garden shears.

, Find a cool, dry and dark place to store your squash.

, If stored in a less than optimal area, they can last for two to three weeks. If stored in a cellar, they can last several months.

Choose or prepare the soil for growing giant pumpkins.,
Choose a fertilizer to enhance your soil.,
You plot should be located in the sun.,
Add organic matter to your soil.",How to Grow Giant Pumpkins1," Collect some of the soil where you intend to plant your pumpkins.Take the soil to your local agricultural or conservation agency for testing. The test will let you know exactly what nutrients are in the soil. You can then determine what needs to be added. Having the right kind of soil will create vigorous, healthy vines. You can prepare the soil in early spring when the ground begins to warm, but it is best to start preparations in fall. This will allow any amendments you add to break down and work their way into the soil.


You will need to prepare a 25 x 25 x 25 triangular area for each giant pumpkin vine to grow.
Giant pumpkins generally need 2 pounds nitrogen (N), 3 pounds phosphorous (P2O2) and 6 pounds potash (K2O) per 1,000 square feet of growing space. Your soil should fall between 6.5 and 6.8 on the pH scale.






Pumpkins need good, well-drained soil, not wet, dense soil.





;
, If your soil doesn’t have the proper amount of nutrients, fertilizers can help to create the perfect environment in which to grow your pumpkins.


Even if your soil is nutrient rich, adding a granular fertilizer, composted manure, or mature garden compost will fertilize the soil while improving the structure of the soil. Incorporate this fertilizer into the soil several days before you intend to transplant your pumpkins.







, Pumpkins need a fair amount of sunshine to grow up healthy and large. Keep in mind that pumpkins are sensitive and will need shelter from any intense wind.

, Organic matters like manure will help your pumpkins grow up strong, healthy (and large!) You should use four inches of manure. Work the manure into the top few inches of soil.

"

Select proper seeds for planting.,
Plant your seeds.,
Transplant your sprouts.,
Cut off weak vines.",How to Grow Giant Pumpkins2," The genetics of the seeds you choose is important. They should come from a background of large-to-giant-size pumpkins. You can either:


Contact a pumpkin growing association for seeds. Pumpkin associations can be found on the internet.






Purchase seeds from a farmer that raises giant competition pumpkins. Top quality pumpkin seeds with good genetics can actually cost up to $50 each.

, If you live in a place that could potentially get frost in late April or May, you should start by planting your seeds in pots and keeping them indoors. If you think your pumpkins will be safe from frost, plant your seeds outside. Keep in mind that the seeds that sprout the fastest will generally grow the strongest pumpkins.Germinating your seeds inside: Plant your seeds in peat pots that have four to six inches of soil in each pot. Plant the seeds one inch deep in the soil that is moist and keep the pots at around 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius). Some people use a greenhouse effect while others find setting them on top of the refrigerator works well. You should begin to see sprouts within three to five days.






Germinating seeds outdoors: Before planting the seeds, soak them in warm water for four hours. Create a two-foot circle in the soil and remove the top inch of soil. Plant five seeds in the circle and cover them back up with the one inch of dirt. If possible, you can create a greenhouse over where you intend to plants the seeds and begin warming the soil several weeks in advance and several weeks after the sprouts have come up.







, Only do this if you have chosen to germinate your seeds inside. Transplant your sprouts when you see the first true leaves appear (they will be green and full looking.)Build up mounds of soil that are roughly two-foot circles (they should be about the size of a pitcher’s mound.) Plant one sprout in each mound. Keep each mound approximately 20 feet (6.1 m) apart. If possible, place a small greenhouse on top of each mound. Doing this will keep your sprouts warm and healthy.






Remove the tent or mini greenhouse on hot days so that the plants do not overheat.







, After a few weeks of growth, examine the pumpkin plant. Select the strongest looking vine in the group. Remove all others by clipping off the vines."
"
Pick your vine.,
Pollinate the pumpkin blossoms by hand.,
Identify the male and female plants to pollinate by hand.,
Pull the petal from the male blossom.",How to Grow Giant Pumpkins3," The strongest and thickest vines often produce the largest pumpkins. Monitor your vines and see which one seems to be growing the fastest and thickest.

, Pollinating by hand is the preferred method but if you don’t have the time or the energy, it is a pretty safe bet that the bees will do most of the pollination for you. The flowers generally show up in late July.

, As in every form of reproduction, there is a male and female pumpkin counterpart. Do not begin pollinating until you the plant has roughly 200 leaves.The female has a small pumpkin at the base and no pollen inside the flower. To achieve the strongest female plant, you can break off the first female flower and wait for the second or third to grow (the strongest females grow when the vines are roughly 10 feet long, or longer.)






The male will have a stamen inside the flower. The stamen will be covered in pollen. These male flowers generally show up before the female flowers do.







, Only do this when a female flower grows from the largest and healthiest vine. Pulling the petal will help to expose the pollen needed for pollination. Rub the pollen stamen on the blossom of the female flower. This step is most successful if completed before the middle of July. This will ensure that the pumpkin has ample time for growth.

Pick your prize pumpkin.,
Tear out the roots that are close to the pumpkin.,
Pinch off the ends and side shoots.,
Give the pumpkin shade.,
Give each plant 15 to 20 gallons (56.8 to 75.7 L) of water twice a week.,
Keep pests away.,
Harvest your pumpkins.",How to Grow Giant Pumpkins4," The largest pumpkins balloon out from the vine. Vines generally have two to three pumpkins. Once your pumpkins have reached the size of a softball, select the one on a vine that looks the most promising. You will have to cut out the others as they will steal nutrients from the prize pumpkin., Pumpkin vines grow roots at every leaf. Tearing out the roots nearest to the pumpkin will allow the pumpkin a bit of wiggle room. If the vine is held down by the roots near the pumpkin, the pumpkin might accidentally tear itself away from the vine as it grows massive. This would effectively end any more growth.


Train vines away from the pumpkin. While growing, the pumpkin could accidentally crush the vines near it.






Make sure to weed the area completely as your pumpkin vine grows. Once it reaches twenty feet and has covered the garden with leaves, you shouldn't have to weed anymore.

, Only do this when the primary vine has reached 20 feet (6.1 m) in length. Pinching off the ends and side shoots will guarantee that the vine’s nutrients will go to your pumpkin.


To increase the chance of a prize-winning pumpkin, shape the vine into a triangle. Treat the base of the vine as the bottom of the pyramid. You can cut the secondary side shoots shorter and shorter as they grow farther away from the base. For example, the shoots growing closest to the base might be twelve feet long; the next set of shoots might be ten feet long, then eight feet and so on., You can either drape a sheet over it or build a small structure to hold a tarp up over the pumpkin. That said, try not shade too many of the leaves. These need sunlight to grow the pumpkin., Only do this if it is a dry season. Pumpkins do most of their growing at night. Water in the early evening so that the leaves and soil are not wet overnight. Try to avoid getting water on the leaves because wet leaves are more susceptible to disease., If you notice insects or other pests in your garden, research what they are, and take appropriate measures to control them. Growing flowers and herbs near your pumpkin patch can attract predator insects that naturally keep pests down.

Common pumpkin pests include squash bugs, striped and spotted cucumber beetles, aphids, vine borers, wireworms, and six spotted leafhoppers., Your pumpkins will be ready to harvest when they are a solid, deep color (and they are gigantic!) The rind should be hard. The vines will usually be dying back at this time.

Keep your squash in a cool place.",How to Grow Winter Squash," If you have a long warm season you can grow almost anything; if it's shorter make sure to pick early-ripening types. Some squash grow on vines that can cover a lot of ground, so if you just have a 12 x 12 foot space, you're better off with a bush variety. Most details will be found on the packaging. Here are a few basics to consider:Butternut squash. This type of squash is bottle-shaped with a light brown rind. It is one of the most popular, common, and arguably most delicious. This type has a rich flavor and a smooth texture, in addition to a natural resistance to squash vine borers. They will store for six months or longer.

Buttercup squash. This type isn't too different from the butternut squash, but it does mature faster than butternut or hubbard. It is good for areas with a shorter, cooler growing season. Each plant will likely grow vigorously and produce heavy crops of squat, green fruits. This type stores for four to six months.

Hubbard squash and kabocha squash. These two types are often clumped together due to their similarities. They can be medium-sized or they can be absolutely huge. In general, they have drier flesh than most other winter squash. Their color varies by variety, and all varieties will store for four to six months.

Delicata squash and dumpling squash. Delicate squash are cylinder-shaped and dumpling squash are pumpkin-shaped. They both produce single-serving-size, ivory-colored fruits with green stripes that turn orange when stored. If you live in a cool climate, these are pretty easy to grow. They are fast to mature and will store for three to five months.

Acorn squash. This type is a ribbed, round fruit with a gold or green rinds. They also mature quickly and will store for at least three months. They are them popular in areas with short summers as there maturation process doesn't take much time.

Spaghetti squash. These are so named because they are full of stringy fibers that look like pasta. The oblong fruits have smooth rinds that vary from tan to orange, and they will store for three to six months.;
, You should plant your squash seeds at the beginning of spring when the soil has warmed to at least 60°F (15°C). Alternatively, you can plant them indoors under bright, fluorescent lights.


In zone 6 and warmer, you can even plant your seeds in early summer. You should stop planting about 14 weeks before the first expected ""frost.""If you have a short growing season, you can start growing them indoors and then transfer them to the outside when all threat of winter has passed.
If you are planting them inside, use biodegradable pots, such as peat pots, so that you can plant the entire pot when you transplant them outside. Removing squash from a plastic pot can disturb their roots and stunt their growth., Squash like warm conditions with soil that is fertile, well-drained, and has a pH of 6 to 6.5 To get good growth and production, you'll need to add lots of organic matter to your garden. Rotted manure and compost are the best for getting your plants the nutrients they need. Dig them in deeply so that the squash's roots will penetrate easily.


Squash are often planted in ""hills."" These help the squash grow by warming the soil more quickly and increasing drainage. Even in well-drained areas, hills can give your plants a boost by providing warm soil as they begin growing.
Hills don't always literally mean a raised area. If you have fast-draining soil and a drier climate, you might actually make depressions, with a wide ridge around them, to hold water. Add some extra compost/manure to the area under your hills, too.

, You want each hill to be part of a 3-ft wide row (they need their space). Leave about 5 to 6 feet (2 meters) between hills. Loosen the soil for up to a foot below the surface to ensure adequate drainage – you can mix in manure or compost at this step, too.


They should appear in about 10 days. If you have a short season, you can get a jump on your growing time by planting them indoors, but if you plant too early and the squash become rootbound in their pots, it will actually stunt their growth.
Upon planting, water them well. They need the initial burst of water to get going.

, In most climes, this is enough to keep your plants going strong. However, if you live in a particularly dry climate you can use flood-style irrigation every 2-3 weeks.Remove the weeds so they don't steal your water; a lack of water can stunt your plants, and weeds will use the nutrients you took all that trouble to dig into your soil.
A drip system is nice but if you don't want to do that, simple trenches between the hills will help you get the water where you want it once the vines start getting rampant.
Watering in the early morning allows the water to evaporate; this is good because water standing on leaves can create good conditions for disease.
On hot days, it is normal for leaves to wilt a little bit during the heat of the day, but they will often firm back up in the evening.That said, if leaves are wilted early in the day before it is too hot, your plants need more water.

, Once your plants have put on a few leaves (this is called ""germinating""), cull all but two or three at the very most per hill, leaving only the most vigorous plants. There simply isn't enough room for all of them to grow to adulthood.


At this stage, you may want to set up row covers to protect your little plants from insects and make sure they grow to full capacity.

, In the US, squash bugs and squash vine borers can do in a vine in no time. Dark gray squash bugs lurk under the leaves and suck the plant's juices. Borers are a caterpillar or a small moth that bores into the stems, killing the stem beyond the damage. Watch for their eggs under the leaves and along the ground. If you live in Europe you don't have those insects but other things can still damage your plants, so be vigilant!


Floating row covers can help with this problem, though you'll have to remove them when your female flowers show up so they can be pollinated. Aphids can be controlled with soap spray or water and as a last result, use neem.""Powdery mildew"" is another culprit, though non-bug, that you need to look out for. In the second half of their growing, spray the plants with a mixture of one part milk to six parts water every two weeks to fend off this disease, In about a month, you can add a side dressing of fertilizer to the vines – about 10 inches on either side. Don't dig too close or you'll damage the roots they send down at each leaf node.


They won't be fully ripe for about 80 to 110 days, depending on the variety you've planted.There's still plenty of time for them to absorb fertilizer.

, By this point, you should start seeing flowers. The first flowers are usually male and will make no fruit, but they do train the bees. The female flowers are fewer and recognizable by the swelling below the base of the flower. This swelling is your future squash.


If they don't form into squash, you may not have enough bees to pollinate them. You'll have to pollinate them yourself by going out early in the morning and taking the central pollen-covered organ in the male flower and brushing it all over the counterpart in the female flowers.

, You'll know if the pollination was a success if the flower wilts and that swelling grows visibly in the next couple of days. At this point, all you have to do is keep your vines watered and weeded, and watch out for bugs or disease.


You don't want wet soil all the time; during a warm summer without rain you'll probably water every few days or so. Watch for wilted leaves, that means they definitely need a drink.

, As your squash begin to grow, you can carefully put a bed of straw under them if you like, to keep them off the ground and free of blemishes and rot. However, rot shouldn't be a problem if you don't overwater or the squash isn't forming in a wet depression.

, Winter squash are generally ripe when you can no longer pierce the skin with your fingernail. The surest thing is to leave them on the vine until the vines start to die back, but you should definitely get them in before frost. That being said, immature fruits don't store well, so be sure to keep them growing for as long as possible. You'll likely get three to five squash per plant.Clip them off the vines with clippers and leave as much stem as you can, at least around an inch.
Don't lift them by the stem; if it comes off the squash will rot. Take care not to damage the skins as that would create an entry point for rot.

, This means leaving the better storing varieties in a warm place for 3-5 days so that the skins will harden up further, protecting them from fungus and bacteria. Butternut, Hubbard and related types (C. maxima and C. moschata) benefit from curing. Acorn and Delicata-type squash are not good storers, and trying to cure them can actually make them last less time, so you'll want to keep them cool from harvest, and use them within 2-3 months.


A ""warm"" place should be 70 to 80°F (21 to 26°C).Before this stage, you may wish to clean them off with a damp, clean cloth to get rid of any dirt that could fester on the plant. The curing process seals the skins and dries the stem, leaving them ready for use., It shouldn't be too dry or too wet. A cool room of a house, an unheated sun porch if it doesn't freeze, a cool cellar if it's not too damp or musty, are all possibilities – even under your bed could work.


Keep your eyes open for signs of rot, or you might find a fermenting puddle where your squash were. Checking every week or two should be sufficient.

Plan to plant pumpkins in late spring or early summer for a fall harvest. Pumpkins typically take 95 to 120 days to mature.









If you celebrate Halloween and would like to have pumpkins in time for the holiday, plant them in late July.;
, Pumpkins grow on vines and need a good amount of space to thrive. Choose a place in your yard with the following qualities:


20 or 30 feet (6.1 or 9.1 m) of open space. Your pumpkin patch doesn't have to take up your whole yard. You can plant it along the side of your house, or along the fence in your backyard.
Full sun. Don't choose a spot under a tree or in the shadow of a building. Make sure the pumpkins will get plenty of sun all day long.
Soil with good drainage. Clay-based soils don't absorb water quickly, and aren't as conducive to growing pumpkins. Choose a spot that doesn't have standing water after heavy rains.

To give the pumpkins an extra boost, prepare your soil beforehand by composting it. Dig large holes where you plan to plant the pumpkins and fill them with a compost mixture one week before planting.



, Go to your local nursery or order seeds from a catalog to use in your pumpkin patch. There are many different varieties of pumpkins, but for the home grower's purposes they fall into three main categories:









Pie pumpkins, which are meant to be eaten.
Large decorative pumpkins that can be carved into jack o'lanterns. The seeds in these pumpkins are edible, but the flesh is not flavorful.
Small decorative pumpkins, often called mini pumpkins.

, Build a small mound of dirt and plant the seed 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) deep. The hill helps improve soil drainage and allows the sun to heat the soil faster, speeding up germination.

Plant 2 or 3 seeds within a few inches of one another, in case one doesn't sprout for some reason.
It doesn't matter which end of the seeds points up. If the seeds are viable, they will grow either way.

, If your pumpkin variety grows along creeping vines, space the hills in the same row 12 ft (3.7 m) apart, and space the rows 6 to 10 ft (1.8 to 3 m) apart, depending on variety size. ""Bush-type"" varieties that grow on shorter vines need 8 ft (2.4 m) of space in all directions.







, If you composted the soil before planting, you can skip this step. If not, add a thin layer of compost or mulch in the areas where you planted seeds. The compost will help keep weeds out and nourish the seeds.









With proper care, the pumpkin plants should sprout within about a week.

, Pumpkin plants need a lot of water, but they shouldn't get too much. Make a habit of watering them when the soil seems a little dry, rather than adding more water to wet soil. Deep, infrequent waterings are ideal.









When you do water the plant, use a lot of water and let it soak deep into the soil. Pumpkin plants' roots run several inches or feet down, depending on the stage of growth, and it's important that the water reaches them.
Try not to get water on the pumpkin leaves. This encourages the growth of a fungus called powdery mildew, which can cause the leaves to wither and the plant to die. Water in the morning, rather than at night, so any water that gets on the leaves has time to dry in the sun.
When the pumpkins themselves begin to grow and turn orange, decrease the amount of water you use. Stop watering entirely about a week before you plan to harvest the pumpkins.

, When the plants first sprout (in about a week or two), adding fertilizer encourages health pumpkin plant growth. Go to your local nursery and ask for a fertilizer you can add to your pumpkin bed.








, In order to make sure your plants produce healthy pumpkins, you'll have to monitor them throughout the growing process.









Weed the patch often. Don't let the growth of weeds crowd out the pumpkin plants or absorb the nutrients they need to thrive. Plan to weed a few times a week.
Check the pumpkin leaves and blossoms for beetles, which eat plant tissue and ultimately kill the pumpkin plant. Scrape them off the plant a few times a week.
Mulch around your pumpkins to keep weed pressure down and conserve soil moisture.
Aphids are pests that threaten a lot of garden plants. They can be found on the undersides of the leaves, and if you don't take care of them, they'll kill the plants quickly. Spray them off with water in the morning so the leaves have time to dry.
If necessary, use an organic pesticide to rid your plants of pests. Ask about products at your local nursery.

, The pumpkins should be bright orange in colour (depending on the species) with a hard shell. Their stems and often the vine itself should be starting to dry out and wither.








, They won't keep for more than a few days before spoiling.








, Use a pair of shears to cut the stem, leaving it a few inches long. Don't break off the stems, since this will cause the pumpkins to rot.








, Keep them away from humidity, damp, and direct sunlight. They do not need refrigeration. Pumpkins keep for many months after they have been harvested.









A mild chlorine rinse before storage can discourage mold and fungi. Use a mix of 1 cup (240 mL) household chlorine bleach and 5 gallons (18.9 L) cold water."

Contact your local county extension agent or garden supply center to see what varieties of squash grow well in your local area.,Check when the last frost is scheduled to hit your zone.,
Decide whether you will purchase starts from a garden supplier, start seeds indoors or plant seeds directly into the ground.,
Plant your seeds into the garden when there is full sun for more than six hours per day and the soil is 60-70℉ (15-20℃).,
Choose a place that has plenty of sunlight.,
Plant your seeds or seedlings one-half inch (1-2cm) deep in hills.,
Place mulch around seedlings.,
Rig soaking hoses underneath your plants for best results.,
Hand pollinate if you don’t see fruit developing in 45 days.,
Pick summer squash when it is less than eight inches (20 cm) long.,
Use summer squash within a week or freeze it for storage over the winter.

",How to Grow Squash1," Consider starting with zucchini (green), patty pan (round) and crookneck (yellow) squash to get a variety of shapes and flavors.;
, If you have not checked what your hardiness zone is, go to http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ Since squash is native to North America, it can grow in sunny summer seasons in zones three through 10.


, The answer will depend upon the amount of space you have and the climate where you live.


Consider purchasing squash seedlings or starts from the Farmer’s Market or garden centers if you have never grown it before. Purchase more than you need, since some may be lost in the transplanting process. Buy them two weeks after the last frost.
Start seeds inside if you have a shorter growing season. Start the seeds in peat seed pots two to three weeks before the last frost. Use warm water when planting to keep the soil above 60 °F (16 °C).
Plant seeds directly into the garden soil if you have a long, hot growing season. Plant them two weeks after the last frost.

, Amend your soil with compost before you plant. Squash like a nutrient rich, well-drained soil.

, Plant summer squash away from short plants, since the leaves are likely to shade and kill them. If you don’t have a lot of garden space, consider building a trellis.

, Space them three feet (1m) apart and at the edges of your garden bed to avoid overcrowding.Consider planting them in large, deep pots if you are worried about other plants.


Plant six seeds or three seedlings in each hill. You will need two to three plants to grow per hill, in order to pollinate the flowers and yield fruit.
If you are planting starts or seedlings, be sure to keep the entire root ball intact.

, Mulch can be made with straw, leaves or other material. It helps to drain the soil and provide nutrients to the hungry plants.Apply organic fertilizer once per month to improve your harvest.

, Squash plants can develop powdery mildew if sprinkled from above. If you only have a hose, water underneath the leaves.

, You can use a paintbrush to gather pollen from the male flowers and brush it into the female flowers. Squash blossoms can be harvested for use in recipes; however, you should ensure that they are pollinating well and only pick the male blossoms.Female blossoms mature into the fruit.

, Pick round squash at a diameter of less than eight inches wide. Larger squash will lose its sweetness and tenderness.

Decide whether to purchase starts, grow from seed indoors or plant outside, just as you would summer squash plants.,
Wait two to four weeks after the last frost to plant winter squash.,
Plant seeds in hills six feet (2m) apart and rows eight feet (2.5 m) apart.,
Plant five or six seeds per hill or three seedlings.,
Water deeply once or twice a week.,
Set growing fruit on a wooden plank or rock to discourage pests from ruining the fruit.,
Let the winter squash ripen completely on the vine.,
Cut the ripe squash from the plant with sharp garden shears, leaving approximately two inches (5cm) of stem.",How to Grow Squash2," Start them indoors two weeks before the last frost date.

, They prefer soil at 70℉ (20℃) to germinate in the garden. They are often more likely to die of frost when young than summer squash.

, Winter squash vines need a larger area than do summer varieties.You can also plant them near a trellis or metal fence so that they will vine vertically.

, You will need to thin them to two to three plants per hill once they are growing strong.

, Watering less frequently than every day encourages deeper root systems which will more readily withstand the heat of the summer months. Squash plants, typically, need a minimum of 1"" (2.5cm) of rain or irrigation water each week. Soak underneath the plants to avoid powdery mildew.Fertilize them once per month.

,


Take care to clean all of the old plants from the garden area after the harvest. This reduces the places where the squash borers can overwinter.
Squash hanging on trellises are less likely to attract garden pests.

, It can take 75 to 120 days for them to completely mature. When ready for harvest, their hard skins should resist breaking if poked by a fingernail.

, Store in a cool, dry place. Some varieties need to be eaten within a week or two, while others can be stored individually for up to three months.

Select your carrot variety.,
Choose a deep enough container.,
Clean your container.,
Opt for a loose, well-draining potting media.",How to Grow Carrots in Pots1," Smaller varieties typically adapt to container growing better than standard-length varieties.


Look for ""round"" varieties that have a spherical shape. Options include Thumbelina, Parmex, and Parisienne.
Look for ""Nantes"" that have a tapered shape, but are shorter and wider than standard varieties. Options include Danvers Half Long, Chantenay Red Core, and Shin Kuroda.;
, Find one that is at least one foot (30.48 cm) deep or more. Carrots develop underground and the root system needs a lot of space to grow. The container should also have adequate drainage holes to prevent excess water from causing the carrots to rot.


The type of container does not matter much as long as it has enough depth. You can go with clay, plastic, or stone, and you can opt for a circular pot or a large rectangular planter.

, If you have a previously used container, wash it out with warm water and soap before planting your carrots. Bacteria and microscopic insect eggs often hide inside used containers and may hinder your yield if they infect your carrot plants.

, Both soil and soilless mixtures can work.


Try a mixture of red soil, decomposed compost, and sand mixed in equal portions for a soil-based media.
Consider coco peat, mixed with a small amount of perlite, for a soilless media.

"
"
Start sometime in March.,
Fill your container with the planting medium.,
Mix fertilizer into the soil, if desired.,
Dig small holes in the planting medium.,
Drop two or three carrot seeds into each hole.

,
Fill the holes in with your planting medium.,
Thoroughly water the seeds.,
Place your pot in a location that receives partial sun and partial shade.",How to Grow Carrots in Pots2," Carrots do well in cooler weather. Some ""early growing"" varieties should be sown in early March, while many ""main crop"" types do best if planted in mid-March.

, Leave one inch (25 millimeters) of empty space between the top of the media and the rim of the container.

, Fertilizer will encourage carrot growth, but it is not necessary.

, The holes should be about half an inch (13 millimeters) deep and spaced approximately three inches (76 millimeters) apart.

,, Do not pack the medium into the holes, since doing so may crush the seeds. Instead, lightly drop the medium into each hole.

, Do not supersaturate the medium, but add enough water to make the medium feel very wet.

, As a root vegetable, carrots tolerate shade well. A location that receives up to six hours of sunlight each day may encourage growth better than a spot that receives none, however.

"
"
Keep the medium wet.,
Feed your carrots with fertilizer once a week to encourage growth.,
Thin your carrots out once the germinated greens have reached a height of one inch (25 millimeters).,
Add planting medium around any greens that seem bent.,
Cover the roots with additional planting medium if they begin to peek through.,
Spray your plants with wettable sulfur or another anti-fungal spray if mildew or other fungi forms.,
Harvest your carrots after two to two and a half months pass, depending on the variety you chose to grow.",How to Grow Carrots in Pots3," You may even need to water it twice a day during hot, sunny weather. Do not let the soil stay dry for any extended amount of time.

, This is only optional, however.

, Cut the greens off at the soil using scissors until only one seedling remains in each hole.


Pulling the seedling out is not recommended. Uprooting can disrupt the medium and damage the roots of the remaining plants.

, Roots will not form correctly if the stems are bent.

, When carrot roots are exposed to sunlight, they begin to green, making them inedible.

, Carrots are prone to develop mildew when kept too wet, and you may need to spray your crop if you receive heavy rains over an extensive period of time.

, Grasp the greens near the top of the root and gently wiggle them out of place. The earlier you harvest, the sweeter the carrots will be.

Aim for a warm planting season.,
Plant your seeds inside about a month before your local last frost date.,
Put three or four seeds in each 3″ pot, about 1″ deep under the soil.",How to Grow Spaghetti Squash1," Spaghetti squash need a long growing season and warm temperatures, and that includes warmth at planting time. So any seeds would have to go out after your frost date has passed. But starting your seedlings indoors is a common way for gardeners to start their squash plants.;
, Squash seedlings will grow fairly large in a month, so small 6-pack style seed trays won’t likely suffice. If you start them that way, you’ll have to replant them in larger containers before your outside plant date.

, They’ll need to be kept somewhere warm as well as sunny in order to properly germinate and sprout.

"
"
If you are not starting with indoor-grown seedlings, you will still have to wait for 2 weeks past the frost date.,
Plant them in hills, just like you did with the transplants, about 3 per hill.,
Plan to put your seedlings into the garden about 2 weeks after the date of your last spring frost.",How to Grow Spaghetti Squash2," If you’ve had cool weather, you can lay black plastic down over the garden before planting to help warm up the soil. The seeds won’t sprout in the cold.

, Many squashes can be grown vertically to save space, but this isn’t the best idea with a spaghetti squash. The fruits are just too big and it is awkward to try to support them on the vine when hanging in mid-air. It can be done, as long as you are willing to put in a bit of extra effort with your trellis and support structures.

, Your soil should be dug up thoroughly to get it loose for the big seedlings, and mix in some aged manure or compost while you are at it. Squash likes nutrients in its soil. Your squash spot needs full sun, and you should allow for 3 feet between each hill (you will just be planting one pot in each location, with 3 or four seedlings in it).

"
"
After the peak of the summer has passed, remove any new blossoms that your squash vines produce.,
Keep your plants watered, and weed-free while the leaves are developing.,
Try to plant a variety that grows as a bush to help save on space, such as Orangetti or Tivoli.,
Grow spaghetti squash in a large container if desired.,
Know your pests.",How to Grow Spaghetti Squash3," There won’t be enough time left for them to mature and the plant’s resources would be better used growing the already-developing squash on the vine. Because the squash will be growing for the full length of the season, they can be prone to getting rot underneath where they lay on the soil. You can help protect your squash with tiles or coffee can lids under each fruit.

, Once the wide leaves are fully grown, they will start to shade their surrounding soil and will keep the weeds out without your help.

, If you do grow a vining squash, be prepared to have the vines spill out of the container for several feet.

, You'll need at least 5 gallons for each plant.


Give them a light feeding part of the way through the growing season to make up for the lack of soil nutrients in the pot.

, The most common insect attacker will be squash bugs, followed closely by the popular cucumber beetle. They are both big enough to be picked off by hand as soon as you see one, but make sure to check inside the blossoms as well as under the large leaves. And those large leaves may be a benefit when it comes to weed control, but they are susceptible to getting mildew if weather is damp. It looks like a dusting of white powder on the leaves and it can effect your plant’s development and growth if it gets too heavy.


Standard fungicide sprays can help to clear it up, and you can keep it from starting by watering your plants right at the soil instead of pouring water over all the leaves.
Once established and growing well, a squash vine is quite large and can withstand a fair bit of insect damage without ill effects.

"
"
Push your fingernail into the outside skin to tell if your squash is ready.,
Store your squash at room temperature in a dry environment.",How to Grow Spaghetti Squash4," The skin should be tough enough to withstand your nail. If it punctures, your squash need more time. Depending on your climate, another sign is that you should harvest your squash when the vines start to wither.

, A whole squash can be stored in the fridge for about 2 weeks before it starts to lose its texture. Moisture will quickly ruin a spaghetti squash, but barring dampness, it should keep for a few months.

Store any extra carrots.",How to Grow Baby Carrots," Just be sure you have enough room: you’ll need at least 8 in (20 cm) of depth, 1 in (2.5 cm) between each plant, and 6 in (15 cm) between rows.Planting in containers can help keep critters from getting to your carrots.;
, It takes carrots 70-80 days to reach maturity, and they are best harvested just after being touched by frost. In the United States, the first fall frost typically takes place between September and October. For more specific information, see the frost dates by U.S. and Canadian city., You can find several varieties online, such as “little finger carrots”or “Parisian round carrots.”, Baby carrots grow best in heavier soils, such as clay, because they are heavy-rooted. The soil should be a fine, loamy texture with a mix of nutrients, including lime. Adding compost can also help improve your soil quality, particularly if it has earthworm castings.Dig up the area where you intend to plant and loosen the soil up to 8 in (20 cm) deep. Break up the sticky clumps of dirt.
Remove as many rocks as possible from the soil, as they may impede the growing process.

, They should be 0.25 in (0.64 cm) deep, about 1 in (2.5 cm) apart, in rows 6 in (15 cm) apart. Cover the seeds gently with soil after planting. You can also plant radishes in between the rows to improve the harvest and break the soil for the carrots.

, Water gently so you don’t dislodge the seeds. Be sure to keep the seeds moist for about 2 to 3 weeks or until the sprouts have their first set of true leaves. Seeds may be slow to germinate but as long as you keep them moist they should sprout.


Maintain a constant moisture for the carrots. This will prevent splitting and flavor loss as well as allow your carrots to mature fully.

, Once the tops of the carrots reach 2 in (5 cm) tall, you may pull every other carrot to leave the remaining carrots 2 in (5 cm) apart. If the carrots are too close together, they will grow crooked. Make sure they have enough space between them.If you see any crowns popping up out of the soil cover them with a bit of mulch or soil to keep them from turning green or bitter., Carrots should be fertilized once they reach 3 in (7.6 cm) tall. Choose a fertilizer with potassium and phosphate, but little nitrogen. This is because phosphate and potassium encourage root development and carrots are a root vegetable. Nitrogen encourages foliage production., This will prevent other plant species from taking up space meant for your carrots. Carrots don’t compete well with weeds, and may be overtaken by them if the area is not weeded properly. Other plant species also attract root flies, which can ruin your crop., This is when the carrots will be at their sweetest. The taste of carrots improves as they mature, but don’t leave mature carrots in the ground longer than necessary as many animals like to eat them., Gently dig around the top of the carrot to loosen the soil. Pull the carrots out of the ground and cut off the leaves, leaving a little stem remaining. Gently brush off the dirt then rinse the carrots thoroughly with water.

, Carrots can be used in a variety of dishes. Miniature carrots have a sweeter taste than some other varieties. They are delicious raw, roasted or in carrot cake.

, Don’t wash them first, just brush off the clumps of dirt. You can store extras by placing them in a box of slightly moist peat or sand. Store them in a dark and cool, but frost-free, area. They will keep for a few months.

Plant the cucumbers in growing bags or pots if growing in a greenhouse.,
For cucumbers growing in a greenhouse:


Place the vertical stake item between each bag or pot and extend it to the eaves of the greenhouse roof.,
For cucumbers growing in the garden:


Insert the vertical stake item between each cucumber plant into the soil.,
Tie each cucumber plant onto the support as it grows.

,
To facilitate the correct growth, be sure to pinch out all side shows, flowers and tendrils until the cucumber plant reaches the wire or string.",How to Train Cucumbers," Otherwise, plant them in the garden as usual.;
,
Place horizontal wires or string along the roof length.
Train the cucumbers to grow up the stake and then along the wire or string. The cucumbers will hang down as they grow.

,
Tie horizontal wire or string along the top end of each stake. You might need to add additional stakes for stability of the growing string.
Train the cucumber plants to grow up each stake and then along the wire or string.

,, At this point, train two sideshows to run along the horizontal wire or string.

"
Choose the right kind of cucumber.,
Select a large pot.,
Make sure your pot has drainage holes.,
Clean your pot.,
Make a good soil mix.,
Add a good fertilizer into the soil mix to provide your plants with an additional boost in nutrition.,
Prepare a stake.",How to Grow Cucumbers in Pots1," In general, bush varieties are easier to grow in pots than vine varieties, which need a trellis to climb and spread out on. Varieties that are well-suited for container growing include the Salad Bush Hybrid, Bush Champion, Spacemaster, Hybrid Bush Crop, Baby Bush, Bush Pickle, and Potluck.;
, The pot should be a minimum of 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) in both diameter and depth, and the diameter and depth of the pot should be equal even if using a larger size.

, Cucumbers love water, but just like any plant, too much water could be bad for the roots. A plastic pot with two drainage holes makes an excellent choice to promote proper moisture levels.

, This is especially important if the container you choose once held another plant, since hidden insect eggs and bacteria could attack your cucumbers if left alone. Scrub the pot with hot water and soap before use.

, A good mix will have loose soil that drains well, along with enough organic material to provide the plants with nutrition. Combine equal parts potting soil, perlite, sphagnum peat moss, and compost for a simple yet beneficial blend. Do not use garden soil, which may be contaminated by bacteria and pests.

, A 5-10-5 fertilizer or 14-14-14 slow-release fertilizer may work best for many cucumber varieties. Mix it into the soil according the label directions.


The numbers on a bag of fertilizer indicate how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium the fertilizer contains, respectively. Each element nourishes a different part of the plant. Nitrogen produces leaf growth, phosphorus improves the roots and fruit yield, and potassium strengthens the flowers and overall strength of the plant. A 5-10-5 fertilizer gives your cucumbers a mild dose that focuses on improved vegetable yield. A 14-14-14 fertilizer, on the other hand, keeps the health of your plant balanced, making it safer to give your cucumbers the slightly higher concentration.

, Vine cucumbers require a trellis or stake to grow. Even though bush cucumbers do not require staking, they do benefit from it. Consider a teepee-style metal staking system, available at most hardware and garden supply stores, since this design encourages plants to climb along the stake instead of merely serving as support.

Fill the pot with potting mix.,
Check the stake.,
Poke a small hole into the center of the soil.,
Plant five to eight seeds in the hole.,
Cover the hole with more of your soil mix.,

Spread peat moss or mulch over the soil.,
Place your pot in a bright, sunny location.",How to Grow Cucumbers in Pots2," Cucumbers need the soil to reach at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) in order to grow. Starting the crop in early July is common and will yield a harvest in September.

, The legs of the stake should touch the bottom of the pot, and the stake itself should stand straight without needing additional support.

, Pack the mix into the pot, carefully packing it in around the stake. Do not make it too compact, however, since your cucumber plant's roots need loose soil to grow in. Leave approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of empty space between the surface of the soil and the rim of the pot.

, Try to wiggle it around in the pot. If it still moves around a lot, pack more potting mix around it to make it more stable.

, The hole should be about 1/2-inch (1.27 centimeters) deep. You can create it by using your pinky finger or the rounded end of a pencil.

, Planting more seeds than necessary will mean that you will have to thin out the cucumber plants as they start to grow, but only planting one or two seeds per hole reduces your odds of success.

, Do not squish the soil into the hole, since doing so may damage the seeds. Instead, loosely drop it over the seeds.

, The soil should be thoroughly and noticeably moist. Do not supersaturate the soil, however, since puddles of water may end up scattering the seeds.

, A thin layer should prevent the soil from drying out too quickly.

, Cucumbers thrive in warm conditions, and the extra sunlight will keep the soil nice and warm.

Thin your cucumbers out once the seedlings sprout two sets of leaves.,
Thin your cucumbers down to one once they reach a height of 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 centimeters).,
Keep the pot in full sun throughout the entirety of the growing season.,
Water your cucumbers daily.,
Add a balanced fertilizer once a week.,
Protect the plants from harsh wind.,
Watch out for garden pests.,
Monitor your plant for signs of disease.,
Harvest your cucumbers when they are still young.",How to Grow Cucumbers in Pots3," Select the two tallest seedlings and let them stay. Snip the other seedlings down to the surface of the soil. Do not yank the other seedlings out, since doing so will disturb the soil and may cause damage to your other seedlings.

, Keep the taller, stronger of the two, and snip the other one down to the surface of the soil.

, Cucumbers need 8 hours of direct sun exposure, at minimum, to fulfill light and heat requirements.

, If the surface of the soil seems dry, it may be time for re-watering. Give mature plants enough water so that a little extra drains out from the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot. Never allow the soil to dry out, since dry soil will inhibit growth and lead to a bitter crop.

, Drench the soil first before adding the fertilizer, since adding the fertilizer when the plants are dry may create problems. Use a water soluble fertilizer, and apply as much as the label directs you to use.

, A little breeze can be good for your cucumbers, but strong winds can damage the plant. Placing your pot near the side of your house or by a fence can minimize potential wind damage.

, Aphids, pickle worms, mites, and cucumber beetles will all target your cucumber plant. Use neem oil or another organic pesticide to drive away and kill these insects.

, Mildew and bacterial wilt are especially common. Many anti-fungal products will rid your plants of mildew, but you may have a more difficult time improving plant health if you cucumbers get a bacterial disease.

, Bigger cucumbers are bitterer. Snip the stem about 1/2-inch (1.27 centimeters) above the cucumber.


Most cucumbers are ready to harvest within 55 to 70 days after planting.

Bush pickle cucumbers and Carolina cucumbers are common pickling cucumber varieties. Bush pickle plants are appropriate for planting in containers. Carolina cucumbers are medium-sized plants that should be planted in the ground.;
,


Grow pickling cucumbers in full sun and warm, moist soil. Traditional cucumber plants need lots of space. Hybrid cucumbers may be planted in a smaller space outside or in a large container.

,


Cucumbers planted outdoors must be planted in warm soil after the last frost. You can plant second crop of cucumbers in mid to late summer. Plants prefer a nutrient-rich soil, so work compost into the soil before planting cucumbers.
Seeds should be planted on their edges 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) deep. Sowing seeds on their edges prevents rot. Space seeds 6 inches (15 cm) apart in rows 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m) apart. Alternatively, you can plant 3 to 4 plants close together in hills 36 inches (.9 m) apart. Planting cucumbers in hills increases pollination and can lead to more productive plants.
If you start your pickling cucumbers inside, plant 2 to 3 seeds at 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) deep in each peat pot or small container 3 to 4 weeks before planting outside. Thin the seedling to 1 seedling per pot after they sprout.
To transplant cucumbers, plant seedlings 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm) apart after the last frost. Cucumbers must be transplanted early. Plants that have more than 4 leaves will not transplant well. Make sure to water the plants well before transplanting.

,


Water pickling cucumber plants frequently and keep their soil moist, particularly when once the fruit forms.






In early spring, cover the roots with black plastic or use polyester row covers over the plants to help the plants yield earlier. Use of polyester row covers will also help prevent infestation by cucumber beetles.






Fertilize with a nitrogen fertilizer when the vines start to form on the plants. Continue to fertilize regularly throughout the growing season.






Support vines with a trellis or fence if you are trying to reduce the space they use. Be aware that cucumbers should not be supported in very windy environments.







,


Harvest cucumbers in the early morning and store them in the refrigerator in loose or perforated plastic bags until you are ready to use them. Pick cucumbers every day to keep them from growing too large for pickling.
Pick pickling cucumbers when they are 3 to 5 inches (7 to 12 cm) long. Cucumbers should be firm and green. Discard any cucumbers that are turning yellow.

Chantenay. Chantenay carrots grow five to six inches into the soil and can be grown in most soil types, though they prefer rich, heavy soil conditions.

Ball-type. Also known as ""Thumbelina,"" Ball-type carrots are extremely similar to Chantenay, though they do not grow quite as long. Danvers. Danvers carrots are large block-shaped carrots that need heavy, nutrient-rich soil in order to thrive. The soil does not have to be deep, however.

Nantes. Originally from France, Nantes carrots are cylindrical carrots with rounded tips that grow between six and nine inches deep. Like Danvers, they thrive in shallow rich soil.

Imperator. This variety, commonly found at the grocery store, needs deep, airy soil. Imperator carrots are characterized by their particularly long, spindly roots that hang on to the tip of the carrot. They are very particular about their soil conditions, so make sure your soil is deep, rich, airy, and has good drainage before attempting to plant this variety.

Amsterdam: These are a small variety, about 3 inches (76 mm) long, which makes them ideal for shallow soil or poorer soil conditions. They can also be harvested earlier.;
, Carrot seeds come either raw, coated with a layer of bentonite clay, or treated with a fungicide. Although they are more expensive, clay-covered seeds are better at retaining moisture during germination than seeds that do not have an applied coating on them. If you want to get a leg up on the growing game and make the germination process easier, choose coated seeds. Additionally, coated seeds are easier to handle and thus you can control where they are spaced better than non-coated seeds. Accurate spacing eliminates the need to thin plants later in the growing process.







, Though full sun is best, carrots can handle some shade as they are a cool weather crop.








, The most important factor when it comes to growing carrots is making sure that the soil is well-loosened. Use a shovel to loosen the soil in your planting area extremely thoroughly.









Remove any rocks or hard, clumpy soil from the area. Use a rake to catch any small stones. You want the soil to be fluffy rather than hard and clay-like.
If the soil is too clay-like, you can soften it by adding organic matter (such as yard trimmings or manure), sand, or compost to the soil. If you do not do this, the carrots will not reach a good shape.
You may want to build a raised bed to plant your carrots in. Because carrots require such strict soil conditions, it can be helpful to start an entirely new planting area rather than try to adapt an existing one. Use cedar wood to build the planter beds, as it does not mold when it gets wet.

, Carrots like a slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.8 and 6.8. Your local agricultural extension office should have soil testing forms, bags, and instructions available.







, Mix in about four inches of organic compost into your soil. This will help the seeds germinate in the soil and encourage a hardy production.








, Then gradually sow more seeds once per week for the next two to three weeks after the initial planting.









Carrots like a cool climate. If you are planting in USDA hardiness zone eight or warmer, you should sow your carrot seeds in the fall or winter.
Again, make sure your soil is extremely well tilled and loose before deciding to plant.
Alternately, learn to grow carrots in a pot. The process for growing carrots in a pot is pretty much the same as in the ground or a planter box. You just need to make sure that your pot is deep enough to hold the carrots and allow the roots to expand.

, If planting in rows, space the seeds about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) apart in a shallow trench, no more than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep. Space each row of carrots 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) apart from each other.








, You can use compost, planting soil mix, and even mix in a little bit of sand, especially in warmer areas. Sand helps support the growing seedlings.








, The seeds will take about one to three weeks to sprout depending on the temperature of the soil. The colder the soil, the longer the seeds take to germinate.








, The seeds are light and fragile and can easily get washed away if you water too much or too vigorously.








, About a week after you plant the carrots, you can gently rake soil so that weeds do not grow. This will disrupt any weeds that may have already taken root. Be very gentle as you do this, and rake perpendicular to your rows. This will not disturb the carrot seeds., If you are in a hot climate, this means watering your carrot plants daily. Just be sure not to wash away the fragile seeds or harm the sprouting seedlings with too much water pressure. Use a watering can with gentle spouts instead of a strong hose.








, Add a few inches of a leaf, bark, or hay mulch to the ground around the seedlings to seal in the moisture.









Pull out any weeds that develop through the mulch by hand. Do so gently so as not to disturb the carrot roots.
Be sure to cover any part of the carrot itself that begins to grow out of the ground with mulch. If the carrot crown is exposed to the air, it will become bitter.

, When the tops of the carrots reach two inches high, thin the carrots to one inch apart by pulling the small carrot plants out of the ground.









This reduces crowding and allows the individual carrots enough room to grow and expand their roots.
After another two weeks passes and the carrot tops have grown several inches high, thin the plants again to three to four inches apart. Be sure not to skip this step, as crowded carrots will not grow straight and may not develop fully.

, The bigger and longer they grow, the sweeter and juicier they become. However, you can pluck and eat them as soon as they grow big enough to eat, which usually takes anywhere from two to three months after planting. You can tell if a carrot is ready to harvest when the crown is sticking slightly out of the ground and the diameter of the carrot is about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) across.









Hand-pull the carrots from the base of the greenery to avoid damaging any roots. Grab the base of the greenery and wiggle the carrot around before pulling straight up.
Water the planting area before you pull the carrots up to loosen the soil and make it easier to pull the carrots without damaging the roots."

Harvest the cucumbers when young.",How to Grow Cucumbers," Cucumbers are exceedingly sensitive to cold temperatures, and even a mild frost can kill them. This is especially true when the plants are in their most vulnerable stages.


Generally, cucumbers should be planted in April or May, depending on the region you live in and when the weather begins warming up. A more specific way to determine when to plant your cucumbers would be to pay attention to the date of the last frost. To be on the safe side, wait until at least two weeks after the last frost date.
The temperature of the soil should be at least 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius). Note that the soil temperature can be a little cooler than the air temperature.;
, Cucumbers grow best when given full sun for the entirety of their growing process.


Sunlight is important as a source of nutrition for cucumber plants, which make full use of the process of photosynthesis.
Sunlight is also important for the sake of temperature regulation. Steady sunlight will mean consistently warm soil, which the seeds need in order to germinate.

, Dig weeds out of your garden before you plant your cucumbers. Aside from being unpleasant to look at, weeds rob the plants of valuable and limited nutrients.


For best results, pull the weeds up by hand, yanking up as much of the root as possible. If you leave the root of a weed behind, there is a strong likelihood that the same weed will continue to grow.
Avoid the use of herbicides. Chemical and organic herbicides alike can make the soil unsuitable for plant growth overall, thereby making it as inhabitable for cucumbers as it is for weeds.

, Spread and dig some granular fertilizer into the soil of your garden to improve its overall quality before you begin planting cucumbers there.Use a trowel or small rake to chop up the soil before adding fertilizer or anything else to it. By loosening the soil, you allow these additives to mix in more thoroughly while also creating ideal conditions for your cucumbers to take root in.
Rich compost or aged manures are the best natural fertilizers for the use of cucumbers. Mix them into the soil to a depth of 2 inches (about 5 cm), and gradually cut and work them into the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 cm).
If you use an inorganic fertilizer, choose a slow-release granular fertilizer and follow the label instructions to determine how much to add to the soil.

, Ideally, the pH of your soil should be fairly neutral to slightly alkaline, so it should have a pH level as close to 7.0 as possible.


Test the pH of the soil with a pH testing kit, available through many garden supply centers and hardware stores.
If you need to increase the pH of your soil, add agricultural lime.
If you need to decrease the pH of you soil, add sulfur or aluminum sulfate.

, If the soil is too dense or too sandy, the cucumber plants could struggle at the root level, causing the plant to die or, at the very least, fail to produce any edible cucumbers for the season.


The ideal soil of cucumbers is loose, light, and sandy, since these soils get warmer quicker and stay warm more easily.
Improve clay soil by adding organic material. Improve dense, heavy soil with peat, compose, or rotted manure.

, In general, there are vine and bush varieties. The former is more common, but the latter may be easier to confine if you have limited space to work with. There are also slicing or pickling varieties. The slicing cucumbers should be used if you plan on eating the cucumbers after harvesting them, but the latter should be used if you plan to pickle them.


Vine slicing varieties include the burpless, marketmore 76, and straight 8.
Bush slicing varieties include the bush crop, fanfare, and salad bush.
Pickling varieties include the bush pickle and the Carolina, the latter of which should be treated as a vine plant.

, Cucumbers have very fragile root systems, so seeding the garden directly is much more preferable than transplanting previously started plants.


Transplant seedlings only when necessary. If you want to start your cucumbers earlier in the season, you may do so, but you will need to start them indoors and be extremely careful about how the plants are handled during transplanting.
Start seedlings indoors in small starter pots placed on heat mats or under grow lights. Seedlings should be started about 4 weeks before you intend to transplant them.
When transplanting the cucumber plants, wiggle the entire structure out of the starter pot, soil and all. The soil will protect the sensitive roots as you transplant the cucumber seedling. If you attempt to transplant a cucumber that is bare-rooted, the plant will not likely survive.

, If the soil is dry, use a watering can or hose to moisten it before you add the seeds.


Ample moisture is vital at all stages of growth. By wetting the soil before you plant the seeds, however, you reduce the risk of washing the seeds away with the force of the water.
If the soil is completely dry, add about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to the soil patch using a watering can or gentle hose.

, Push one or two seeds 1/2 inch to 1 inch into the top of the soil (1.25 to 2.5 ml).The plantings should be about 18 to 36 inches (45.72 to 91.44 cm) apart, regardless of whether you are planting seeds or seedlings. Note that bush varieties can be spaced a little closer together than vine varieties.
Alternatively, you can space the seeds 6 to 10 inches (15.24 to 25.4 cm) apart and thin your seedlings out once they reach 4 inches (10 cm) tall. At that point, you should consider thinning them out so that they are 18 inches (45.72 cm) apart.

, Getting this ready after planting the seeds may save you trouble later on.


Cucumbers will grow horizontally, but growing cucumbers vertically will improve the airflow and sunlight exposure, thereby increasing your overall yield.
You can use a cage trellis, stake, fence, or nearly any other vertical structure.
Guide the vines onto your trellis. As the plants get bigger, guide it onto your prepared trellis by gently wrapping the vine tendrils along the trellis.

, Covering the soil will limit the number of nutrient-depriving weeds that can return while also keeping the soil nice and warm for the cucumbers.


Organic mulches, like straw and wood chips, must be applied after the plants have already sprouted and the soil has sufficiently warmed up. Plastic mulches can technically be applied immediately after you plant the seeds, though.
Dark mulch is especially good at keeping the soil warm and moist.

, Cucumbers need plenty of moisture throughout their entire life cycle.


Water deeply at least once a week using a gently hose or watering can. You should provide at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water each time.
Alternatively, install a drip irrigation system to regulate the water flow more consistently. This is especially beneficial because it keeps the foliage dry, thereby limiting the risk of fungal diseases.
Note that adequate moisture is especially important once the fruit begins to set.

, Use a mild liquid fertilizer every couple of weeks to maintain good soil quality for your hungry plants.


If you did not use a granular fertilizer when preparing the soil, you should directly fertilize the soil with a liquid feed every two weeks. Do not get inorganic fertilizer on plant leaves or fruits.
If you fertilized before planting your cucumbers, you should fertilize again once runners appear on vines and flowers begin to bud. If you prefer organic fertilizers, use compost or ages manure.
If the leaves turn yellow, you need a high-nitrogen fertilizer.Note, however, that you should not over-fertilize your plants. Doing so can stunt the growth of your fruits and limit your yield.

, Netting and fences can prevent many of these larger pests from causing problems.


The netting should be made from a fine mesh in order to effectively keep out small critters like rabbits and chipmunks.
Netting is especially important during the early stages, when animals might be tempted to dig seeds and sprouts out of the soil. At this stage, you could also cover the plants with a small berry basket.
Note that you should remove the netting once the plants get too tall or large to stay closed in.

, For insects, fungi, and other small pests and diseases, you may need to use some type of organic insecticide or fungicide.


Common pests include:

Cucumber beetles
White flies
Aphids
Spider mites


Common diseases include:

Bacterial wilt
Mosaic viruses
Anthracnose
Downy
Powdery mildew
Mosaic
Scab disease



, Slicing cucumbers should be about 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 cm) long. Cucumbers can usually be twisted off the vine without the use of shears.

Pickling cucumbers should be harvested at 2 inches (5 cm) and dills should be harvested at 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15.24 cm).
Cucumbers that get too large or too yellow can become bitter. You should not allow a cucumber to turn yellow on the vine.
At peak harvesting time, you will likely end up picking cucumbers every few days.

Choose a good location.,
Choose a bean variety that will suit your taste and location.",How to Grow Beans and Peas1," Beans typically want (unfiltered) full sun, which is defined as at least 6 hours of sunlight per day.They do very well in warmer climates such as that of the American South. Some bean varieties, such as those that were traditionally grown using in cornfields using the three-sisters method (i.e. beanstalks twining around cornstalks with squash at the base), are more tolerant of shade and will still produce in dappled sunlight or with under 6 hours a day.



Make a sun chart to determine which parts of your yard or patio will be best for beans.;
, Each will have different light, space, planting, and harvesting requirements, not to mention a different flavor. Some beans (like snap beans) are grown to be eaten raw – pod and all – while others are meant to be shelled and dried for later use in cooking. There are two general categories of bean:


Pole beans grow tall and must be trellised.Not only are they beautiful to look at, but they also make the most of vertical space.
Bush beans are compact and don’t need supports.Since they don’t cast long shadows, they can more easily be planted in and around other plants.

"
Choose the best place.,
Choose a pea variety that will suit your taste and location.",How to Grow Beans and Peas2," Although peas typically want full sun, which is defined as at least 6 hours of sunlight per day, they also prefer cooler climates. If you live in a hot area, plant your peas in an area that either gets dappled sunlight throughout the day or is shaded during the hottest hours. (A spot partially shaded by a tree or hedge is ideal because the growing leaves will provide more shade as the season gets hotter.)



Make a sun chart to determine which parts of your yard or patio will be suitable for growing peas.

, Each will have different light, space, planting, and harvesting requirements, not to mention a different flavor. Moreover, some grow tall and must be grown up a support system (which can be a great way to utilize vertical space), while others are more compact (and won’t cast a long shadow across other areas of the garden). There are three general categories of peas:


English (a.k.a. garden) peas are grown only for their seeds and must be shelled after being harvested. There are both high- and low-growing varieties.Snow (a.k.a. sugar) peas are grown for both their sweet, flat pods and their seeds. No shelling is necessary, as they are completely edible, but they taste the best when picked young. There are both high- and low-growing varieties.Sugar snap peas are also grown for both their seeds and pods but are thicker than snow peas and more closely resemble snap beans. They only come in high-climbing varieties."

Watch them grow.,
Harvest the pods.,
Let a few pods mature completely near the end of the growing season.",How to Grow Beans and Peas3," This will be determined by the spacing requirements of the variety you’ve chosen. If you plan to plant rows, be sure to leave enough space between them for easy access – particularly if you’ve chosen a tall variety.

, These are the beans or peas themselves, of course, which means that, unlike with many other seed types, you'll need relatively fresh ones. Fresh beans or peas from a farmers' market will work fine; fresh ones from the supermarket might work, but the exact variety probably won’t be listed and many will fail to sprout. Alternatively, you can buy dried seeds as long as they aren’t very old. (Check the date on the package.) Dried beans from the supermarket may work, but you'd do best to go organic (to make sure they haven't been treated not to sprout). Frozen or canned beans and peas are useless.


For dried beans, test them first. Soak some in water then put them into a damp paper towel and fold it over. Keep the towel just damp (splash it with water once a day or so), and in two or three days open it up and look. If there are little sprouts poking out of the split beans, it’s a good sign that they’re healthy and you should go ahead and plant them. (In fact, plant those sprouted ones first!) If they look exactly the same, give them another couple days and if that doesn't work find another source of beans; and if the beans have gotten moldy you can try again to sprout them using less water, but you'll probably need another source of beans.

, Either put dirt in a suitably-sized container (unfertilized potting soil from any garden store will work fine) or dig up the ground where you want to plant them. You need about 6 inches (15 cm) of loose, rich soil. If your ground is mostly clay or sand, you'll probably have better luck in a pot. (Or buy some compost and topsoil, mix it with the dirt you dug up – about 50/50 – and put it back so it forms a slight mound.)


Go easy on fertilization. Remember that peas and beans can obtain their own nitrogen. If you provide too much nitrogen in the form of fertilizer, the vines will get big but there will be fewer beans and peas to harvest.

, If you plan to grow just a few plants, this may not be an issue; if you plant fifteen of them, however, you may be overwhelmed when the time comes to harvest everything. Moreover, some peas/beans are “determinate,” which means they will flower and make peas all at once. You will get one large harvest, then the plants will die. Others are “indeterminate” and will set flowers and make pods for as long as they grow (several weeks to several months). You won't get as many pods at one time -- usually not more than 5-6 ripe pods per plant per couple of days -- but you'll get them for much longer.


Assuming you are growing indeterminate varieties, two plants will generally make enough for one person (for a side dish) every couple of days. Use this to calculate how often you will want to eat the peas/beans and how many people you'll be feeding to decide how many plants to grow.
For determinate varieties, you can either make a good meal or two out of them or preserve them by drying, canning, pickling, etc.

, Push your finger down into the soil you're planting to about to the first joint (1-1.5"", 2.5-5cm) and then put the seed into that hole. Pat soil down over it (to ensure soil contact, which is critical for germination) and water gently (to avoid re-exposure). Ex.: pour water on your hand and sprinkle it over where each seed was planted.


Although it depends on the variety, beans are typically planted about one or two weeks before the expected date of the last killing frost in the spring. Look for soil temperature that's reliably over 60°F (16°C) as a cue. Keep in mind that varieties with colored seeds are more likely to germinate in cool soils than varieties with white seeds.
Peas are commonly planted about six to eight weeks before the last killing frost (soil temperature of 50°F/10°C or higher). Some peas (snow peas and sugar snaps) like cool temperatures and are more of a spring and fall plant in most climates. Again, your particular bean variety might have different requirements.

In areas like the San Francisco Bay Area, peas grow well planted in February and produce until late May or early June, when they die off. Plant them again in September/October (while it's still warm) and they'll produce through December or January.


If you buy actual seeds in a packet meant for planting, it will say to initially plant more than you need and then thin them down to a more manageable number. You can do that, but remember that if you don't thin them enough (or do it soon enough), the seedlings will end up competing for nutrients, becoming stunted or even dying.
You can also plant the seeds more or less where they are supposed to end up. Some won't germinate, so plant a few in each area to make sure you have enough. For example, if your seeds should be spaced about 6"" (15 cm) apart, plant three or so every 6”. Don’t plant them too close together; if they all germinate, it will be difficult to pull up the extras without hurting the one you want to save.
If planting a large area with peas or beans, doing so by hand can be back breaking work. Consider using a wheel planter (as shown) or a planter that attaches to the back of a tractor.

Depending on the variety and whether you planted fresh, dried, or pre-sprouted seeds, expect the first sprouts to show above the surface between around 2 to 10 days.

, Most peas and beans are twining plants. You will therefore need something for them to twine on: a fence, a net strung between two poles, individual poles for each plant, or a bean tepee (made of 3-4 bamboo poles tied together at the top). It's best to have a support ready to ""plant"" while you plant the seeds. The supports can also help mark your seed locations.


If you want to grow your peas or beans along a chain-link fence -- particularly one bordering your neighbor’s property -- be sure you don’t mind sacrificing whatever ends up on the opposite side. If the fence is between you and the sun, it’s probably best not to use it as a support; plants grow toward sunlight and may only produce a handful of goodies on your side.

, Water them at least daily -- and more often if it's dry -- but remember that too much water is as harmful as too little. To test the soil, push your finger into the ground. If it gets it wet/muddy, you’re using too much water; it should be damp to dry.


Water with a “rain” spray on a hose or a watering can. Don't run the hose directly onto the seeds; they'll either wash away or drown.

, If you let them fall over, a) they may rot on the surface and b) they may twine with their neighbors and become difficult to separate without breaking. Keep checking them and encouraging them to grow up the twining surface every day when you water them. They grow fast!


At this point they can take more direct watering, but still, don't run the hose right on them.

, Tender pea shoots are delicious, raw or cooked. When the peas are 4-6"" or 10-15cm tall, you can cut off the top two ""levels"" of leaves and bring them to the kitchen. Don't cut more than this, though; the stem gets fibrous as it grows and you want to cut the top where it is still tender. The pea plants will grow back, and you can get several harvests out of them for greens.
, Flowers will begin to show a couple weeks after the sprouts come up. (Beans and peas flower in lots of different colors, including white, pink and purple, so you could even sneak some into a flower garden for show.) When the flowers dry up, a pea/bean pod will begin to grow from the same place.

, If your variety is edible-podded, pick and eat them when they plump up. If it isn’t edible-podded, wait until the pods are round and you can see the little bumps from the peas/beans inside. Pick them, open the pods and use the peas/beans inside.


Some, like snow peas, taste best when picked a little young.
Pick them the same day you intend to use them -- and as soon before eating as possible. The flavor begins to fade as soon as you pick them.
Always pick pods before they get too old. One taste of a too-big pod will tell you why: while they're not harmful to eat, they're not very tasty, either. The texture is coarse and pithy and they lose their sweetness.

, Assuming you liked the variety, you can use the seeds to plant again next year. (See tips.)

"
"
Work compost into the soil.,
Push a fingertip about 1 inch (2.54 cm) deep into the soil.,
Drop a single seed into each hole, and cover with more potting mix or topsoil.,
Water the seeds and soil to help the snow peas germinate.

,
Push a stake or trellis into the ground next to the seeds if you are growing a variety that grows very tall, such as Oregon Giant.,
Remove any weeds by-hand if they appear near your snow peas, especially when the peas are very young.,
Water the growing snow peas regularly.,
Add a layer of mulch, such as grass clippings or shredded paper to the top of the soil.,
Pick snow pea pods after the pod has reached a length of between 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm).",How to Grow Snow Peas," Add about 3 inches (7.62 cm) of compost for every 100 square feet (30.48 square m) of land. Potting mix has fertilizer built in, so you will not need to add compost to it.;
, Make as many 1 inch (2.54 cm) holes as snow pea seeds you plan on planting. Space each hole 2 inches (5.08 cm) apart.

,


If you are growing snow peas in the ground in rows, space each row 18 inches (45.7 cm) apart so that the peas have plenty of room to grow.

,, Dwarf varieties, such as Snowbird or Dwarf Gray Sugar, only reach about 24 inches (.61 m) in height and do not need stakes or support. Look at the seed packet to determine what variety of sugar pea you're planting.

, You don't want to risk hurting the peas' roots by using a hoe or digging too deeply.

, Aim the water at the soil, not the leaves, to prevent any fungal infections from forming and spreading.


Wait until the top 3 inches (7.62 cm) of soil have dried before watering again. Too much water can cause the roots to rot and inhibits the growth of the plant.
You may notice that the sugar peas need more water right when they begin to produce flowers. It's okay to increase the amount you water at this point to encourage healthy fruit production.

, This locks in moisture and protects the plants from heat as the weather warms up.

, The seeds inside the pod will still be flat and not rounded like garden peas.


Pods are usually ready to pick 1 week after the pea plant has produced flowers.
Once the snow pea plant has begun to produce pods, pick them at least every other day for the best taste and texture. Pods left on the plant too long become stringy. Remove pods regularly to encourage the plant to produce more blossoms and pods.
If you do miss a pod or two and the seeds inside become large, use them as you would garden peas. Don't eat the outer pod on overly mature snow peas, as it will be stringy and tough.

Choose the right type of seed for your growing zone.,
Plan on starting the onion seeds indoors, 8 to 10 weeks before the last frost date.,
Fill a shallow container with a dampened seed starting mix.,
Plant the seeds according to the label on your seed packet.,
Keep the seeds warm and damp until they sprout.,
Limit the humidity and warmth once the seedlings sprout.,
Harden the seedlings for 4 weeks before you transplant them outside.,
Wait until the seedlings are at least 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) tall.This will ensure that the young plants are strong enough to tolerate the outdoor environment.

,
Prepare some well-draining, phosphorous-rich soil in a spot that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight.,
Plant the seedlings at least 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) apart.,
Water the seedlings.,
Water the onions frequently, and never let them dry out.,
Pull the soil away from the bulbs to expose the tops as they mature.,
Harvest the bulbs.,
Trim the leaves down to 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters).If you plan on braiding the onions into a rope, like garlic, you can leave the leaves longer.

,
Pull the bulbs out of the ground.,
Cure the onions out of direct sunlight, someplace that is warm, dry, and has good air circulation.,
Store the cured onions someplace dry and cool with good air circulation.",How to Grow Onions from Seed," There are three different categories of onions: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral. These categories are based on what plant hardiness and growing zone you live in. If you choose the wrong type of onion for your area, you may not get a very successful crop.If You live in Zone 7 and warmer, choose short-day onions, such as Red Burgundy, Red Creole, and Vidalia.
If you live in Zone 6 and colder, choose long-day onions, such as: Alisa Craig, Copra, and White Sweet Spanish.(14-16 hours).
You can grow day-neutral onions, such as Cabernet and Candy, in any growing zone (12-14 hours).
There are online tools you can use to help you figure out your zone. Check a plant hardiness zone map to know your area.;
, This will give the seedlings a head start. It will allow them to germinate into healthy seedlings before you transplant them outside.

, The container should be about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) deep, and have some drainage holes. It can be any shape or size you want.

, If you don't have the seed packet anymore, begin by sprinkling the seeds over the damp soil. Mist them lightly with water, and then cover them with a 1/8 inch (0.32 centimeters) thick layer of seed mix. Gently pat the soil with your hand when you are done.

, Cover the seeds with a humidity dome, or cover the seeds in starting mix and plastic. Keep them someplace warm, about 70 to 75°F (21 to 24°C). If it is too cold where you live, place the containers on a heat mat. Expect to see the seedlings emerge after 7 to 10 days., Take off the humidity dome or plastic cover and move the seeds to a cooler spot. Keep the soil moist, and remember to fertilize it. The best type of fertilizer is diluted fish emulsion or compost tea.

, Start hardening them 4 weeks before the last frost date. During this time, slowly introduce the seedlings to the outside. Start by placing them outside in a sheltered spot for several hours, then bringing them back inside for the rest of the day. Increase outdoor exposure little by little every day until you are able to leave them outside overnight.


The hardening process will help the seedlings get used to colder temperatures, decreased sun, and less watering.
Transplanting the seedlings outside right away will send the seedlings into shock and could possibly kill them.

,, Spread a 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) thick layer of 5-10-5 fertilizer over the soil. Mix the fertilizer into the soil to a depth of about 8 inches (20.32 centimeters).Make sure that the soil is soft, and free of clots.


If you can, try adding some organic material into the soil, such as rotted manure or compost intended for gardening.If you can't get 5-10-5 fertilizer, try to find something that is high in phosphorus.

, Refer to the packaging that the seeds came in; this will tell you how far apart the seeds should be spaced. If you lost the packaging, space the seedlings 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) apart.Use a fork to loosen a hole in the dirt, place the seedling into the hole, and then push the dirt back.

, Once you have transplanted the seedlings, give them enough water to dampen the soil.

, Consider adding some nitrogen to the water to keep the onions healthy. You only need to do this until mid-July, however., The leaves are not the only part of the onion that will stick out of the soil; the bulbs will too. If the bulbs are not developing out of the ground, you may want to brush some of the soil away from them, so that only the roots and the bottom part of the bulb are in the soil. This will help the bulbs dry faster., Begin harvesting when the bulbs are 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) in diameter. Bend the plants to the ground to avoid top rotting of the bulbs (pink neck). Give the bulbs 5 to 6 days to dry and turn brown.


This will speed up the process of drying the bulbs, as well.

,, Once the outer layer of the onion bulb's skin has dried, it's ready to harvest. Place the bulbs in a container, such as a box, bag, or wheel barrow to store the onions you have harvested. Make sure the container is warm,, Spread the bulbs out on a screen to provide ample circulation. Let them cure in a shed or garage. A porch that doesn't get a lot of sunlight will also work.


If you cure the onions in direct sunlight, the skins will soften and invite bacteria. If you cure them someplace damp and humid, they may start to rot.

, If you are not braiding your onions together and hanging them up, you will need to store them properly in a bag or box. You can store them however you want, as long as they are kept cool and dry. Good air circulation is a must. Here's a few popular ways to store onions.Store the onions in an onion bag, and hang the bag up.
Store the onions in a shallow box. Use newspaper to keep the bulbs separate.
Store the onions in nylon stockings. Tie a knot in the stocking between each bulb. Hang the stocking up. When you want to get an onion, simply cut below or above a knot.

Select a plant from which to take your cuttings.,
Prepare the container for the new plant.,
Select and cut off a stem.,
Use a razor blade to cut the lowest node in half.,
Remove all but 2 of the new plant's leaves.,
Set your cutting into its soil.,
Cover the container with a plastic bag.,
Monitor the growth of your cuttings.",How to Take Cuttings," This ""mother plant"" should be relatively large, so that removing a few stems will not kill the plant. The plant should also be healthy, as any afflictions plaguing the mother plant will affect the new plant.;
, Fill a small pot or other container with either potting soil or a soil-less potting mix. Potting mix, a mixture of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite, will generally yield better results for potted plants because of its superior drainage. In a pinch, you could also use soil from your garden outside. Regardless of your soil choice, water the mix until it is moist, but not soaked.

, When selecting a stem, you should look for young, green growth. Young stems will always root better than more mature, woodier stems. Select a piece of stem with a few leaves on it, and cut just below a node (the joint where a leaf meets the stem) with a sharp pair of scissors. As an added precaution against contamination, it is a good idea to wash the scissors beforehand with soap and water. You could also sterilize them with rubbing alcohol.

, Plants send out new roots from nodes, so by exposing some of the node's interior, you increase the chances of your new plant sending out a root from that node. Again, it is a good idea to wash or sterilize the razor blade.

, While the new plant needs leaves to provide energy through photosynthesis, too many leaves will compete with the plant's efforts to send out new roots. Leaving only 2 leaves is a good option.

, Use your fingers to work the cutting down into the soil or potting mix a bit, making sure to completely bury the exposed node. Ensure that the leaves are not buried, and that the plant is stable enough to stand upright. You can plant several cuttings in a single container if desired; you can always transplant them later.

, Place the pot with your cuttings into a large, clear plastic bag and place the bag in a sunny window. The bag will act as a greenhouse by sealing in humidity. Make sure to leave the bag partially open to allow air to flow.

, If any of them start to look unhealthy, cull them from the container. Once the cuttings have developed strong roots, you can transplant them to new containers.

How many seedlings do you want to grow? Use this amount to determine how many rolls you'll need.
Where will you place the seedling starters? Choose a suitable spot unlikely to be in the way of everyday things and that is warm.
What are the requirements of the seeds that you would like to plant? Think about germination temperature, light and humidity. If you're not sure, use a gardener's guide which has information about the particular plant you wish to grow.;
, You'll need empty toilet or paper towel cardboard rolls, the amount being determined by the amount of seedlings you're going to grow. You'll also need the items listed under Things You'll Need below.

, Cut the toilet rolls into rings roughly 4cm wide.

, Do not compress the paper too much.

,, Tear the top layers of toilet paper in the ring and place a seed in the tear and close the tear over the seed.

,,, The toilet paper and cardboard will suck up most of the water. Slowly tilt the plate to ensure even wetting of all seedling starters.

, Puff up the plastic bag to make room for the seedlings and tie the bag lightly to keep the air and moisture inside.

,, You don't want to miss the sprouts popping up!

, Plant the seedlings into potting soil or straight into the garden by placing the biodegradable seed starter directly into the soil.  Mix a small amount of liquid plant food with the water and add it to the plate if you are not planting the seedling out directly after germination.

Replant into larger pots, if you plan to keep them inside for several weeks longer.",How to Start Seeds Indoors,"


Visit the National Climate Data Center website to find the frost data in your area.;
,, Read the packets carefully. Seed starting times and germination rates vary greatly.

, Plan to plant seeds with similar growing schedules near each other.


For example, corn and beans can be planted earlier than flowers. Squash do not take transplantation well, so they can be started later and planted before root systems begin to develop.

, These small plastic trays hold a few inches of dirt. They are easy to care for, but dry out quickly.

, Cut holes in the bottom of each container for drainage.

, Seeds do not do very well in heavy soil or potting mix, so make sure your soil is specially chosen for this task.

, Moisten it with warm water. Fill each container with 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of soil.

, You will be able to use this to soak water into the soil from below.

, You can increase germination with a light soaking. Do not do this if it is not recommended by the seed packet.

, Not all your seeds will germinate, and you can remove plants later in case of crowding.

, The depth will depend upon the plant, so read the seed packages.


Plants that are placed inside soil are usually planted at a depth of 3 times the diameter of the seed.
Other plants need full sunlight immediately, and they should be placed on top of the soil.

, Keep seed packets nearby.

,, You are creating a greenhouse environment.

,,, You will need to move it up as they grow.

, Keep them on for 12 to 16 hours a day.

, To add warmth, place a wet/dry heating pad under the baking sheet and keep it at a low heat.

, The soil will suck up the moisture without displacing the seeds. Keep water in the baking sheet at all times.

,, Never allow the soil to get dry. Seeds need to remain moist at all times or they will not germinate.

,, You may need to pull up several starts, if they are crowding each other.

, Your starts can grow bigger and more hardy until they are ready to plant in the garden.

, You can get the best dampness by fully dipping the towel in water, then ring it out completely, being careful not to tear the fragile towel. Once most of the water is out, carefully open the towel all the way, taking care to prevent tears. Lay the towel on a flat surface.

, Place seeds on a center of the paper towel. You can add more or less, depending on the size of your planting area. Just keep the seeds towards the middle of the towel.

, To make sure the seeds stay in place and do not slip out of the paper towel, fold the towel in half once and then fold it in thirds, keeping the seeds in the center panel of the tri-fold.

, You can mark the plastic baggie with the seed name, date, and the estimated length of time the seeds will take to germinate (DTG). You can choose whether or not that would be useful for you. Then, carefully place damp paper towel with seeds into the plastic baggie.

, This is fairly easy to do in any regular house with central heat. If your circumstances are different, you can put the baggie on top of something that stays at a regular comfortably warm temperature. Make sure it's not hot! Some people choose the top of a refrigerator or even on top of a heating pad on the lowest setting.

, Check your seeds daily to make sure they keep damp. If they dry out, just add a tiny bit more water to your bag.

, If you are good at scheduling your time and will remember to check your seeds at the approximate date of germination, then you can come back around germination time. A daily checking may be needed.

, Your seeds have sprouted! Now you can plant in your desired growing pot or plot.

, Seeds require plenty of light, so the seedbed should be placed in an area with the most consistent light and the fewest shadows.

, If these are big risks in your yard, consider purchasing or making a small plastic hoop house in which the seeds can be protected.

, The tuber roots and the weeds can crowd out the seedlings.

, Break up the soil with a rake. Allow sticky, soaked soil to dry out before.

, Add compost, if it is sandy or it has low nutrient value. Add store-bought sandy soil if there is so much organic matter in your soil that it sticks together.


Aim for a consistency of breadcrumbs in your final soil mix., Pick out weeds and debris. Pace the soil mix in a garden sieve with one-quarter inch (0.6cm) holes through which you can shake the soil., Spread it onto the area until it is level. Use the back of a garden rake to level and pat it down lightly.

, Try sprinkling it first to break the surface tension. Then, water more deeply.

, Flies are attracted to fresh soil and they will disappear during this time. Weed the area if weeds germinate during this process.

Growing an Aloe Vera plant from an ""offset"" is more effective.,, Try to cut at a downward angle, towards the stem. The knife must be very clean, or you risk infecting the leaf.








, This can take as little a few days to as long as two weeks.This film will help keep the cut part from getting infected by the soil.An infected Aloe Vera leaf won't survive for very long.








, Like most plants, Aloe Vera likes water, but it hates to sit in it. If your pot does not have a drain hole, the soil will stay soaking wet. This can lead to root rot, which can kill a plant—including the hardy Aloe Vera.








, If you don't have any cactus soil, you can mix your own by mixing one part sand and one part potting soil.








Consider filling the bottom of your pot with gravel first. This will help the pot drain even more.
The pH level should be 6.0 to 8.0. If the pH is not high enough, add some gardening lime. You can buy it from a garden shop.

, Make sure that about one-third of the leaf is in the soil.









Consider dipping the cut base in some sort of root hormone first. If you don't have any on hand, ground cinnamon or honey will work as well. Both will kill any bacteria., For the first four weeks of so, you will want to keep the soil moist. Once the leaf is done transplanting, wait until the soil is completely dry before you water it again. To learn how to further care for your Aloe Vera, click here.

Pat the soil around the plant, and water it.,
Place the plant in a sunny spot and wait one week before you water it again.",How to Grow an Aloe Plant With Just an Aloe Leaf2," Offsets, also known as ""pups"" are part of the main plant. They are usually smaller and brighter in color. They will also have their own set of roots. Search for them along the base. Here are some things you should look for when selecting an offset to cut:









The offset should be one-fifth the size of the main plant.
Choose an offset that has at least four leaves, and is several inches tall.

, This will make it easier to find where the offshoot joins the main plant. You may have to brush the soil away from the roots to see the offshoot better. It may be attached to the main plant, but it should have its own set of roots.








, The offshoot may come away easily. If it doesn't, you will need to cut it using a sharp, clean knife. Let the wound scab over for a few days before you move on. This will prevent any infections.








The offshoot must have some roots attached to it.Once you have pried the offshoot away from the main plant, you can put the larger plant back into its pot.

, This is very important. Like most plants, Aloe Vera likes water, but it hates sitting in it. If your pot does not have a drain hole, the soil will become waterlogged. This can lead to root rot, which can kill your Aloe Vera.








, If you don't have any cactus soil, mix one part sand with one part soil.









Consider filling the bottom of your pot with gravel first. This will help the pot drain even more.
The pH level should be 6.0 to 8.0. If the pH is not high enough, add some gardening lime. You can buy it from a gardening shop.

, The hole should be deep enough to fit the roots as well as one-fourth of the plant (from where the roots end, and upwards). Many expert gardeners recommend that you dip the roots in root growth hormone first, to help the roots grow faster.







, Water the plant enough so that the soil is damp, but not soaking. Aloe Vera is a desert plant, so it really does not need much water.








, After this, you can water your Aloe Vera like your normally would.To learn how to further care for your Aloe Vera, click here.

Make sure that your plant gets plenty of bright sunlight.,
Wait until the soil is completely dry before you water it again.,
Fertilize once a year during spring.,
Watch out for bugs, disease, and fungus.,
Watch the leaves.,
Know what to do if your plant grows too slowly.",How to Grow an Aloe Plant With Just an Aloe Leaf3," Ideally, Aloe Vera should get 8 to 10 hours of sunlight each day. You can get this by placing it in a south or west-facing window. If necessary, move the plant from window to window throughout the day.








If it is cold where you live, move the plant away from the windows at night. These areas tend to get very cold, which can kill your plant., When you do water the plant, make sure that the soil is completely soaked through. Also, make sure that the water is draining freely from the pot.Do not over-water your plant.









Aloe Vera tends to go dormant during the winter months. It won't need as much water.Aloe Vera will need more water during the summer months, especially when it is hot and dry.

, The fertilizer should be water-based, and heavy in phosphorus. Prepare the mix at half strength.







, Use a natural, organic pesticide to keep pests, such as mealy bugs and scale, at bay. You can avoid fungus easily simply by keeping the soil dry.







, They are great indicators of health, and what your Aloe Vera needs.









Aloe vera leaves should be plump and straight. If you notice the leaves becoming thin and curly, give your Aloe Vera more water.
Aloe Vera leaves should grow straight up. If the leaves droop, the plant needs more sun.

, Sometimes, Aloe Vera does not grow well. Fortunately, it is easy to figure out what is wrong. It is even easier to fix these common problems.








The soil is too damp. Water the plant less often.
The plant needs more sunlight. Move it to a sunnier spot.
You added too much fertilizer. Move the plant to a new pot and add more soil.
The soil might be too alkaline. Add some soil sulfur.
The plant doesn't have enough room for its roots. Move it to a bigger pot.

Cut a “budstick” from its source.,
Carve a “bud shield” for grafting.,
Make a T-cut in the new plant.,
Create a pocket.,
Trim the bud shield if needed.,
Graft the bud shield to the root stock.",How to Do Budding in Plants1," Search for fully matured buds growing along the original plant (often called a “scion” in budding). Prioritize branches that are still actively growing well away from the plant’s stem, on the outside of the scion’s canopy. Look for buds that appear fat and healthy where leaf stems grow from the branch. Cut the branch from the scion and then snip away any leaves from the branch. This is now your “budstick.”When cutting away the leaves, make your cut at the base of the blades so that the stem is still attached to the branch.
Matured buds of one species of plant may look considerably different from another. Search online for images and descriptions for the particular plant that you are budding.;
, Hold the bud stick so that the leaf stem is pointing away from you. Use a sharpened knife to begin your cut roughly a half-inch below the stem’s base. Slice into the bud stick toward the leaf stem. Curve your blade into the wood and then outward, in a crescent-moon motion, so that it comes out a half-inch above the stem. You should now have a small shaving of wood to graft into a new plant, the bud itself, and the leaf stem to use as a handle, all in one piece (this piece is called a “bud shield”).To make sure the bud doesn’t go flying, remove the blade from the budstick just before it breaks the surface on its way out. From the outside, slice a cut a half-inch above the stem, as though crossing a “T” along the top of your original cut.
These cuts should be as smooth as possible. Rough sawing actions with your knife will prevent the wood from successfully grafting with the new plant.

, Choose a smooth spot on the stem of the new plant (called a “root stock”) to graft your bud to. Make the vertical cut first, from top to bottom, along the stem. Keep it to the same size as the length of your bud shield. Then make a horizontal cut along the top to form your “T.”Alternately, you can make your horizontal cut along the bottom of the vertical cut. This will allow excess water or sap to drain from the root stock more efficiently.

, Peel the bark away from your T-cut. Start from the inside corners where the vertical and horizontal cuts meet. Peel outward until a triangle of the plant’s tissue is exposed. Stop here, without tearing the peeled bark off the stem.If the bark resists peeling, this may be a sign that the root stock has not fully recovered from its winter dormancy. Wait until its dormant cycle is completely over before grafting. Usually this is during the height of summer., Hold the bud shield by its leaf stem. Line it up with the vertical cut in the root stock. Place the bud shield’s wood shaving against the root stock’s exposed tissue. If the top of the wood shaving is higher than the root stock’s horizontal cut, cut off the extra wood so that it doesn’t stick out., Once the bud shield lines up perfectly with the root stock’s vertical cut, line the two up. Smooth the two flaps of peeled bark over the bud shield to cover it. Wind grafting tape around and around the root stock to seal the graft, leaving only the bud shield’s leaf stem and bud exposed. Let the plant heal for two to three weeks, then remove the grafting tape. Trim the root stock above the bud shield to motivate growth from the scion budIf it is too late in the season to expect growth immediately, wait until winter to trim the top of the root stock.
Budding rubbers, which break down naturally, can be used instead of grafting tape.

Leave them for 40–120 days, checking every week or two.,
Plant the seeds.",How to Germinate Maple Tree Seeds1," Sugar maples, bigleaf maples, boxelder maples, Japanese maples, Norway maples, and some red maples lie dormant over the winter, then germinate as soon as temperatures warm. The cold stratification approach produces very high germination rates in these species.All of these species drop their seeds in autumn or early winter. If your red maple trees drop their seeds in spring or early summer, see germinating in the soil instead.
If you're going to plant the seeds outdoors, start this method 90–120 days before the last winter frost.;
, Place a handful of peat moss, vermiculite , or germination paper in a small, plastic, zip-locked bag.For best results, use sterile material and handle it with disposable gloves to avoid introducing fungus.


Tiny ""snack sized"" bags work best. Larger bags trap more air with the seeds, which can lead to fungal problems.Red maple seeds are unusually sensitive to acidity.For this species, choose vermiculite (a neutral or basic substance) rather than peat moss (acidic)., Add a couple drops of water to the growing material to dampen the material slightly. If you see standing water, or if you can squeeze out water from the material, it is too wet.

, Fungicide can prevent mold from destroying your seeds, but it is not always necessary, and may damage the plant if overused. Add only in tiny quantities, following manufacturer's instructions.


Some growers rinse the seeds in very diluted bleach solutions instead.

, Place up to 20 or 30 seeds in each bag. Starting from the base, roll the bag to expel most of the air. Zip it closed., Now it's time to ""stratify"" the seeds, or expose them to temperatures that trigger germination. For most species, the ideal temperature is usually around 1–5ºC (33.8–41ºF).The crisper drawer of a refrigerator is usually about this temperature.Ideally, use a thermometer to confirm the correct temperature. Some seeds may fail to germinate if the temperature is just a couple degrees off.
If possible, keep boxelder and Norway maple seeds at exactly 5ºC (41ºF), and red maple seeds at exactly 3ºC (37.4ºF).Other species are not as picky.

, Most of these species take 90–120 days to germinate, but the bigleaf maple and a few others can sprout in as few as 40.Every week or two, check on the bag and make adjustments as needed:


If you notice condensation, pick up the bag and gently tap it to knock the water droplets off. Lay the bag back down on the opposite side, so the wet seeds have a chance to dry off.If the growing material has dried out, add a drop or two of water.
If you notice any mold or black spots, remove that seed and throw it away. (If the whole batch is molding, try a little fungicide.)
If the seeds have begun to sprout, remove them from the refrigerator.

, Once the seeds have germinated, plant them 0.6–1.2cm (¼–½ inch) under moist soil.Most maples do well in partial shade, but look up the exact species if possible for more info on planting.


To increase the odds of survival, start the seedlings in an indoor seed tray instead. Fill the tray with 7.6–10 cm (3–4 inches) of well draining seed starter, or an even mix of peat moss, rotted compost, vermiculite and coarse sand. Water whenever the soil becomes completely dry. Transfer to planter pots once the second set of leaves appear."

Label the container so as not to forget what you are growing.,
Place where there will be some heat.,
Monitor daily.,
Plant in whatever medium you'd like.",How to Germinate Seeds Guaranteed Without Soil or Medium for Garden or Hydroponics," The only consideration here will be temperature. Many seeds, especially smaller ones, will need higher temperatures. So if you can't provide the heat necessary for that seed, you might not be successful in the germination.;
, Make sure to get the seeds to stick to the sponge so they get moist. Paper towels work best because you can see through them to monitor growth.

, It's best to make it possible to see the seeds inside without opening it so you don't have to spend extra time each day opening this up.

, A smaller bag/container is better really, so the moisture stays on the seeds and seed retrieval will be less difficult.

, Consider labeling with the exact type of the plant and not just ""tomato"". If you end up with a fruit you don't like the taste of, you will want to know which type it was.

, Direct sun can be used, but only if the seeds are covered. Sun will cause the seed to act like it's not in the ground and stop it from growing. Left too long like this and the seeds could die. You can wrap them inside the towel to simulate being in the ground. You can use indirect sunlight or some other heat source. Best to place them indoors as this will keep them at a moderate temperature (not too hot or cold) at all times. Note: seeds don't need sun, just heat and water. Their plants need sun. So, placing them on a heater or some warm source is okay too, but creating a fire hazard should be avoided at all cost.

, The best thing to do is put them somewhere you will see them regularly. You must take them out of the bag/container soon after they sprout or they may die off.

, Since these seeds are just babies they will adapt to just about anything as long as it's not too harsh. Don't forget to do research if you plan to do hydroponics. Wicking gardens are about the same as regular dirt gardening, but there is some caution as these may contain too much water for the plant.

Start with good seeds.,
Plan to start them at the right time.,
Get the right growing medium.,
Choose a seed container.",How to Germinate Seeds1," They should be less than two years old, from a reputable source, and suitable for your growing region. You'll have better luck with seeds that came from plants local to your area - they'll like the environment, soil, and other conditions you can provide. Buy your seeds at a local nursery, a farmer's market, or an online vendor that sells seeds for different growing regions.Try checking to see if there is a seed swap in your area. You can meet other gardeners, get seeds, and get tips for germinating specific types of seeds in your area.;
, Some seeds need to germinate indoors several weeks before the weather gets warm, while others need only a few days' time. The time you need to start your seeds also differs by growing region. Getting the timing right is important if you want to give your seeds the best chance to grow into strong, healthy plants.


Check the back of the packet your seeds came in for instructions on when they should be started. Seed packets come with a lot of vital information.
You can also look online for more info about when to start your seeds.
If you're still not sure when to start your seeds, plant to start them a few weeks before the last frost of the season. You can start growing them indoors and let them sprout a few inches high before transplanting them outside. This is a safe bet for many types of plants.

, Seeds need to germinate in a growing medium that's usually different from standard potting soil or dirt. They require a certain soil texture to germinate, and it's different for different seeds. Research the needs of the seeds you're growing and get the appropriate growing medium from a nursery or online vendor.


You can buy a soilless growing medium that's premixed, and it works for many types of seeds.It's cheap to make your own growing medium from vermiculite, perlite, and milled sphagnum moss, all available at garden stores. A ration of 1:1:1 is usually effective.
Don't try to plant seeds in regular soil. Seeds already contain all the nutrients they need to germinate within them. The extra nutrients in regular potting soil are detrimental during the germination period.

, You'll need a container that's 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) deep with drainage holes in the bottom. It can be shaped like an open tray or have individual segments for different seeds. The width of your container depends on how many seeds you're planting; make sure you allow plenty of space for the seeds to germinate.


You can buy a seed pallet or tray, but it's just as easy to make your own out of an old egg carton, newspaper, a wooden box, or other household supplies.
When the seeds germinate and sprout, the seedlings will need to be moved to larger containers or planted in the ground. For this reason the aesthetics of the seed germination containers aren't as important as their utility.

Keep an eye on the nighttime temperatures in your area as you transplant seedlings outdoors.
Some plants, such as onions, can handle freezing temperatures after you harden off seedlings. Other plants, such as tomatoes, will suffer if the temperature goes below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 degrees Celsius).
Members of the cabbage family can handle cold temperatures but are more likely to bolt, or produce flowers and seeds, if the temperature remains cool for longer than a week. Don't let cabbages sit out in temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 Celsius).
Place the seedlings near a wall of your house in the evenings at first, so they will benefit from the warmth of the house. The walls will protect the seedlings from wind.

Prepare the cutting.,
Insert the cutting into sand and peat in the pot.,
Place both the pot and the cutting into the bag.,
Tie the top of the bag with a twist tie.",How to Propagate Your Plants2," You might want to use a normal-sized flowerpot for one plant or you can even establish several cuttings in the same pot, planted apart from each other. Seedling tubes are also a good idea for many plants.

, Get a plastic (polythene bag) and place gravel at the base of the bag. The pot will be placed in here after you have made the cutting. Fill the pot with suitable soil - sand and peat for drainage make an ideal combination for many plants. Finally, the pot must be able to drain well (the water will go onto the gravel, rather than pooling in the plastic bag).

, Cut it off just below a leaf or joint (node).

, Once you have cut the plant piece, strip or cut off any leaves on the lower half. You can strip or cut off as high as two-thirds if necessary. If the bark looks like it will tear, use scissors. You can also make a small incision to the lower end of the stem to encourage root growth from this ""wound"".

, Use a skewer, pencil, or similar long object to create a hole for the cutting to sit in. Do not use the cutting itself to push in a hole or you will damage it. The idea is to gently drop the cutting into the hole and carefully in-fill with dirt.

, Make sure the pot is sitting snugly on the gravel.

, This makes it easy to undo for watering and to place back on again.

Keep the soil moist.,
Pull the cutting or divided plant gently in about 6 - 8 weeks.,
Transplant to a larger pot or the garden when the seedling is well-established.

",How to Propagate Your Plants3," Do not soak or over-water the cutting or divided plant or it may rot and not take root. Water spray works well for many plants but take care with succulent and furry leaves. They are best only watered directly at the soil level, otherwise the combination of humidity and water may encourage fungal growth.

, If you can feel resistance, you'll know there are roots. Most plants will root within 6 - 8 weeks, although some species of plants can take up to 12 months! Do your homework on the plant if you are not sure. Most common garden variety plants will root quickly.

Use sexual propagation for increasing plant numbers by germinating seed and growing the seedlings to maturity.,
Use asexual propagation for processes that involve using the leaf, stem, and root cuttings.",How to Propagate Your Plants4," This is probably the most widely used method by the majority of growers, including many agricultural grain crops.


There are many ways to pre-treat seed for attempting germination in the artificial setting of a greenhouse. These are processes used in an effort to overcome seed dormancy and reach successful germination on a human driven schedule. Mother Nature does a wonderful job of overcoming dormancy so seed will germinate at the safest time for the seedlings to emerge into a growth friendly environment. We try to imitate those processes to grow plants indoors successfully.

, All of these asexual methods develop plants that are essentially clones of the original specimens. Putting slips into a jar of water in the kitchen window until roots form are stem cuttings. This method as a high risk of mold developing.


Divide clumps of plants, such as Hostas, when they get very large is another form of asexual propagation.
Plant bits of a rhizome root will cause new plant growth and is another form of cutting. The practice of grafting which is often used with roses and fruit trees is a type of asexual propagation.
Use layering with raspberry canes where they are bent over to the ground and covered with soil where new roots will develop.

Look for buds that appear fat and healthy in the crooks where leaf stems grow from the branches. Cut the branch from the original plant (or ""scion"") and then snip the leaf blades from their stem. The cut branch is now your ""budstick.""Do not cut the leaf stem from the branch. This way you will be able to hold your eventual ""chip"" without disturbing the bud itself.
Matured buds of one species of plant may look considerably different from another. Search online for images and descriptions for the particular plant that you are budding.

, Position your blade horizontally along the budstick, about a half-inch below the bud and leaf stem. Slice downward into the budstick at an angle of roughly 50 degrees. Make your cut an eighth of an inch deep. Perform your second cut by placing your knife about three-quarters of an inch above your first cut, with the bud and leaf stem between the two. Position it horizontally along the branch. Slice downward into the wood, angling the blade so that it connects with your first cut. Once the cut is made, pluck the chip out of the scion by its leaf stem.You may need to vary the depth and length between the two cuts according to the size of your plant and its buds.

, Choose a smooth area on the stem of the plant receiving the transplant (called a ""root stock""). Perform the same cutting technique here to create a pocket to receive your chip. Try to make it as identical as possible in size and shape to your chip so that one fits into the other perfectly.Because you do not need to peel live bark to make your pocket, this technique can be used before and after summer, unlike T-budding.

, Insert the chip into the root stock’s pocket. Wind grafting tape around the graft. Cover the bud and stem as well as the whole graft. Seal it tightly to prevent loss of moisture, which is a greater risk with chip budding than it is with T-budding.Let the plant heal for two to three weeks, then remove the grafting tape. Trim the root stock above the chip to motivate growth from the scion bud.If the chip is smaller than the pocket, line up as many sides of the chips as possible with the corresponding edges of the pocket.
If it is too late in the season to expect growth immediately, wait until winter to trim the top of the root stock.

Cut a budstick from a scion plant.,
Cut out your patches.,
Graft and wrap your patch.",How to Do Budding in Plants3," Look along branches that are actively growing on the outside of the original plant’s canopy. Search for fully matured buds where the leaf stems meet the branches. Cut the branch from the original plant (called a ""scion""). Then cut the leaves from the very top of their stems. What you have left is a ""budstick.""Snipping the leaf's blades away and leaving the stem creates a handle to hold your eventual “patch.”
Matured buds of one species of plant may look considerably different from another. Search online for images and descriptions for the particular plant that you are budding.

, First, make a horizontal slice along the budstick, about a half-inch above the bud and leaf stem. Then make a second, parallel slice of equal length about a half-inch below the bud. Perform a third, vertical slice from the end of one horizontal cut to the corresponding end of the other. Then make a second vertical slice to connect the other two ends of the horizontal lines. Now carefully peel the rectangle of bark from the branch.Next, find a smooth stretch along the stem of the ""root stock"" (the plant that will receive the scion patch). Use the same cutting technique to remove a rectangular patch of equal size.

, Place the scion patch into the root stock’s open patch. Line the sides of each one up so they are flush.Wind grafting tape around the patch to seal it, leaving the bud and leaf stem exposed, or use budding rubber to secure the patches. Let the plant heal for two to three weeks. If you used grafting tape, remove it, since it doesn’t break down naturally like budding rubbers do. Trim the root stock above the patch to motivate growth from the scion bud.If it is too late in the season to expect growth immediately, wait until winter to trim the top of the root stock.

Follow this approach for mountain and Asian species.,
Treat the outer hull.,
Store in a warm room.,
Cold stratify for 90–180 days.,
Plant the seeds.",How to Germinate Maple Tree Seeds2," Vine maple, striped maple, Amur maple, and paperbark maple are all tough to germinate, and require extra attention. This applies to most other species native to Asia, as well as mountain maples and rocky mountain maples.All of the seeds in this category drop in autumn or winter. Left alone in the soil, they can take years to germinate.

, Many of these species have an extremely hard hull (pericarp). Growers often ""scarify"" the hull to greatly improve germination rates. You may use any of these methods:


Rub the base of the seed (opposite the wing) against a nail file or sandpaper. Stop as soon as you break through the hull, barely nicking the seed coat underneath.Soak the seeds in household strength hydrogen peroxide for several hours, then rinse well.Soak the seeds in warm water for 24 hours., The US Forest Service recommends keeping the seeds at 20–30ºC (68–86ºF) for 30–60 days.These seeds have not been studied as thoroughly as those of other species, so exact guidelines for each species are not available.

, Transfer the seeds to a plastic, zip-locked bag in the refrigerator, with a small handful of peat moss or other growing material. Check back every couple weeks to look for signs of mold, drying, or sprouting. Rocky mountain seeds (Acer glabrum) usually take the full 180 days to germinate. Other species can take as few as 90, but they are unpredictable.For more information, see the cold stratification method above.
Don't expect every seed to sprout. Germination rates as low as 20% are common for these species.

, You may start the germinated seeds on an indoor seedling tray, or plant them outside if the last frost has passed. Plant them 0.6 to 2.5cm (¼ to 1 inch) beneath the soil surface. Water occasionally but deeply, not letting the soil stay dry for long.


For more specific information, look up your exact maple species.

Collect seeds in late spring or early summer.,
Plant immediately.,
Plant on moist ground.,
Plant in sun or partial shade.,
Leave bare seedbeds undisturbed (optional).",How to Germinate Maple Tree Seeds3," Silver maples and some red maples (but not Japanese red maples) will drop their seeds early in the growing season. These species do not go dormant, and there is no need for any special treatments.Some red maple trees will not drop seeds until autumn or winter; these require cold stratification. Even the groves that drop seeds early usually have alternate years of good and bad seed production., Seeds of this type will die if they dry out in storage. Plant shortly after you collect them. They should germinate quickly., Place the seeds on moist ground with plenty of leaf litter and other organic material.As long as the soil doesn't dry out, the seeds will require no maintenance.

, Silver maples grow poorly in shade.Red maples can handle shade for 3–5 years, but may have trouble growing if they remain under the canopy past that point., If some of the seeds fail to germinate, they will often sprout the following year. These are usually a minority of the seeds, but if you haven't had much success it could be worth leaving the area untended for a second season.


If very few of the seeds germinate, and the climate has been fairly typical, the seeds most likely died in storage. Plant a new batch next year rather than waiting.

Get the containers ready.,
Determine whether to soak the seeds.,
Sow the seeds.,
Put the seed containers in the right environment.,
Keep the growing medium moist.",How to Germinate Seeds2," Line your seed containers with your seed growing medium. Fill the containers to within half an inch of the rim, rather than all the way to the top. Sprinkle water over the growing medium to moisten the growing medium all the way to the bottom. Don't douse it in water; it should just be slightly wet to provide a good environment for the seeds.








, Some seeds need to be soaked for a few hours before planting, while others can go straight into the growing medium without soaking. Determine whether the seeds you have need any type of pre-processing before they get planted. Look on the seed packet or check online.









To soak seeds, place them in a clean container and cover them with room temperature water. Let them sit for between 3 and 24 hours. Strain them and pat them dry with a paper towel.
If you soak your seeds, plan to plant them directly afterward. Don't let them dry out again first.

, Scatter seeds evenly over the growing medium and use your fingers to lightly press them in. Cover the seeds with a layer of growing medium about three times the thickness of the seeds. Moisten the growing medium again once the seeds are sown.









Don't sow too many seeds together; make sure not to overcrowd them. Check the seed packet for each type of seed you are planting to get specific recommendations for spacing the seeds.
Some seeds need to be planted deeper in the growing medium, and others shouldn't be covered at all. Most seeds are fine with a light covering of growing medium as described above, but you should check to make sure the seeds you have don't need special treatment.

, Most seeds don't need sunlight to germinate, but some do, so you'll need to check to make sure you give your seeds the proper conditions. Placing the seeds in a room with a temperature between 60 and 80 degrees F is a safe bet, but again, some seeds need special treatment and require very cold or hot temperatures to do well.









You can use a heat mat under the seed tray to regulate the temperature and keep things on the warmer side during the germination period.Once the seedlings sprout, keep them in an area with a temperature above 70 °F (21 °C) until they're ready to be transplanted outside., Cover the trays lightly with a sheet of plastic wrap to keep the moisture in and regulate the temperature. Lift the plastic wrap each day to lightly water the seeds. Make sure they never get the chance to dry out, or they won't germinate properly.









Do not overwater the seeds. If they get waterlogged they won't grow.

, If you covered your seedlings with a sheet of plastic wrap or newspaper, remove it and keep the seedlings moist with a couple of waterings a day. Water in the morning and early afternoon, but avoid watering later in the day. If water sits on the growing medium all night long it might facilitate the growth of mold.








, Since the growing medium doesn't contain nutrients, you'll need to fertilize the seedlings with plant food after they've gotten a few inches tall. Find out what type of plant food is appropriate for the seedlings you're growing. Use organic fertilizer if at all possible.








, If a lot of the seeds germinate and sprout, it's necessary to thin out some of the weaker seedlings so the strong ones can get even stronger. Thin them out to the point where you have 2 or 3 sprouts per seed container, or 2 or 3 sprouts for each area the size of one egg carton segment. Pick the extra sprouts out close to the base, pull out the roots and discard them.








, When the growing season begins it will be time to move the seedlings to bigger containers or your outdoor garden. Make sure you get the right type of soil for your plants, and plant them in an area with the correct amount of sunlight and drainage.

Separate perennial plants with the need for digging.",How to Divide Overgrown Perennials," Many perennials will benefit from being divided every three to five years or so. One sign that your perennial plant is in need of division is a bare patch in the center of the plant. This indicates the plant is dead in the center of its root mass, but has fresh growth around the edges of it.;
, The best time to divide perennials is the fall or spring, or whenever the plants are dormant. For example, perennials which flower in spring or in summer are best divided after they bloom — in late summer or early fall. Those that bloom in the fall can be divided in spring. Peonies in particular prefer to be divided in the fall.


However, plants can be divided at any time of the year provided they aren’t allowed to dry out afterwards. Too little watering is the most common reason for plants to fail.

, Some gardeners prefer to divide their plants in spring, when the new shoots emerge. This is because the fresh growth is a good indication of which are the healthier parts of the plant. Parts which do not produce fresh shoots can be discarded when the plant is divided.

, Division exposes the roots of the plant to the air. It is best to divide perennial plants in cooler temperatures and on cloudy rather than sunny days, as this will prevent the roots from becoming too dried out while they are above ground.

, Start by preparing the soil in the new location for your divided new plants. In most cases it will be sufficient to incorporate some compost or well-rotten manure into the new planting spots.

, The day before you divide your plants, give them a good water. This ensures the plants are well hydrated before you begin.


Being short of water is a source of stress to perennial plants and division is only going to stress them further. This is why it’s best to make it easier on the plants by ensuring they are well hydrated.
You might like to trim the plants above ground if this will make it easier to handle when dividing.

, Observe the depth to which the plant is located in the ground, as you will need to replant the separated root sections to the same depth in the new location later.


Try to keep as much root intact as possible and avoid damaging the roots. Gently shake or hose off excess soil.
Remove any dead, damaged or diseased roots and stems. If the plant roots are mushy or show signs of rot, try to cut this away to leave any healthy root.

, With some plants, it may be possible to gently pull apart the root mass with your fingers. This method is suitable for fibrous rooted plants or ones not joined at the crown such as bulbs or rhizomes. These include hostas and day lilies.


Plants such as bearded iris will be made up of joined rhizomes - a knife is required to separate these.
With tough or woody root masses you may need to insert two garden forks to prize it apart, or cut it with a spade or knife.
Some very tough and woody perennials may require an ax or saw.

, Generally it’s best to divide the perennial so each new section of plant has between three and five healthy shoots. Some larger plants may require division into many sections. Other plants may only need to be halved or quartered.

, You should plant the divided parts immediately, to the same depth as the original plant. Either replant outdoors straight away, or plant into pots to nurture in a greenhouse or indoors until the new young plants are established.


You should keep the new plants watered until they are established. The best way is to water every two or three days for the first few months.






Many perennials don’t flower their first year so be prepared to wait longer for newly divided plants to bloom.

, If you are replanting one divided plant back into the original location, remember that the local soil will probably benefit from some improvement.


The presence of the plant over the last few years will have taken some of the nutrients from the soil.
Therefore, you might like to dig in some compost or well-rotted manure before you replant in that same spot.

, After several years, perennial bulbs may form smaller ‘bulblets’ or ‘corms’ around the original bulb. In terms of appearance, this is not unlike a head of garlic with the separate cloves within. In plants such as daffodils this can eventually cause perennials to become overcrowded and impair the flowering. That’s a sign that it’s time to divide the corms from the parent bulb.


Wait until the above-ground foliage has withered away. In most cases this will be in the fall. Dig up the bulb and gently separate the corms using your fingers. Discard smaller ones or any affected by damage, disease or mushy with rot.
It’s best to replant these separated bulbs immediately, but if you can’t you should store them as for overwintered bulbs — in a paper bag in a cool, dark and dry place.

, A small number of perennials can be divided without needing to dig the original plant up. It’s better if you can avoid digging the entire plant up, as this places it under immense stress.


Instead, you can cut root sections from the side edges of perennials such as geranium or Jacob’s ladder and replant them, without needing to remove the entire root mass.

You can also plant them in late summer to harvest them in the fall. To determine the best time to plant the seeds, check the local frost forecast for your area.Cabbage seedlings will be grown inside for between four and six weeks, and then transplanted outside a couple weeks before the last frost.;
, Prepare seed starters by filling them with potting soil. With your finger, make a ½-inch (1.3-cm) hole in the center of each seed starter cell. Drop two or three cabbage seeds into each hole, and cover the hole with soil.Potting soil is ideal for cabbage seeds because it’s fertile and drains well.

, Once you plant the seeds, add enough water to the soil to make it moist. As the seeds germinate and grow, keep the soil moist, adding more water as it begins to dry out.

, Cabbage seeds germinate when the temperature is between 65 and 75 F (18 and 24 C). Store them inside or in a garden shed where the temperature will be maintained in this range. Once the seeds come up, move them to a place that gets plenty of sunlight, like a south-facing window., As the cabbage seeds germinate and start to grow, sprouts will shoot up through the soil. Keep the cabbage seedlings inside until they're three to four inches tall, and have at least four or five leaves each.The seedlings will take between four and six weeks to grow to this stage.

, It’s best to transplant cabbage to its outdoor location about two to three weeks prior to the last frost. Check the long-range weather forecast for your area to determine this date.


When you know when the date for the last expected frost, schedule a date a couple weeks in advance of that to transplant your cabbage.For fall plantings, set the plants out 6-8 weeks before the average first frost date of the year.

, There are a few things that cabbages need to thrive, and sunlight is one of them. When choosing an outdoor location for your cabbage, look for somewhere that gets at least six hours of full sun each day.Avoid planting cabbages in the same garden beds as cauliflower, strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes.
Cabbages will thrive in gardens close to cucumbers and beans., Cabbage loves fertile soil, so mix the soil in your seedbed with equal parts aged compost or manure. Water the bed so the soil is moist before transplanting the seedlings.


The ideal pH for cabbage is between 6.5 and 7.5. You can test the pH of your soil with test strips, which are available at most department, garden, and hardware stores.If you need to lower the pH, add more compost or manure to make the soil more acidic. To increase the pH, add pulverized limestone to the bed.

, Plant the seedlings at the same depth they were in the pots, about a ½ inch (1.3 cm) deep. Space them 12 to 24 inches (30 to 61 cm) apart, and in rows that are about 24 inches (61 cm) apart.For the best results, pick a cloudy day to transplant the cabbage seedlings. This will help prevent shock to the fragile plants.

, Add a 1-inch (2.5-cm) layer of mulch to the top of the soil. This will help keep the soil moist as the seedlings grow, protect the plants from pests, and help regulate the temperature of the soil.


The ideal mulch for cabbage includes ground leaves, finely ground bark, or compost., Cabbage plants will need about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of water each week. If you aren't getting enough rain, water the soil enough to keep it moist as the cabbages grow.Continue watering the cabbages until the plants approach maturity. At that time, stop watering them to prevent split heads.

, When the cabbages start to grow new leaves and develop heads, amend the soil with fertilizer. This will happen about three weeks after transplanting, and at this time, the cabbages will need nitrogen-rich fertilizer.


Good fertilizers for a cabbage patch include fish emulsions, liquid fertilizers, blood meal, and cottonseed meal., Cabbage growing time depends on the variety, but it can take anywhere from 80 to 180 days for a cabbage to mature after the seed is planted.


After transplanting the seedlings, the cabbages will need anywhere from 60 to 105 days to mature., When the cabbages start to mature, you can start doing squeeze tests on the heads to determine if they're ready for harvest. The base of the head should be between 4 and 10 inches (10.2 to 25.4 cm) across, depending on the variety.


To do the squeeze test, squeeze the head of the cabbage with your hand. A solid and firm head is ready for harvest, but a loose and soft head needs more time to mature., When the cabbages are ready, use a sharp knife to remove the heads from the stems. Cut off the outer leaves and add them to the compost pile if they're healthy.When the heads have been harvested, place them in the shade or into the fridge until you're ready to use or store them.
When you harvest the cabbage heads, leave the stems in the ground to continue growing. Many cabbages will regrow new, smaller heads, and these can be harvested again in several weeks.

, You can eat your harvested cabbages immediately, or store leftovers for later. Clean the cabbage heads under running water to remove dirt and insects. Set them on a clean towel to dry completely. You can store cabbage by:Wrapping it loosely in plastic wrap and storing it in the fridge for up to two weeks.
Storing it in a cold or root cellar for up to three months.
Drying or freezing the leaves.
Turning it into sauerkraut.

Choose the right time of year.,
Get the right tools for your soil.,
Cut or dig around the hosta plant, starting 10cm/4 inches from the base of a small plant, to 35cm/18 inches for a very large clump.,
If you are new at dividing hostas or other perennials, washing the dirt off the clump can be very helpful to see the individual plants and their rhizomes (from where the roots grow).,
If possible, particularly if the hosta is not a large clump, separate the individual plants by hand, by gently forcing your thumbs between plant's stems, and easing the stems apart.,
If the clump is very large, it may just be easier to use a serrated kitchen knife, to cut through the clump.,
Start by spreading the roots so that you determine where you want to cut.,
If possible, make the cut about halfway through the crown and then see if you can pull it apart by hand; use the same back and forth pulling motion.,
Washing between cuts to remove sand and small rocks can also improve your insight into how the plant's stems are growing, and to see where to cut or pull apart.

,
You can also use the hacksaw to cut through the clump, by turning the clump on its side, but be careful that the saw doesn't get stuck, so prevent that by forcing the plant apart, either with your other hand or perhaps the handle of another garden tool, if the clump is huge and the saw is pretty deep into the clump.

,
Remove some older, larger leaves or cutting the foliage back at the time of dividing will reduce water loss and help to minimize shock.

,
Plant the divided plants.,
Do not let the roots dry out too much.,
If the plants' roots dry some before you get a chance to replant, soak the plant in a bucket of water for two to twelve hours.,
For stem divisions resulting from pulling plants apart and which have a nice balanced root distribution, plant these divisions at their original level, so that the white basal portions of the stems are just under the ground and you cannot see them.,
If you had to use the knife or hacksaw to cut the clump, plant these smaller now-divided clumps at the same height as they were growing, or just slightly deeper (1/3cm/1 to 1-1/2 in.,
Keep newly divided hostas wet; keep plants from drying out for the first two weeks.

",How to Divide a Hosta," While many gardeners choose spring for time to move and divide plants, it can have a negative effect on the plants, especially in hotter climates. It's preferable to divide hostas in the late summer and early fall, roughly 4 weeks before first frost. Hostas are fairly tough plants, though, and can be divided at any time during the growing season if you carefully replant, water, and mulch the divided clumps. Tamping down the soil around the root ball so that the plant can't be easily dislodged will insure greater success.;
, Often, if the clumps are large (say about 25cm/10 inches across at the base), you will find it easiest to use a fork with flat blades and a spade or shovel. If the soil is very light and humus-y, and the plants are smaller, a long-bladed knife, preferably with a serrated blade, will work well. A hacksaw is very helpful if the clump is very large. Some folks like to have a garden hose handy, or a large bucket of clean water.

, Once you have cut a circle around the clump, slide the spade underneath the clump and lift it out of the ground, or pry the clump from the ground with the fork.

, Also wash the plant if you are unsure of how the individual plants are growing and you don't want to slice one in half (particularly if the hosta is a slow-growing expensive one). Do not worry about damaging the roots with the water, because hostas' roots are tough.

, To remove a stem from the crown, use a back and forth pulling motion and not a side-wise motion (hold the core plant in one hand, and grab the stem in the other, rotate the stem-holding back and forth), work the stem back and forth until the rhizome comes loose or breaks from the crown. The rhizome will break at the appropriate point. Even if you lose some of the plant stems, you'll still have enough of the rhizomes to produce a healthy new clump.

, You can cut the clump in various sizes, such as simply in half, into thirds, or quarters.

, Try to keep as many roots and leaves as possible, by making cuts through the crown but not into the roots. Start by cutting the crown in half, if you are really careful you can navigate around the stems; if the clump is really large, sometimes it is just easier to cut in half without much concern that you cut a few stems in half, because the clump is such a monster anyway.

, In this case, hold each half in one hand, and gently rotate the halves in opposite directions, then rotate back and forth each time applying a bit more pressure and simultaneously exerting pressure to move the halves away from each other. If you can't pull it apart then make the cut deeper.

,,,, Do not think that a small piece might not grow. It's amazing how resilient these plants are and you might as well plant the little pieces alongside a larger plant.

, If you can not plant them right away, place some moist dirt or peat moss on the roots and put them away from direct sunlight, deep shade is good in hotter climes.

, Do not leave the plants in water for more than a day, the roots will begin to rot.

, If you have washed the roots or the roots are not holding much soil, make a good size hole and spread the roots out in a fan. Replace the soil, pressing firmly with the heel of your hand around the plant, and water the plants well so no large air pockets in the soil exist.

Wrap the wound in the plant's stem.,
Replant the new plant when it is ready.",How to Cut and Layer Plants," For successful air layering, you'll need a toothpick, a sharp knife, rooting hormone, some sphagnum peat moss, twine, rubber bands, and plastic wrap. As an alternative to acquiring these materials individually, you can purchase complete air layering kits at many nurseries and florists.


Before starting the layering process, you must moisten the peat moss. Do this by soaking it in water for about an hour, and then wring it out thoroughly so that it is moist but not dripping.;
, Begin by choosing the area along the plant's stem where you want the new growth to form. This location should be just below a node (the point where a leaf joins the stem). Prepare the area by plucking away any leaves on the stem within about 3 inches (7 cm) of the point you've selected.

, Using a very sharp knife, make a cut into the plant's stem. The cut should be made upwards at an extremely shallow angle so that you are not cutting too deeply into the center of the stem. The cut should ideally be about an inch (2.5 cm) deep.

, After making the cut, gently place a toothpick into the wound so that it is held open and will not heal. Apply a small amount of rooting hormone to the wound, trying to get most of it onto the exposed surfaces of the cut. This hormone will encourage the new root growth that will be the beginning of your new plant.

, To provide an ideal environment for the new growth and to prevent infection, you'll want to wrap the wound. Begin by piling the peat moss around the wound into a roughly spherical shape about 4 inches (10 cm) across. Secure the peat moss onto the stem using twine. Then, wrap a sheet of plastic wrap around the peat moss to keep in the moisture. Secure the plastic wrap with rubber bands.

, After several weeks, you will be able to see new root growth emerging through the moss and brushing up against the plastic wrap. At this point, remove the plastic wrap and the peat moss gently. Make a clean cut at the point where the root attaches to the plant's stem. Pot this new root in a container filled with potting mix, and water it as you would a normal seedling of that plant species. As the plant grows, it can be cared for just as you would a normal seedling.

Wasabi naturally grows in wet, wooded areas with plenty of moisture in the air and well-draining soil.
In the USA, parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Blue Ridge Mountains have the right conditions for growing wasabi. Few other places are naturally suitable for growing the plant.;
, If you live in a region that doesn't have the natural climate necessary for growing wasabi, you will need to recreate the right conditions manually. One of the best ways to do so is by using a greenhouse, which traps heat and humidity and allows you to control the temperature. If you decide to use a greenhouse, adjust the settings so that the temperature is always between 45 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.


If you live in a place where the growing conditions are fairly close to what wasabi naturally needs, you may be able to get away without using a greenhouse. If you live in a hot region, use a tarp or sheet to shade the planting bed so it won't get too hot. If you live in a place with mild cold snaps, cover the plants when the temperature gets cold.

, Wasabi does not do well in direct sunlight; it needs a very shady spot. In the wild, wasabi grows under forest canopy, where just enough sunlight filters through the leaves to give the wasabi what it needs to flourish. As a home cultivator, try to replicate this environment either by planting the wasabi under trees or using a hand-fashioned canopy to shade the growing bed.In a greenhouse, it's still important to make sure the wasabi gets plenty of shade. Situate the wasabi under taller plants or near shaded windows to make sure it isn't struck by direct sunlight.

, Use a mixture of compost and organic, sulfur-rich fertilizer. Till the soil to a depth of 10 inches and work in ten inches of compost to create a rich, healthy soil. Test and adjust soil pH until it falls between 6 and 7. This specific pH creates the best environment for wasabi. You want a very rich, organic soil with just the right pH to give your wasabi the best chance of surviving in a home setting.Follow label instructions when applying fertilizer.

, Wasabi likes to be kept moist, but not muddy and waterlogged. To check whether the soil drains well enough, water the area well and watch the water soak in. If it's slow to be absorbed, work in more compost. If it drains right away, the soil is fine for wasabi.


Planting wasabi near a natural pond or stream is a good idea, since the soil will stay constantly moist, but will naturally also drain well.
You could also plant wasabi near a waterfall that will continuously splash on the plant to provide water.

, Wasabi seeds are difficult to source at local nurseries, so most people order them online. Late fall is the best time to order seeds; wasabi needs the winter to establish good roots. When the seeds arrive, keep them moist and plan to plant within 48 hours of receipt., The night before you plant them, place the seeds in a small bowl and cover them with distilled water. Soak the seeds overnight prior to planting. Soaking will help to soften the seed shells and make it easier for the wasabi to germinate. Sow the seeds one to two inches apart and press them lightly into the soil.

, Wasabi is a semi-aquatic plant that must be kept wet to flourish. Every day, mist the soil and the sprouting seedlings with fresh, cool water to emulate splashes from natural water sources, like a stream or waterfall. If the wasabi is allowed to dry out, it will begin to wilt.


A micro-irrigation system is a good alternative to misting. Watch your plants for wilting (not enough water) and root rot (too much water), and adjust your irrigation accordingly.
Because wasabi must be kept wet, it is susceptible to mold and disease. If you see a plant become diseased (wilted and discolored), pull it out right away to prevent it from spreading to other plants. Do not soak the soil or plants with a hose or watering can, as this increases the chance of rot and disease.

, Weed out competing plants so the wasabi roots have plenty of room to grow. Since the soil is kept moist on a daily basis, weeds tend to sprout quickly. Weeding every day or every other day will keep the problem under control.

, Wasabi doesn't develop its distinctive flavor until it becomes mature after about 24 months. During this time the wasabi will grow about two feet tall and two feet wide. It will stop getting taller and wider, and start putting energy into growing a long, carrot-like rhizome beneath the soil.

, Rhizomes are mature and ready to eat when they're about seven or eight inches long. Dig up one rhizome to check the length before completing the rest of the harvest. Use a long, slim spade or pitchfork and take care not to cut the rhizomes when you dig it out.

, Wasabi left in the ground will produce new seeds and drop them into the soil, saving you the trouble of ordering more seeds. Leave several plants in the ground so you'll have a fresh crop of wasabi in the next couple of years.


When the new plants begin to sprout, space the seedlings about 12 inches apart so they have plenty of room to grow. If you leave them in clumps, many will wilt and die.

, Clean the wasabi rhizomes and discard the leaves. To enjoy wasabi's fresh, sharp flavor, shave off as much as you need and leave the rest of the rhizome intact. The heat of the wasabi will fade after a few hours, so it's best to cut off only as much as you need for one meal at a time.

, Fresh wasabi will keep in the refrigerator for about a month or two before it begins to rot. If you want to save wasabi for later use, it's best to dry it out and grind it into a powder. The powder can be mixed with a little water to form wasabi paste.

, If there are yellow leaves in the middle of the bottom this means that your bok choy is ready to grow!

, You can be creative with this one. Add at least 1 inch of water, but you can add a lot of water until the bok choy is floating!

, The bok choy can be placed anywhere as long as it gets sunlight. The bok choy can be a very unique edible plant for decoration or as a house plant.

, You can also spray the middle of the bok choy (where the leaves sprout):

, Before a bok choy grows roots, it will have white bumps where the roots sprout from. This is perfectly normal; when you see roots sprouting from the bumps wait 1 day before planting.

, Make sure the roots and base are at least 1 inch underground. Sometimes when the bok choy has roots the will have a dark tint. This just means that the roots are actively growing.

, A regrowing bok choy will commonly have ""ripped-looking"" leaves. This is also perfectly normal and as the plant grows the leaves will become more full.

, Bok choys need at least 1 inch or water whenever the soil is dry to the touch. The water can be poured straight down on the bok choy or around the base. Make sure not to overwater. As the bok choy grows older you can add more dirt around it or just bury it with top and leaves exposed.

, You must kill them immediately. Aphids will literally drain the life out of bok choys. Use an insecticidal soap spray to kill them. They especially like to hide under the leaves. You can get this spray at a gardening or home store.

, Black flying bugs occasionally appear flying or on bok choy. Wave your hands near them so they fly then squash them. These bugs can multiply quickly and lay eggs on your plant killing them.

Check your soil.",How to Grow Radishes," Like many vegetables, there are innumerable varieties of radishes at your disposal, both hybrid and open-pollinated. If you are a novice gardener, consider growing Cherry Belle radishes; they mature in just 22 days and have a pleasant, mild flavor.Spring radishes are the types that people are most familiar (like the Cherry Belle radish, which is the the red on the outside, white on the inside one). You want to make sure that you're growing these in spring or fall. They tend to be the fastest growing radish, as well.
Typically the summer radish is similar to the spring radish, but tends to grow more slowly, taking around 6-8 weeks to mature.
The winter radish is much larger and starchier than the spring and summer radishes and takes longer to grow. It's best to sow it in late summer for a fall or winter harvest. Winter radishes include Daikon and Champions. Daikon can grow to 18 inches (45 cm) long and takes 60 days to mature, and includes some extra-spicy varieties.;
, Radishes should be planted in an area with full sun or partial shade, and loose, well-drained soil. Remove any rocks from the soil, as the roots will bifurcate around any rocks in their way. Add organic matter to the soil before planting, such as compost, manure, or leaf mold.Make sure your radishes are getting plenty of sunlight. Otherwise they will grow big on top and very small in the root section. However, too much sunlight can cause radishes to go to seed.
The soil needs to be free of rocks, well-drained and have a pH content between 5.8 and 6.8. Use plenty of organic matter (like compost) in the soil.
For best results, conduct a soil test or send soil samples to a lab to check for proper nutrients. Make any adjustments to the soil at least one week before planting.

, Radishes are a cool weather crop best planted in spring and autumn. Growing radishes during the hot summer months may cause them to bolt. You can plant your first crop a full 2 weeks before the last frost in spring, as radishes endure frost well.Stop growing when hot weather shows up. This basically means that if you're having consecutive days of 60 °F (16 °C) or above you should hold off on your radish planting until it gets cooler.
A typical spring radish germinates in about 5 days, and is ready for harvest in 3 to 4 weeks.
Because radishes grow so quickly, you can ""inter-crop"" them between slow-growing vegetables to make row markers. You can also ""succession plant"" them by sowing a new row each week, to spread your harvest over a longer period.

, You will want them to be about 1/2 inch (12.5 mm) deep and 1 inch (25 mm) apart. As they germinate, thin the successful seedlings to about 2 inches (5 cm) apart, allowing more space for bigger varieties. Rows should be planted about 1 foot (30 cm) apart.You will want to thin the radishes when they have grown about 1 inch. Aim to just cut off their heads with a small pair of scissors, all the way down to the soil.If you're planting a large radish you will want to plant the seeds about 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch deep.
Radishes work well as companion plants, because they keep a lot of the bugs off the regular plants and they grow more quickly. Plant them alongside carrots, parsnips, and cabbages.

, Keep the radish beds moist, but not soaked. Watering radishes frequently and evenly will result in quick growth; if radishes grow too slowly, they will develop a hot, woody taste. Add compost to the radish bed as desired to help retain moisture.


If you don't water them evenly (for example, not watering for a few days and then drowning them) the radishes can crack.

, Radishes are typically ready to harvest when their roots are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Check your seed packet for your variety's expected size at harvest and time to maturity. To harvest, lift the entire plant out of the ground with your hand.You can also push back the dirt and see if a bulb has grown. If so, pull a few radishes and taste them. That will let you know if they're ready to be harvested.
Unlike many root vegetables, radishes cannot be left in the ground, as doing so will cause them to become tough and pithy.

, Brush the soil off your radishes using your hand, and then store them in a cool, dark place for up to 2 weeks. Wash them with water before eating them., There are different kinds of fungi that can kill your radish or make it taste really bad. Usually there are obvious signs of a fungus problem that you can watch out for and subsequently deal with.If pale yellow and grey spots appear on the radish leaves, your radish might have leaf spot, also known as Septoria leaf spot, a fungal disease. If you do have this, make sure that your planting bed is well-drained (the water doesn't just sit there) and add organic matter (like compost). Remove the infected radishes. To avoid this problem, rotate your crops so that you don't plant your radishes in the same bed each time. Also, keep your garden free of plant debris (dead plants, weeds you've picked, etc.).
If pale green spots start appearing on the upper side of the leaves, with a purple downy growth on the undersides, you might be dealing with downy mildew, a type of fungus. Get rid of infected plants and make sure that you aren't over-watering. Avoiding radish over-crowding by thinning the herd. To avoid downy mildew, make sure that you rotate your crops, and keep the garden free of plant debris.
If the radish leaves turn yellow between their veins, if the leaf margins turn brown and curl upward, if the stem base turns dark brown, black, and becomes slimy, you might have blackleg, a fungal disease. Add organic matter, like compost, to the plant bed, and make sure that your soil is well drained (not holding too much water and that you aren't over-watering). To avoid getting this, make sure that you rotate your crops.

, Fungi aren't the only things that can cause problems with your radishes. Certain bugs can get into your plants and feed on them so that they begin to die. Many times you can avoid these bugs by keeping your garden clear of plant debris and weeds. If they do show up there are some ways you can deal with them.


If your leaves are looking faded and you find that there are tunnels and grooves in the roots, you might have root maggots. These tiny critters are small, gray/white, legless worms. Flies lay their eggs in the soil beside the plant. To get rid of them, add lime or wood ashes to the base of your radish plants. Wait to plant your radishes until the weather is drier so that you avoid the maggot's life cycle.
If you have tiny holes appearing in the radish leaves, you might have flea beetles. These little critters are bronze or black beetles 1/16th of an inch long. If you find you have these, spread diatomaceous earth, a type of soft, sedimentary rock that crumbles easily into a fine, off-white powder. This can act as a natural bug killer.You should also cultivate the ground often, so that you disrupt the beetles' life cycle.
If your radish plants have whitish or yellowish spots, have deformed leaves, or if the plants are wilting, you might have Harlequin bugs. These bugs, which are black with yellow or red or orange markings, suck the fluids out of the radish's plant tissue. Pick out and destroy all the bugs and the egg masses. To help keep them out of your garden, keep it clear of the places where bugs breed, like crop residue and weeds.
If the leaves of your radish plant turn a dull yellow, if they curl and become brittle, your radish plant might have contracted Aster yellows, a mycoplasma disease spread by Leafhoppers. If this is the case, remove the infected plant or plants, and control the leaf-hopper population by keeping down the weeds and plant debris.

, Soil temperature, type, and how watered it is can play a big role in how well your radish plant is doing. Remember that you're trying for evenly watered (not overly watered), correct pH content soil.


If your radishes end up tasting too hot or too pungent, it likely means that the soil is too dry or the temperature of the soil is too hot (above 90 degrees Fahrenheit). To protect your roots and cool the soil, add 2 to 3 inches of organic mulch. Water your radishes 2 to 3 hours at a time and then wait until the soil has dried to at least a 4 inch depth.
If the radish root is pithy and woody the temperature of the soil has likely been too high and the watering spotty. Make sure that the roots are covered with soil or warmth to keep them cool and that you are watering evenly. Also, make sure that you are harvesting your radishes as soon as they're big enough, so that they don't grow too big and crack.

Store in cool temperatures.",How to Grow Turnips," Turnips thrive in cooler temperatures, so you should plant them when soil temperatures are still somewhat cool. For spring turnips, sow the seeds outdoors three weeks before the last expected frost. For fall turnips, sow the seeds in midsummer, roughly two months before the first expected frost of winter.The soil temperature needs to be an average of at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) for the seeds to germinate, but temperatures between 50 and 70 degrees (10 and 21 degrees Celsius) Fahrenheit encourage the most rapid growth.
Fall turnips are typically sweeter than spring turnips, and they are also less likely to attract root maggots.;
, Turnips thrive in full sun, so the area you choose should receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily, if not a little more.


Ideally, you should also choose a spot with naturally loose, well-draining soil. You can improve the soil conditions if necessary, but starting out with good soil conditions will make your job easier.
Also keep in mind that turnips prefer soils with a pH of 6.5. Most soils will not be too acidic or too alkaline, so testing is not always necessary. If you have difficulty with your turnip crop, though, consider testing the soil pH by taking a sample to your nearest university or by purchasing a home pH testing kit from a garden nursery or home improvement store.

, Loosen the soil with a rake or shovel to a depth of 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm), then mix in a 2-inch to 4-inch (5-cm to 10-cm) layer of compost.For added benefit, consider mixing in a few handfuls of well rotted manure along with the compost.

, Spread the seed across the prepared soil as evenly as possible. Cover the seed gently with 1/4 inch (6 mm) of soil for spring turnips or 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of soil for fall turnips.


Alternatively, you can plant the seeds in rows spaced 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) apart.
Note that germination usually takes anywhere from 7 to 14 days.
After planting the seeds, make sure that they are evenly watered. You do not want to drench the seeds since doing so can wash them out of the soil, but the surface of the soil should be somewhat moist to the touch.

, When the seedlings reach a height of 4 inches (10 cm), pull the weakest ones so that the strongest have more room and resources. ""Early"" varieties should be thinned out so that they are 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart, while standard or “maincrop” varieties should be 6 inches (15 cm) apart.


If you only want to grow turnips for their greens, however, you should not thin them out.
Usually, the greens of the removed plants are large enough to use.

, Turnips need 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week. Any less will cause the roots to become tough and bitter, but too much more can cause the turnips to rot.


Monitor the rainfall in your area. During seasons of average rainfall, you may not need to do any additional watering. If the season is a dry one, though, you should water the turnips by hand.

, When the plants reach a height of 5 inches (12.7 cm), add a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of mulch around the greens.


Mulch holds in moisture, and even moisture can encourage better growth and flavor.
Additionally, mulch can help control and limit the number of weeds in your garden.

, While not strictly necessary, a monthly application of mild, organic fertilizer can help strengthen the turnip root. Choose a fertilizer high in potassium and phosphorus rather than one high in nitrogen.Nitrogen fertilizers will cause the turnip greens to get very bushy, but the roots will suffer as a result.
Look for fertilizers that also contain boron or apply a separate boron spray four to six weeks after sowing the seeds.
Make sure that any fertilizer you use is food-safe.
Instead of a fertilizer, you could apply a dose of compost tea once a month or so.

, Any weeds that poke their way up through the mulch should be pulled by hand. Avoid using herbicides since the chemicals can get on the turnip plant, damaging it and making it unfit for human consumption.

, Root maggots and flea beetles are among the most common pests you'll need to worry about, while powdery mildew and downy mildew tend to be the most common forms of fungi.


Root maggots are most often a problem when you grow turnips in soil that nurtured radishes, turnips, or rutabagas the previous year. To prevent root maggot infestations, rotate your crops and treat the soil with a food-safe insecticide labeled for use against root maggots.
Keeping the soil pH above 6.0 can prevent most problems with mildew and other fungi, like club root. Periodically test the soil pH with a pH testing kit or by taking it to a local university extension office.Typically speaking, once turnip roots become infested by pests or fungi, there is not much you can do to save them. Your best option is to remove the infected plant and treat the soil as needed to destroy as much of the pest or fungi as possible. You may or may not be able to recover the rest of your turnip crop.

, As a general rule, you can harvest greens as soon as they are large enough to pick. Generally, this is when the green reach a height between 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm).As long as the growing points or nodes are not removed, the greens should regrow after harvesting them.
If you want to harvest leaves and roots from the same plant, only remove two or three leaves per plant. If you remove all of the leaves, the root will die.

, You should be able to harvest mature, ripe turnips after five to ten weeks. ""Early"" varieties only require five weeks, while main crop varieties need six to ten.


You can harvest small turnips simply by hand pulling them. To harvest large turnip roots, use a spading fork to loosen the soil around the root before pulling it out.
You can harvest turnips at virtually any size. Small turnips are tender and tend to be somewhat sweeter than large turnips, though, so most prefer to harvest turnips when the roots are between 1 and 3 inches (2.5 and 7.5 cm) in diameter).
You can check the root size by lightly brushing away soil on top of one plant to reveal the root below. If that one plant appears ready for harvest, most of the others will likely be ready, as well.
Make sure that all of your turnips are harvested before the first frost. Do not allow them to grow too large, since overripe turnips have a woody taste and texture.

, When packed and stored in a cool place, harvested turnips will usually last for three to four months. Consider keeping them in a basement, root cellar, or shed and covering them with straw.


Twist off the tops, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of stem before storing the turnips. Do not rinse off any soil since it can actually help protect the roots wile they remain in storage.
You might be able to leave your fall crop in the ground until early winter by covering them with a thick mulch, but pull them out before the soil freezes and hardens.
Turnips can also be stored in the refrigerator.

Don’t worry about your kale contracting diseases or attracting many pests.,
Pick off any caterpillars and drop them in a bucket of soapy water to drown them.,
Remove any aphids with a strong spray from a garden hose.",How to Grow Ornamental Flowering Kale Plants," In cooler climates, an area with full sun exposure, where it gets eight to ten hours of direct sunlight is fine. In areas where summer temperatures commonly exceed 80 °F (27 °C), plant it in a spot where it will get six hours of sunlight in the morning and shade in the afternoon.Ornamental kale are annuals, so they only last one season or year. They grow best in the cooler weather of spring and fall.
If the ornamental kale does not get enough sunlight, it will grow slowly and the center leaves will not develop their bright colors.;
, These plants will commonly continue to thrive in the fall in spite of frost and can survive well into winter in milder climates. In fact, they thrive when temperatures drop to below 60 °F (16 °C).


When planted in early spring, they might survive the summer to flourish again in the fall in cooler climates or when planted in a garden that is shaded from the afternoon sunlight.

, Ornamental kale will not do well in slow-draining clay soil. If the garden soil is clay, build a 1-foot high raised bed for the ornamental kale and fill it with sandy or loamy soil.Soil pH is not an issue for this annual.

, Use 3- to 6-inch layer of organic matter such as well-aged cow manure, compost, sphagnum peat moss, leaf mold or decomposed pine bark mulch. Mix the organic matter into the garden soil with a rototiller.


If the organic matter is not thoroughly mixed into the garden soil it could interfere with water movement, creating pockets of wet organic matter and dry soil.

, They can be planted in the garden in early spring around the time of the last frost or in late summer.Start the seeds either directly in the garden when temperatures are above 65 °F (18 °C) or indoors about one month before planting them outdoors.

, A good mix contains one-third sphagnum peat moss, one-third soil and one-third course sand, perlite or vermiculite.Pour the potting mix into the flat, level it and moisten it with room-temperature water.

, Do not cover them with soil as ornamental kale seeds require exposure to sunlight in order to germinate. Instead, press the seeds into the soil lightly with the palm of your hand.


Keep the soil evenly moist. The seeds will germinate in about ten days.
Thin out the sprouts once they are a few inches tall, to one seedling per 3 to 4 inches. Keep only the sturdiest-looking plants.

, Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth or organic mulch over the soil around the ornamental kale plants to help keep the soil moist and control weed growth.Thin them once they are a few inches tall, to one plant per 1 to 1 1/2 feet.
Water them as often as necessary to keep the soil lightly moist but muddy.

, Use a soaker hose or garden hose with a sprinkle-type nozzle to water them below the leaves in order to keep the leaves as dry as possible.


Water them in the morning so that any water that does get on the leaves will dry throughout the day. Give them 1 to 2 inches or 3 to 6 gallons (11.4 to 22.7 L) of water each time.
The easiest way to measure how much water is being given with a soaker hose is to place a 1-inch deep can next to the plants. When the can is full, the plants have received about 1 inch of water.
Too much water will cause ornamental kale leaves to turn yellow and drop.Not enough water will cause the leaves to wilt., Apply the fertilizer about three weeks after planting.Sprinkle about 1/4 pound of fertilizer per 25 square feet on the soil around the kale plants.Do not get fertilizer on the plants as it could burn the leaves. If fertilizer does get on the plants by accident, wash them off right away with clear water from the garden hose.
Ornamental kale plants that do not get fertilizer will grow more slowly and may not develop their bright colors.

, This will help wash the fertilizer down to the roots.

, You should also harvest ornamental kale 70 to 80 days after the seeds are planted., Remove the outermost leaves first.


All of the leaves can be cut back to a height of 2 inches. The plants will grow new leaves in a week or two.

, Ornamental kale leaves taste quite bitter.To reduce their bitterness, boil them twice using fresh water each time or boil them once and then cook them in olive oil.

, Ornamental kale is not generally bothered by pests or diseases but caterpillars and aphids occasionally attack them., Caterpillars will munch on the kale’s leaves, leaving very distinct rounded holes on the leaves or half circles along the edges.Wear protective gloves when picking caterpillars. Some of them can inflict a painful sting.

, The forceful spray of water will usually crush and kill them. Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that pierce the ornamental kale leaves with their mouths and suck out the juices.These little pests can be nearly any color but are often green or red. They also secrete a clear, sticky liquid called honeydew and can often be found on the undersides of the leaves.


Be sure to spray the undersides of the leaves to get rid of any hidden aphids.
If the aphids return, spray them again. They may need to be sprayed every few days for a week or two to get severe infestations under control.
Always spray ornamental kale in the morning so the leaves will dry quickly during the day.

Identify the different characteristics of organic seeds.,
Buy organic seeds locally.,
Purchase organic seeds online.",How to Buy Organic Seeds," There are a variety of seeds that qualify as ""organic."" For many gardeners, the main characteristic of an ""organic seed"" is that it is grown in organic soil and not treated with any pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or herbicides. Identification labels for organic seeds will signify whether a seed is originally propagated from an organic plant. Look for labels on seed packets, in catalogs or online.


Look for untreated seeds. A ""U"" will identify seeds that are untreated, meaning they have had no chemical or synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides.
Check for an ""O,"" which identifies organic seeds, or those that have been taken from organically grown plants.
Look for open-pollinated seeds. Open pollination refers to seeds that have been pollinated by natural means, either by birds, bees, wind or through self-pollination (seeds that are naturally capable of reproducing themselves). These seeds will be labeled with an ""OP.""
Look for an ""H."" This stands for heritage (or heirloom) seeds, which carry qualities of a particular plant that has been cultivated. Heritage seeds are those that have been carried down from a particular seed that the grower felt created a healthy, desirable plant. Heritage seeds are usually the result of cross-pollination from 2 types of seeds that created the new cultivar.;
, Choosing locally grown organic seed will allow for better adaptation to your soil and garden environment.


Shop at local nurseries or choose from local seed catalogs. Look in the phone book or online for nurseries or landscapers in your area. They will be able to tell you if they sell organic seeds, and they often will recommend seeds based on local growing conditions. Most nurseries, and even garden departments at home improvement stores, carry seed catalogs from top seed distributors.
Ask fellow gardeners what they have enjoyed growing from organic seed, or ask your local farmers and vendors at the farmer's markets. Farmers and gardeners in your area will have the expertise to recommend what type of seeds have grown best for them, as well as information on special heritage or heirloom seeds. Many farmers who grow organically have created their own heirloom seeds, and may even sell or trade them along with their produce.

, The Internet allows for many seed distributors, co-ops and other organic plant producers to provide consumers with purely organic seeds that they have certified. You also will have the benefit of browsing through many varieties of seeds online. Recently seeds are also sold in general marketplaces like eBay or garden marketplaces like MySeedz.


Start a search. Begin by browsing keywords, such as ""organic seeds"" or ""certified organic.""
Look for certified organic seeds. A website that is selling seeds should provide certification for organic requirements. Although requirements vary, a reputable seed distributor will have the certification listed. In the United States, for example, there will be a certification number provided. This ensures that you are purchasing seeds that are organic and untreated.
Search for online vendors that have been established. Signs of longtime vendors include their age of operation, whether they are licensed with the Better Business Bureau, and if they are a common name in gardening or organic food production. Many organic food websites will have links to vendors who are reputable. Established vendors in the seed business also usually offer a variety of plants for sale.

You may wish to plant extra plants if you want onions to eat during the first season.;
, Most of the flowers will be dry, and the seeds will begin to fall out on their own.
,, Many seeds will fall out on their own. For the rest, place them in a bag, pound the whole bag against a hard surface. If you have many seeds, you may be able to use the wind to separate them from stems and other matter. Use a large bowl and toss them in the air, or pour them from one container to another in a light breeze. The wind should sift the lighter stems away and leave the heavier seeds to fall.

There's no harm in having a little bit of stem or seed head in your seeds unless you are sprouting them. If you plant it along with the seeds, it will just decompose.

Vegetables at great risk of cross-pollination include:


Brassicas
Cucurbits
Alliums
Beets.;
, This technique (also known as ""bagging"") will need to be done before the flowers open so that bees and any other pollen transporting insects are preventing from getting to them. For covering the flowers, try such items as:


Newspaper or cardboard perhaps with plastic for water protection
Toilet rolls
Tape

Muslin or similar sachets or bags (these can be tied in place)
Handkerchiefs
Plastic beverage or food containers (cleaned).

, You can cover the entire plant with a screen rigged up to cover just the relevant plant or plants. Make it like a cage with something like muslin, light organza, wire mesh, etc., covering it; anything that will keep out the insects.

Lever it back to loosen the soil under the seedlings and gently tease them out.
Carefully separate the seedlings by holding them by the leaves. Avoid handling by the stem or the roots as they are both easily damaged.







, Discard the more spindly looking ones with the smaller root systems as they are less likely to survive.

,


With the dibber, create a large hole deep and wide enough to hold the root system.
Lower a seedling in and firm the soil around it.

, Use an indelible pen to put the plant variety on one side, and the date on the other. Place this at the edge of the tray.

, Turn the rose on the watering can upwards, this prevents disruption to the soil's surface. Water heavily.

, Different seeds require different growing conditions. Check the seed packet. If your seedlings will eventually be planted outside, place them in an unheated greenhouse or cold frame, or outside in an area that is protected from direct sunlight and heavy winds. This will gently acclimatize the seedlings to outside conditions. When they have sprouted 3 or 4 pairs of leaves, they are ready to be replanted into display containers or transplanted into the ground.

Hybrid seeds: These are seeds whose parent plants are 2 distinctly different plants that have been crossbred to promote certain desirable traits. These seeds may produce plants that are more disease resistant, produce larger fruit, or have an easier harvest. The disadvantage of this type of garden seed is that many unique genes are lost and attributes such as a unique taste, smell, or texture may not be present in the plants and fruits from hybrid seeds. The seeds collected from hybrid plants may not be suitable to plant for the next year as they may not produce the same type of plants as those they came from.
Heirloom seeds: Heirloom seeds come from plants that have not been genetically changed by humans. Heirloom plants and vegetables have distinct smells, tastes, and textures that hybrid seeds may not have. The seeds from these plants will produce the same type of plant they were harvested from. Although heirloom seeds may not have some characteristics bred into them that the hybrid seeds possess, many of these characteristics are not particularly sought after by the backyard gardener.
Organic seeds: These seeds come from parent plants that are pesticide-free and organically grown. These seeds may be heirloom or hybrid.;
, Mark off the seeds as you find sources for them so you do not double order.

, Many seed companies have been in business for many years and take pride in producing quality seeds that have good sprout rates and will produce healthy plants. Look into how long a seed company has been in business and if there are any consumer complaints against them.

, Seed packets come with an expiration date printed on them. Make sure you have the current year's seeds. Although expired seeds may sprout, the sprout rate may be less or the plants may not be as healthy as they could be.

, The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides a map of 11 climate zones in North America that lets gardeners know if the plants of the seeds they are buying for their garden will survive in their part of the country. This can give you a general guidelines to follow when selecting seeds for a garden.

, Some seeds need cool weather for germination, such are cabbages, lettuce, and Brussels sprouts. Others prefer warm to hot weather, such as zucchini, corn, and watermelon. Look on the back of your seed packet for the months to achieve the best germination rate for your gardening zone.

Understand the purpose of grafting.,
Purchase high quality rootstock seeds or plants.,
Select a compatible variety of the same species for the fruit-producing plant.,
Use two plants of the same size.,
Graft during early morning or just after sunset.,
Sanitize your tools to reduce the risk of infection.,
Treat newly grafted plants with special care.",How to Graft Plants1," Fruit plants, including tomatoes and others sometimes thought of as vegetables, are bred and cross-bred over many generations to improve their attributes. However, no one variety is perfect. By removing a section of a plant that produces great fruit and grafting it onto a variety that absorbs nutrients well and resists disease, you can create a plant with the benefits of each.Because you're trying to combine specific attributes, there's no advantage to grafting two plants of the same variety together.The resulting plant will not produce offspring with the same mix of qualities. The seeds are produced by the top, grafted portion only.

, The rootstock plant is the plant that provides a root system and base. Because these are carefully bred for certain qualities, they are typically more expensive than standard seeds, sometimes around 50¢ for a single seed.Pick a rootstock that has the qualities you're looking for.



Generative rootstock puts more energy into producing fruit, but is more vulnerable to disease, cold, and heat. Consider using these in mild climates such as the Pacific Northwest, and harvest small fruit as soon as it ripens.Vegetative rootstock tends to be less fragile and handles heat better, but won't produce fruit quickly. It is ideal for long, hot growing seasons.Pick a rootstock specifically resistant to diseases in your area if you have problems with disease-ridden plants.

, The fruit-producing, or scion, plant produces the better fruit, and its top will be grafted onto the rootstock. Research your rootstock to find out which varieties will thrive when grafted onto it.If you are running a farm or commercial operation, you should research which scion plant will produce the type of fruit you're looking for.


Note: most plants cannot be grafted onto a plant of a different species (for instance, a cucumber cannot grow on a tomato plant). Some plants can be grafted onto related species in the same genus or family, but you should ask an expert or search online to determine whether that applies to your plants before attempting., Grafting is most successful when the rootstock (base) variety and the scion (top) variety have the same size stem. Plant your rootstock seeds and scion seeds in separate, labeled containers. If you know that one variety grows faster than the other, plant at different times so they'll reach the best grafting stage at the same time. The grafting stage for each type of graft is described in the methods below.


Plant several seeds at least of each variety, since there's always a chance some won't grow or survive the grafting process. If you're growing large numbers of plants, you can use an online ""seed calculator"" to determine how many you'll need to plant.

, At these times, the plant will be moving water from its roots to its leaves (transpiring) at a slower rate, which makes it less vulnerable to stress from grafting and the accompanying water loss. Ideally, you should carry out the grafting indoors and in a shaded location.If you can only graft the plants at another time, move them to a shady spot in the early morning of the day you plan to graft.

, Since you'll be making an open cut into the plant, you should keep your hands and tools as clean as possible to reduce the chance of an infection entering the plant. Sanitize your cutting tool before you begin. Scrub your hands with anti-microbial soap and put on latex gloves., Plants that have just been grafted are more vulnerable to temperature changes and infection until the two plants have sealed together. For some types of grafting, you'll need to have a ""healing chamber"" ready where you can control the environment carefully. Chamber construction is described in more detail in the top graft section. The other methods listed here do not require one.

"
"
Choose the plants you wish to grow from a cutting.,
Using sharp garden secateurs (pruners), snip off shoots from the plant.,
Strip a half to two thirds of leaves from the lower part of the cutting.,
Treat the cutting.,
Create the rooting medium.,
Water well when first planted.,
Transplant the cuttings to their final growing spot once you're certain they have taken root.",How to Grow Cuttings from Established Plants," For example, an herb such as rosemary or lavender, a flower such as rose or any other plant. However, be aware that not all plants will grow from a cutting; a good gardening guide will clarify for you whether or not a plant can be produced through a cutting. If not, you might surprise yourself with what you can achieve just through trial and error and not being too fussed if the plant doesn't take.;
, Choose reasonably new but mature growth from the parent plant. Choose a length for the cutting. Generally, cut about 8 to 10 cm/3 to 5 inches for perennial and 15 cm-30 cm/6 to 12 inches for shrubs. Since the size varies according to the plant, you might need to practice some trial and error again. When cutting, unless advised otherwise by advice on the particular plant, cut at a 30 degree angle, leaving the cutting with a point.

Small cuttings are best for smaller plants and shrubs, while larger cuttings (called ""truncheons"") up to a meter or two long and 5-10 cm/2 to 4 inches thick can work best for larger plants such as poplars and mulberries.
If in doubt, make the cuttings about 10-20 cm/4 to 8 inches long.







, Be sure to remove the bottom two leaves and pinch off the top pair of leaves too. Remove flower buds because they will suck the nutrition out that the plant needs during the time it is growing new roots.


It is best to cut the plant about 1/2 cm-1 cm/1/4 inch to 1/2 inch below a knot (a knot has two small branches or two leaves) because roots tend to grow around and underneath a knot.

, Treating the cutting gives it a better chance at taking root because it has nutrients to encourage it. Place the cuttings in a weak mixture of water and a seaweed-based liquid fertilizer for a period of 3-4 hours. If possible, put the cuttings under a single fluorescent light. After this, dip the cut end of the cutting in rooting hormone just before planting it.

, Start the cutting in sand, soil, or even just water. Some cuttings actually produce roots better in water than in soil––again, you'll need to either experiment or read up on the specific plant's preferences. Sand is a sort of compromise, but should be treated like water when it comes to adding fertilizer.

Use a pencil or a chopstick to create the hole for the cutting to slip into. The cut end should be inserted to a depth of around 2.5-5 cm/1-2 inches, although this is dependent on the length of the cutting.
Keep the cuttings out of direct sun.
When using water as the planting medium, make it a very dilute fertilizer mixture. Also make certain the plant does not get direct sunlight, as the intense UV rays are hard on the roots. Aside from how well it works, another reason to use water is that you can see what's happening. This is not only fun (and great to involve the kids in), but also allows you to know when the plant is ready, without having to worry about guessing whether roots have developed. Once roots finally start, the rate of their visible growth can be astonishing, noticeably changing even hour to hour.






If using garden soil, plant cuttings in a moist well prepared garden bed rich in organic material, with a pH around 5.5 - 6.0 (or you can place them in pots with good potting mix). Space the cuttings so they are about as far apart from each other as the cuttings are long.

If using softwood cuttings, take the cutting and stick into moist soil straight in the garden. Simply water them and in a year or two, they'll be growing along with the rest of the garden.



, Then, keep the cutting moist, but not over watered (try a mister). Success rates can be anything between zero (some plants cannot be rooted from cuttings at all) and 90 percent. Try not to get discouraged if it doesn't take; equally, don't be surprised by initial wilting in the first few days––that's normal.


Covering the cuttings with a plastic bag loosely (to allow for continued airflow) can help trap adequate moisture.
Trees are the hardest to grow from cuttings, while cactus and succulents are the easiest. Plants with water retaining leaves like lavender and geraniums work almost 100 percent of the time.

, With large 'truncheons' of willow, poplar or mulberry, trim a point on the bottom end, and ram the cutting into the ground for three quarters of its length, so that just a small part sticks above ground. This action is best done right where you want the tree to grow; no further action is necessary apart from keeping weeds and plant-eating animals (rabbits, deer, kangaroos, etc.) away.


To test for roots, give the cutting a very gentle tug. If you feel resistance, it means that the roots have begun to form and are growing. Don't be rough with this action or you could destroy the cutting.

Construct a healing chamber in advance.,
Add pans of water to the chamber and monitor the environment.,
Choose plants that are 2–5 inches (5–13cm) tall and have equal diameters.,
Cut each plant in half at a 45º angle.,
Join the two plants together with a grafting clip.,
Move the new hybrid plant to a humid, dark environment immediately.,
Gradually return the plant to more sunlight.,
After two weeks, return surviving plants to normal growing conditions.,
Plant the hybrid with the graft clip well above the soil.",How to Graft Plants2," A healing chamber is necessary to protect the newly grafted plants while they are healing. For one or two plants, simply have a large plastic bag handy to place over each plant after the grafting occurs.For a larger number of plants, and a better chance of survival, build or purchase a large wooden or PVC frame, then draping it fully with polyethylene sheeting. Have a tarp or opaque shade cloth ready to block most sunlight from entering the chamber during the first stage of healing.Place a bench in the chamber to hold your plants.


Use a frame with a peaked roof so condensation runs down the sides and doesn't drip onto the plants.;
, Place shallow pans of water around the floor of the chamber to increase the humidity. Before you graft any plants, you should monitor the environment in the healing chamber for at least several days to make sure it is stable. The temperature levels should be constant between 70 and 80ºF (21–27ºC) and the humidity should be 80–95%.Note that you should not store any plants in this chamber until they are grafted.

, Grafting is most successful on young tomato and eggplant plants, whose stems are still green (herbaceous) instead of woody. The stems should not have grown noticeably thicker, and each plant is usually ready when it has 2–4 true leaves. The most important note to remember is that the two plants should have stems with exactly the same size, so they can grow together without difficulty.


Note that the first one or two leaves the plant grows will be ""seed leaves"", not true leaves. These should be easily identified as they will be a different shape or size than the true leaves, but the exact appearance depends on species.
If it's not possible to find stems of exactly the same size, you must use a rootstock (base) stem larger than the scion (top) stem. The other way around will not work.

, Use a sterilized razor blade or sharp knife to cut through the rootstock (base plant) and scion (top plant) stems. While the exact angle is not important, you should use the same angle for each so they fit together as closely as possible. Make the cut in one motion to keep the surface as flat as possible. Discard the top half of the rootstock and the bottom half of the scion plant.


Cut each plant above the smaller lower ""seed leaf"" but below the higher, full size leaves to prevent the scion plant from attempting to grow roots, which can lead to infection.See Understanding Grafting Basics for more information on rootstock and scion plants.

, These clips should be made from silicone or rubber, and should be available at gardening stores or online. Try to match the angles of the cut surfaces as precisely as possible, then hold the plants in place by closing the grafting clip around them.

, The plant must have time to grow the two vascular systems together, which allows sap to flow through the plant. During this time, keep the plant in a humid, dark environment to minimize the amount of water loss from the scion plant until this happens.


The healing chamber described earlier is perfect for this, with an opaque shade protecting it from sun. For a smaller operation, put a plastic bag over the plant and keep out of direct sunlight. Water the base of the plant or mist its leaves if the environment is below 85% humidity., You should keep the plant in the special environment for at least 4 days, and it will often take a week before the leaves return to a full, healthy state. Even then, you should gradually alter the environment for another few days, or up to a week.Increase the amount of sunlight it receives gradually and reduce the humidity by occasionally removing a pan of water or lifting up the plastic a little higher.Wilting is normal for the first day, but mist the plant's leaves if it occurs. If the plant continues to wilt for three or four days, the graft was unsuccessful. Although this method is quite reliable, this still happens about 5% of the time even in the best of circumstances., If the plant's leaves are still wilted, they are not likely to survive, or at least not likely to do well this growing season. The healthy plants can now be returned to normal growing conditions for a seedling about to be planted. The exact conditions will vary according to species.

, The point where the two plants are joined should be at least 1 inch (2.5cm) above the soil, to reduce the chance of the upper scion plant trying to grow roots. There is no need to remove the grafting clip, which should fall off on its own as the plant grows.Do not hesitate to prune away roots growing from the scion or shoots growing from the rootstock. You may also wish to prune away smaller branches so more energy goes into fruit production."
"
Plant the scion seed 5–7 days before the rootstock seed.,
Prepare to graft when both plants have their first true leaf.,
Use a clean razor blade to make a downward cut partly through the rootstock.,
Make an upward cut at a matching angle partly through the scion stem.,
Hook the two plants together at the cut and fasten.,
Wait until the cuts have fully healed together.,
Remove the top of the rootstock plant after about seven days.,
Remove the scion's roots.,
Remove the clip or tape.",How to Graft Plants3," As a general rule, the scion seed, which is selected for its fruit, should be planted earlier than the rootstock seed, selected for other qualities such as disease resistance.You can plant at more precise times if you know the growing rate of each variety.


Plant in small containers. For this method, you will need to attach the two plants while each is still attached to its own roots, so they need to be able to reach each other without being transplanted.

, The first leaves to emerge from a seedling are small seed leaves that do not look like the leaves of an adult plant. After one or two of these have grown, a true leaf with a noticeably different shape will grow. When both plants are at this stage, they are ready to be grafted together.You'll have the highest chance of success if the stems of each plant are almost the same diameter and height, although it's not absolutely vital for this method., You should cut approximately halfway through the stem, with a sharp downward cut, between a 30º and 60º angle.Choose a point on the stem below the seed leaf.Always use a sanitized razor blade and wear latex gloves. This reduces the chance of infection to the plant. Because the cut requires precision, an ordinary sharp knife does not work as well for this method.

, Again, choose a point below the seed leaf and cut approximately halfway through the plant. The cut you make should be angled upward so the two cuts can easily be joined together.

, Hook the upper ""tongue"" of the scion plant into the wedge created by the cut in the rootstock plant. Secure the joint with a grafting clip or by wrapping it in lead tape.Labeling each plant at this point is a great idea, especially if the varieties look similar. If you get them confused in the next step, you could end up removing the best part of each plant instead of the worst.

, Unlike the top grafting method, you do not need to place your new hybrid plant in a special healing chamber, since each plant is still able to transport water from its own roots to its leaves. Keeping them in greenhouse conditions appropriate to the species is still a good idea, especially if you are growing a large number of plants.

, If the plant looks healthy and isn't wilting by now, the graft is probably going to be a success. You can cut off the top of the rootstock plant above the join.Use a sanitized razor blade, as before.

, Keep an eye on the plant's health. If the cut appears healed and the leaves are full and not wilted, you can cut off the scion's lower half, below the join. This is typically done a week after the graft, at the same time you remove the top of the rootstock. If the plant looks slow to recover, you may wait an additional few days to be safe., Now that the cuts have healed and you've successfully joined the two plants, you may remove the clip or tape holding them together. Continue to care for your plant as you would an ordinary, un-grafted plant of the rootstock's variety.

Plant the rootstock plants in advance.,
Prepare to graft the plants in cool weather when the scion plant is budding.,
Make a T-shaped cut on the rootstock plant.,
Cut a healthy bud and attached wood from the scion plant.,
Insert the bud wood into the T cut.,
Tie the plants together.,
Wait for it to heal before removing the binding.,
Cut the rootstock branch some distance above the new bud.,
Once the bud wood has grown a few new leaves, remove the rest of the rootstock branch.",How to Graft Plants4," For roses and similarly sized plants, they should be planted about 1ft (30cm) apart.Plant them in a nursery bed and care for them according to the needs of the species and variety. They can be raised from seeds or cuttings, but they will need to be planted enough in advance that they have sizable, woody stems by the time the scion plant is budding.


Unlike other forms of grafting, which attach a portion of the main plant, budding only requires the scion plant to form buds. This means the scion plant can be a different age or size than the rootstock.
See Understanding Grafting Basics to learn about rootstock and scion plants.

, If the weather is hot and dry, water the rootstock plants heavily for two weeks before grafting. This helps make the bark soft and easy to cut and manipulate., The cut should be about 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) above the ground. The vertical portion of the T shape should be 1–1.5 inches (2.5–4 cm) long, and the horizontal portion should cover about 1/3 the distance around the stem.There should be two flaps of bark, each on one side of the vertical cut, that can be lifted away from the trunk slightly.


Roses and small flowering bushes may be cut 2–4 inches (5–10cm) above the ground instead.As always when cutting into the trunks or stems of plants, it's a good idea to use a sterilized, sharp knife and to wear latex gloves. This reduces the chance your plant will get infected.

, Select a shoot from the scion plant that is growing strongly and healthily, and remove one of its buds. Cut into the wood at an angle to remove a strip of wood beginning 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) below the bud, and ending about 3/4–1 inch (1.9–2.5cm) above it.Carefully pull away this piece of wood, cutting it off from the branch if necessary.

, Gently ease the flaps of bark on either side of the T apart to reveal green wood underneath, called the cambium layer. Insert the strip of wood containing the bud, with the bud pointed upward. Push it carefully into the vertical T cut until the bud is just below the horizontal cut of the T.Each piece should have a layer of green wood lying against each other. You may need to practice several times to cut the plants to the correct level. One rootstock plant can receive several scion buds., You can purchase a special gardening material for this purpose called budding rubber. Otherwise, use wide rubber bands or green tie tape.Do not cover the bud with the wrapping.

, The cuts will take anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks to heal, depending on season.Once the plant looks healthy and the cuts have healed over, remove the binding.

, You don't want the rootstock to grow more shoots, but don't remove it all immediately. Cut the rootstock stem off approximately 12–14 inches (20–30 cm) above where the bud was attached, or a few inches above it if you are working with a small plant. This ""nurse branch"" will help protect the vulnerable place where the two plants were joined.

, Once the wood inserted from the scion has become established and grown a few new leaves, remove the remainder of the rootstock branch above the joint. Cut it down almost the entire way, to about 1/8 in (3 mm) above where the bud was joined. This will put all of the plant's energy into growing the new scion.

Plan to grow cauliflower in cool weather.,
Adjust to a difficult climate.,
Choose a growing site with at least six hours of full sun.,
Start with rich, moisture-retaining soil.,
Start with transplants or grow seeds indoors.,
Transplant the seedling.,
Water consistently, providing 1 - 1.5 inches (2.5 - 3.75 cm) of water per week.,
Mulch the planting area.,
Be ready to protect young cauliflower from pests.,
Fertilize to supplement the cauliflower's growth.,
Blanch the head to prevent it from darkening.,
Harvest when heads are large, white, and firm.,
Treat boron deficiency with seaweed extract.,
Stop clubroot by eliminating infected plants.,
Prevent blackleg by practicing crop rotation.",How to Grow Cauliflower," Most cauliflower varieties require about 1.5-3 months of consistently cool weather to mature properly. Ideally, the daytime temperature while the cauliflower is maturing will be around 60ºF (15.5ºC).This means that the proper planting time depends on your climate:


Cool climates: If your late summer temperatures are below 80ºF (27ºC), you can plant cauliflower for a fall harvest.Start the seeds 8 to 12 weeks before the first fall frost.Warm climates: If you have frost-free winters, you can plant cauliflower seeds later in autumn, once temperatures have dropped below 80ºF (27ºC). Harvest in winter or early spring.Temperate climates: Spring-planted cauliflower is difficult to grow in most climates. The coastal valleys of California are the only major exception, and can support year-round crops.;
, Cauliflower is one of the most temperature-sensitive vegetables around. If the temperature requirements above seem difficult to achieve in your area, you can make the job easier with one or more of these tactics:

Look for ""summer"" or ""tropical"" varieties that can handle warmer temperatures than most.
Wait about a month after the recommended seed-starting date and buy a transplant from a garden store.Plant a new batch every week for 4–6 weeks to see which works best., Though they require cool weather, paradoxically, cauliflower also require a fair amount of full sun during the day. Choose a spot for planting in your garden that receives full sun and isn't shaded by trees, tall grass, or other crops.


You'll also want to make sure that your growing site has ample room for your cauliflower crop. Generally, cauliflower plants will need to be spaced about 18-24 inches apart.

, For a good cauliflower crop, the plant's growth must be completely uninterrupted. This means that the plant must receive consistent moisture and have access to sufficient nutrients as it matures. A good soil makes meeting both of these requirements much easier. Ideally, your cauliflower's soil should have the following qualities:


High organic matter content. This enhances the soil's ability to hold moisture.
High potassium and nitrogen content. Potassium and nitrogen are nutrients vital for the cauliflower's development.If these are not present in the soil, it may be necessary to use fertilizer.
A pH of between 6.5 and 7. This ""sweet"" pH range minimizes the danger of a cauliflower disease called clubroot and maximizes nutrient availability.

, Cauliflower has a reputation for being somewhat fragile. Many people start with seedlings from a local garden store to transplant into their garden. If you have seeds instead, plant them indoors to protect the young plants from weather:


Plant each seed in its own peat or paper cup. The biodegradable container lets you ""plant"" the whole pot in your garden later without damaging the cauliflower's roots.Press the seed about 1/4–1/2 inch (0.6–1.25 cm) deep and cover it with dirt.
Water regularly so the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
In cold weather, keep the soil at 70º F (21º C) with bottom heat from a warming plate.If you must plant your seeds directly in the garden, plant them in rows 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) apart., Whether you grew the plants from seed or bought them from a garden nursery, you'll need to move them outdoors once they have three or four true leaves:Before transplanting, move the seedlings outside for one hour a day. Gradually increase this time over the course of a week to ""harden off"" the seedlings, adapting them to outdoor conditions.
If you used a biodegradable container, bury the container in the ground so the soil level is even with the rest of the garden.
If you used a non-biodegradable container, remove the seedling carefully to avoid breaking its roots. Make a small hole in the ground and bury the seedling up to its stem. You may want to make a shallow, saucer-like depression around the seedling to help the surrounding soil retain water. Firm the soil and water the seedling. , The most important idea when it comes to growing cauliflower is that of consistency. Cauliflower plants need consistent access to moisture and nutrients or their growth won't be consistent. If the plants' growth isn't consistent, the final product that you eat won't have as good of taste or texture. After planting your cauliflower plants, ensure that each receives frequent watering so that its soil is consistently damp (but not waterlogged). This usually means that the plants should be receiving roughly 1 - 1.5 inches of water per week and that the moisture should be penetrating roughly 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep.


Note that rainfall can contribute towards this watering goal. Thus, if you experience frequent rainfall, it's possible that you may rarely need to water.

, Once the seedlings are growing in your garden, cover the soil with a light layer of mulch to help retain moisture and regulate temperature., When cauliflower seedlings are young and fragile, they are vulnerable to a variety of garden pests, including cabbage worm, aphids, harlequin bugs, and more.This especially true in cases where cauliflower is being planted as a spring crop, as the end of the winter months usually coincide with a surge in insect populations. Some of these pests can interfere with the cauliflower's growth cycle - others can eat the plant to ground, ruining your crop entirely, so managing these pests at the first sign of trouble is a top concern for serious gardeners.


Nontoxic pest treatments include diatomaceous earth, soap sprays, and cultural practices such as controlling humidity or introducing predator insects. Look up integrated pest management practices to find out more.
You can also use plant-friendly pesticides, but read the label carefully. Using the wrong pesticide or applying pesticide incorrectly could damage your plants or make the vegetable unsafe to eat.
To prevent pests from reaching your cauliflower, try cutting old milk jugs in half and laying them over the seedlings for protection.

, If growth is slow or you suspect your soil is low quality, test your soil. If your soil is relatively low in nitrogen (N) and potassium (K), bolster these nutrients with fertilizer. Apply a fertilizer high in the missing nutrient(s) every two to three weeks.You may also apply seaweed extract to supply boron, an important nutrient.


For a large home garden, you can use a mixture of 5 quarts of fertilizer for every 100 feet (30.5 m) of crop row.Use a technique called side-dressing to administer your fertilizer to the maturing plant. Dig a shallow, narrow furrow parallel to each row of plants about 6 to 8 inches away from the plants' stems. Pour the fertilizer into this furrow, rake the soil, and then water. This ensures that the fertilizer can be administered in equal, constant proportions to each plant and helps minimize the danger of over-fertilizing.

, As the cauliflower grows, a small ""head"" will begin to form at the center of its leaves (note that this is sometimes also called the ""curd""). For ordinary white cauliflower, if this head is exposed to light while it is growing, it will yellow and darken. Though a darkened head of cauliflower is still edible, it is less visually appealing and will have a less-tender texture. Thus, it's important to use a process called ""blanching"" to keep the head pale and white. When the head is roughly the size of an egg, bend the plant's own leaves over the head so that it is shaded from sunlight. If necessary, use twine or rubber bands to hold the leaves in place.


Trapping moisture around the head can cause the plant to rot. Confirm the head is dry before blanching, and take care not to get any water on the head while it is bound.
Don't bind leaves so tightly around the head that air cannot reach it.
Note that non-white varieties of cauliflower (like purple, green, or orange cauliflower) do not need to be blanched. Additionally, some varieties of white cauliflower are bred to be ""self-blanching"", with leaves that naturally protect the head as it grows.

, After blanching, continue caring for the plant as normal, occasionally removing the leaves around the head to monitor its growth and allow moisture to escape after watering. When the head is large (roughly 6 inches (15.2 cm) across), white, and firm, it is ready to be harvested. This can be anywhere from a few days to a few weeks after blanching, depending on your climate (growth is generally faster in hot weather). Cut the head from the base of the plant with a knife, leaving a few leaves attached to protect the head. Rinse, dry, remove the leaves, and enjoy.


Cauliflower can be stored in a variety of ways. It will last for roughly a week in the refrigerator and can be frozen or pickled for long-term storage. Alternatively, cauliflower can also be stored by pulling the plant up by its roots and hanging it upside down in a cool place for up to a month., If cauliflower doesn't have access to boron, an essential nutrient, it will begin to experience a variety of unappealing symptoms. Its head will turn brown, its leaf tips will die and its leaves will distort, and its stem may become hollow and brown. To treat this problem, boron must be introduced into the plant's soil immediately. Feed the plant with seaweed extract immediately and repeat every two weeks until symptoms disappear.For subsequent crops, add boron to the soil by mixing in compost or planting cover crops of vetch or clover., Clubroot is a fungal infection that causes large growths on the roots of plants in the family Brassicaceae (which includes cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and other plants). These root growths interfere with the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, causing it to grow asymmetrically, wilt, and eventually die. Worst of all is the fact that clubroot is contagious and can easily spread from plant to plant. To prevent a case of clubroot from ruining your entire cauliflower crop, swift, aggressive action must be taken. Pull infected plants up by their roots and discard them (don't compost them). Be sure to remove the entire root system - any fungus left in the ground can release spores and continue spreading.


To prevent clubroot from returning, use one of the following methods:

Improve the drainage of your soil by adding organic matter (clubroot thrives in moist environments).
Plant a cover crop of winter rye and till it into your soil before planting cauliflower.
Rotate your crops. Do not plant brassicas or in the same area two years in a row.
Increase the alkalinity of your soil by mixing in hydrated lime in the fall (clubroot thrives in acidic soils)
Lay thin sheets of clear, construction-grade plastic over infected soil during sunny weather. Leave in place for 1 - 1.5 months. The plastic acts as a sort of ""greenhouse"", trapping the sun's rays to heat the soil and kill the fungus.



, Another common fungal disease of cauliflower is blackleg. Blackleg causes irregular grey lesions or holes in the leaves and is sometimes accompanied by root rot. Like clubroot, this disease is difficult to treat, so preventative cures are the best bet. In particular, crop rotation is an effective technique for reducing the chance of blackleg. Don't plant cauliflower (or another member of the Brassicaceae family) in the same location more than one year in a row - this gives any remaining blackleg fungus in the growing site a year to die off.


Additionally, in the event of blackleg, remove all plant debris left over after a harvest. This dead or dying plant material can contain live fungi for months, leading to the re-infection of the next crop.If you have any doubts about whether certain seeds are contaminated with the fungus or not, washing the seeds in hot water can help remove the fungus prior to planting."

, Purchase seeds for growing mustard greens from a local gardening center, hardware store, or department store. You can also order seeds online. Given the quick growth cycle of mustard greens, you can replant them every two or three weeks to keep up production. If you intend to do so, purchase more accordingly.

, Mustard greens grow best in moist, rich soil. To prepare the soil for planting, spread compost over the planting area, about 3 to 6 inches thick. Carefully turn the compost into the ground with a digging fork, loosening the soil., Mustard greens thrive in cooler temperatures but do not grow well in summer. Aim to start seeds about four weeks before the last frost. The plants can tolerate frost, which actually contributes to a sweeter flavor to the greens., Plant seeds just under the soil, about a half an inch apart. Once the seedlings sprout and grow their first leaves, gently unearth them and pull them apart into clumps. Replant the seedlings approximately 12 inches apart. While this replanting of the seedlings is not necessary, doing so will allow greens to grow faster and yield more., Mustard greens require 2 inches of water per week to thrive. Factoring in rainfall, make sure that they receive adequate hydration. Be sure to keep the soil evenly and consistently watered. , Carefully remove any weeds you see growing around your plants. While mustard greens do not require a lot of room to grow, the influx of weeds can cause unnecessary disturbance, particularly to fragile seedlings. To remove weeds, softly dig them out with your hands, ensuring that the roots are removed as well., To ensure the successful growth of your mustard greens, protect them from bugs that might feed on them (e.g. cabbage worms, cabbage loopers, and flea beetles). Cover plants with row cover fabric, available for purchase at most gardening centers. Since the insects can’t reach the plant under the fabric, they can’t feed on it, or lay eggs to reproduce., Mustard greens should be harvested when the leaves are still young and tender; older leaves will have a more bitter flavor. You can start to pick the leaves after 4 weeks, when they should be about 6-8 inches long (approximately 15-20 cm). You can harvest greens by snipping off outer leaves from the plant, and then leaving it to continue growing. Alternatively, you can unearth the entire plant and harvest all of the leaves at once.Discard any yellow leaves that you find on the plant.

, Pick all your mustard greens and refrigerate them. Leaves can be kept in the crisper drawer for up to a week. Beyond that, you can freeze the greens to be used for cooking later on., When things get too hot, the plants will begin to seed and grow a flower stalk, signalling that no new leaves will grow. At this point you can either dig up the plants, or leave them there to seed. Once the seed pod developing on the plant has dried, you can collect the seeds. Be sure to collect them before the seed pod splits open; seeds that spill onto the soil will likely be dispersed and grow into new plants later on."

Obtain horseradish crowns or roots to plant.,
Find an out of the way place to plant the horseradish.,
Dig a hole about a foot deep.,
Plant the horseradish diagonally.,
Make sure the plant gets plenty of sunlight.,
Water the horseradish once or twice a week.,
Fertilize as needed.,
Prune suckers and weeds from the plant.,
Wait until late fall to harvest horseradish.,
Loosen the soil around the roots and remove the plant.,
Cut away small sections of horseradish to use or store.,
Replant roots sections to keep the plant growing.",How to Grow Horseradish," Purchase a cutting of horseradish from a greenhouse or grocery store. Most of the time, these places will sell crowns (the uppermost part of the plant) or roots that are pre-cut and ready to plant. Most gardeners start horseradish from crowns, as the plant grows from the roots and only its weed-like flowers produce seeds.Like carrots or potatoes, horseradish roots are ready to go straight into the ground.;
, Set aside an area in the corner of your garden to plant the horseradish crop, or designate a unique space such as a barrel or hanging planter to keep it from overtaking other plants. Horseradish takes roots quickly and flourishes in cool conditions, and it can quickly spread throughout your garden if you don’t check its growth.Horseradish is a perennial, so plant it somewhere you'd like to have it growing for years to come.
If you are working with a smaller garden, look into alternative planting methods such as terracing or using contained planting methods like a half barrel or Smart Pot., Loosen the soil about 12 inches deep where you decide to plant the horseradish. Make the hole wide enough to accommodate the entire length of the root, as it should be planted at an angle. Space the horseradish 18-20 inches (46-51 centimeters) away from the nearest plant so that the roots have plenty of room to spread and grow.







, Place the horseradish crown or root into the hole at roughly a 45 degree angle, with the thinner, bottom portion of the root slanted down. This will allow the roots to radiate out beneath the soil while keeping the leaves of the crown vertical above ground. Fill the hole with a shovelful of compost to act as a fertilizer.








Horseradish roots can be buried completely, or you can leave the top of the root visible to track its development.

, Horseradish should ideally be grown somewhere open with ample sun exposure, but a slightly shaded area is also acceptable. Unlike more temperamental plants, horseradish doesn’t require direct sunlight to thrive, although it will help it grow faster. Avoid planting horseradish near walls or fences or beneath trees that might strangle root growth.Horseradishes are perennial plants, so they will come back every year.

, Horseradish roots are very good at retaining moisture and therefore only require watering once or twice throughout the week. Water horseradish plants more frequently in the hot summer months when the soil tends to be drier. Be careful not to overwater horseradish, as this is one of the few conditions that can be harmful to its survival.When watering horseradish, it’s only necessary to keep the soil around the roots slightly damp. Don’t drown them.

, Fertilize during the spring with a high-phosphorus, low-nitrogen fertilizer. Fertilizing is optional, as the compost you used to plant the horseradish should provide sufficient nourishment, but can help the roots grow larger. Keep an eye on the progress of developing horseradish plants and use a fertilizer if the plants’ growth seems stunted or if soil health is poor.Do not fertilize more than once per growing season: in the case of horseradish, once a year in the springtime.

, As the horseradish grows, it will begin to sprout tall leaves known as “suckers” and various types of weeds. Keep these pruned down to prevent them from spreading. A healthy horseradish plant should have only 3-4 leaf stalks—any more may cause unintended spreading and irregular shaped roots should they be allowed to continue growing.Horseradish weeds can also spread undesirably to other plants.
Some weeds take the form of tall, spiked stalks that grow white flowers. This is a common sign that the horseradish has survived the harshest winter weather., A cold-hardy vegetable, horseradish reaches its peak in size and flavor after it has been through a frost, so wait until late fall to harvest horseradish crops. It usually takes around one year for a horseradish plant to reach maturity after its initial planting, so if you first planted the root in fall it should be ready to harvest by the following fall.The growing season for horseradish is one year from fall to fall.
A harsh frost will often kill off the foliage that grows at the crown of the plant. This is a good way to know when the horseradish is ready to be pulled., Use a shovel or trowel to gently loosen the soil beneath the plant’s leaf stalks. Once the root is visible, take hold of it and pull until the entire root system has been removed. Fully-grown horseradish plants will be between 6-10 inches in length, so dig deep to keep from damaging the root.








Accidentally severing any part of the root may result in unwanted growth and spreading.

, Snip away the green leaf stalks on the horseradish crown. These can be thrown away or used as compost. Cut the horseradish into small, thin sections that can easily be used later for cooking or other purposes. Unused horseradish can be stored in a plastic sandwich bag and will keep in the refrigerator for 3 months or longer.








If you know you want to continue growing horseradish, let a few root segments remain in the soil when you harvest.
Wash and dry horseradish roots thoroughly before using them to prepare food.

, If you decide to replant the harvested horseradish, cut the plant roughly 3-4 inches beneath the crown (around the root’s midpoint) and return the root portion to the soil, keeping the crown portion to use in the kitchen. The roots will reestablish themselves on their own, and you can resume regular watering and weeding.




Although the crown of the horseradish can produce a new plant, best results will be achieved by replanting the root system.
If you don’t want the horseradish plant to return after a harvest, you’ll need to make sure that all traces of the plant’s roots have been removed from the soil. Otherwise, they will continue to take up growing."

Enjoy kohlrabi raw or cooked.",How to Grow Kohlrabi," Kohlrabi is a brassica, in the cabbage family. Increasingly popular, kohlrabi is also available in different varieties, all easy to grow, with slight variations in look and time to maturity. The biggest difference is whether or not you pick a green or purple variety.


Green kohlrabi varieties include the Korridor and the Winner, which mature quickly, in about 50 days, compared to about 60 for some other varieties. Bright lime-green in color, they make an attractive addition to a garden bed.
Purple kohlrabi varieties like the Azur Star and Kolibri are particularly bug-resistent, because of the purple leaves on the plant, which keep the insects away. Taste-wise, you won't notice much difference.
Storage varieties like Kossak, Superschmelz, and Gigante are, as you might guess, much larger than the regular varieties of kohlrabi. They'll last longer in the cellar or the fridge, prepared correctly. Taste-wise, these varieties are all very similar.;
, Kohlrabi should be planted in full sun, close to other roots, like potatoes, beets, onions. Kohlrabi are big drinkers and feeders, which means they'll need a good amount of water and fertile soil. It's usually recommended that you plant five or six cabbage-family plants for each member of the household. Sow three times the amount.


Kohlrabi should be kept in a separate part of the garden from pole beans, tomatoes, and strawberries.

, Several weeks before the last frost of spring, Kohlrabi may be planted, which means you can start tilling your soil early. Kohlrabi should be planted in well-tilled soil enriched with compost. It's hardy in most conditions, though it excels in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8.Good drainage is also helpful in avoiding rot and blight in your kohlrabi plants, so make sure you've got an area of the garden that doesn't collect water too much.

, Kohlrabi is a hardy grower that should be planted about a month before the last frost in spring. Ideally, you want the plant to mature before the temperature gets much over 75 F, which means you’ll want to plant it early, among your earliest sows, probably, in an area with a very hot summer. Kohlrabi will mature in 50-60 days.


If you live in a place with warm winters, it’s also common to plant kohlrabi in late autumn to harvest in early winter. The plant should be able to withstand autumn frosts.
If winter's running long, you can start kohlrabi in pots indoors and move the plants outside about a month before the last frost, then plant them after.

, Kohlrabi seeds should be sowed in moist soil about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep and an inch apart, a single seed in each hole. Use your finger to make a small indent in the ground, then cover the seeds loosely with soil. Leave at least an inch between each plant, which you'll thin out later.


Kohlrabi should be planted in rows, which should be spaced about a foot apart to give them room to spread out and mature.

, When you see your starts coming up, weed around them very carefully, paying special attention to milkweed, thistle, and any other local weeds. Kohlrabi are easily beaten out in the beginning, and have a shallow root structure, since the bulb is above ground. The most critical time for kohlrabi is in the first couple of weeks. Let them flourish, then thin them out.

, After a couple of weeks, the plants should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall and you can start thinning out the most successful of them to give them room to grow. Carefully dig up the plants and re-space them, so they're about 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart, moving some to other places in the garden if necessary.


The greens of young kohlrabi can be eaten raw, in salads, or can be thrown into stir-frys as any field green. It's a unique and nutrient-rich way of spicing up a meal.

, After thinning out your kohlrabi, it's important to provide them a bit of structure and nitrogen support, so you should pack some compost around the base of kohlrabi to help hold them up and inject some nutrients into the soil. This can be the big difference between healthy-looking big bulbs and woody in edibles.

, Kohlrabi need lots of water, and do well in relatively mild or Mediterranean climates. If the soil is dry, under-watered kohlrabi will become woody and unpleasant to eat. If the split striations on the bulb start to look dry, increase your waterings.


When watering, water the soil around the base of each bulb, don't water on top of the plants, which can increase the possibility of rot. This goes for most cabbage.

, Kohlrabi and other cabbages are susceptible to cutworms, making it important that you stay on top of these pests as your plants mature. You'll notice holes in the leaves and egg clusters on the underside of the leaves. If you find this, move swiftly.


Wash leaves with egg clusters on them thoroughly, removing the eggs as you find them. It’s common to “collar” the leaf stems of the kohlrabi by tying them up to get the leaves off the ground. This can help to keep the infestation at bay. Bacillus thuringiensis, if you’ve got a serious problem.Keep an eye out for rot, as well. “Cabbage yellows” is easy to recognize, due to the yellowish-brownish color the leaves will take on. Remove infected plants entirely.

, Kohlrabi is ready to be harvested when the stem is about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in diameter, and the bulbs are big and healthy-looking. The bulbs of different varieties will grow to different sizes, so you'll partially be using your judgment. If you let them go too long, kohlrabi will become slightly woody and unpleasant.

, Kohlrabi have a crisp texture and a mild flavor that makes them a versatile and nutrient-rich food for your table. It's like a cross between a cabbage and an apple, sweet and savory at the same time. Roast it up with other root vegetables, bake and mash kohlrabi, or serve it in a mixed vegetable sauté.


Kohlrabi is eaten in Germany as a bar snack, dressed with salt, cut into slices, and served raw. It's maybe the best possible way to eat this crunchy vegetable, served with a mug of beer.

Garden cress is also called broadleaf cress. Curly cress and watercress are other forms of the vegetables, which grow in cool weather. Put cress in either full sun or part shade. Part shade is best for cress.;
, Cress will easily grow from seeds. You can also grow cress if you have stem pieces of cress cuttings. You can obtain cress seeds in home improvement and garden stores or online.Plant cress every two weeks if you want to have a continuous harvest. When using soil to grow cress, choose soil pH of 6.0 to 6.8. Plant the cress in early spring as early as you can work soil. Cover the seed lightly with soil or compost.

, You should plant the cress seeds in your garden early in the spring before the last frost. Cress grows quickly from seeds.You will be able to harvest the cress 15 to 20 days after sowing the cress. Plant more crops until mid summer. You can also plant the cress yet again in early fall and during winter.
Sow cress ¼ inch deep. Sow the seeds thickly in wide rows. Space each row between 18 and 24 inches apart. Try to keep the soil weed free when growing cress.
You can plant cress with carrots or radishes. This is called intercropping.

, Cress needs plenty of water to grow. Keep the cress well-watered throughout the growing season. Don’t let cress roots become dry.

You can spray seedlings daily with water to keep them moist., Seedlings should sprout after five to fifteen days.Once the seedlings are an inch or two tall, you should thin them back until they are six inches apart from one another."

Popular varieties of watercress include English Watercress and Broad Leaf Cress.
You can also start growing from mature watercress purchased at a supermarket or farmer’s market. Just soak the base of the stalks in water for a few days to encourage root growth and proceed to plant them in soil as you would from seed.;
, Choose a large container or planter with drainage holes that is at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep. Add a layer of landscaper’s cloth at the bottom of the container to keep the potting mix from escaping when you water. Add pieces of broken pots or small pebbles to the bottom layer of the container to allow for good drainage.You can also use multiple small containers and place them in a larger drainage tray.
Plastic containers are recommended over terra cotta ones, which can dry out too quickly for watercress.

,


You can also place small pebbles in the drainage tray to allow water to flow freely into the growing container.

, Use a soilless mixture that drains well and contains peat moss and perlite or vermiculite. Leave approximately two inches (5 cm) of space to the top rim of the container and water the soil well.The ideal pH of the potting mix should be 6.5 and 7.5.

, Place the seeds 1/4 inch (.64 cm) deep in the potting mix, allowing three to four inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) between each seed.

, Soak the potting mix deeply enough so that water fills the drainage tray below roughly halfway full, but doesn’t rise higher than the growing container. Replace the water in the drainage tray with fresh water every two to three days.To keep the soil thoroughly cover the surface with a thin, clear plastic sheet that has small holes poked in it, which will retain water and allow airflow. The sheet can be removed when the sprouts begin to appear above the soil.
Mist the soil surface well with water in a spray bottle every other day.

, Position the watercress where it will receive roughly six hours of natural light each day, but try to avoid harsh, direct rays that can burn the young plants.


You can keep the containers indoors or when the weather is regularly between 55˚F and 75˚F (13˚ and 24˚C) where you live, you can place the container outside during warmer months.

, Add a small amount of water-soluble, all-purpose gardening fertilizer to the water in the drainage tray at the package-recommended rate.

, Once the plants have grown roughly five to six inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) in height use kitchen or gardening scissors to trim the top four inches (10.1 cm) of the plant as needed.


Avoid taking more than a third of any plant when cutting to allow the plants enough foliage to continue growing.
Periodic harvesting helps encourage new growth.

, Rinse the watercress in cool water, dry it and use immediately or wrap it in bundles and store in the refrigerator for use with a few days.

Cover the tray with cling film.",How to Grow Cress2," Grow the watercress indoors in a water tray. Obtain a shallow tray, such as a plastic food container from a grocery store. Line it with paper tissue or a sterile potting mix.Wet the paper or potting mix, but don’t add so much water that it’s swimming in it. Sprinkle seeds over the surface. If using potting mix, sprinkle a little mix over the top of the seeds.

, Instead of a shallow container, you could also plant the cress in a three-inch pot that you fill with damp compost.


Sprinkle the seeds onto the surface of the pot. This can be an effective method for growing cress because the cress will eventually starve in a container without soil.
The soil in the pot, especially if it’s damp compost, will provide the cress with enough nutrients to continue growing the cress. Push the seeds lightly into the soil. Check up on your cress every day until it begins to sprout.

, You can use a water sprayer to water the container of cress. You can also soak the container in a bucket filled a few inches of water. The soil will soak up moisture through the bottom. This will only work if you have holes in the bottom of your container., This will stop evaporation. Without the cling film, the cress could dry out fast. You want space an inch or two of space for growth because the seedlings will hit the ceiling of the film eventually. Germination will likely start in about a couple of days."

Cress tastes best during its early seed-leaf stage. Try to cut and eat the cress before it matures. If you want, you can even eat the sprouts of the cress.
Snip the stalks off at the base. Store the cress. You can keep cress in your refrigerator for about one week. Seeds can be allowed to sprout.

, People use cress as an addition to salads or sandwiches. Sometimes people also snip the cress stalks off at their bases in order to use them as a garnish.


Add cress to steamed or boiled potatoes and soups. You can replace parsley with cress. Cress is filled with carotenoids, mustard oil, vitamin K, and antioxidants, including vitamin C.
Once you cut cress, it’s going to continue to grow, yielding additional harvests. You can usually cut cress four or five times before it goes to seed. When it goes to seed, it may still grow, although the taste will be unpalatable.

, There are several different types of cress, although they bear many similarities.


Garden cress, also called broadleaf cress, has light and bright green leaves. It thrives in damp soil.
Curly cress, also called cresson, resembles parsley with its finely divided leaves. It’s dark green and also thrives in damp soil.
Watercress is an annual that is usually grown in water. You can grow watercress indoors in a pot that you set in a tray of water.

, Watercress grows well in cool, but sunny spots with partial shade. Planting watercress in the shallow portion of a steady-flowing, freshwater stream or creek is ideal, but you can also create your own pool or bog of water.


Ideal planting times are in early spring after the last frost, or in early fall before temperatures drop too low.

, If you have a steady flowing stream or creek, simply mix in four to six inches (10.1 to 15.2 cm) of organic compost into the top six to eight inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) of soil., If you don’t have an existing water source, dig a hole that is roughly two feet (61 cm) across and 12 inches (35 cm) deep to create a bog. Line the bottom and sides with a large sheet of heavy plastic pond liner, leaving a four inch (15.2 cm) lip at the top and punch a few holes in the sides for drainage. Fill the lined hole with a mixture of one part garden soil, one part coarse builder's sand, one part compost and a handful of fertilizer., If planting next to a stream, make sure the soil is deeply soaked. If you’ve created a growing site, fill the bog to the brim with water.


If you’ve created a growing site, water the area every two to three days to ensure it remains thoroughly soaked or install a water pump to keep fresh water circulating through the bog.

, Sow the seeds 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) deep and roughly 1/2 inch (12.6 mm) apart, and cover with a thin layer of fine gardening soil.


You can also start the watercress indoors using the method above or transplant mature plants. However, as the plants can be delicate, they may prove difficult to transplant.

, Once the watercress has sprouted, thin the seedlings roughly four to six inches (10.1 to 15.2 cm) apart. If small white flowers appear, trim them back with gardening scissors to encourage new growth.

, Once the plants have grown roughly five to six inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) in height use kitchen or gardening scissors to trim the top four inches (10.1 cm) of the plant as needed.

Many seeds sold for planting are treated with insecticides or fungicides. You need 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of seeds for each 5 square inches (13 cm^2) of container space.;
, Clear plastic containers with clear lids, such as those used for sprouts, berries and other produce at the store, work great for growing sprouts. You can use plastic wrap to cover containers that do not have a clear lid.


The size of the container doesn't really matter as long as it is at least 4 inches (10 cm) deep.
If you want to grow your sprouts in soil, the container must have drainage.

, Fill a bucket with a solution of 9 parts lukewarm water and 1 part household bleach. Soak the containers and the seeds in the water for 20 minutes. Alternatively, you can disinfect only the containers with the bleach solution.

, Some growers have reported higher germination rates from seeds given the longer soak without the bleach.

, Place the seeds in a tea strainer to rinse them.

Sow your seeds in seed pots.,
Prepare the garden 2 to 3 weeks before planting.,
Check the pH level of your soil.,
Transplant your seedlings into the garden.",How to Grow Brussels Sprouts1," Do this approximately 5 to 6 weeks before you want to transplant them into your garden. Plant the seeds 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep. You can keep seed pots inside near a window or outdoors in a protected area as long as daytime temperatures stay above 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10° C). Germination will occur in 2 to 5 days.


Brussels sprouts transplants should be started in April for May planting. Brussels Sprouts can be direct seeded up until mid-late June for a continuous harvest.;
, Till the soil and mix in organic compost. Brussels sprouts do best in loose organic soil that retains moisture. They grow best in full sun but will tolerate partial shade.

, Amend it if necessary, using the appropriate fertilizer. Brussels sprouts like a pH level of 6.0 to 6.5. Soil temperature should be 70-80°F (21-26°C) for optimal growth.


Brussels Sprout is a heavy feeder and will also benefit from applications of boron, calcium and magnesium, particularly during the early stages of growth.

, They are ready when they are 4 to 6 weeks old and around 6 inches (15 cm) tall.


Remove the plants from the seed pots. Soak the root balls in a general plant fertilizer mixed with water before planting them in the garden. Follow the fertilizer manufacturer's guidelines to prepare the correct concentration of fertilizer solution.
Space the plants 24 to 30 inches (61 to 76 cm) apart. If the transplants are spindly or growing crooked, you can bury them in the ground up to the first set of leaves so the plants do not become top heavy.

Test your soil.,
Make sure the soil drains well and is very fertile.,
Choose an area of your garden with full sun.,
Direct-sow your seeds outdoors.,
Plant the broccoli seeds in widely spaced rows.,
Water thoroughly after sowing broccoli seeds.,
Regulate the soil temperature.,
Thin your outdoor seedlings.",How to Grow Broccoli1," Broccoli prefers soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. You can test the soil and add different nutrients to adjust its acidity. Be sure to test the soil periodically throughout the growing process. In addition to pH, the soil test results will tell you if your soil lacks any important nutrients, which you can add with soil amendments.


Your local agricultural extension office should have soil testing forms, bags and instructions available.
If your soil's pH level is below 6.0, add acid compost or planting mix.
If your soil's pH is above 7.0, mix in granular sulfur.;
, If your soil test reveals you have low quality soil, or if your soil drains poorly, there are several things you can do to ready your garden for planting broccoli:


If your soil is prone to flooding, consider building a garden planter box to raise your soil above the ground. If possible, use cedar wood to build your planter box, as it does not rot when exposed to water.
To increase the fertility of your soil, mix up to four inches of mature compost into your soil. If your soil is in particularly poor condition, also add a high-nitrogen organic fertilizer to enrich the soil.
Organic fertilizers like alfalfa, cottonseed meal, and manure are good choices for planting broccoli.

, While broccoli prefers full sun, it will tolerate some shade.

, For a summer harvest, sow seeds two to three weeks before the last spring frost. For a fall harvest, direct sow seeds outdoors 85 to 100 days before the first fall frost.


Alternately, start your seeds indoors. If you choose to start your seeds indoors, plant them in peat pots or other small seedling pots. Keep them in a sunny room.
If sowing seeds indoors, you can plant them earlier and transplant them to the garden 2 or 3 weeks before the last frost. If you plant them in separate pots or tray containers, you won't need to thin them later.

, Organize your plot into rows about 36 inches (90 cm) apart. Dig holes every 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) along each row. Place a few seeds in each hole and cover with soil.


Optionally, you can sow seeds every 6 inches (15 cm) instead and thin out the smaller or less healthy plants as they grow.
Use a rake to lightly smooth the soil over the seeds if you are planting outdoors, but be sure not to disturb the seeds themselves.
Simply pat the soil over your seeds with your fingers if planting in peat pots.

, Drench the soil, but be sure not to leave puddles of water, broccoli enjoys good drainage. If you planted the seeds indoors, use a spray bottle to dampen the soil.

, If direct sowing outdoors, apply an organic mulch made of mature compost, leaves, or bark to keep soil cool. Alternately, if you are planting in cool temperatures, apply a black plastic covering to heat the soil. You can buy plastic coverings at your local garden supply store, but any semi-sturdy black plastic such as a tarp will work.

, When your outdoor seedlings reach one inch (2.5 cm) in height, you may need to thin the plants in order to allow them space to grow. Remove smaller or unhealthy-looking plants until the survivors are 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) apart. This will prevent overcrowding as the broccoli plants continue to grow."

Put a thin layer of moist, sterilized potting soil in the clean containers.

,
Sprinkle the wet broccoli sprout seeds in a thin layer on top of the soil.

,
Cover the seeds with another thin layer of moist potting soil.

,
Put the covers on the containers or cover the tops with clear plastic wrap.,
Place the container in a place where it won't be disturbed and is out of direct sunlight.,
Move the containers to an area of indirect sunlight on the 4th day or when first leaves appear.,
Harvest your sprouts within 1 to 2 days after leaves appear.,
Agitate the water to move the sprouts around.,
Skim the seed hulls off of the water surface and discard them.",How to Grow Broccoli Sprouts2,",,, When growing your sprouts in soil, ventilation is not usually necessary. However, if too much moisture should build in the container, make a couple of air holes.

, Until leaves appear the sprouts do not require any light. Kept at a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 to 23.8 C), the seeds should sprout in 3 to 5 days.

, Direct sunlight will kill them, but the sprouts need some light exposure now if you want the leaves to stay green.

, Use your hands to pull the sprouts from the soil and transfer them to a large bowl of cool water.

, This cleans the dirt from the sprouts and causes the hulls from the seeds to dislodge and float to the surface of the water.

, The hulls retain moisture, and if stored with the sprouts may lessen their shelf life.

"
"
Place a few layers of wet white paper towels in the bottom of a sterilized container.

,
Sprinkle a thin layer of seeds on top of the wet towels.,
Cover the containers with a clear ventilated lid or use plastic wrap with air holes cut out.

,
Place the containers near a window but not in direct sunlight, or put them under a fluorescent light if the room in which you are growing them is not warm enough.,
Harvest the sprouts by hand and rinse them to remove hulls 3 to 5 days after they sprout.

",How to Grow Broccoli Sprouts3,", Leave the seeds uncovered.

,, When growing without soil, seeds require temperatures to be at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 C) to germinate.

"
Water the plants at the base after transplanting.,
Feed Brussels sprouts with a nitrogen fertilizer every few weeks.,
Add organic compost to the top of the soil around the plants regularly.",How to Grow Brussels Sprouts2," Keep them well watered throughout the growing season to prevent the ground from drying out. Reduce the amount of water a couple of weeks before harvest; allow the ground to dry between watering.


Ensure to water the crop adequately during the growing season as the plants require water for growth and sprout development. However, Brussels sprouts need a large amount of water but do not like standing water. That being said, lighter soils will require more frequent waterings than heavier soils.

, Stop fertilizing when you cut back on watering at the end of the growing season.


In addition, removing the growing tip of the plant about a month before the harvesting date will result in greater yields as the plant will divert energy from leaf growth into developing the Brussels sprouts.

, This feeds the plants and provides a barrier for weeds. Brussels sprouts have a very shallow root system, so avoid disturbing the soil around them.


Weed the area carefully by hand if needed. Aphids and cabbage worms are common pests that will affect the sprouts. Maintaining the soil PH at 6.5 or above will help prevent certain diseases such as club root (a soil borne fungus).

"
"
Harvest your Brussels sprouts slowly, starting at the bottom of the plant.,
Pick the sprouts when they are 1 to 1-1/2 inches (2.5 to 4 cm) in diameter.,
Harvest the entire stalk with the buds intact instead of doing a slow harvest.,
Finished.

",How to Grow Brussels Sprouts3," The sprouts mature from the bottom up and are at their sweetest when they are still small and tightly closed.


To encourage development of the upper sprouts, pinch out the growing tip of the Brussels sprouts plant in late summer. The Brussels sprouts will develop a sweeter flavor after a few light frosts.

, Pinch them off with your fingers or use a small knife to cut the buds off.


The sprouts form in the leaf axils (the point between where the leaf joins the stem) and can be harvested around 3 months after planting.

, Cut the stem a few inches below the bottom bud when the leaves on the plant start to turn yellow.


Store the sprouts in a cool dark place. Like most things sprouts taste best when they are fresh.

"
Transplant seedlings when they are four to six inches in height.,
Water the bed thoroughly before setting out seedlings.,
Dig holes about three inches deep and space seedlings one to two feet apart.,
Regulate the soil temperature.,
Dampen the soil with a thorough watering after transplanting.

",How to Grow Broccoli2," Usually this will take about six weeks. The height and plant development are more important than the duration of the germination process.

, Make sure you have completed the proper soil preparation methods outlined above before transplanting your seedlings, including fertilizing the soil.

, Position plants to the same depth they were in pots/containers. Miniature varieties can be planted as close as one foot apart.

, For summer plantings, apply an organic mulch of compost, leaves, or bark to keep soil cool. For winter plantings, apply a black plastic covering to heat the soil.,"
"
Water your broccoli plants regularly.,
Fertilize your plants about three weeks after planting.,
Avoid digging or turning the soil.,
Harvest your broccoli plants.",How to Grow Broccoli3," Allow your plants between one and one and a half inches of water per week. Broccoli likes moist soil.


You can use a rain gauge to see how much water the plants are getting naturally, and make up the difference with irrigation.
Make sure not to get the budding broccoli crowns wet when watering. Doing so causes them to mold.
In particularly hot or dry conditions, increase the amount of water you feed your plants.

, Use an organic, nitrogen-rich fertilizer when your broccoli plants begin to form new leaves. Fish emulsion works well for fertilizing broccoli plants. You can continue to fertilize the plants about once a week until they are ready for harvest.

, Broccoli plants have very shallow roots. If you disturb the soil you may accidentally break roots and damage your broccoli plants.


If weeds develop around the plants, suffocate them with mulch instead of plucking them from the ground to avoid disturbing the roots.If you choose not to grow organically, you can also use a chemical pesticide to remove unwanted weeds from your garden without disturbing the broccoli roots.

, You want to harvest your broccoli crowns when the buds are tightly closed and dark green. Avoid waiting until the buds begin to flower into light green or yellow flowers. Cut the crown where it meets the stem using garden shears.


See ""Choosing a Variety"" above for exact growing times for specific varieties.
Avoid breaking the crown off. A clean cut will better encourage new growth.
With a healthy cut, the broccoli plant should grow small shoots from the side of the stem. You can continue to harvest the small shoots, and the plant should produce more."

Choose a large-headed variety if you have plenty of growing space.,
Choose a sprouting variety to plant in a mild winter climate.,
Choose a romanesco variety if you have good quality soil.,
Choose broccoli raab to grow broccoli quickly in a cool climate.",How to Grow Broccoli4," Large-headed varieties produce large crowns between fall and spring. These are the most commonly found variety. These varieties take 50 to 70 days to mature if planted in the spring, and 65 to 90 days to mature if planted in the fall. Large headed varieties include:


Arcadia
Belstar
Munchkin
Nutri-Bud
Pac-man

, Sprouting varieties are characterized by their bushy appearance and small crown size. They develop best between fall and spring. These varieties take 50 to 70 days to mature if planted in the spring, and 65 to 90 days to mature if planted in the fall. Sprouting varieties include:


Calabrese
De Cicco
Purple Peacock
Purple Sprouting

, Romanesco varieties grow in swirled, cone-shaped crowns that look very ornamental in the garden and are crunchy when eaten. Romanesco varieties prefer temperatures in the 80-degree range and plenty of water. These varieties take 75 to 90 days to mature if planted in the spring, and 85 to 100 days to mature if planted in the fall. Romanesco varieties include:


Natalino
Romanesco Italia
Veronica

, These varieties are harvested as buds, making them richer in flavor that other varieties. They take only 40 to 55 days to mature if planted in the spring, and 50 to 75 days to mature if planted in the fall. Broccoli raab varieties include:

Plant directly in it.",How to Use Your Compost," As long as you maintain the pile weekly, it should be clear when it’s ready. It's ready when it is:


dark brown or black
soft
crumbly
mostly smooth (you can throw that stubborn corncob back in the pile)
earthy-smelling;
, Make a potting mixture of 1 part compost to 3 parts soil and put in pots, about an inch / 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) short of the brim. Plant your seeds in these pots just as you would any other soil.

, Plants that already have roots can handle more compost, so your potting mixture for seedlings or transplanting plants can be 1 part compost to 2 parts soil.

, If your potted plants (or flowers, herbs, vegetables) are already growing, use the compost with nothing added and sprinkle on the surface of the dirt. (If you don’t have room, you can shovel out a layer of the dirt that’s already in the pot and replace it with the compost).

, Use finished compost in a layer on top of your soil to nourish the plants underneath. Water will carry nutrients down, into the soil. This is called top-dressing. You can top-dress a garden, a tree, even a lawn (just sprinkle it in).


Compost also makes an excellent layer in any no-dig garden. In this kind of a use, especially in a raised bed, you can make the layer as thick as you like.

, As you dig garden beds, add as much compost as you like and mix it with the soil as you put it back. It's a great amendment for both sandy and clay soils.

, If you have ever had a tomato or pumpkin seed volunteer in a compost pile, you will know that some plants don't mind growing directly in compost. It can be a little strong for others, and carbon (brown stuff) that is still decomposing can rob plants of nitrogen, but if you have a few extra vegetable seeds, see if any of them would be happy directly in your finished compost pile. You can spread the compost out a bit first or move it to another spot, if you prefer.

The contents of the composter need to be moist but not wet.,
When adding water, use well water or water that has allowed to sit overnight so chlorine can evaporate.,
Tumble your composter at least once a week.,
In a composter that is working well, the contents should feel warm to the touch.

Know when to plant.",How to Grow Kale1," Kale is usually grouped by leaf shape, and although growing times vary between varieties, most kale is ready for harvest between 45 and 75 days after transplanting.



Curly Kale is sweet and mild and is one of the most commonly found kale varieties. It is characterized by its curly, wrinkled leaves.

Lacinato or Dino Kale also has a wrinkled texture, though its leaves are tall and skinny.

Premier Kale is known for its cold hardiness and its ability to grow quickly.

Siberian Kale is the hardiest variety that (as the name suggests) can withstand harsh temperatures and easily resist pests.

Red Russian Kale has impressive red twisting leaves. It is similar in its resilience to Siberian kale.

Redbor Kale is a dramatic deep purple and red kale, perfect for adding color to any dish.

Walking Stick Kale has a thick stalk that can grow up to six feet tall. The stalk can be used as a walking stick, hence the variety name.;
, You will need at least six square inches of growing space per plant regardless of your container type. Choose an area with full sunshine if you’re planting during the fall, and an area with partial shade if you're planting in the spring.


Avoid low-lying areas and spaces where water tends to collect and/or flood. If you do not have an area with suitable drainage, you can build a raised garden bed.
Use cedar planks to build your garden bed, as cedar does not rot when it gets wet.

, Make sure that you plant your kale in fertile, loamy soil, amended with nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium if it is low in these nutrients. Sandy or clay-like soil will hurt the kale's flavor and production ability. Kale prefers soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8.


If the pH level is below 5.5, enrich the soil to make it less acidic.
If the soil pH is above 6.8, mix in granular sulfur to lower the pH level.

, If you're starting your seeds or starts indoors, plant them between five and seven weeks before the last frost. If you're going to start your kale outside, plant the seeds two to four weeks before the last frost or at least 10 weeks before the first frost in the fall.For kale seeds to germinate, the soil temperature just has to be at least 40 °F (4 °C).
Kale seeds sprout most effectively in a soil temperature of 70 °F (21 °C).

Add coffee grounds to your compost.,
Add grounds to the soil directly to increase acidity.,
Consider adding lime to balance coffee's pH.,
Use coffee grounds to add nutrients to your soil.,
Optionally, make a liquid plant food.",How to Use Coffee Grounds in Your Garden1," One of the simplest ways to use leftover grounds is to add them to the rest of your compost. In addition to providing extra organic matter, coffee grounds are able to speed up the decomposing process in compost. Getting this benefit is as easy as pouring the leftover grounds into the compost pile and mixing to incorporate them.


There are two main types of composting materials: ""green"" compost and ""brown"" compost. Coffee grounds are considered to be ""green"" compost along with other wet, nutrient rich materials. If you add a lot of coffee grounds to your compost, balance it out by adding some ""brown"" compost as well — dry, bulky materials like dry leaves, twigs, newspaper, straw, corn husks, sawdust, and so on.;
, On their own, coffee grounds have a pH of about 5.1 — fairly acidic compared to the soil in most gardens. Though this can be too acidic for some plants, it's perfect for some that require extra-high acidity. Just sprinkle a handful of grounds near the roots of the plants at the start of the growing season to get the acidifying effect. Blueberries, cranberries, and citrus fruits like coffee added to their soil. Other coffee-loving plants include camellias, gardenias, rhododendrons, and vireyas.Some flowering plants will give different-colored blooms in acidic soil. For example, the addition of coffee grounds to hydrangeas is good for blue blooms.

, As noted above, coffee grounds' natural acidity can make them inappropriate for many ""average"" gardens. To mitigate this, mix a pinch of lime with the grounds. Lime is naturally alkaline (or ""basic,"" the opposite of acidic) and will work against the acidity in the coffee grounds. This lets you add coffee grounds directly to your garden as a mulch or soil conditioner.


Lime (often sold as ""garden lime"" or ""agricultural lime"") is a powdery substance that's not related to the green citrus fruit of the same name. You can usually find it at hardware stores or gardening supply stores for fairly cheap.

, Acidity isn't the only thing that coffee ground have to offer. They are rich in several nutrients that are critical to healthy plants, so if your garden lacks these, coffee grounds are an excellent choice. See below:Coffee grounds are rich in:

Nitrogen
Magnesium
Potassium
Coffee grounds are not rich in:

Phosphorous
Calcium

, You don't need to use the coffee grounds themselves in your garden — you can also make a nutritious plant food from them and use it instead. To do this, place a handful of coffee grounds into a bucket of water. Let it sit in a cool, out-of-the-way place (like your garage) for a day or two. It should create a nice amber-colored liquid. Strain the remaining grounds out, then use the liquid to water your plants.


It will have the same acidity and nutrient content as normal coffee grounds, so use it with caution if your plants don't require high acidity or nitrogen, potassium, etc.

Mix soil and fertilizer in small pots at least six square inches.,
Alternately, churn your garden soil and add fertilizer to sow seeds directly into the garden.,
Sow seeds under a thin layer of soil.,
Water the plant thoroughly.,
Grow the seedlings until they are three to four inches high.",How to Grow Kale2," Use organic fertilizers and composts when possible. Kale particularly likes fish emulsion and compost tea.

, Be sure that you sow seeds two to four weeks before the last frost date if you are planting directly in the garden.


If the plants start to crowd each other as they grow, you can always further thin the plants out to allow for more space between each plant.

, Kale seeds are small and can only grow through ¼ to ½ inch (6–12 mm) of soil. Space the seeds about three inches (7.5 cm) apart. Pat the soil lightly to cover the seeds.

, While the seeds grow, allow the top layer of the soil to dry out between watering.

, At this point, your kale seedlings should have at least four developed leaves. It takes four to six weeks for your seedlings to reach this stage.

"

Water your plants thoroughly.

",How to Grow Kale3," Follow the directions for your specific type of fertilizer for precise amounts. For compost and mulch, spread a layer a few inches deep. For seaweed powder or rock dust, apply a thin, even sprinkle.

, Do so by gently patting the container on its side if you used plastic pots to start your seedlings. If you purchased kale starts at a garden supply store or nursery instead of starting with seeds, simply remove the purchased seedlings from their plastic containers.

, The holes should be just deep enough to plant the seedlings at the same level they were growing in the pot. If you are planting multiple rows, make sure that the rows are 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61.0 cm) apart.

, Pat the soil down to the same level it was in the plant, without burying any leaves. Make sure to plant the starts perpendicular to the ground, regardless of the shape of the roots.

Harvest the kale about 70-95 days after sowing and 55-75 days after transferring to your garden.,Enjoy your fresh kale!",How to Grow Kale4," Depending on the amount of sun your plants receive, you may have to water them as often as every day.

, Fertilizer helps the kale grow strong and robust and keeps it producing healthy, sweet leaves.

, Make sure that the kale is at least six inches tall before you mulch your plants. Mulching helps prevent wet soil from sticking to leaves and molding them.

, Doing so helps to reduce the chance of harmful pests.

, The plant should be at least eight inches tall before you harvest the leaves. Be aware that growing time varies according to each variety, so be sure to look up the appropriate time before harvesting.


Pick off the outside leaves first if just harvesting individual leaves.
If harvesting the entire plant, cut the stem down to about two inches above the soil with one clean cut. This will allow the plant to continue to produce leaves.
Don't leave the leaves on the plant for too long after they are ready for harvest. Doing so will produce bitter, tough leaves.,"

Use grounds to deter pests.,
Use grounds to keep cats out of your garden.,
Use coffee grounds as worm food.,
Use grounds to discourage fungal infection.",How to Use Coffee Grounds in Your Garden2," Slugs and snails can chew up your most prized plants, but they are not fond of coffee grounds. Sprinkle a handful of grounds around the bases of plants you want to protect. If you're worried about increasing the acidity of the soil, make a solid ring of grounds farther away from the base.


It's thought that this works because the caffeine in the coffee grounds hurts these pests., Coffee grounds aren't just good for tiny pests. They can also be used to keep feline friends from playing in your delicate plants. In this case, use the grounds just as you'd use them to repel snails — sprinkle them around the plants you want to protect. The acidifying effect on the soil may be unavoidable here due to how much you'll need to use.

, If you participate in vermiculture (raising worms), you have a great opportunity to use up your coffee grounds. Worms love to eat coffee grounds, so feel free to add plenty to your worm bin or a worm-containing compost pile. Note, however, that coffee grounds should be part of a balanced diet: fruit and vegetable scraps, newspaper, leaves, and so on should accompany any coffee grounds you add., There is some evidence that coffee grounds can be used to prevent certain types of fungus from attacking your plants. A light sprinkling of coffee grounds may be able to prevent Fusarium, Pythium, and Sclerotinia species of fungi from taking root. Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers are especially vulnerable to fungal infections, so coffee grounds make an especially good choice for these plants."

, Continued aeration, or at least stirring the tea periodically, will also help prolong its useful life.

, It is best to apply spray applications early in the morning or just before dusk to minimize the effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays. Use a spray bottle for indoor or small outdoor plants and a garden sprayer for larger foliar applications.

, When using compost tea for a soil drench application, make sure that the tea is applied so that it seeps into the plants' root zone by applying additional water after the compost tea application.

, When drenching a medium-sized plant, use 2 cups (.5 l) compost tea plus enough water to push the compost tea down into the plant roots.

, Apply the tea immediately before or after watering one or two times per month throughout the grass growing season.

,, When conditions exist that are favorable for these or other similar diseases, apply compost tea before an outbreak.

For the first pass with the tiller, the depth adjustor should be all the way up, as you don’t want to go too deep on your first till.
If the depth adjustor is up all the way, you don’t have to tip the tines down as far to get the pin off the ground, meaning your pass will be shallow.;
, Always wear safety glasses when tilling, as rocks, dirt, and debris can be thrown around by the tines. It’s also a good idea to wear long sleeves and pants to protect your arms and legs from projectiles. Heavy or steel toe boots are also recommended to protect your toes from the tines.


Never wear sandals or open-toed shoes when operating a tiller, lawn mower, or other machine with blades.

, Motorized tillers have an On and Off switch located on the engine. While you can't flip the switch and turn the tiller on, the machine does have to be on before you can start the motor.

, Tillers are motor-powered machines, and before you can start the engine, you have to open the throttle. This will allow fuel into the engine.


Many tillers will have a rabbit and turtle on the throttle to indicate the position. When you're starting your tiller, push the lever to the rabbit to open the throttle., The choke is a valve that controls air intake in the engine. In order to start your engine, you want to engage the choke and close the valve, as this will provide a richer fuel supply to the engine, making it easier to start.If the engine gets too much air when it’s trying to start up, it won’t have enough fuel to get going.

Pull up the levers under the handles.,
Tip the tiller forward.,
Make passes on alternating rows.,
Go over the area again in the opposite direction.,
Turn the machine off.,
Use a hand tiller instead.",How to Use a Tiller2," Once the motor is started, you'll notice that the tines still aren't turning. To engage the tines, squeeze the levers under each handle to spin the tines.On a tiller with the tines in front, the forward motion is controlled by you. To prevent the tiller from moving forward when the tines are engaged, you'll have to pull back on the handles to hold the machine in place.

, When you want to move forward and till the ground, raise the handles upward to tip the tines downward into the soil. As you push the tines into the ground, they will begin to churn the soil. Walk forward at a normal walking pace, keeping the tiller tipped at the same depth.


As you push the tiller forward, the tines will continue breaking up all the soil they come into contact with.

, When you get to the end of your first row, push the machine forward in a curving motion to turn it around. Rather than trying to till the soil in the row directly beside you, move over by one row to till your next pass.


Backyard tillers aren't always easy to turn, and tilling every other row will make it easier to maneuver the machine., Once you’ve gone over each row and tilled the entire area once, repeat the same process, working in the opposite direction. For instance, if you tilled in horizontal passes the first time around, do vertical passes this time.On the second pass, push the tines farther into the soil to till at a deeper depth.
Changing your direction and making two passes with the tiller will ensure you fully till all the soil and blend in all the organic matter.

, When you’ve finished tilling the soil, release the levers under the handles to stop the tines from moving. Turn the machine off by flicking the switch on the engine.

, A hand tiller is a manual, non-motorized tiller. Some hand tillers have a bladed wheel that let you push the tiller forward when it’s in the ground, but others have to be moved from one spot to another. To start, push the blades or spikes into the soil to the right tilling depth for your garden, usually between 6 and 8 inches (15 and 20 cm).


For a tiller with a bladed wheel, push the tiller forward while it’s in the ground. This will rotate the blades and till the soil.
For a tiller without the wheel, twist the tiller as you pull it straight out of the ground. Move the tiller over to an adjacent patch of soil, insert the spikes and repeat.

Remove existing sod, plants, and weeds.,
Remove obstructions.,
Test and evaluate the soil.,
Amend the soil.",How to Use a Tiller3," To make the job of tilling easier and more effective, it’s important to remove any grass or plants that are already growing in the soil you want to till. The purpose of tilling is to prepare the soil for new plants, so you start by removing the old growth.Use a shovel to dig into the ground around the roots of existing plants or weeds. Start a few inches (several centimeters) away from the plant and dig in at a 45-degree angle toward the center of the roots. Sever the roots with the shovel and pull the plants out by hand. Wear gardening gloves to do this.
To remove sod, you can use a shovel to dig out small patches at a time, use an herbicide to kill the lawn, use a sod cutter, or kill the lawn by depriving it of light.

, Rocks, large stones, tree roots, and other obstructions make it difficult to till land. Large rocks especially get in the way of the tiller, so it’s best to move them before you till. With a wheelbarrow, walk up and down the land you want to till. Look out for rocks, roots, and other items that aren't soil. Place anything you find into the wheelbarrow.


These objects are also obstructions for seedlings that are trying to grow, so your plants will have a better chance if the land is clear.

, Different plants need certain soil conditions to thrive, and if your soil doesn’t meet those needs, then your plants may die. Two qualities you should evaluate for are soil type and pH. You can test pH with a test kit that you can buy at garden stores, home and hardware stores, and online. To determine the soil type:Take a hose and soak a small section of the soil in your garden.
Grab a small handful of soil and squeeze it into a ball.
Place the ball somewhere well-ventilated but protected from rain.
Let the ball dry out for 24 hours.
When dry, pick up the ball of soil.
A tight ball indicates clay. A ball that crumbles or loses its shape is mostly sand. A crumbly ball that loosely holds its shape is loam, which is ideal.

, In order to make the conditions more favorable for your plants, you can amend the soil with certain organic matters to make it more suitable for growing. For instance, you can add specific soils to create loam, and can add different things to adjust the pH.


For a garden with a high pH and acidic soil, sprinkle lime or wood ash over the soil before tilling to balance the pH.For a garden with a low pH and alkaline soil, sprinkle sawdust, peat moss, or compost.
For a garden with sandy or clay-like soil, add 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of aged compost, manure, peat moss, or shredded leaves.

Plant grass and shrubs.,
Add mulch or rocks.,
Use mulch matting to hold vegetation on slopes.,
Put down fiber logs.,
Build retaining walls.,
Improve drainage.,
Reduce watering if possible.,
Avoid soil compaction.",How to Prevent Soil Erosion1," Bare soil is easily swept away by wind and water, the two main causes of erosion. Plant roots hold the soil together, while their leaves block rain and stop it breaking the soil apart.Turf, ornamental grass, and low, spreading shrubs work best, since they cover the soil completely.


If you have any bare ground, try to establish plant cover as soon as possible to limit erosion.
If the ground is mostly flat (slope of 3:1 or less), this might be enough to solve the problem.Steep slopes erode faster, so they need more protection.;
, This will weigh down the soil and protect the seeds and young plants underneath from getting washed away. It also slows the absorption of water to reduce runoff. Grass clippings or bark chips work especially well.If you plant something in the soil, the plant’s roots can hold the soil together. If you don’t plant anything, then keep the soil covered with mulch. You can also add mulch around plants to add another layer of protection or to keep the soil warm.

, Fiber mulch mats or erosion control mats are a layer of mulch held together in a fiber mesh. This structure holds the mulch together in areas where normal mulch would be washed or blown away.Lay the mat over seeds or young plants.


On steep slopes, dig a small trench at the top of the hill. Lay the top of the mat in the trench, fill it up with soil, then fold the mat back over the top. This helps water run over the top of the mat, where the mat will slow it down, instead of traveling underneath it., Another option for erosion control on steep slopes is a series of rolled up logs or ""wattles"" made from fibrous material (like straw). Water running down the slope will slow down when it hits the logs, soaking into the soil instead of carrying mud downhill. Put the logs down across the slope, 10 to 25 feet (3–8m) apart. Hold them in place with wooden stakes or sturdy, living plants.You can plant seeds directly in the logs to protect them while they grow.

, Badly eroded slopes will continue to collapse downhill until they are stabilized. A retaining wall at the base of the slope will block the soil and slow down the collapse. This gives grass or other plants time to grow and help the soil hold together.


Give the wall a 2% slope on the side (perpendicular to the incline) so that water flows off to the side instead of pooling.You may build the wall from concrete blocks, rock, or wood. Only use wood treated with a preservative to prevent rot.Use retaining walls around flowerbeds and other raised soil areas as well.
You may need local government approval to build these structures.

, All buildings should have gutters or pipes that can drain water effectively out of your garden and into water collection systems. Without adequate drainage, heavy rain could wash away a whole layer of topsoil.


Areas with heavy water runoff may require installing an underground perforated drainage pipe.

, Over-watering your garden can speed up erosion by washing away soil. Use less water if you can, or install a drip irrigation system. Since a drip system only delivers small amounts of water at a time, there is no water flooding across the surface to carry topsoil.


You can also install drip lines underground to deliver water directly to the roots.

, When people, animals, or machines travel over soil, they press it down, compacting the soil into a dense layer. Since there is less space between dirt particles in compacted soil, water has a hard time draining through, and carries soil on the surface downhill instead. Walk on paving stones or cleared paths instead of trampling the soil, especially when it is wet. Adding compost or manure can also help by attracting earthworms, which break the soil into looser clumps.


Compacted soil also makes it harder for plants to become established, since the roots have trouble breaking through.Compaction always lead to net erosion. The water may run off of compacted soil, but as it runs off it generates more force, which can increase the erosion in other areas.

Get your leaves in a pile.,
Shred your leaves.,
Prepare a compost bin.",How to Turn Dead Leaves Into Mulch1," To start, rake up the leaves in your yard. You want to gather all the leaves together so you can prepare to turn them into mulch.If you have a smaller yard, you may only need one big pile of leaves.
If you have a bigger yard, you may have to make a series of piles to rake up all the leaves.;
, To make mulch, you will need to shred your leaves. There are many different ways you can do this.If you have a leaf shredder or wood chopper, try feeding your leaves through this machine.
If you don't have one of these machines, you can run a lawn mower over your leaves to shred them. You will have to thin your piles out a little so the lawnmower can run over them.

, You need a compost bin for the process of turning leaves into mulch. If you already have a compost bin, you can use that. If you don't, you will need to prepare one.You can purchase a compost bin at a local hardware store. It's important the bin be at least 3 by 3 feet.
You will probably end up with several 12 to 18 inch layers of leaves, so make sure the compost bin you select can accommodate this.

, Tomatoes favor a more acidic soil with a pH of 6.2 to 6.8. Use a pH soil testing kit, available at home improvement and garden stores, to test the pH levels of the soil.

,, Using a trowel or shovel, move the soil while it is dry. Working with wet soil will make it difficult to move and aerate, and it will stick to your tools. If soil pH conditions aren't ideal for growing tomato plants, add fertilizer to prepare your soil for planting.

, Apply peat moss, compost or manure to the soil to improve its quality. Mix in small amounts of any or each of these components as you dig and mix your soil prior to planting. The richer the soil, the better the growing conditions.

, Tomato plants require being set deeply in the soil, up to their first leaves.

,, Dissolve 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of fertilizer into 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Apply 1 cup (240 ml) of the solution to the base of each tomato plant. For larger areas, apply 2 lbs. (907 g) of fertilizer per 100 square feet.

Understand that it takes a couple of years to prepare your soil for optimal gardening.,
Begin soil preparation by digging out the area of your vegetable garden.,
Analyze the soil to determine its condition.,
Cultivate the soil by turning it with a shovel or rototiller.,
Mix some fertilizer into the soil to prepare it for growing vegetables successfully.,
Add topsoil to the surface of your garden area.,
Allow the cultivated soil to sit for a couple of days before planting.,
Ideally you should prepare vegetable garden soil with compost 2 seasons ahead of the time you plant your vegetables.",How to Prepare the Soil for a Vegetable Garden," You don't have to wait 2 years to plant your garden, however. There are steps that you can take that will allow you to grow a good garden presently.;
, Create the perimeter first by digging the edge of the garden area before breaking the ground in-between. Remove the top layer of sod with a shovel. If the area is not a grassy spot, then just remove weeds, rocks and debris.

, Too much sand in the soil may make the soil dry, and too much clay may make it too wet. In order to grow a successful garden, your soil should be a good combination of earth, sand and clay. You can send a sample to your local garden center and get it analyzed.

, Tilling the soil breaks it up and prepares it for planting. Till the soil 12-inches (30 cm) down. Using a rototiller will make this process faster than if you do it by hand. Continue to remove rocks and debris as you work.

, Opt for compost, humus or manure. Space the bags out on top of the plowed ground. Break open the bags and pour the compost onto the ground. Spread the fertilizer around the area with a rake. Work the compost into the tilled ground by piercing the cultivated soil at least 6 inches (15 cm) down with a shovel and turning the soil to break it up.

, This process should be similar to adding compost to your garden area. Good topsoil will allow you to grow your garden in the present as your current soil prepares itself for future planting.

, You can turn the soil daily if you wish, but the process is not necessary if you turned the soil adequately already.

, This time is needed for the compost to break down and greatly improve your soil.

Keep soil covered year-round.,
Plant trees to prevent landslides.,
Reduce tillage.,
Protect weak crops with strip cropping.,
Practice wet season spelling.,
Control downhill runoff with flumes.,
Turn a hillside into terraces.",How to Prevent Soil Erosion2," Bare soil is far more vulnerable to erosion than soil with ground cover. Aim for at least 30% ground cover on all grazing land, ideally 40% or more.After harvesting crops, leave the residue on the soil as a mulch, or plant hardy winter crops.

, Tree roots are powerful tools when soil is too eroded or steep to plant. Plant native trees on steep slopes and riverbanks to reduce soil loss.Bare ground around the tress still needs to be covered in mulch or grass for best results.

, Deep, frequent tillage creates a layer of compact soil vulnerable to water erosion, topped by loose soil easily removed by wind.Consider a zero-tillage approach using a coulter or other deep planting device.If this is not feasible, try a ridge-till or mulch-till system that leaves the lower soil levels untouched.These conservation tillage techniques also reduce the amount of vehicle traffic, and therefore soil compaction.

, Crops with weak roots or that need to be sparsely planted are more vulnerable to erosion. Plant these in strips, alternating with strips of an erosion-resistant crop such as dense grass or legumes.Plant the crops so they contour the slope.
Plant these crops perpendicular to the prevailing wind if possible.

, Grazing land cannot remain healthy and erosion-resistant if cattle are allowed to graze year-round. For best results, close off a paddock for the entire wet season to allow grasses to reestablish themselves.


This may not be effective if the other paddocks cannot support the spelled cattle.
If possible, keep cattle away from riverbanks and heavily eroded soil at all times., Runoff is concentrated into a narrower area as it travels across lands. The points where the concentrated runoff reaches a slope are particularly vulnerable to erosion. You can build a paved flume, or lined channel, to lead the water to a safe drainage system. Build these at gully heads as well.


Another option is to build a swale to re-direct the runoff into a pond. Building several swales along a hillside can greatly reduce runoff volume and eliminate the need for a paved channel.Do not build flumes on slopes steeper than 1.5:1., The steepest slopes are almost impossible to farm on. Turn the hill into terraces instead by building retaining walls running across the slope. In between the walls, grade the soil level to create a flat area resistant to erosion.

Start with a six inch pile of leaves.,
Add a material with a higher nitrogen level.,
Add water.,
Turn the leaves frequently.,
Cover the heap with a plastic sheet.",How to Turn Dead Leaves Into Mulch2," You will need to create several layers when turning leaves into mulch. To start, you should spread out a pile of leaves on the bottom of your compost bin. Keep the pile about six inches high., You need materials high in nitrogen to help break down the leaves and create mulch. Manure is generally the best material you can use here. If you don't have manure, you can also use cottonseed meal, bone meal, or Agrinite. You can purchase many of these items at a local hardware store.It's best to have a five to one ratio. There should be five parts leaves and one part of your nitrogen material.

, Getting the leaves a little wet with help them turn into mulch. There is no precise amount of water to add. It depends on how much leaves you're working with. Add enough water that the leaves are damp but not saturated with moisture., Once the leaves and nitrogen are mixed, it's up to you to help them turn into mulch. You will have to take a rake or similar tool and turn the leaves over every three days. This will help them begin to break down and turn into mulch., Keep your leaves covered with a plastic sheet or tarp. This will keep your leaves warm. It will also prevent weather from drying the leaves out or getting them wet."
"
Add mulch to your garden.,
Put the mulch in a compost pile.,
Fertilize your soil.",How to Turn Dead Leaves Into Mulch3," Mulch can be used in your garden. You can place them over seeds and plants for fertilizer and protection.


A six inch blanket of leaves can help protect plants over the winter from strong winds., If you have an existing compost pile, separate from the one you used to turn your leaves to mulch, you can add your mulch to this. The high nitrogen compost of mulch created with leaves can easily help break down organic material in a compost pile., Mulch can be used as a fertilizer in the spring. You can add a layer of mulch where you're planting new flowers and plants. This may help them grow faster."

Decide what type of garden to grow.,
Decide what specific plants to include in your garden.,
Choose a spot for your garden.,
Make a garden design.",How to Start a Garden1," What purpose do you want your garden to serve? Some gardens are functional, and produce fruit and vegetables you can use to feed your family or give away to neighbors. Others are more ornamental in purpose, serving to beautify your property and provide a pleasing sight to people passing by. If you're not sure what type of garden you want, consider the following options:


Vegetable gardens can include peppers, tomatoes, cabbages and lettuces, potatoes, squash, carrots, and many other vegetables. If a vegetable is able to grow in your region, you can find a way to grow it in your yard.
In flower gardens, different types of flowers may be strategically planted so that something is in bloom almost all year long. Some flower gardens are structured, with flowers planted in neat rows and patterns; others are wilder in appearance. Your personal style and yard type will determine what type of flower garden you might plant.

Herb gardens often complement both flower and vegetable gardens, since they tend to flower beautifully and also serve the functional purpose of adding flavor to your food. Herb gardens might include rosemary, thyme, dill, cilantro and a variety of other herbs you may want to use to make dried spices and teas.
In general, vegetable gardens have the highest soil and maintenance requirements. Flowers and herbs can withstand more neglect than vegetable plants.;
, Find out what grows well in your region garden zone by using this zone finder to determine what zone you are in, then research which plants do well in your area. As you find out more about your options, make a list of the plants you want to buy and the best time of year to plant them.


Some plants don't grow as well in certain zones. If you live in a place with mild winters and hot summers, you may have trouble growing plants that require a cold snap to grow properly.
Unless you plan to make your garden relatively large, try to choose plants that need similar growing conditions. Do they need the same soil type and sun exposure? If not, you may have to create a garden with several types of growing conditions, which can be complicated in a small garden.
Visit a farmers market or plant sale in the spring. Often, you can learn useful information from vendors and buy healthy plants that grow well in your area.

, Take a look around your yard to assess the where you want the garden to be located. The location you choose should both help the garden serve the function you want it to have and also be in a spot that is conducive to growing strong, healthy plants.


No matter what type of garden you're planting, most plants will grow better in rich, well-drained soil. Avoid spots in your yard where water seems to stand for awhile after a heavy rain, as this could indicate the soil there is too soggy or clay-based for healthy plant growth.
Most vegetables grow best with a lot of sunlight, so if you're planting a vegetable garden choose a spot that isn't shaded by trees or your house. Flowers are more versatile, and if you'd like a flower plot next to your house you can choose flowers that grow best in partial or full shade.
If your soil isn't high quality, you can make a raised bed and grow flowers or vegetables there. Raised beds are planting beds that are built on top of the ground within wood frames that are filled with soil.
If you don't have a yard, you can still have a garden. Plant flowers, herbs and certain vegetables in large pots on your patio. You can move them around according to the amount of sun the plants need.

, Draw an outline of your garden or yard space. Map out different options where you want to plant various items in the location you chose. Tailor the design to fit the needs of your plants, making sure the ones that need shade will be planted in shade, and the ones that need full sun are in an area that isn't cast in shadows during the day.


Take into account the space each plant will need, both at planting time and after it starts to mature. Make sure everything you want to plant will fit in your garden and have enough space to spread out.
Take the timing into account. Many plants need to be planted at different times in different zones. For example, if you live in a region with mild winters and hot summers, you may need to plant your flowers earlier than you would if you lived in a region with cold winters and shorter summers.
If you're planting a vegetable garden, design it so that it's convenient for you to walk into the garden and harvest vegetables as they ripen. You may want to make a path through the garden for this purpose.
Flower gardens should be designed with aesthetics in mind. Choose colors that look pretty together, and make patterns that are pleasing to the eye. Keep in mind when different flowers will begin to bloom.
Also take your lifestyle into account. Do you have children or pets who might run through the area? Is the garden within reach of your hose? Is it too close or too far away from your living space?

Till the soil to a fine grain.,
Sow the tomatoes in simple rows.,
Fertilize later.,
Use grass clippings.,
Water about once a week in the morning only.,
Keep the tomatoes at your own height.,
Trim.",How to Prepare the Soil for Tomato Plants2," Do not do any other work on the soil; instead focus on the way the tomatoes are grown in that soil.

, Plant about 8-10 plants in total for a small, manageable garden.


Leave about 2 feet (0.6 m) between each seedling, and the rows 2 feet (0.6 m) apart. This helps the fruit and ground to stay cool.
Plant 2 seeds in each hole. Wean out the weaker one at about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of growth.

, Don't over prepare the soil. The seedlings are very sensitive to new conditions when transplanting (or from seed). They can not only die, but can be slowed way down and the yield can be poor. Instead, use chicken poop (such as ""Chickity Doo Doo""). It comes in pellet form and doesn't take much knowledge to use. Use about 1 cup per plant spread out on the surface. Watering will leach the nutrients into the soil for you. Do not cultivate.

, Spread them around in your garden. The more the merrier, to about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) height. Not only does this keep the weeds down but it also keeps the soil cool and moist. So less watering!

It also provides more organic material (compost fertilizer) for the next growing season.







, Do not water at night, as this creates dangerous conditions for your plants as insects love wet dark environments and rot and other diseases such as mold, verticillium rot, etc. are easily avoided by watering during the morning.


Also, watering during high noon isn't great because most of the water will evaporate before the plants are able to absorb.

, This standard exists for two reasons. First, it is hard enough to maintain the tomatoes, so there is no reason to go reaching as well. You can make them shorter; just make sure to stop them when they reach desired growth. Second, tomatoes don't care about fruiting that much. Most breeds like to just grow and grow. Causing the plant to vine out will focus most of the nutrients on greenery rather than on fruit production. So keep them small and you will have higher yields and much faster.

, Hold up three fingers. Now cut the middle one. That's how it's done.

"
"
Shape lightly during the first few months of growth.,
At the end of the first growing season, measure the total height of the hedges.,
Shape the hedges at the start of the second growing season.,
Prepare the hedges for their third growing season.",How to Shape Hedges1,"


Hedges that have recently been planted, such as within the previous two months, require only generalized shaping.
Use a large pair of pruning shears to cut the hedges down to a height of approximately 6 inches (15.24 centimeters). Don't worry about making sure that the tops of the hedges are perfectly aligned at this time, just that they have been adequately trimmed.;
,


This can be done simply by using a yardstick or measuring tape. Determine the distance from the base of the hedges to their highest point.

,


In the spring following the first year of growth by the hedges, greater amounts of shaping must be done. Review the height of the plants, and trim them down to half their current size. This can be done without focusing a great deal on symmetry.
Make sure that this process has been completed before the hedges begin blossoming.
In addition, during the second year of growth, the sides of the hedges can be shaped lightly. Using a large pair of shears, trim growth that is sticking out from the sides of the hedge. Focus most of your attention to especially deviant branches and leaves, being carefully to avoid performing excessive amounts of trimming.

,


At the start of the third growing season, repeat the process described above, trimming the hedges to half their starting height. Greater amounts of shaping on the sides of the hedges may be required at this time.

Buy gardening supplies.,
Prepare the soil.",How to Start a Garden2," It takes a lot of equipment to plant a garden, but once you buy most of the supplies they will last through many gardening seasons. You'll find the best selection at a home and garden store or a nursery. Gather the following supplies:


Seeds or young plants. You can choose to either start your garden from seeds or buy young sprouted plants that already have a head start. Check the list of plants you intend to grow and buy as many seeds or young plants as you need for the different components of your garden.
Soil fertilizer and topsoil. Bone meal, blood meal, and other fertilizers help your plants grow healthy, and a layer of topsoil is useful to have in case you're planting something that needs extra protection.
Compost. You can mix compost into the soil to improve its moisture retention, buffer pH, and provide micro nutrients. You can buy compost or make your own.
Mulch. Many plants require a layer of mulch to protect them from inclement weather and extreme temperatures while they're in the early stages of growth. Mulch should be spread on top of the soil to help retain moisture and reduce weeds.
Soil tilling equipment. If you're planning to create a large garden, you might want to buy or rent a soil tiller, which is wheeled over the ground to break up the soil and make it into a soft plant bed. For smaller areas, a garden rake and hoe should be sufficient.
A shovel and spade. This equipment makes it much easier to dig the proper-sized holes for seeds or young sprouts.
A garden hose. Get a hose with a fixture that allows you to either lightly mist or fully spray plants, depending on what each one needs. Alternatively, if you are planting a large area, a sprinkler and even an automatic timer will save you time.
Fencing materials. If you're planting a vegetable garden, you may need to construct a fence around it to keep bunnies, squirrels, deer, and the neighborhood pets from taking ripe vegetables.

, Use the soil tiller or garden rake to break the soil in the area you mapped out for your garden. Work the soil to a depth of about 12 inches (30.5 cm), making sure it is loose and does not have large clumps. Remove rocks, roots, and other solid objects from the garden bed, then fertilize it and work in compost to prepare it for planting.


How your plants grow depends on the quality of the dirt. You can buy a soil testing kit to find out the amount of organic matter, the amount of nutrients, and the pH level of the soil. Use the results to determine how much fertilizer and other ingredients to add. Alternatively, you can take a soil sample to your county extension office and they will test the soil for free or a small fee.
Don't add more fertilizer than the directions tell you to. Extra fertilizer can be toxic to plants. Note that not all plants like very fertilized soil; some would actually benefit from poor soil, so remember to find out the soil preferences of the plants you choose.
If your soil test shows a pH level that is too acidic, add limestone to raise the pH. If your soil is alkaline, you can add cottonseed meal, sulfur, pine bark, compost, or pine needles to make it more acidic.

"
"
Plant the seeds or young plants according to your design.,
Fertilize as necessary.,
Add compost, mulch or topsoil as necessary.,
Water the garden.,
Weed the garden.,
Consider erecting a small fence.",How to Start a Garden3," Use the spade to dig holes spaced a few inches apart, or as indicated on the packaging of the seeds or young plants you bought. Make sure the holes are as deep and wide as they need to be. Place the seeds or plants in the holes and cover them with soil. Pat the soil gently into place.

, Depending on the plants you choose to grow, you may need to fertilize the garden again after planting. Some plants may need more fertilizer than others, so make sure you only use it in the areas that require it.

, Some types of plants require a thin covering of compost, mulch or topsoil to protect them during seed germination and while the plant is young and fragile. Spread the material by hand, or use a soil spreader to cover a larger area.


Some types of compost or mulch aren't appropriate for certain plants. Conduct research on the produce you're growing to make sure you use the right ground cover.
Too thick a layer could in inhibit growth, so make sure you add only as much as each type of plant needs.

, When you're finished planting and treating the soil, use the garden hose's ""sprinkler"" setting to thoroughly dampen the garden. Continue watering the garden every day, adding more or less water to different areas according to the plants' needs, for the first few weeks after planting.


Over saturating the soil could drown the seeds and prevent the plants from growing. Don't water to the point where streams of water run through the garden.
Never let the soil completely dry out. Watering once a day is sufficient.
Once the plants have sprouted, water in the morning, rather than at night. Water sitting on the leaves and stems all night can lead to the production of mold and other plant diseases.
After a few weeks, reduce how often you water the plants. Give the garden deep waterings two or three times a week or as needed.

, Sprouting weeds take nutrients from the soil, leaving less for your vegetables or flowers. Weed the garden every few days to make sure your plants get the nutrients they need - just be careful not to pull up sprouting garden plants.


A stirrup hoe will help remove weeds before they get too big. You can run the hoe along the soil beside plants and knock the weeds down.

, If you see small animals such as rabbits, squirrels, deer, and gophers or voles in your garden or in your neighborhood, you may want to go ahead and put a fence around the garden to protect it. A two or three foot tall fence should be tall enough to keep small creatures out. If you have deer in your area, the fence may need to be as high as eight feet.

, Water so that the soil becomes moist down as far as possible but don't saturate it.

, It must touch the soil completely (hence the reason for smoothing it well). Hold the plastic down with soil. Rocks can also be used. Just be sure it's attached firmly.

, If it's some sun and some rain or overcast weather, leave it longer, about 6 to 8 weeks.Temperatures under the plastic on a hot day will be hot enough to kill any nematodes, bacteria, cutworm and less resilient weed seed, about 50ºC to 60ºC.

, Use a thermometer to check the soil temperatures. After several weeks in a row of the same high temperature being recorded, the plastic sheet can be removed and the soil will be sterilized.

, Don't disturb the soil other than to plant in. Do not dig in manure or compost. If fertilizer is needed, simply leave the manure on the surface and let the rainwater it in."

Prepare the hedges to be shaped along their length.,
Shape the hedges using an electric trimmer.,
Prepare the hedges to be shaped along their width.",How to Shape Hedges2,"


At the start of the fourth growing season, the hedges can be shaped with greater detail. Purchase a pair of stakes that are equal to the height which you want your hedges to be.
Push the stakes into the ground on either side of the length of the hedge. Tie a piece of light-colored string to each stake, aligning it at the desired height of the hedge.

,


With this piece of equipment, carefully trim the top of the hedge down to the height of the string. Use care to ensure that the top of the hedge is level at all locations.

,


Repeat the process above which describes how to trim the hedges along their length. Instead of placing the stakes in the ground on the either side of the length of the hedge, however, insert them into the ground on either side of the width of the plants.
Tie a string around both stakes, making sure that it is even with the top of the hedge.
Use an electric trimmer to remove any growth that falls outside either of the staked markers.

Ask your local landfill if you can take some flattened cardboard home for your garden.,
Place a square of used carpet on the planned garden area and leave it over the winter.,
Get a permit from your local Forest Service to collect rocks.,

Many cities or municipalities will collect branches and leaves in the fall, which are ground or chipped into a mulch.,
Collect your own leaves.",How to Find Inexpensive Mulch," They usually will if you call ahead for permission. Or obtain large pieces of cardboard elsewhere, for example, an appliance store.


The cardboard will stay flat better if you use a string trimmer to clear the area first. Trim as close to the ground as possible, being sure not to damage bark of shrubs or trees with the trimmer. You could also mow the area closely.
If the ground is dry, water it. Put down cardboard, overlapping edges by at least 6"". Weigh down the cardboard with bricks, large rocks, or best of all, a heavy (4"") layer of mulch such as wood chips. This is most effective when the ground is damp and the growing season is active. Late winter is ideal in many climates. You can accomplish the same thing by putting down heavy layers of newspaper and covering with mulch. You may wish to pre-moisten the newspaper by dipping it in a bucket or wheelbarrow full of water.
If you're using cardboard, remove tape, staples, labels, and anything else that won't break down eventually.;
, By spring, all the weeds will have been smothered and it will be easier to start a garden there. Move the carpet to the next area and repeat. Cover the carpet with wood chips for improved aesthetics. In late spring, rake off the chips, remove the carpet, and rake the chips back onto the weed free area to keep new weeds from growing.


Carpet is not biodegradable, so plan to remove it before you plant.

, In Idaho it costs five dollars. Rock makes a great mulch and will extend the growing season by retaining heat into the night. This is less environmentally friendly than wood chips, and small rocks may well work themselves into the soil and make it harder to dig weeds out.

, Some electric companies remove plants that grow near wires and shred them. The electric company will deliver a load (dump truck) of not cleaned wood chips. Look in the yellow pages. Wood chips make perhaps the best mulch, except on vegetable gardens. Coarse wood chips allow weed seeds to fall down through them, then never get enough light to germinate. When the chips rot, they will improve the soil and you can add more. Use a generous layer—at least 4"".


Place wood chips on top of cardboard or newspaper to exclude weeds for longer (at least until the mulches break down). The wood chips will soften the look of the material underneath.

, (These also make a great wrap to protect shrubs through the winter.) Coffee shops may also be able to offer spent coffee grounds and filters, which can be composted or applied to soil directly.

, They often are available for free to local residents at a service center or some other location. You will need to contact the appropriate office in your area to check. Be sure to bring your own rake or shovel and containers or pickup truck.

, If you have a large tree that drops leaves, or your neighbors do, take a bin and collect them. You can use a lawn mower to help shred them, let the kids play in piles, or just use them whole. Whole leaves will take a lot longer to break down, but they will smother weeds better in the meantime.

, Attach the water butt to your roof drainage system so that any rainwater that lands on your roof is stored. Ensure that an overflow pipe is fitted encase your water butt fills up. Where possible make the overflow pipe feed into soil so that excess water isn't wasted or passed into local sewage/drainage systems.

, Using the watering can and the stored water from the water butt, water your plants and your grow your own produce accordingly.

, Ensure that you water your garden at the coolest times of the day (i.e. first thing in the morning) as this will reduce the amount of water that is evaporated from your lawn and plants. But don't water at night because that can lead to root rot.

, To increase the water retaining capability of your soil purchase some water retention gel and mix with the soil within your tubs and containers. The water retaining crystals with absorb water ensuring that water is kept within the soil and not simply passed out of the planting area.

, Purchase stress tolerance enhancers and apply them to your plants to further reduce the need for watering.

, Ensure that your garden includes plants and veg that are native to your region and are therefore more likely to require less water than plants from other countries or continents.

, Try moving plants from normal soil into containers and tubs as they will hold water for much longer than normal garden soil/compost. A substantial amount of water passed into normal garden soil will be passed further down into the earth.

Water in the morning if possible.,
Water in the late afternoon if the morning is inconvenient.,
Do not water your garden at night.,
Water your garden with the correct frequency.,
Water near the roots, not over the leaves.,
Water long and deep.,
Check for signs of overwatering.",How to Choose the Best Time for Watering the Garden," This is the best time to water your garden because it works with the plants' natural growth cycle. The plants are ready to drink early in the morning, when the sun is up but not quite high in the sky. During the rest of the day, they'll be able to drink in the water before the sun gets hot. Hydrated plants are better able to withstand extreme heat.If you wait until noon or later, when the sun is very hot, the water can actually burn the plants. The sun-heated water will get too hot for the fragile stems and leaves, and it will leave damage in its wake.
Try to water your garden before 10 am, to make sure the water has plenty of time to seep into the soil and dry a little before the sun gets strong. Watering in the afternoon wastes your water, since more of it will evaporate before soaking into the soil.;
, It's not always convenient to water first thing in the morning when you have a million other things to do. If you miss the morning watering, wait until late afternoon, when the sun is no longer at its hottest. This way your plants won't get burned, and there will still be time for them to dry out a little before nightfall.If you wait until the afternoon, aim to water from 4 pm on, since before that time the sun may still be strong enough to burn your plants.
If you absolutely must water when the sun is strong, try to do so only occasionally, rather than making it an everyday habit.

, When you water at night, the water sits on the leaves and stems of the plants instead of evaporating. The soil may become water-logged instead of draining properly with help from the sun. This is detrimental to your plants because it leads to mold and fungal growth around the roots and on the stems and leaves.


Only water at night as a very last resort, if your plants are very thirsty and you can't wait until morning.
If you must water at night, water the soil to avoid getting the plant itself wet, and use less water to avoid waterlogging. Irrigation tape or a soaker hose makes this much easier.

, The general rule for gardens is that they need about one inch of water per week. However, certain types of plants need more water than this, and certain types need less. The best approach is to research your plants' water requirements, and to keep an eye on their health.If a plant wilts, it needs more water.


Another good test is to insert your finger a few inches into the soil. If it feels completely dry, it's probably time to water. If it's wet just below the surface, give it more time.
Use common sense when it comes to the frequency with which you water your plants. For example, if it has been a rainy week, your plants don't need as much water. If you're in a drought, they might need extra water.

, The roots absorb water that nourishes the plant; water that hits the leaves just drips off or evaporates. When you're watering, point the hose, watering can or sprinkler low on the plant, near the roots, to make sure the plant gets adequately watered there.


Watering over the plant and getting the leaves all wet is also detrimental to the plant's health. Water that sits on the leaves can either cause mold to form or cause the plant to overheat.
If you find it difficult to water the roots using your hose, look into a special watering system that waters plants close to the ground, such as a soaker hose or a drip-tape irrigation system.

, Most plants are healthiest when their roots grow deep into the ground, rather than growing outward and closer to the surface. Watering deeply, so that you completely saturate the soil, ensures that water gets all the way to the tips of the roots, and it encourages downward root growth.


That's why it's healthiest to water plants sparingly, but deeply. Instead of watering just a little bit every day, choose one or two days a week to give the plants a good, deep watering.
That means spending a full thirty seconds or more on each area, rather than just spraying the garden down quickly.

, Plants that are getting too much water are just as likely to die as plants that get too little water. Make sure you're watering your plants at the correct frequency, and try not to overdo it. Look for these signs that your garden might be getting too much water:


Leaves that are yellow or brownish at the tips
Limp, soggy foliage

Monitor watering times for effective plant growth.,
Plant indigenous plants.,
Go organic.,
Try making your own compost.,
Try alternate methods of gardening.",How to Make Your Garden Water Wise," Cut down on lawn areas. Rather create an architectural feature that looks pleasing and water wise. By doing this you are already reducing your gardens watering requirements. When you are hardscaping make sure that the style and surfaces used blend in with the overall feel of the area. Examples of this include rocky pathways with pebble stones, concrete stones, earthen paving of specific garden spaces, etc.;
, This can be done by collecting rainwater in a tank, rock pool, etc. These are allowed in the countryside or on an estate as long as the tank is out of sight. This prevents you from using purified drinking water to water your plants. In sub urban residential areas, smaller tanks may be allowed if covered by plant creepers or the tank is made to look as part of the garden design and layout.

, Use drip irrigation at the roots of plants. When plants are watered by irrigation or the usual hosing, only 2 % of the water actually reaches the roots of the plants. The rest of the water actually runs off or evaporates. As a result much of the water is wasted. Mulch your garden as well as this retains water. Information on drip irrigation is freely available on many sites on the internet., Early mornings and evenings is the best time to avoid evaporation. Also remember to group plants according to their water needs. Hardy and herbaceous succulent plants that require less water should be grouped together. Flowering plants and shrubs ideally should be grouped together. In this way watering can be timed accordingly.

, These are natural to the country, grows more naturally without too much effort and uses much less water to flourish and survive. This is also not only water wise but will invite butterflies and birds into your garden.

, Stop using chemical laden pesticides and fertilizers. Rather use natural remedies to get rid of insects, ants and other garden pest. Mint and Mustard herbs is well known for keeping away mosquitoes and flies. Find out from a plant specialist or nursery about plant types that serve as an insect or pest repellent.

, One can make compost from almost any organic substance. Organic simply means anything that will decay and break down. Vegetable and fruit peels, egg shells, coffee grinds, used teabags, stale bread and garden refuse makes excellent compost.

, Indoor or a partly enclosed garden covered in shade cloth can work wonders in terms of water conservation and usage. Planting shrubs and flowers under shaded trees can also be useful. Create innovative and original ideas of your own. You may surprise others, even yourself, with some aesthetic beauty that can become a trend for others to follow.

Use horticultural sand or sphagnum peat moss as the soil for your carnivorous plants.;
, Carnivorous plants thrive best in conditions that lack nutrients, and the minerals commonly found in most water types can over-fertilize your plant.


Use distilled water or collect fresh rainwater to feed your carnivorous plant.

, Most carnivorous plants require damp soil at all times, with the moisture level of the soil varying depending on the exact breed of your plant.


Store your carnivorous plant in a pot or planter that contains a tray or saucer you can keep filled with water throughout the day.
Pour water into the tray or saucer instead of directly into the plant's flytrap; as this may falsely trigger the plant into closing its flytrap.

, These plants can thrive indoors or outdoors, as long as they are exposed to direct sunlight.


Place your carnivorous plant under bright fluorescent bulbs for approximately 12 to 14 consecutive hours if you are unable to place the plant in direct sunlight.

, Most carnivorous plants only require 1 or 2 insects per month to thrive healthily.


Buy freeze-dried insects, crickets, or wingless fruit flies that measure approximately one-third of the size of your carnivorous plant.
Use tweezers to carefully place the insect on the trigger hairs of your carnivorous plant. Depending on the type of plant you have, the location of the trigger hairs on your plant will vary.

Dig the hole for your compost pit.,
Chop your compost materials finely.,
Add the organic materials to the compost pit.",How to Make a Compost Pit1," Your compost hole should be about 1 ft (30.5 cm) deep. The area of the hole will be determined by the amount of organic matter you want to add. At most, the compost material should reach a height of 4 in (10 cm) in the pit.When estimating the hole's size, keep in mind that the compost material will be finely chopped or torn to pieces before being thrown in the hole.
Your pit can be as wide as you like. Garden rows, for example, can be enriched with a compost trench dug at standard pit depth.
If you have a lot of compost material, you can dig a deeper pit, but avoid going deeper than about 3.2 ft (1 m). Important decomposing organisms cannot live beneath this depth.;
, Underground composting happens at a much slower rate than aboveground setups. Exposing as much surface area of the compost materials as possible is the key to speeding the process.


Kitchen scraps can be ripped apart by hand, chopped with a knife, or even pulverized in a blender or food processor.
Yard scraps can be broken down using a lawn mower. Aim for pieces no bigger than 2 to 3 in (5 to 8 cm) long, wide, and thick., It’s time to start composting! Dump your food scraps and yard waste into the hole, but remember – you don’t want the materials you'll be composting any taller than about 4 in (10 cm).Use a shovel to mix the materials together so that they decompose as evenly as possible.
It’s especially important to make sure your carbon-rich materials (such as paper and dried leaves) are mixed thoroughly with your nitrogen-rich materials (like vegetable scraps and fresh grass clippings).
Well-mixed compost materials are important from the outset, as you generally do not turn the materials like you would with other kinds of compost setups."

Cover your compost with soil when full.,
Improve decomposition by watering the compost area.,
Grow plants above the compost pit when it has decomposed.",How to Make a Compost Pit2," If your compost pit isn’t quite full, you can add more to it later. Cover the materials in the pit with a fine layer of soil or carbon-rich material, like shredded paper or dead leaves, then close it up with a board.Animals may be enticed to your compost pit in hopes of getting an easy meal. Use heavy rocks to keep your board in place over the pit.So you don’t overfill the pit, use a permanent marker to write the date and height of the materials on the board covering.
Each time you insert fresh compost materials, cover the top layer with more soil or carbon-rich material. When the materials reach 4 in (10 cm) in height, it's ready to be filled.

, Once you have finished adding compost materials to the pit, you can backfill it with the soil you removed. Fill the pit until it is level with the surrounding soil.To prevent unsightly patches of dirt where you’ve dug the pit, cover it with sod or seed it with grass.

, Underground compost decomposes more slowly than above ground piles. Speed up this process by ensuring the area stays fairly wet with a garden hose.


During dry weather, soak the ground above the compost pit with a hose. Dryness will make it more difficult for microbes to break down your scraps.
If the area is kept sufficiently moist, underground compost should be fully decomposed in about a year., A major benefit of underground composting is that you don't have to perform any extra steps to harvest the compost. The best way to take advantage of this is to plant your plants directly over the compost pit.During the year, the decomposed scraps will work themselves into the soil, enriching it naturally.

Maintain the trench as you would a normal pit.,
Rotate the position of plants and the compost trench in the second year.,
Reposition plants and the compost pit in the third year.",How to Make a Compost Pit3," Each row should be roughly 1 ft (30.5 cm) wide. The rows containing your compost trench and plants should be separated by an empty middle row.

Using a three-season rotation will keep garden soil nutrient rich even after many years of growing.Especially if you keep your garden in the same place every year, the plants will deplete the soil’s nutrients over time, making it harder to grow things.

, To ensure the entire row receives an equal amount of compost enrichment, dig a 1 ft (30.5 cm) deep trench that runs down its middle. A hoe works well for this purpose.Remember to keep an empty row between your compost row and the row containing plants during your first year of composting.

, Fill the trench evenly with compost material until it reaches 4 in (10 cm) high. When you reach that level, the trench is ready to be refilled with dirt. Water the refilled compost trench regularly to improve its decomposition.If you plan on adding more compost later, cover compost materials with soil and seal it with a board, as described in the “Maintaining a Filled Pit” method above.

, At the start of the new planting season, you’re going to move the rows containing your plants and trench. Dig your compost trench in the row the plants were last year, and shift the row with plants to the one left empty last year., At the start of the planting season in the third year, the trench-row will continue to chase after the plant-row (in a manner of speaking). The second-year plant-row becomes your new trench-row, and the empty row becomes your new plant-row.By continuing to rotate plant-rows and compost trench-rows in this fashion, you can keep your garden well supplied with nutrients so it can thrive.

"
Ensure that your compost pile is properly aerated.,
Adjust the ratio of nitrogen-rich and carbon-rich materials in your compost pile.,
Keep your compost pile free of meats and dairy.",How to Reduce the Odor of Composting," A healthy compost pile needs plenty of oxygen mixed in. Otherwise, aerobic bacteria (those that need oxygen to metabolize the organic materials) cannot function, and decomposition will be driven instead by anaerobic bacteria, which produce foul-smelling gasses as byproducts of their metabolism.


To begin addressing the oxygen content of your compost pile, make sure you are turning the materials regularly. To ""turn"" a compost pile means to occasionally shift everything around with a pitchfork or shovel. This introduces fresh oxygen into the deeper areas of the pile.
Poor aeration can also be caused by materials that are too small. For example, a compost pile composed largely of sawdust will be difficult to aerate, as the small pieces of sawdust will fit together snugly and prevent air from flowing through the pile. To prevent this problem, integrate larger or looser materials into your pile. Tree limbs and cardboard scraps are good materials for this purpose.
A third reason your compost pile could be improperly aerated is that it is too wet. If your compost pile is saturated with water, there will be little room for air to flow. Ideally, a handful of composting material should have the moisture content of a thoroughly wrung-out sponge.;
, A compost pile that has too high of a nitrogen-to-carbon ratio will emit a smell similar to ammonia. This problem can be solved quite easily by adding more carbon-rich materials.


Nitrogen-rich materials are those that are still close to their living state, and are sometimes called ""green"" materials. Examples include food scraps, fresh grass clippings, coffee grounds, and tea leaves. These materials should make up between 20 and 50 percent of your pile by volume.
Carbon-rich materials are sometimes called ""brown"" materials. Examples include dried leaves, cardboard and paper, sawdust, wood, straw, and corn cobs. These materials should make up between 50 and 80 percent of your compost pile by volume. There is no precise, correct ratio; if an ammonia smell arises, simply add more carbon.

, There are some foods that should never be added to your compost pile, as they will go rancid and emit foul odors. These foods include meats, bones, dairy, and fats and greases.


If you have already added these foods to your existing compost pile, you can mitigate the odor problem by burying the entire pile. Composting underground (often called ""trench composting"") eliminates odors, but the decomposition occurs far more slowly.
In addition to generating odors, meats, dairy, and fats tend to attract rodents and other unwanted pests to your compost pile.

If you don't have any scrap lumber and table saw, buy 2"" x 24"" pieces from a hardware store.
These instructions assume you are cutting the lumber to a 90º angle. Alternatively, you can cut them with a miter saw to a 45º angle instead, so you can fit them together like a picture frame.;
, Unroll a sheet of 1 inch (2.5 cm) poultry netting or hardware cloth on a flat surface. Place a plank over it to guide your cutting.









Use the plank itself, not a tape measure. Storebought lumber dimensions will not match the measurement on the label.

, Cut the poultry netting with tin snips or an angle grinder along the outside edge of the plank. Make sure you get enough material to stretch between your frame.









If you don't have the right cutting tools, wire cutters are a much slower alternative., Lay a plank underneath the netting, flush against one edge. Place a second plank on top of it, sandwiching the wire between them. Do not align them perfectly: the second plank should be offset just enough to allow the width of another plank to butt against it. This overlapping pattern adds strength and makes the screen easy to put together.


The netting should extend a little more than halfway across the width of the plank. It needs to be held securely, but it can't have any sharp edges poking out where you'll be holding the screen.
If the netting keeps rolling up, clamp one end of it onto the table., Position a third plank underneath another edge of the netting, forming a corner with the other bottom plank. Position a fourth plank on top, flush against the end of the offset plank.


If you have a carpenter's square, place it against this corner to guide you.

, Hold the corner together with three vises, and clamp on an additional vise at the other two corners that have planks. If you don't have this many vises, weigh down the planks with heavy objects.

, Drill two screws into the center corner to hold all the planks together. Drill an additional three or four screws along each side, plus another screw at each incomplete corner.








, Use the same overlapping pattern to form the next corner. Clamp and drill the top and bottom planks together.

, There's only one side left without a frame. Place your penultimate plank underneath it. For your last plank, measure the gap between the two planks on either side, and cut the plank to fit. Clamp and drill this final plank into place.








, If you've had enough carpentry for today, you don't need to modify your current setup. Just place the screen onto a wheelbarrow, shovel your compost onto it, and shake until the smaller particles fall through the screen. If you're looking for a less labor-intensive method, read the section below.


For better ergonomics, stand up straight while shaking the screen. This may require placing the wheelbarrow on higher ground.

, The goal of this project is to create a raised platform for your compost bin, so you can let gravity do the work for you. The first step is to dig four post holes, 2 feet (0.6 m) deep — or a little deeper if you have unstable soil. Place them so the two front posts (where you'll be accessing the compost) are 5 feet (1.5 m) apart, and the sides of the rectangle are 3¾ ft (1.1 m) apart.


You can vary these dimensions to match your garden space, as long as you alter your lumber cuts to match.
These metric conversions do not take into account standard metric lumber sizes. Plan and measure carefully.

, Install four 6 foot (1.8 m) posts of 4 x 4 lumber, tamping them in place with a gravel bed or at least hard-packed soil. At least ⅓ of the posts' lengths should be underground.

, Screw in 2 x 10 boards the the outsides of the posts to create a back wall and two side walls for your compost platform. If using the recommended measurements above, the side walls will be about 4 feet (1.2 m) long, and the back wall will be about 6 ft (1.8 m) long. It's a good idea to measure the distance between posts before you cut the lumber. Install three boards to form each wall, leaving a small gap between the boards to help your compost aerate.


Optionally, you can create a low front wall, two boards high. This will keep your compost from spilling out, but it will make wheelbarrow access difficult.

, This creates two compartments, one where compost can fall directly through the screen, and another where large objects will roll down the screen for later return to the bin. Here's how to find the proper placement:


Hold your screen against the top front edge of a side wall. Position it so it leans down toward the center at about a 30º angle.
Imagine a short wall supporting this screen, allowing a short overhang. Mark a spot on the back wall to the height of this divider.
Construct this divider with two 2 x 10 boards on their edge, screwing them together and to the back wall.
Increase the divider' stability by driving a few stakes into the ground at either side.

, Take a piece of 1 x 1 scrap lumber, and screw it just under the lip of the side wall, to support the top of the screen. Attach a second piece on the underside of the screen itself, near the other end. This second support will hit the divider, preventing the screen from sliding to the ground.

, Nail down three more 2 x 10 boards across the top to support your compost bin, again leaving small gaps for aeration. Start from the back wall and build forward. Make sure to leave space at the front so you can shovel out your compost directly onto the screen.


You may want to support the ceiling with an additional brace at the lip of the back and side walls, especially if you have a large compost bin.

, Cut this hole at the lower edge, so you can access the compost that's been in the bin longest. To sift the compost, just rake this out and let it fall onto the tilted screen. Shake the screen by moving it forward and back along the supports. The large scraps will tumble down the screen to one heap, and the well-rotted compost will fall straight through into a separate heap or a waiting wheelbarrow.

Decide on a location for your compost pile.,
Build an enclosure for your compost pile if desired.,
Build a base layer for the compost pile.,
Add your organic scraps to the compost pile.,
Turn your compost pile occasionally.,
Stop adding materials and start a new pile.",How to Create a Compost Bed," There are a few considerations to keep in mind when choosing a location. Do not place the compost pile so far from your house that you will be disinclined to add scraps and to monitor its condition. If you have nearby neighbors, they may not appreciate an unsightly compost pile close to their property line. Also, avoid positioning your compost pile on your best garden soil; this robs you of valuable space to grow your vegetables and other plants.;
, A compost bed can be as simple as a large open heap, but an enclosure provides numerous benefits. It keeps rodents and other animals away from your compost, and it helps to keep your compost contained when you turn it with a pitchfork. An enclosure can be made from lumber, poultry wire, concrete blocks, or any manner of fencing. Make sure the enclosure still allows you easy access and is no longer than about 3 feet (1 m) long in any direction.

, For efficient decomposition, the microbes in your compost pile need fresh oxygen. The bottom of a compost pile tends to be the most oxygen-starved, as it is farthest from the outside air and gets no ventilation. The best way to remedy this problem is by deliberately building a base layer for your compost pile out of tree branches and limbs. A loose pile of these limbs will help to establish plenty of air pockets in the bottom of the compost pile.

, Nearly any plant-based material can be added to a compost bed. Vegetable scraps, coffee grounds and filters, paper, cardboard, and yard clippings are all examples of materials you can add to your compost pile. These materials can be divided into carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich types.


Nitrogen-rich materials are those that are still in a living state. Fresh leaves, fresh grass clippings, vegetable scraps, and coffee grounds are all nitrogen-rich. These materials should only compose about 1/4 of your pile by volume, or the compost will begin emitting an ammonia-like smell.
Carbon-rich materials are those that are dead and inert. Paper, cardboard, and sawdust are examples of carbon-rich materials. These items should compose about 3/4 of your compost by volume.

, To continually introduce fresh oxygen into your compost pile, you'll need to mix the materials every 1 or 2 weeks. Use a pitchfork to dig into the pile and fold the compost together. Make sure to dig the materials at the very bottom of the pile up to the top.

, Eventually, you will need to stop adding fresh organic matter to your compost pile. If you don't, you will eventually have a pile that contains finished compost, freshly added materials, and everything in between. To avoid the difficulty of having to sift out the finished compost, stop adding materials and simply turn your compost regularly until it is finished. Start a new pile to add your fresh scraps to during this process. Your compost will turn into rich, black humus in about a year.

Collect the seaweed from your local beach or waterway.,
When you get home, be sure to wash sand and beach debris off the seaweed for the sand and beach debris is very alkaline.,
Choose what you want to use your seaweed for.,
If using it in the compost, be sure to mix it through with other materials really well.,
To make your seaweed into a liquid fertiliser, simply put all the compost in a barrel or any other sort of container.,
If you choose to use the seaweed directly on the garden, it's imperative that you do so correctly.",How to Use Seaweed in the Garden," Be sure to check with your council or local government first for in some areas it is illegal to take seaweed off the beach.


Kelp is generally the best option, but other types of seaweed work great as well. Collect the seaweed in a plastic bag and if the seaweed is not already wet, be sure to to wet it with some seawater to prevent it drying out.;
, However if you have extremely acidic soil you could use this to your advantage and not wash of the sand.

, You could make it into a liquid fertiliser, add it to your compost or use it in its raw state in the garden.

, If you don't, the seaweed could become slimy and suffocate the compost.

, All you have to do here is add a little bit of water and wait for the seaweed to decompose.( This usually takes a few months.) Liquid seaweed solution can be used on all parts of the garden. It's particular effective in helping plants bearing fruits or flowers for the seaweed builds up disease resistance.

, The common mistake that many people make is mixing it into the soil. You should never do this for, as the seaweed breaks down, it will rob the soil of nitrogen. The correct way to apply seaweed is on top of the soil. Gradually over time worms and other soil creatures will bring it down into the soil. The results from this method are marvellous for there is a slow release of trace elements into the soil.

Choose a tumbler.,
Put organic materials into the tumbler.,
Balance your carbon and nitrogen.,
Be aware of pesticides and contaminants.,
Load the tumbler in batches.",How to Compost in a Tumbler1," You can buy tumblers on the internet or at a garden supply store. You can also build your own. Pick a tumbler based on your needs. Remember that larger tumblers will take more strength to turn, but you will be able to compost more material at one time.One advantage to tumblers is that they are more aesthetically pleasing (and less smelly) than compost piles. You can put your tumbler anywhere in your yard that is convenient.;
, Composting takes advantage of organic scraps to make a nutrient rich soil. These scraps can be anything from egg shells and left over salad to grass clippings or dried leaves. Just open up the lid on your tumbler and throw in any scraps that you have from the yard or kitchen.Smaller sized pieces are better. Try grinding or shredding any large materials before adding them to the tumbler.

, You want your end product to be a nutrient rich soil that can be used around your garden or home to grow things. Plants need a balance of carbon based and nitrogen based nutrients. You want your finished compost to have a carbon-nitrogen ratio of roughly 10-1. Adding a mixture of about 75% grass clippings and 25% kitchen scraps will typically put you in the right ball park.The best way to gauge your carbon to nitrogen ratio is to keep track of the things you put in your tumbler. You can find guides that give you the relative carbon and nitrogen content of different compost materials online., The microbes in the compost will break down some contaminants, but not all of them. If you want to avoid having pesticides and other contaminants in the plants you are growing, make sure that you don’t add them to your tumbler. You can use all organic ingredients to avoid getting pesticides in your compost., From start to finish, the compost can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months. The important thing to remember is that this time frame is from the last scrap you put in, not the first. As the the compost forms, it will become more compact and make more room in the tumbler. This might tempt you to add more scraps, but be aware that doing so will restart the amount of time your compost will be in the tumbler.Instead of continuing to add to the tumbler, you could have a compost bucket (or a second tumbler) that holds scraps until the current batch is finished. Then, you can move the second batch into the tumbler.

Start the reaction.,
Turn the tumbler.,
Place a pan underneath the tumbler.",How to Compost in a Tumbler2," If you just put your materials in the tumbler, they will probably turn to compost on their own ― eventually. To make your composting process faster, you need to add some microbes to start breaking down the organic materials in the tumbler. There are several ways that you can do this:Add horse or cow manure to the tumbler.
Add garden soil to the tumbler.
Add a commercial composting mix to the tumbler. These can be found online or in a garden store.

, The composting process requires air. In a tumbler, aerating is done quite easily. You simply turn the tumbler back and forth several times. Do this every two to three days for optimum aeration. The turning allows air to get mixed in with all levels of the compost.Turning the composter too often will slow down composting.

, Most tumblers have a drain that allows liquid (known as compost tea) to drain out the bottom. You can collect this liquid in a pan or bowl underneath the tumbler. Pour the compost tea into your garden or use it to water your potted plants. This liquid is full of nutrients that will help your plants grow."
"
Watch the temperature inside the tumbler.,
Keep the compost moist.,
Observe the color and consistency.,
Use the compost.",How to Compost in a Tumbler3," Maintaining the correct temperature is crucial on two fronts for composting. First, a higher temperature will help break down the compost materials faster. Second, the compost needs to get hot enough to kill any unwanted pathogens and weed seeds. Measure the temperature with a thermometer. Ideally, it will be no lower than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).If your compost is not getting hot enough, you can add manure or commercial products to increase the nitrogen levels and provide more heat.

, Proper hydration will keep the compost from clumping into a hardened mess, or turning into a slush. The compost should stay about as moist as a wet sponge that has been rung out. If your compost is too dry, you can add water directly to the mix., Many composters will refer to green and brown composting materials. Keep in mind that this actually has nothing to do with the color of the materials or the compost. It actually refers to the carbon (brown) and nitrogen (green) content of the material. Your compost should be a dark brown., Your compost is ready once it has a dark brown color and all of the materials have broken down. It will have a similar consistency to soil. Empty the tumbler and use the compost in your garden or potted plants. It will provide nutrients that the plants need to grow.Some tumblers unload from the side. Others unload from the top or bottom.

Chop compost materials into uniform, two inch pieces.,
Blend or freeze kitchen scraps before adding them to the compost pile.,
Make your compost pile as large as possible.,
Layer brown and green materials within the pile.,
Avoid disturbing the compost pile during the winter months.,
Keep the compost pile damp.,
Insulate the compost pile to help it retain moisture.,
Consider buying a pre-made composter unit.,
Wait for temperatures to warm up a little if you think composting has stopped.",How to Compost in Cold Weather1," Try to chop up your materials into small, 2 inch (5.1 cm) pieces so that it will decompose faster. Exercise caution when using shredded leaves. These items tend to form clumps that are harder to get rid of in the winter, because cold temperatures tend to slow down decomposition.;
, Decomposition of kitchen scraps can be sped up by throwing all these items into a blender with some water, then pouring them into the pile.If this method is unappealing, you can also bag the kitchen scraps and put them in the freezer before adding them to the compost pile. The process of freezing and thawing out the scraps will help them decompose faster as well.

, Larger compost piles perform better than smaller ones during the winter months because, even if the outer layers are frozen through, there may still be some decomposition going on in the center.


This is because bigger compost piles tend to be self-insulating, with the outer layers protecting the inner ones.

, In the winter, deliberately layering green and brown materials in the compost pile will help create heat pockets of faster decomposing green materials under the brown materials that decompose much more slowly. This keeps the pile warm.

, Try to take a hands-off approach to compost during periods of cold weather. Every time gardeners disturb their pile heat escapes and productivity is lessened.

, If you find yourself irrigating your trees and shrubs during the winter, you should also water your compost pile until it is damp. The microorganisms that break down the items in the pile need moisture to be fully functional., During the winter, tarps can be used to help the compost piles retain moisture and trap heat. They are easy to remove when new materials need to be added to the bin. In colder areas, snow can serve to insulate the compost pile from freezing temperatures and can be left on until you choose to add more to the compost pile.


Those living in places where it does not snow or only snows infrequently may want to use straw bales for insulation instead.

, Gardeners in cold climates may benefit from purchasing one or two pre-made composter units. These fully enclosed devices may provide the composting materials with some additional protection from the elements.

, Despite your best efforts, your compost pile may quit functioning when the temperatures drop below freezing. However, you should not worry too much because the compost piles are sure to return to life with the onset of warmer weather.

"
"
Make sure there is a balance of nitrogen, carbon, air and water in your compost pile.,
Add some carbon-based ingredients.,
Use a nitrogen-based fertilizer.,
Place your compost pile in a sunny location.,
Start your composting indoors.,
Know which ingredients you shouldn’t add to your compost.",How to Compost in Cold Weather2," Compost needs nitrogen and carbon, as well as air and water, in order to function properly so try to make sure that there is an available balance of all four components in order to keep the pile working properly., Typical carbon-based ingredients for compost include straw, leaves, cardboard, and shredded newspapers.


However, gardeners should only add black and white or grey newsprint because colored sheets may contain potentially toxic chemicals.

, Add some nitrogen-based fertilizer, such as blood meal or alfalfa pellets, to the compost pile from time to time to keep it working. This is especially helpful during cold periods. Nitrogen not only generates heat, it is part of a balanced diet for all microbes.


Gardeners can also add kitchen scraps, such as vegetable peels and coffee grounds, for a higher nitrogen content if the pile stops decomposing like it should.

, Where possible, compost piles should be located in sunny places, as this will increase heat and speed up the decomposition process.

, Start the composting process in the garage, basement or nearby shed and eliminate some trips to the compost bin. Cooler temperatures will reduce the usual unpleasant odors. Simply place the compost materials in a large bucket or small garbage can and take them out to the compost pile once a week or whenever the container gets full.


Layer kitchen scraps between layers of “browns” or paper products to help reduce odors.

, Diseased plant parts, dog manure, cat manure, coal ashes, and black walnut leaves should all be kept out of the compost pile because each of these things are known to be harmful in their own fashion.


Meat and dairy products should also be kept out of the compost bin because they will certainly attract unwanted attention from neighborhood animals.

Find a trash can, preferably one with a lid.,
Fill the trash can with 1 to 5 gallons with mud depending the size of the bin.

Store your composter in a warm place such as a basement or a garage.

,
Feel free to add your food scraps, paper, yard waste, or anything that biodegrades into your composter.

Once it is done biodegrading, what will remain are nutritional dirt-like remains that are good for your garden.

Find a good location.,
Determine the size of your bin.,
Gather your supplies.,
Build it.,
Add the composting materials.,
Maintain your compost bin.",How to Build a Compost Container," Map out an area of your yard in which to place your compost bin. You will want a spot that is not too close to your home but is still close enough that it will be convenient for you to make regular trips to make deposits in your compost pile.;
, Size matters. You can have a small, compact single-chamber compost bin or you can build a multi-chamber compost bin. The size is completely up to you but the size of your bin should coincide with the amount of compost you want. If you have a small garden, a single-chamber compost bin will suffice. However, if you have a garden large enough to feed a large family, you may want to consider building a multi-chamber compost bin. If you decide to build a multi-chamber bin, each chamber will be used for the various ""stages"" in the composting cycle.

, The easiest, cheapest, most eco-friendly material to use for your compost bin are wood pallets. Not only are the pallets free, but they already have slats built right in for the air to be able to get to your compost pile. Pallets are easily obtainable from furniture stores, hardware stores, building supply stores, etc. Any facility that uses pallets for transporting goods will have a virtually limitless supply of pallets that they stack behind their store for the trash. Take a trip behind your local Big Lots store and you are bound to find as many pallets as you would like. For a single-chamber bin, you will need 5 pallets. When getting your pallets, try to find ones that have narrow openings between the slats. The narrower the slat the better because this will help contain your compost. Once you have your pallets, you will need twine to bind your pallet box together.

, So, you have your 5 pallets and twine. In the spot you've chosen to place your compost bin, lay down your first wood pallet to act as the floor of your bin. Next stand up the next 3 pallets on each of 3 sides of the 1st pallet. Use the twine to bind the corners together at the top, the center and the bottom of the corners. You should now see the box that your compost will go in. With the 5th and final pallet, place this in the opening of your box. You may choose to prop it in front of the opening or, if you are really fancy, you may attach 2 hinges to one side so that the door of your compost bin swings open. The door doesn't have to close completely. It's main function is to keep your compost pile from spilling out of the container.

, Here is the fun part. You may now put in those raked up leaves from your yard, grass clippings, kitchen waste and manure (if you have some). For your compost to be successful, you want to have a good mixture of brown (leaves) and green (grass) materials, air (which is already taken care of since you are using the pallets) and water. The manure is an excellent material to add to your compost but its not absolutely necessary. The only manure you will want to use would be cow, horse, chicken, rabbit, etc. Any animal that is naturally vegetarian will produce the desired type of manure. As for the kitchen waste, make sure you don't put any meat or animal byproducts in your compost. The meat will rot instead of decompose and the rot will introduce harmful bacteria to your compost and render your compost useless. Once your materials are in your compost bin, you will soon see bugs and worms living there. Don't be alarmed by this. These critters are vital for the success of your compost pile since they help break it down into the ""black gold"" you need for your gardening needs.

, If you want to walk away from your computer right about now because you feel tricked into doing something that requires maintenance, stay seated. Maintenance (that dirty ""m"" word) is not as difficult or as time-consuming as you may think. About once a week, you will need to turn your compost pile. If you have a pitchfork, this makes the turning very easy. Turning your compost pile consists of simply getting the composting material from the bottom of the pile to the top of the pile and vise-verse. If you don't get regular rain, you will also want to get your compost wet about once per week. You don't want to drown it but a give it a good soaking weekly if it hasn't rained.

Buy 1 4-by-8 panel of the extra-thick cedar lattice.,
Cut the sheet across the 4-foot dimension into three pieces of equal length.,
Cut one of these 32-by-48-inch pieces in half.,
Beef up all the 32-inch sides by attaching 32-inch pieces of 2-by-2, 1-by-4, or even scrap plywood.,
Buy 8 sets of hook-and-eye fasteners and install them as shown.,
Attach the long sides to the short sides with the hooks and eyes and - voila!

,
Place this bin somewhere in your garden, on one side, at one end or corner, or in the middle.,
Leave the bin uncovered.",How to Build a Cedar Lattice Compost Bin," This is usually made with 3/8-inch thick cedar strips.;
, Each piece should then be 32-inches by 48-inches.

, Now you have two pieces each 24-by-32-inches. See the accompanying pictures. When finished you'll end up with a compost box 48-inches long, 24-inches wide, and 32-inches high.

, This is shown in the pictures above where the four finished pieces are laid out. Drill holes for the screws through the cedar to prevent splitting. Use bright-finish wallboard screws with small washers - again to prevent splitting.

, These should be 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) down from the top and the same up from the bottom. Drilling pilot holes makes it much easier to screw these in. Put the hooks on the long side and eyes on the short sides - it doesn't actually make a difference, but being consistent makes it much easier to assemble the box.


These images provide good views of the scrap used to beef up the sides of the panels.

,, This way, when it's time to spread your compost, simply remove the sides and spread the contents with a rake - no having to fill and dump a wheelbarrow. Next growing season place the bin somewhere else in the garden.

, You can leave it open to the rain. The water soaks through and carries nutrients to the roots of the nearest plants. You'll notice those plants next to the bin will grow like they're on steroids. If you want to cover your bin, do so with something that will let in some rain or water from your sprinkler - a piece of plywood with holes drilled into it - or even a few boards. The spaces between the boards will let in some water.

"
"
Gather your materials.,
Nail one 2 x 6 board across the bottom of two 4 x 4s.,
Measure the amount of space you want between each 2 x 6 board.,
Having chosen your spacing, nail another 2 x 6 onto the 4 x 4 above the previous one.,
Create another section of the wall in the exact same manner.,
Prop up the two walls parallel to one another and connect the back end of the bin with a perpendicular 2 x 6.,
Complete the bin by placing the final boards perpendicularly across the front side.,
Cover with a 9 square foot cover.,
Consider making one or two more identical bins so that you can have a turning unit.",How to Build a Compost Bin1," For this basic compost bin, you'll want untreated wood. Untreated wood will last for a plenty long time, and the treatment won't interfere with the composting process or overwhelm helpful fauna. Cedar is a great option. You'll need:









Four pieces of 2 x 2s or 4 x 4s lumber, cut to 3' lengths. These posts will serve as the four corners to your square compost bin. Opt for rough, unplaned wood.8-16 pieces of 2 x 6 lumber, again cut to 3' length. These boards will make up the walls of your compost bin. Most compost bins have spaces between the exterior boards for aeration; how big you want your spaces to be will depend on whether you use 8, 12, or 16 pieces of lumber.
9 square foot cover, preferably made of solid wood. A solid cover will help maintain a more consistent internal temperature for your compost bin.
Galvanized nails or coated deck screws.;
, Place the two 4 x 4s on the ground, 3' apart so that the 2 x 6 fits evenly on either end. Measure off one or two inches from the bottom of each 4 x 4 so that the 2 x 6 will be level. Place the 2 x 6 onto the 4 x 4s and drive two nails into each 4 x 4.








, You'll want to continue building the wall by nailing 2 x 6s onto the stakes, but you'll also want a little bit of space between each 2 x 6. How much space you choose is up to you. At any rate, you'll want the space between each board to be the same, or else the bin will look less professional and put-together.









An inch or two is pretty standard. Any gap larger than two inches won't effectively hold in the material and will leave it exposed to small animals, such as raccoons and opossums.

, Continue nailing 2 x 6s into place, factoring in the desired spacing, until you reach the top of the wall. At the end of this step, you'll have two vertical 4 x 4s cross-beamed with three or four perpendicular 2 x 6s. This is 1/4 of your square bin.








, Put down two 4 x 4s. Measure off one or two inches for your starting point. Then lay a 2 x 6 board perpendicularly over the 4 x 4s, hammering it into place with four nails. Continue placing, then hammering, 2 x 6s perpendicularly over the 4 x 4s — leaving the proper spacing — until you have wall no. 2 assembled. The two walls should be mirror images of one another.








, As with the previous 2 x 6s, measure off from the bottom, drive in four nails, and space each one evenly. Hammer down 2 x 6s across the back wall of the 4 x 4 until the bin has three walls entirely built.









Make sure to offset the nails you drive into the 2 x 6s so that they don't collide with the nails driven into the 4 x 4s in the previous steps.

, Hammer three or four 2 x 6s across the front face of the bin, following the same routine and remembering to offset the nails.









For greater ease of use, make the front side removable either by adding hinges to the front boards or grooves for them to slide in and out of. This will make the easier to stir, turn, or remove the compost when needed.

, You can use a tarp or wood for the compost bin, although wood is decidedly better at retaining heat over the long run. If you desire, consider making two small wooden handles and attaching them to either side of your cover for easier placement.








, One bin contains active compost material; another bin contains processed (or processing) compost materials; the final bin contains soil you'll use to cover the active compost bin.

Gather the materials needed to build an “on-the-ground” tumbling composter.,
Drill two holes into the lid and bottom of your container using a 7/8” drill bit.,
Create aeration holes all over your container.,
Drill two holes straight through each end of your two metal or aluminum pipes using a 1/4"" metal drill bit.,
Drill two additional holes into each pipe, and then thread your rod through those holes.,
Secure the pipe and rod structure to your container.,
Fill your tumbling composter with composting ingredients and secure the lid.,
Test the security of your lid by rolling your new tumbling composter across the ground.",How to Build a Tumbling Composter1," An inexpensive and less complicated way to build your own tumbling composter is by creating an “on the ground” tumbling composter, which is simply a container outfitted to hold compost that you “turn” by simply rolling the container across the ground. Purchase or obtain a large cylindrical container with a lid that fits tight. A garbage can works best, and is likely the easiest to find. Select either a plastic or metal garbage can that will hold at least 30 gallons; large containers used for composting hold 55 gallons. Wash the garbage can or container thoroughly if it has been used. Additional materials you’ll need include:


Two 48"" lengths of 1/2"" metal/aluminum pipe
One 36"" length of 1/4"" steel threaded rod (zinc plated)
Four 2"" long 1/4"" bolts
Eight 1/4"" nuts
A 1/4"" metal drill bit
A 7/8"" drill bit
Drill
Hacksaw
Measuring tape
Ear and eye protection
2 elastic bungee cords that are the same length as the can's diameter (optional);
, The holes you’ll drill into the lid need to be 4” from the outer edge of the lid and directly across from each other, or specifically 180 degrees apart. The holes at the bottom of the container need to be 2” from the edge. You’ll need to place the holes at the bottom in a sunken part of the container’s base because you’ll be sticking metal or aluminum pipes through these holes and you want your tumbling composter to be able to stand upright once assembled.

, Drill several holes, about 15-20, into the top and bottom and along the sides of the container using your drill and a 1/4” drill bit. Space the holes evenly. The holes will allow oxygen to flow freely throughout your tumbling composter.

, Make sure to place them as close to the end of pipes as possible. Doing so will enable your tumbling composter to stand up properly.

, Once the pipes and connected rod are placed inside the container, the rod will need to rest in the middle of the container. Therefore your two additional holes must measure at half the height of your container. Measure the height of your container and divide that measurement by two. The number you come up with will be the length you measure on your two pipes to determine where your two holes will be drilled. Use your 1/4"" metal drill to drill the two holes straight through the pipe.


Before you thread your rod through the new holes, it’ll need to be cut down to size in order to fit inside your container. To do this, measure the diameter of the container at the point where the pipes’ holes will be. You found this point earlier by dividing the height of your container by two. When you come up with the diameter of the container, cut the rod 1” shorter than that, so it’ll fit easily inside the container.
Slide one end of the rod through one of the pipes until the pipe is about 3” from the other end of the rod. Then screw onto the rod two of the 1/4"" nuts. Start at the end of the rod that is farthest from the pole. Each nut should be about 4"" from each end of the rod. Once secured, the first nut will be right next to the pole, while the second nut will be about 4"" from the end of the rod. Once the second nut is secured, slide the rod through the second pipe, stopping when the pipe touches the 1/4"" nut. Secure the two pipes by screwing an additional 1/4"" nut on the outer edges of the rod next to each pipe.

, Place the structure inside the container and then turn the container on its side to make it easier to thread the ends of the pipe through the two 7/8” holes in the bottom of the container. Secure the pipes by sliding a 2” bolt through the 1/4"" holes you drilled into the ends of the pipes, and then screwing two 1/4"" nuts onto the ends of each bolt. Stand the container upright and then secure the lid by threading the tops of the pipes through the two 7/8” holes.


You’ll need to drill holes into the length of the pipes just above the lid, so that once bolted the lid will stay secure when you roll it on the ground.
Use a marker to mark the spots where you’ll drill your holes, and then to ensure your holes are even, disassemble your tumbling composter, and lie the pipes flat on the ground when you drill them.
Drill two holes straight through each pipe using the metal 1/4"" drill bit, and then reassemble your tumbling composter.

, To secure the lid, follow the same method used to secure the pipes to the bottom of the container. Use two bolts and nuts on each side of the bolts, after you’ve filled your tumbling composter with composting ingredients. Slide one bolt through each of the 1/4"" holes you've just drilled, and then secure those bolts by attaching a 1/4"" nut to each end of the bolts. If necessary, you can secure bungee cords over the top of the container by laying them in a crisscross pattern over the lid and securing the cords either underneath the handles of the lid or through a few newly drilled holes.

, Make sure your lid is tightly secured by rolling it across the ground. If dirt begins to spill from around the top, adjust your bolts, or tighten or obtain bungee cords to further tie down your lid.

This bin will be able to compost things like yard waste, sawdust, and leaves. It can only be used outdoors over soil and will compost very slowly.









The height of the rectangle will be the height of your bin.
The length of the rectangle will be the diameter of your bin.
If you’re not sure where to begin, hold the uncut chicken wire in front of you to get a sense of how tall and wide you’d like it to be. Since you’ll be filling this bin with yard waste, err on the large side.

, These will be staked into the ground to maintain the shape of your wire bin, so be sure that they are longer than the height of your chicken wire.








, Stretching it out will make it easier to work with.








, This works best of you place the stake beneath the wire. The top of the stake should stick out slightly above the top of the wire.








, Your chicken wire should now be in the shape of a cylinder.








, It may be necessary to crawl inside the wire to reach the stake better.








, Make sure you choose a spot that won’t get in your way later.








, Be sure to stake them close enough to the wire that they don’t pull it out of shape. When you are done, the four stakes should be in the shape of a square.








, Once the bin is fully secured, you can start filling it with yard waste.

Put anything into your compost bin except the following materials.,
Know your greens and browns.,
Shred your materials up for expedited composting.,
Pay attention to heat and moisture in your compost pile.,
Stir your compost with a strong pole or tool, making sure to cover your food scraps with dirt.,
Keep the compost cover anchored down with a heavy object in order to discourage looting from animals.",How to Build a Compost Bin3," All organic matter will eventually decompose if you give it enough time. Grass, garden clippings, leftover fruits and vegetables, and certain animal manure are all fair game for your compost bin. Less advised is throwing meat, bones, and dairy (cheese, etc.) into the compost heap. Animal manure like cow and chicken manure is fine, but try to avoid cat or dog manure.








, Green compostable materials, which contain essential sources of nitrogen, include grasses, garden clippings, and green leaves.They are mostly moist. Brown compostable materials, which contain carbon-rich materials, include drier materials such as hay, twigs, and shredded cardboard. A mix of two parts green to one part brown is the ideal compost ratio.








You don't have to be exact with your ratios. As long as you don't have an abundance of greens or an abundance of browns, your compost should turn out nutrient-rich and successful.

, If you want to speed up the pace of your compost cycle, make sure to shred your materials before adding them to the bin. Grass clippings, of course, come pre-shredded, but you may want to put your twigs, hay, and other dry matter through the shredder in order to enlarge its surface area.The larger the surface area, the more the small animals and bacteria can process.








, In order to get the composting kickstarted, your pile needs to be hot and wet. The two biggest problems a compost system encounters are lack of heat and lack of moisture. These affect the composting process in different ways.









Try to keep the internal heat of your compost bin at 110 °F (43 °C) or higher. Between 110 °F (43 °C) and 140 °F (60 °C) is the ideal temperature for your pile. If your pile dips below 110 °F (43 °C), consider adding more green nitrogen-rich material or more water.
Try to keep the compost pile damp throughout — never soaked and never dry. A moist pile will heat up more efficiently, allowing for better composing in the end.

, A pitchfork is recommended and will work best. Mixing the compost will help breakdown the scraps faster. Mixing sinks the superficial compost to the bottom and brings the bottom-dwelling compost up top. Give your compost a stir every other day, especially if you notice it not getting hot enough.








, A couple heavy bricks, placed near the center of your compost cover, will effectively keep animals like raccoons and opossums from throwing off the cover and looting your compost for easy pickings.

Gather the materials needed to construct a “barrel-roll”tumbling composter.If you prefer to expend less energy turning your compost, building a “barrel-roll” tumbling composter will help.,
Drill holes in the center of the top and bottom of your barrel.,
Drill holes into the body of the barrel for aeration.,
Create a door on the side of your barrel.,
Attach a sheet of metal inside the barrel to act as a mixing fin to help turn the compost when the barrel rotates.,
Pass the pipe or post through the center holes.,
Build a wooden saw buck to support the compost barrel.,
Set the barrel with the pipe in the wooden 2x4 saw buck.

,
Rotate the barrel in the sawhorse frame using the pipe or post as an axle to ensure it works properly.",How to Build a Tumbling Composter2," This type of tumbling composter sits atop a wooden structure and turns on an axle, such as a PVC or steel pipe, that runs directly through it. You’ll need to purchase or obtain a plastic or steel barrel, between 20 and 55 gallons (75-200 liters), including a 48 inch (1.25 meter) length of 2 inch (5 cm) schedule 80 PVC pipe, or a length of 1 1/2 to 2 inch (3.8-5 cm) galvanized steel pipe. You’ll also need:


2X4 treated lumber
Nails
Circular saw
Jigsaw
Drill motor, drill paddle bit, and drill bits
Hole saw
Basic hand tools (hammer, measuring tape, flexible metal ruler, framing square)
Hinges
Latches
Door handle
“L” brackets

, Measure the diameter of each end of your barrel, and then divide that measurement by two to determine the center point. Your holes should be large enough to fit the pipe you’ll be using as the axle. If you can, cut off a small piece of your axle pipe, place it over each center mark, and trace a circle along the outside of the pipe. If you can’t, measure the diameter of your axle pipe and draw a circle of the same size around each center point. Once your circles have been created, use a drill paddle bit or hole saw of an equal size to create your holes.

, Using a 1-inch (2.5 cm) bit space 15-20 holes evenly along the sides of the barrel. This will allow oxygen to flow freely throughout the container.

, Before you start cutting out a door, trace the shape of the door you want along one side of the barrel using a flexible metal ruler and a framing square. The measurements for the door will differ depending on the size of your barrel. If your barrel is on the smaller size, like 20 to 30 gallons, trace a 12” by 12” square. If it’s a 55 gallon barrel, you can outline an 18” by 12” rectangle. The longer side should be parallel to the length of the barrel.


Make a couple small holes in one of the corners using your drill to allow space for your jigsaw blade to start cutting. Continue to use the blade all the way around the outline of the door until the shape is removed.
The door will likely be a bit flimsy once secured. If your barrel is plastic, secure two pieces of wood to the inside of the barrel, one along the side where you’ve placed your hatches and the other on the opposite end where you’ll place your latches and handle. If your barrel is metal, use two steel plates instead of wood. Consider flattening two “L” brackets to use for your steel plates.To secure the door, install two hinges at the top corners, then install two latches at the bottom corners to lock the door. You can place a handle at the center point of the two latches to help with opening and closing the door.

, A long spare piece of galvanized sheet metal bent into an “L” shape and bolted to the interior wall of the barrel will do this nicely. Put the fin opposite from the hatch, so as to weight balance the empty container.

, When you’re ready, slide the pipe through the center holes. The length of pipe sticking out of each side of the barrel should be long enough to rest each end on the wooden structure you’ll create.


If you’re using a plastic barrel, the weight of the compost inside your tumbling composter can break the plastic, so before inserting the pipe through the holes secure two slabs of wood to the barrel to distribute the weight of the compost.
Take two slabs of wood, such as 2”x4” pieces, and drill into each piece a hole large enough to fit your pipe through. Line each hole up to the holes on either end of your barrel and nail the boards to the barrel.
Alternately, you can secure an “L” bracket to each side of the pipe, which will also distribute the weight of the compost.

, Nail 2 sets of 2x4s (pieces of wood that are 1.5″ × 3.5″ or 38×89 mm in terms of height and width, respectively) in an x-frame, and nail two 2x4s across the feet at the bottom for support.

,, If it does, you can now fill your tumbling composter with leaves and other compostable material, and allow your new ""garden helper"" to do its job.

Use wood ashes as a soil amendment in the early spring while the soil is dry and before the plant life has begun to actively grow.,
Apply 20 pounds (9 kg) of wood ashes per 1000 square feet (93 square m) of soil, tilling them thoroughly into the soil.,
Sprinkle ashes upon each layer of your compost pile.,
Amend heavy clay soil by using wood ashes because they break up the soil and help it retain more air.

,
Deter garden pests by using wood ashes.,
To keep your ashes where you want them, apply them on a day that is not too windy.,
Use caution when using ashes in the garden.,
Produce more wood ashes by burning hardwoods rather than soft woods.",How to Use Ashes As Fertilizer,"


Nearly all plants benefit from the potash content of wood ashes. Other components of the ashes are beneficial to the soil and plant growth as well.
Because the wood ashes act as a liming agent, they reduce the acidity of the soil. Plants that prefer acidic soil such as blueberries, azaleas or rhododendrons will not thrive if wood ashes are applied.;
, Leaving the ashes in concentrated piles could cause too much of a salt build-up in areas of the soil that could potentially harm your plants.

, The ashes help break down the organic materials as they compost.

,, Sprinkled lightly throughout the garden bed, wood ashes repel maggots, aphids, slugs, snails, and cutworms. Reapply the ashes after heavy rains.

, Otherwise they're liable to blow away before they have a chance to settle into the soil.

,


The ashes contain a good amount of lye which is a caustic agent. For this reason, refrain from placing them on young tender plants. Wear gloves when handling the ashes. Use a mask to avoid breathing in the residue and protect your eyes with sunglasses or goggles.
Avoid using ashes from cardboard, coal or painted wood. These substances contain chemicals that can be harmful to your plants.
Monitor your soil to be sure it hasn't become too alkaline. Use a soil testing kit to check the PH levels or take a soil sample to your county extension office lab to be evaluated. Alkaline soil will need sulfur added to it.

, Hardwoods will make 3 times the amount of ash per cord of wood than soft woods.

Rake through the soil.,
Water the soil thoroughly.,
Cover the soil with a clear plastic sheet.,
Let the soil area sit for 4-6 weeks.,
Alternately, sterilize the soil in your oven.,
Save kitchen scraps, grass clippings, and other compostable material.,
Mix 3 parts “browns” with 1 part “greens.” “Browns” are materials that produce carbon, such as leaves, straw, and cornstalks.,
Put compostable material in a composting container.,
Process the compost through a screen.,
Purchase or acquire sand.,
Get peat moss.,
Get vermiculite.,
Assemble fertilizers and nutrients.,
Wear protective gear.,
Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your work space.,
Measure out your ingredients.,
Pour all ingredients separately through wire mesh hardware cloth.,
Put in the peat moss first into your mixing bin.,
Add fertilizers and mix thoroughly.,
Add compost, vermiculite and perlite.,
Store your potting mix.,
Test your soil with a pH meter.,
Test your soil with a bioassay.",How to Make Your Own Potting Mix," Choose the area of ground from which you’ll be taking soil and cultivate the area. Remove any dead leaves, weeds, plant trimmings and other debris.Rake through the soil and smooth it out so that it is level.


Do not use areas that contain pesticides, chemicals or other pollutants. This can contaminate your soil.;
, The water should reach approximately 12 inches deep into the soil. This will improve how well heat will conduct through the soil, heating it up and solarizing it thoroughly.

, Seal in the soil under a plastic sheet; you can use a painter’s tarp, which is readily available at home supply stores. Place rocks or line soil along the edges of the sheet to hold them down.

, There will be a good deal of heat generated and trapped under the plastic sheet, which will work to solarize the soil and kill unwanted pests, pathogens, and weeds. Summertime with hot and sunny weather is the ideal time to solarize soil.Leaving the tarp on longer than 4-6 weeks will result in a disintegrating tarp.
You can rotate the areas of your garden that are being solarized , devoting a section of the garden to solarizing soil while another section has growing plants.
Covering the ground like this in the colder months will actually create better conditions for weeds by warming the soil. Only do this during warmer months.

, Fill glass or metal baking pans full of soil. Cover tightly with tin foil and bake at 200 °F (93 °C) for about 30 minutes. Stir the soil every 5 minutes as it bakes. Allow to cool completely.Your house will smell earthy when you use this method, which can be off-putting to some people.

, Plant-based materials, including grass, straw, leaves, kitchen scraps, coffee grounds and weeds are great materials for a compost heap. Compost will ensure your homemade potting mix will have rich nutrients and beneficial microbes.

, “Greens,” which produce nitrogen, include kitchen scraps, coffee grounds, weeds, grass trimmings and the like.Never put animal meats, dairy products, feces from dogs, cats or pigs, or biosolids (human waste) in your compost. This can make your compost a health hazard., This container can be purchased at a home supply store or made yourself. It should have a lid and be at least 3 feet cubed. This minimum size will ensure that the contents will be able to heat to 160 °F (71 °C) for at least 2 weeks. This will result in fully composted material.Be sure to turn over the composting material at least 5 times during these 2 weeks in order to ensure that the material is composting throughout.
You can also add worms to your compost, which helps the composting process.

, Once the material is fully composted, which usually takes about three months, push it through a screen in order to get particles of compost that are a consistent size. The particles should be relatively small so that you can mix it well into your potting mix. Return the larger particles to your compost bin., Sand will add air space in the potting mix, improving drainage in the dirt. Choose builder’s sand, which has a coarse texture. Do not use fine sand or plaster sand, as these are too fine and add a denser texture.Perlite is a good sand substitute. Made from volcanic rock, perlite is pH neutral and can improve how water drains from the soil. It is not as heavy as sand., Peat moss, or sphagnum moss, improves water retention in your potting mix. This can be especially helpful for plants that require more water over a sustained period of time.Peat moss is readily available at garden centers and does not cost much.


Peat moss does have high acidity, however, and may need to be counterbalanced to improve the pH balance in your soil.
You can also use ground-up newspaper in place of peat moss, which will also help retain water.Coir fiber is another option to take the place of peat moss. Coir is the fiber from coconut husks and will improve water retention. It is usually sold at garden centers as a compressed brick that expands when moistened.Bark can also be used as a partial substitute for peat moss. It creates a lot of air space in the soil, although it does not retain water quite like peat.Some experts suggest avoiding bark, however, because it can immobilize nitrogen, a crucial component of good potting mix., Vermiculite is a volcanic rock material that is silvery gray in color. It is coarse, resembling mini pebbles, and it can improve water retention.Handle vermiculite gently to ensure that it does not lose its air holding capacity.Choose either a medium grade or coarse grade of vermiculite.

, Good rich potting mix requires fertilizers and nutrients to give your plants food to help them grow strong, healthy and productive. Some of these materials might include blood meal (for nitrogen), bone meal (for phosphorus), greensand (for potassium), and other minerals. These are all readily available at garden centers.Limestone is another typical nutritional ingredient. Limestone is used to increase calcium or magnesium levels in the potting mix.Dolomitic limestone is best to get a combination of both calcium and magnesium in your soil.
The exception to fertilizing would be if you want to use your potting mix to start seeds. Skip fertilizers for sensitive seedlings.

, Gardening gloves will protect your hands from minor slivers, while a face mask will help prevent inhalation of dust and particles from the materials you’re working with.

, Having all your tools and supplies on hand will speed up the process of making your own potting mix.You’ll need:



Large receptacle for mixing: This can be a large bucket, garbage can, wheelbarrow or other container.

Container for measuring: Some of the materials will be added in smaller amounts to the potting mix. It is helpful to have a container to measure accurately. A 5-gallon bucket is a useful size, as are 1-cup measuring cups.

Water: Have a watering can and hose available.

Trowel: A trowel will be useful for mixing your materials together.

Shovel: Have a shovel ready for shoveling larger amounts of soil, peat and compost into your mix.

Hardware cloth: Hardware cloth is a wire mesh screen that will be used to push your materials through to sift out the large pieces and debris. One-quarter inch hardware cloth is ideal.

, It can be helpful to have a table for preparing the potting mix, especially if you’re making smaller batches in buckets. At the very least, you should have a level, open, work space that is outdoors. Put a tarp underneath your work space to catch extra dirt and other material.


Use a mixing barrel or large garbage can for mixing your potting mix.

, There are a number of different recipes for potting mix, each of which is appropriate for different types of plants. For a general, all-purpose potting mix, use the following recipe:


Measure 1 part peat moss; 2 parts compost; 1 part vermiculite; 1 part sterilized garden soil; and 1 part perlite or sand. To start, use a 5-gallon bucket as each “part.”

, To remove large chunks and debris, run each of your ingredients through a screen or ¼ inch hardware cloth.Hardware cloth is wire mesh available in rolls from hardware and home supply stores for $5-$10 per roll.

, Dump all the peat moss that you’re using into a mixing bin. It may help to start with a small batch of soil, instead of using all of your available materials in the first batch.

, These will add nutrients to your potting mixture. A good fertilizing mixture is:For everyone 5 gallons of other ingredients, add 1 cup greensand; 1 cup blood meal; ½ cup bonemeal; ½ cup lime; and ½ cup rock phosphate.

, Add each of these ingredients one by one and mix thoroughly. Turn over the soil to make sure you are mixing them all in throughout the potting mix., Store the unused potting mix in an old garbage can or other container with a lid. Choose a sheltered spot for storage. You don’t want your potting mix to be exposed to rain before it’s in your garden, so choose a spot that is under cover. Similarly, your potting mix should not be directly exposed to sun, especially in hot weather. A garden shed is a good storage place., The pH measures the acidity and alkaline levels of the soil.Meters that measure the soil’s pH levels are available for purchase online for $20 or more. Let the mixture mature for a week to give all the ingredients a chance to blend together before testing the pH. Place the pH meter in your soil to test its pH. If the soil is too high in either acid or alkaline, nutrients may not be absorbed into plants as easily.


An ideal pH level for most plants will be between 5.5 and 7.0To raise the pH levels, or to make it more alkaline, add some lime. To lower the pH, or to make it more acidic, add more sulphur.Make small batches of soil to test different mixtures and proportions. This will help you get a feel for how different ingredients produce different pH levels.

, A bioassay is a test to check the viability of a biological specimen. Basically, this means that you’re going to use the soil to start seeds and monitor how they grow. Try growing oats, beans, or lettuce from seed. Monitor how quickly the seeds germinate and how the seedlings grow.If the majority of seeds do not germinate or the seedlings grow slowly, your potting mix might be poor. Try a different recipe for your potting mix. Search online for “potting mix recipe” to find another option.
Remember to skip the fertilizer in your mix if you’re going to be using it to start seeds.

Determine percentages of the major active ingredients in the package.,
Know what each ingredient is used for.,
Research your plants needs.",How to Read a Fertilizer Label," N-P-K (Nitrogen- Phosphorus- Potassium) are the 3 most abundant ingredients listed on EVERY fertilizer label. They are always in this order, N-P-K. You will see them on the label as three numbers. Such as: 30-10-10 / 10-5-5 / 21-0-0 But what does it mean and how do you know which formula you need? The first example, 30-10-10, means that if you had 100 pounds of that fertilizer there would be 30 pounds of available nitrogen, 10 pounds of available phosphorus and 10 pounds of available potassium (potash). The remaining 50 pounds are inert or inactive ingredients.;
, Nitrogen is for green and growth. Phosphorus and Potassium for fruit, flower and roots. To turn a lawn green and get it growing, 21-0-0 is the fastest and cheapest way to go. That is Sulphate of Ammonia. However, to promote a healthy lawn that is more drought-tolerant, you would want the roots to be well developed also. A general purpose lawn fertilizer such as 10-6-4 would be a far better diet to achieve a truly healthy lawn.

, Check several sources. Compare notes on what different experts recommend for the type of plants you are growing. When making fertilizer purchases your knowledge of N-P-K percentages will aid in your decisions. Nitrogen = Green/Growth. Phosphorus and Potassium = Fruit/Flower/Roots.

Buy a soil test kit at your garden store or have your soil tested by your local agricultural extension service.,
Choose a Miracle-Gro product that contains the correct ratio of nutrients for your soil.,
Follow the specific directions on the Miracle-Gro product you have purchased.,
Mix the granules and water well until the solution is completely dissolved.

,
Water your houseplants with the solution or simply add some to the plant’s saucer tray; the roots will soak it up.

,
Read the application instructions on the container to determine how much you need to apply, and how often.",How to Use Miracle Gro," The soil test will tell you which nutrients your soil is lacking.;
, Miracle-Gro’s All-Purpose Plant Food, for example, has a 15-30-15 ratio, meaning that there is 15% Nitrogen, 30% Phosphate, and 15% Potash. Compare your soil test results with the ratios listed on Miracle-Gro products to be sure you get the right combination your soil needs.

, Most of the granular products call for a single scoop (provided with product) for each gallon (3.78 L) of water.

,,, It’s also a good idea to research the nutrient requirements of your specific flowers and trees to determine how often they require additional fertilizer.

Water the soil before the application of fertiliser.,
Clear away anything that you don't want To be fertilized.,
Turn over hard soil.,
As with any product to be applied to your garden, read the instructions first.",How to Prepare Soil for the Application of Fertiliser," This is important whether the fertiliser being applied is artificial or organic in nature.;
, This includes weeds, potted plants sitting on the soil, and any ornaments sitting on the soil near the plants.

, If soil has compacted, turn it over a little and churn it before applying fertiliser. This will ensure that it aerates better after application of the fertiliser.

, If the product is homemade, know the correct amounts and effects of the fertiliser before adding.

Set up a feeding system.,
Once the earth worms have eaten all the food given then the following steps will be taken:

,
Washing Worms.,
Catching Worms.,
Sieving Out Undigested Compost.,
Collecting Vermicast.,
Leave the vermicast to dry out.

,
Worm Wash.,
Worms After Wash. Undigested compost and the worms are placed on a netting on top of fresh compost.",How to Make Vermicast,"


Wind Row System. Place food on the right hand side of the row and keep it moist. Scrape vermicast off the opposite side because the worms will gravitate towards the direction that you feed them on. Therefore you are able to remove the vermicast from the left and it won't contain any of the worms.
Pond System. Start at the bottom-15 centimeter (5.9 in) compost. Keep adding 15 centimeter (5.9 in) compost at a time till pond is full. Remove whole pond to wash.
Wind Rows Undercover. Food is placed on front and kept moist. Vermicast is scraped off the opposite side. Feed from the front, worms keep moving forward so what you remove from the back won't contain any of the worms. This is usually done in sheds and on a smaller scale.;
,, This step occurs more so in the pond system however some worms are taken in the wind row system during the collection of the vermicast. Vermicast and worms mixed together in a tank of water, it is stirred, the worms are separated to the outside. Once everything is mixed up, the vermicast is suspended in the water and the worms disperse to the outside of the tank which are then caught in the nets.

, Worms are caught and placed in into buckets.

, Undigested compost is taken out with any worms that are left over. There may also be worm eggs which will need to be taken out as well.

, Vermicast settles towards the bottom of the tank and water drains off.

,, Liquid left over-can be used as liquid fertiliser.

, The worms will move into the compost leaving the undigested compost which you can then remove.

Gather the seaweed.,
Rinse the seaweed to remove some of the excess salt.

,
Fill a bucket or barrel to three quarters way with water.,
Stir the seaweed mix every two to four days.

,
Allow to soak for several weeks to several months.,
Use as needed.",How to Make Seaweed Tea Liquid Fertiliser," Make sure it is lawful to do so and do not pillage your local beach! Look for seaweed that isn't too stinky and is still wet.;
,, Add as much seaweed as will fit and leave to soak.

,, The fertiliser grows stronger over time. Make sure to keep the brew somewhere that its odours won't affect your daily household. It is ready for use when it no longer carries a smell of ammonium., When it is ready, use as a fertiliser on your plants and garden beds (soil). It should be diluted with water at a minimum of three parts to one."
"
Use soluble fertilizer when you want to water in the fertilizer.,
Use granular fertilizer when you need to supply a concentrated amount of nutrients.,
Use controlled-release fertilizers when you want peace of mind that your plants are getting fertilized gradually.,
Use manure pellets when you want an organic form of slow-release fertilizer.",How to Tell the Difference Between Different Types of Plant Fertilizers," This fertilizer is usually added to the watering can.


This is best for helping boost growth when its growing season and for frequently fed container plants.;
, A plant may be lacking in a particular nutrient (this will be evident through such things as yellow leaves, wilting, etc. and then you'll need to match the symptom to the cause using a plant guide). This type of fertilizer can provide an instant boost of the necessary nutrient.


Heed the use advice and warnings on this fertilizer. Too much can burn and even kill the plant.
Usually this fertilizer is intended only for a short-term boost.

, Good for gardeners who forget, the metered dose is also often good for the plant, as it's not getting too much in one dose. Check the packaging for details of duration but it's commonplace for the fertilizer to continue releasing over a period of 4 to 9 months.


This fertilizer can be used for a wide range of plants.

, This will feed the plant and enrich the surrounding soil. Read the instructions accompanying the pellets for correct use and application.

Use compost.,
Add in some composted coffee grounds.Coffee grounds can be mixed directly into the soil or added to a pre-established compost pile.,
Try composted manure.,
Mix in a good dose of blood meal for a quick-release fertilizer.Blood meal is an organic product made from dried blood, and it contains 13 percent total nitrogen.,
Apply cotton seed meal cautiously.,
Use crab meal, feather meal, or leather meal for slow-release fertilizers.,
Try biosolids and wood.,
Plant nitrogen-fixing cover crops.",How to Make Nitrogen Fertilizer," Compost is nothing more than decomposed organic matter. The average compost pile contains a plethora of beneficial nutrients, including potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Regarding nitrogen, the bacteria in compost break matter down into ammonium, which is then naturally converted by other bacteria into nitrates that plants can absorb through their roots. Compost high in nitrogen materials, including moist greens, fruits, and vegetables, tends to provide the highest content of nitrogen to the soil bed it is applied to.;
, The grounds contain about two percent nitrogen by volume, which is considered fairly high as far as nitrogen-containing materials are concerned. Additionally, while some worry about the acidic properties of coffee, it is the coffee beans rather than the grounds that contain high levels of acid. Coffee grounds that remain after brewing are usually between a pH of 6.5 and 6.8, which is near neutral.


You can add coffee grounds directly to the soil by mixing damp grounds into the soil or by spreading the grounds over the surface of the soil and covering them with organic mulch.

, Sheep, beef cattle, and swine manure contain the largest concentrations of nitrogen, with poultry and dairy cattle manure following closely behind. Horse manure also contains some nitrogen, but the concentration is significantly less than it is in other forms of manure. Composted manure, or manure that has had the chance to decompose, is better to use because bacteria has already begun to break down the nitrogen into a form that plants can absorb.


Note that there are downsides to using animal manure. Manure tends to increase the salt content of soil, and using manure may lead to an increased yield of weeds.

, This is a notably high percentage for fertilizer components. You can use blood meal as a nitrogen fertilizer by sprinkling it over the top surface of the soil and pouring water over it to help the soil soak it in, or you could mix the blood meal directly with water and apply it as a liquid fertilizer.


Blood meal is an especially good source of nitrogen for heavy feeders, like lettuce and corn, because of how fast-acting it is.
Blood meal can also be used as a component in compost or as an accelerant for other organic materials, since it promotes the decomposition process.

, This fertilizer component is made of ground seeds from the cotton plant. Some consider it to be the second best natural source of nitrogen, following blood meal. Unlike blood meal, however, cotton seed meal breaks down slowly, distributing nitrogen to plants over an extended length of time.


The major disadvantage of cotton seed meal is that it has a negative impact on soil pH. It greatly acidifies soil, so if you plan to make an organic fertilizer out of cotton seed meal, you should also carefully monitor the pH of your soil.

, These products are made from ground crab, feathers, and cowhide leather, respectively, and each contains a decent amount of nitrogen. These components all break down at a slow pace, however, and will not provide adequate amounts of usable nitrates to plants in need of a quick dose. These components are good to use in fertilizer mixes and composts, though, since they can maintain a steady content of nitrogen throughout the growing season.

, Treated biosolids and wood materials Sawdust, wood chips, and sewage sludge (which are pre-treated before using as fertilizer) all contain nitrogen and can all be used in nitrogen fertilizers, just make sure that the biosolid you will be using are treated and monitored properly, if not,the associated risks of such products may not be worth the potential benefit. Moreover, because these materials all decompose slowly and contribute small amounts of nitrogen, they are not even the most beneficial nitrogen components available.While they might not be the best choice for nitrogen fertilizers, biosolid fertilizers add much needed nutrients. Wood chips also add anchorage for the plants.

, Certain plants, like legumes and clover, store nitrogen in nodules at their roots. These nodules release nitrogen into the soil gradually while the plant lives, and when the plant dies, the remaining nitrogen enhances the overall quality of the soil.


Just toss some legumes on the soil. Mung beans are suggested since they don't grow too big but they grow fast.
To replenish Nitrogen on the soil. Try fallowing. When resting your plot on the 7th year, sow some mung beans. Don't harvest the mung beans, instead, let the seeds fall into the ground for more nitrogen-fixers. Do this, especially if you will be planting heavy feeders like corn on the next growing year.

Determine how much fertilizer you need.,
Measure out 4 cups (.25 liters) of cottonseed meal.,
Add 1 cup (237 milliliters) of lime.,
Add a phosphorous booster.,
Add kelp or seaweed in the fertilizer.,
Distribute your fertilizer onto the soil.",How to Make Fertilizer1," You will need about 1-quart (.25 liters) of fertilizer for every 20-square feet of soil. Your measurements do not need to be exact, so estimate your needs based on the size of your garden.You can adjust the ratio of the fertilizer recipe to make the quantity of fertilizer that you need.;
, Cottonseed meal is commonly used in fertilizer because it contains 7% nitrogen, which is what nourishes the plants. Cottonseed meal also has a high protein content. Seed meal is the byproduct of vegetable oils and is often used as animal feed. For the best results, get a certified organic bag to protect you and your plants. While fertilizer is normally measured in nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus levels, seed meal is measured in protein since it is usually livestock food.


Seed meal is cheapest in large quantities, and can be stored in an airtight container for years., When buying lime you have three options -- agricultural lime, gypsum, and dolomite (or dolomitic lime). All three of them will boost plant health and productivity the best, but if you're on a budget you can cut the recipe to just one of the three options.


If you do only buy one form of lime, use dolomite whenever possible, as it contains essential magnesium., Mix in 1 cup (237 milliliters) bone meal, phosphate rock, or bat guano to increase the phosphorus levels. While the two ingredients above, seed meal and lime, are the most essential, a good fertilizer usually supplies phosphorus. If budget is an issue, you can skip this step, but bone meal is easy to find at garden stores and will make a big difference for your plants.


Like the rest of the ingredients, bone meal can be bought cheaply in bulk and stored in an airtight container for several years.

, Mix in 1 cup (237 milliliters) kelp meal or dried seaweed to provide essential trace minerals. Again, this step isn't necessary if you're on a budget, by kelp meal helps plants resist stress from heat, cold, drought, and a multitude of other issues. Your best option for cheap kelp meal is usually online.


A similar but less expensive alternative is basalt dust., Spread roughly 1 quart of fertilizer over the earth before planting anything, mixing gently into the soil. For nutrient heavy vegetables like cabbage, spinach, brussels sprouts, asparagus, or leeks, you can also sprinkle some fertilizer around the roots every 3-4 weeks. If you feel like your soil isn't very rich (for example, there is a lot of clay), you can add another half quart per 20 square feet.


If your plants are already in the ground but want some fertilizer, use your hands or a trowel to lightly mix the fertilizer into the top layer of soil. Lightly water the plants both before and after applying.

"
Decide between organic and conventional fertilizer.A broad and important choice you'll be confronted with is whether to use organic or inorganic fertilizer.,
Purchase a soil test.,
Determine whether your plants need nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium.The 3 main nutrients provided by plant fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.,
Choose the appropriate fertilizer for your plants' nutrient needs.Packaged fertilizers always display their NPK content on the package.,
Apply fertilizer routinely to plants every 60 days or so.",How to Know What Fertilizer to Use On Your Garden Plants and When to Use It1," Fertilizer not marked as ""organic"" is typically petroleum-based, and should not be used in organic gardens. Organic fertilizer can come from many sources, including animals (e.g. manure), plants (e.g. seaweed), and minerals (e.g. Epsom salt).


If you're buying non-organic fertilizer, you'll need to choose a release speed. General-purpose fertilizer releases most of its nutrients within a few months, and so will have to be applied several times per season. Slow-release fertilizers remain effective for an entire growing season. Water-soluble fertilizers become available to the plants as soon as you water the area.
The distinction regarding release speed does not need to be made with organic fertilizers. Plants will use the nutrients in organic fertilizer at the rate needed, so there is no risk of over-fertilizing and burning the plants.;
, After the winter season has passed and the spring has begun, conduct a soil test to assess the pH and acidity level of your soil. Poor soil means that the soil is deprived of nutrients so fertilizing your soil can be a great solution to that.Even a nutrient-rich ground can still benefit from regular fertilizing, especially since growing produce strips soil of its nutrients.Choose your fertilizer depending on the quality of the soil and the plants you are trying to grow., In fact, the concentrations of these 3 nutrients are printed on the front of each package as a series of 3 numbers, sometimes called the ""NPK"" numbers or the fertilizer grade.


Deficiencies of these 3 minerals can be roughly diagnosed through leaf appearance. Nitrogen deficiencies lead to yellow and brown leaves; phosphorus deficiencies cause purple-veined and slow-growing leaves; potassium deficiencies lead to curled, distorted leaves.
The balance between nitrogen and potassium determines where plants focus their growth. A high nitrogen-to-potassium ratio boosts leaf growth, which is ideal for lawns, shrubs, and other plants in which foliage is desirable. A high potassium-to-nitrogen ratio will boost fruit, flower, and vegetable growth at the expense of leaf growth.
To achieve the most accurate picture of your soil's nutrient content, you can have a soil sample from your garden analyzed. In the U.S., many county extension offices can perform this test or direct you towards an organization that can.

, Some types of fertilizers are richer in 1 nutrient than another, and you should match this nutrient content to your plants' needs.


Plant-derived fertilizers provide quick nutrients to your soil and can be applied often. Corn gluten meal is a good source of nitrogen; soybean meal is a good source of phosphorus; alfalfa meal is a good source of potassium.
Animal-derived fertilizers tend to offer large amounts of nitrogen, and are therefore good for encouraging leafy growth. Bone meal is also a good source of phosphorus, and fish emulsion is a great all-purpose fertilizer. Manure, while often low in nutrient content, provides a large amount of organic matter that increases the soil's water retention and introduces beneficial microorganisms.
Mineral-based fertilizers release their nutrients into the soil very slowly, and so are best considered long-term amendments rather than short bursts of food. Epsom salt contains plenty of magnesium and sulfur, which are beneficial for tomatoes and peppers. Gypsum contains high levels of calcium and sulfur.

, Avoid burning plants with fertilizers by watering them before feedings. If plants have not been planted yet, add the fertilizer into the soil by tilling it. If plants are already planted or are in the process of being planted, sprinkle the fertilizer in the garden bed as per the fertilizer’s instructions."

Understand what garden “teas” are.,
Make comfrey tea.,
Consider using comfrey as mulch.,
Create nettle tea.,
Make some horsetail tea.",How to Make Homemade Plant Fertilizer1," Garden ‘teas’ are made of some common weeds, and can deliver nutrients such as nitrogen (to encourage leaf growth), potassium (to help develop flowers and fruit) and phosphorus (to help root growth). The teas should be applied in dilute form by spraying or using a watering can.


Don’t over fertilize plants using these mixes as generally very little is required to boost your plants. For instance, using too much comfrey tea in your garden could introduce too much potassium to the soil. This can lead to stunted plant growth over time.;
, You should be warned that comfrey tea smells horrendous – but plants love it! To make this water-based fertilizer that is high in potash and nitrogen, gather a big bundle of comfrey leaves – ideally enough to fill a large bag.Chop or tear these up a bit and place in bucket, then cover with water (ideally rainwater). Try to weigh down the leaves with something heavy, such as a stone.
Cover the bucket to keep insects from laying eggs in it. After about a month, strain the contents and dilute it in about 15 parts water so that you can spray the tea on your plants.

, Comfrey leaves can also be shredded and used as a mulch around plants, where they will steadily rot into the soil and improve it. Shredded comfrey can also be incorporated into the soil when planting, just as you would use manure.


Try to let leaves wilt for a few hours after harvesting before using in the garden, to prevent them from sprouting.

, Nettles can also be used in a similar way to comfrey to make a liquid feed. You can also combine nettle and comfrey to make a mixed batch. Avoid using any roots or seeds, and preferably harvest the plants before they flower.Chop up the leaves in a bucket, cover them with rainwater and wait a month. Use this in a diluted form as a liquid fertilizer.

, Horsetail is a garden weed that grows and spreads extremely easily in the garden. It is said to be high in silicon and can help your garden plants resist infection. It’s also quicker to make horsetail tea than comfrey or nettle tea. To make horsetail tea:


Take about a tablespoon of dried horsetail. Add 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of rainwater and boil it up in a big pan, simmering for half an hour. When cool, store in a glass container. To use it in the garden, dilute in 5 parts of rainwater and spray this on your plants every ten days to help them resist fungal infections and rust.

Make an Epsom salt fertilizer.,
Make an Epsom salt bath.,
Add Epsom salt to the soil.",How to Make Fertilizer2," Mix together Epsom Salts, baking powder, salt peter, and ammonia with a gallon (4 liters) of water for an all-around fertilizer. This mixture is good for any plant type, and should be sprayed once every 4-6 weeks. To make it, simply combine the ingredients with a gallon (4 liters) of water and shake or mix until completely dissolved:


1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) Epsom Salts
1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) baking powder
1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) saltpeter
1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) ammonia., Mix 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) Epsom salts with 1 gallon (4 liters) water for an even easier liquid fertilizer. Epsom salts contain both magnesium and sulfur acids, which help plants stay healthy and gives added flavor to a variety of vegetables. Once a month, mix up 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of Epsom salts with 1 gallon (4 liters) water and use this to water your plants.


Roses, in particular, love Epsom salt baths. You can use a tablespoon of salt for each foot the rose bush is tall, mixing in a gallon of water and using twice a year-- once the leaves appear and right after the first series of blooms.Epsom salt baths can help make up for soil that is low in magnesium and sulfur.
While an Epsom salt bath will help your plants sprout, you will need to give them nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium to keep them growing.

, Sprinkle Epsom salt over the soil of new plants, using a rough tablespoon for each plant. You can sprinkle a tablespoon of Epsom salts on top of the soil for your new seedlings, as they help promote strong, early growth. This is best done right when you transfer the plants from pots or planters into the soil. As you water the plants, they will slowly dissolve the Epsom salts into the soil.

Use water from a freshwater aquarium.,
Create a coffee compost.,
Use egg shells.,
Brew grass tea.,
Use urine.,
Save and spread your fireplace ashes.,
Try banana peels.,
Make your own compost.,
Get your soil tested.",How to Make Fertilizer3," Freshwater aquariums contain nitrogen, which can provide your plants with a healthy boost. Fish naturally release nitrogen into the water, making their ""waste"" water an important source of nutrients for plants. Instead of dumping it down the toilet, use it to water your plants once a week. Fish waste, as well, contains trace elements important for plant growth., Mix coffee grounds with leafy yard waste for ""quick compost,"" especially for acid-loving plants. Mix your coffee grounds with an equal amount dead leaves, pine straw, and other brown yard clippings and sprinkle over the soil once a month. Roses, azaleas, hydrangeas, and many other plants crave a low pH soil, and will respond particularly well.


This method isn't just for acid-loving plants -- any gardener can use it to add nitrogen, simply cutting back to once every two months in order to protect the soil from a pH swing., Spread old eggshells over your garden, or in the bottom of planting holes, for a calcium boost. Plants like tomatoes and peppers particularly love calcium, but your whole garden will enjoy eggshells. Calcium, which is over 90% of an eggshell's makeup, helps a plant develop strong cell walls. To use eggshells, light crush up the shells and spread over the garden. You can till them into the soil or leave them right on top -- they decompose very quickly., Make a ""nutrient tea"" with grass clippings from your yard. Use the bag on your lawnmower to keep the clippings the next time you cut the grass. Use them to fill up a 5-gallon bucket roughly 2/3s of the way to the top, then fill it near the top with water. Stir it quickly, then let it sit for three days, stirring once each morning. When done, strain out the grass clippings and use your ""tea"" to water your plants, providing essential nitrogen, by mixing it with an equal amount of water and spraying over the plants., While it may seem gross, urine is a free, nitrogen-rich option for fertilizing plants. While most people are understandably squeamish about storing their own urine, it is high in essential nitrogen. To make the process more palatable, fill a bucket with sawdust and pee into this, dumping a large cup of water over it after you're done. You can then use this nutrient rich mulch when planting your next batch of plants.


Because urine can contain pathogens, you may want to sterilize it by keeping it at a temperature above 68 degrees Celsius for at least 30 days.If you don't mind going ""to the source,"" you can dilute your urine with 10-20 times the amount of water and use it to water your plants directly. Straight urine is too concentrated for plants to handle.
Note that you can water this down significantly -- up to 20 parts water for 1 part urine, so it doesn't smell foul., Wood ash is high in calcium and potassium, making it an excellent supplement to your soil. Simply spread it right over the garden, using your hands to lightly turn it into the top layer of the soil.


Vegetables, in particular, tend to love ash, as it promotes healthy root growth.

Warning: Do not use fireplace ashes on plants that love acidic soil like blueberries, roses, or azaleas., Cut up banana peels and add them to the hole when planting. Banana peels don't do much once the plant is already in the ground, but it can work wonders as you're planting. The peels contain a lot potassium, which promotes a plant's root development. Cut up half a banana peel and toss it in the bottom of your hole before adding the plant., Composting at home is easy, so you can turn all of your old food scraps, leaves, and plant clippings into food for your garden. When organic matter decays, it releases nutrients that can enrich your soil. You can build your own compost in your yard, or you can try one of the commercially-available kitchen compost units., Take a sample of your soil for testing to fine-tune your fertilizer options. The only way you can tailor your fertilizer effectively is if you know what the soil already contains. The steps above list many different household fertilizers, as well as their essential nutrients, allowing you to make a garden-specific program. You can get home testing kits, or you can bring your sample into a local garden store or county extension office for analysis. When pulling up a soil sample, follow the directions on the kit. If nothing is provided:


Use clean, plastic shovels and a well-cleaned bucket. Dirty or metal implements can introduce other minerals and nutrients.
Dig a hole 4-6"" deep, placing the dirt in the bucket. Do not include mulch or trimmings.
Repeat with 4-5 holes, mixing together in bucket.
Dry the soil on newspaper for 12-24 hours.
Bag the sample in a clean plastic bag or container and take in for analysis."
"
Pay close attention to the numbers on the bag of fertilizer.,
Choose a fertilizer with a slow burning release.,
Go for a granular fertilizer for even coverage that gets the job done.Apply the granular fertilizer onto your lawn with a spreader to get the consistent coverage without the equipment pros are often equipped with.,
Give the lawn its first feeding of fertilizer when the soil has warmed up.,
Park your spreader in your driveway or on top of a tarp and fill it.",How to Know What Fertilizer to Use On Your Garden Plants and When to Use It2," There are three numbers on the label, showing the percentage of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium – the main nutrients your lawn needs in order to thrive and flourish. A bag that reads 20-5-10 (20% nitrogen, 5% phosphate, 10% potassium) is the perfect starter mix to apply to your lawn during the spring., Slow release fertilizers release nutrients gradually over time. Fertilize the lawn every 6 to 8 weeks. Give the lawn 2-3 pounds of fertilizer over the duration of the lawn’s growing season.,


Keep in mind that if you choose to use a granular fertilizer, before you apply it, the ground needs a quarter inch of water to wet it before the fertilizer gets laid down., The perfect time of year to begin fertilizer application is the middle of April. The amount of feedings should total up to 5 by the end of the grass’s growing season.The second fertilizer feeding should occur 4 weeks later, around mid-May. Subsequent feedings should occur every 6-8 weeks after that until November hits.
On the third feeding, don’t use the 20-5-10 slow burning granular fertilizer you chose, instead give the ground an organic feeding of manure.Watering your lawn will dictate how much time occurs in between feedings for the 3rd through 5th applications. If your lawn receives routine watering through a sprinkler system, you will need to fertilize the lawn every 6 weeks. If you don’t have a sprinkler, the wait in between feedings can be 8 weeks.

, Any loose granules left on one spot on the ground can burn and/or kill the grass. Disperse the fertilizer onto your lawn by mowing the lawn with the spreader.Start by applying half of what the bag recommends for the first fertilizer feeding. This helps prevent over application which can do more harm than good to your lawn.
Begin by covering the yard’s perimeter and then work your way to filling in the middle."

Use coffee grounds as a fertilizer.,
Try using a seaweed fertilizer.,
Make a banana fertilizer for your roses.,
Make a good tomato feed.",How to Make Homemade Plant Fertilizer2," Coffee is known to be a great fertilizer and soil improver. It’s especially good for acid-loving plants, such as blueberries, azaleas and rhododendron. It’s also good for keeping blue hydrangeas blue. Many coffee loving gardeners keep a pot in the kitchen to store used grounds for use in the garden. To use coffee grounds:


Sprinkle used coffee grounds around the base of your plants, where the grounds will also act as mulch. Avoid putting the coffee over the exposed rhizomes of plants such as iris as this could lead to rot.
Alternately you can add a few cups of used coffee grounds to a watering can (pick one with a wide spout or it will clog a fine watering rose or narrow spout). Cover the grounds with water and let the mixture sit for a few days before using it.

, Seaweed is a great source of plant nutrients, especially potassium, and there is evidence that plants sprayed with seaweed tea can resist insects more effectively than other plants. Seaweed tends to lack other nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate, so in very poor soils you may like to supplement this fertilizer with other fertilizing agents to balance the soil.Seaweed should be used in the same way you would use manure. However, unlike fresh manure, it does not need to be rotted down first.
Dig it into the garden before it dries out. Chop it up a little if your seaweed is in very long tangled strands. You don’t need to worry about the salt content as it is usually too low to affect your plants and soil.
You can also make seaweed tea in a similar manner to comfrey tea, but leave the mixture to infuse for two months.

, Roses benefit from the potassium in bananas. Once you’ve eaten the fruit, lay two or three strips of peel under your roses and cover with mulch such as a three inch layer of well-rotted manure.

, When potting up tomato plants, improve the soil by using a cup of shredded comfrey leaves and a cup each of crushed eggshells and powdered milk.Stir this into ten cups of compost and use for your plant tomatoes.

Save your egg shells.,
Crush the eggshells or grind them into a fine powder.,
Add a few teaspoons of powdered eggshell into the hole if you are planting a new flower, herb, or vegetable.Once you have some eggshells in the hole, put the plant inside, and pat the soil around it.,
Add crushed eggshells around the base of your plant.You do not need to cover the eggshells with soil.,
Mix crushed eggshells directly into potting soil.",How to Fertilize Soil With Eggshells1," When you use eggs in a meal or for a recipe, save the shells. Crack open your raw eggs, rinse the shells with warm water, and let them dry in a sunny pot. Run your finger around the inside of the shell when washing it to remove any residue, but try to preserve the membrane. Most of the nutrients are in this.


For best results, plan on using 4 to 5 eggs for each plant you want to fertilize.;
, You can crush them into flakes using your hands or a food processor. You can also grind them into a powder using a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder instead.It is possible to use whole eggshells in your soil, but they will decompose much faster if they are crushed or ground into powder.To make the crushing process easier, bake the eggshells at 350 degrees until the start to lightly brown before grinding.

, Putting eggshells directly into the hole with the plant ensures that the plant will get the nutrients from the decomposing eggshells., As they decompose, they will leach calcium and other nutrients into the soil. This will help your plants grow into strong, healthy plants.

, When you buy plants from the nursery, you will need to transplant them outside, or into a new pot. Before you do this, consider mixing a handful of crushed eggshells into the soil. Overtime, the eggshells will leach their nutrients into the soil, and help the young plants grow into healthy, strong plants.


If you aren't able to use eggshells right away, you can also crush them and add them to your compost bin.

, You can use your hands, a coffee grinder, or even a food processor. Crushing the eggshells will make it easier to measure them out.

, This will be enough to brew 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of eggshell tea.


Consider adding 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of Epsom salt for extra nutrition.Epsom salt is high in magnesium and sulfate, both of which are beneficial to plants., You need 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water for every 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of crushed eggshells.Boiling the water will give the eggshells a ""jump start"" and help them to start releasing their nutrients into the water faster.

, During this time, the eggshells will release their nutrients into the water.

, This will allow the water reach outdoor temperatures, and lessen the risk of ""shocking"" the plants by being too hot or too cold. Some gardens find that this also helps the plants absorb the nutrients better.When leaving the jar outside, make sure that it is covered, and in a shady spot, out of sunlight.

, For best results, use the eggshell tea once a month.The water will be infused with calcium and other nutrients, and give your plants a growing boost. Store any leftover water in a cool, dry place."

",How to Fertilize Soil With Eggshells3," You can simply crack the egg in half, but you won't have much space to plant the seeds in. Instead, consider cracking the egg near the upper third with a spoon.Save the egg yolk and white for eating later.


Don't use hardboiled eggs, as the shells would be brittle. If you already cooked the egg, save the water you cooked it in, let it cool, and use it to water your plants instead.
Don't use colored or painted eggs (such as Easter eggs). The pigments in paints and markers contain dyes that can harm the delicate seedlings., When rinsing the shell, be sure to run your finger around the inside of the shell to remove any residue.

, It is easiest if you do this from the inside.It is not absolutely necessary, but it will help prevent over-watering, which can kill a young plant.

,, Larger vegetables, such as beans, cucumber, and squash can work, but they will need to be moved outside 1 week after they sprout.Consider easy-to-grow herbs, such as: basil, dill, and parsley. Marigolds are great for starting in eggshells, and they are edible too., The holder can be as simple as an egg carton to as fancy as an egg holder. If you are using an egg carton, consider lining it with plastic first so that it doesn't get soggy from the draining water.

, Depending on what type of seed you planted, you might see the seedling emerge in less than a week. When watering the seedlings, consider using a spray bottle instead of a watering can; it will be a lot more gentle on the delicate, young plants.Depending on how dry it is in your home, you may need to water the seeds every day to every few days.
Consider rotating the eggshell every few days. This will allow the plants to get equal amounts of sunlight and grow more evenly.You may need to pull out the smaller/weaker seedlings so that each eggshell has one plant growing in it. This will ensure that the young seedlings enough space to grow in., Before you plant the egg in the soil, crush it slightly in your hand—enough to break the shell but not so much that the soil loses its shape. This will break the shell up a little and allow the roots to poke through.Eggshells are biodegradable. As they decompose, they will release nutrients and calcium into the soil, which will help the young plant grow.,"

Use coffee grounds as fertilizer.,
Fertilize the garden with bananas.,
Add egg shells to the garden.,
Fertilize the garden with Blackstrap molasses.,
Soak the garden with epsom salts.",How to Fertilize a Garden Cheaply1," Used coffee grounds contain good nutrients for plants like nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. They are particularly good for blueberries, evergreens, azaleas, roses, and fruit trees. Use your own coffee grounds or ask coffee shops for their used grounds.Let the used coffee grounds dry and then scatter them like mulch over your plants. Do not use wet ones, as they will mold.;
, Bananas are great for providing potassium for the plants, especially roses. Bury a whole banana, or just the peel, in the top layer of soil next to rose bushes and other plants.Over time, replace the bananas with fresh ones.

, Egg shells contain beneficial nutrients for plants like nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and calcium. Crush up egg shells in an old coffee grinder and sprinkle them on your garden soil for a natural fertilizer.Get in the habit of adding fresh ground egg shells to your soil once a week. Plant roots need a steady supply of calcium, which can be found in egg shells, to thrive.

, Blackstrap molasses contains carbon, iron, sulfur, potash, calcium, manganese, magnesium, and potassium, which are all great for plants. Mix Blackstrap molasses with 1 cup (236 ml) epsom salts and 1 cup (236 ml) alfalfa meal. Dissolve the mixture in 4 gallons (15 L) of water and then spread it on your garden.Molasses also feeds beneficial bacteria in the soil, which will keep your plants healthy and happy.

, Epsom salts are great for encouraging plant growth and seed germination. Combine 1 tablespoon (14 ml) of Epsom salts with 1 gallon (3.7L) of water. Put the mixture in a spray bottle and apply it to the foliage in the garden.The Epsom salts can also increase fruit and flower production for roses, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, and indoor houseplants.

Know what your soil needs.,
Research to learn which components offer your plants what they need most.Some organic components are sold by the name of the nutrient they provide.,
Buy a dry organic fertilizer blend.,
Consider buying fertilizer components as needed.",How to Buy Organic Dry Fertilizers1," If your plants appear healthy and you only want to enrich the soil, then you should buy a balanced organic dry fertilizer containing trace minerals and equal amounts of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. To help suffering or struggling plants, though, you should select a fertilizer that directly addresses your garden's needs.


Check for signs of nutrient deficiencies. The quickest way to determine if your plants lack proper nutrition is to observe how they look. The appearance often gives away many clues about what the plants are lacking. For instance, nitrogen improves foliage growth, so yellowing and browning leaves suggest that your soil needs more nitrogen. Similarly, plants lacking in phosphorus produce little fruit and plants lacking in potassium have weak flowers.
Test your soil for deficiencies.If you want to get a more accurate reading of your soil's deficiencies, you should submit a sample of the soil for nutrient testing at an agricultural lab. The lab results will indicate which nutrients were found in high amounts and which are desperately low. Along with an analysis of the soil's quality, many professional tests will also come back with a suggestion on what type of soil you need to look for to improve your soil.;
, Boron, Iron, sulfur, manganese, and zinc are good examples of this. For most nutrients, however, you will need to look for components that are naturally high in those nutrients even though it is not obvious by the name.


To add nitrogen to the soil, look for blood meal, cottonseed meal, fish meal, soybean meal, crab meal, corn gluten meal, feather meal, and leather meal.
To add phosphorus to the soil, look for components like bone meal and rock phosphate.
To add potassium, look for granite meal, greensand, kelp meal, wood ash, Sul-Po-Mag, and sulfate of potash.
Dolomitic limestone can add calcium, magnesium, and molybdenum. Epsom salt can add magnesium. In addition to phosphorus, phosphate rock can add calcium and sulfur. Gypsum is another component that can add sulfur, and kelp meal, greensand, and granite meal all contain trace elements that can benefit the soil.

, Pre-made blends of dry organic fertilizing components can be found on the market. In each blend, the components are dispersed evenly through the mixture, ensuring that each handful contains roughly the same concentration of nutrients. Each blend also uses different components, however, so it is important that you check the label to find out which components are used.


Check the number on the label. All fertilizers, whether chemical or organic, are labeled with a three-part number that indicates the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively. When buying a pre-mixed dry organic fertilizer, a simple, effective way to determine if it will offer your plants what they need is to check this number. If you need a balanced fertilizer, for instance, you should look for one with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 label. If you need to give your plants a dose of potassium, however, look for a fertilizer with a heavier dose of potassium, like a 0-0-12 fertilizer.

, Another way to organically fertilize your garden is to buy dry fertilizer components separately. You can purchase blood meal, kelp meal, and most other dry components separately. Once you have what you need to balance or enrich your soil, you can either combine them together into your own fertilizer blend or apply them separately by digging them into the soil or spreading them at the surface and watering them in.

Use grass clippings.,
Make green manure with plants.,
Use wood ash or sawdust as fertilizer.",How to Fertilize a Garden Cheaply2," Grass clippings make great organic fertilizer as they provide moisture for the soil and prevent weeds from cropping up. Use freshly cut grass from lawns that have not been treated with herbicides. Sprinkle a ½ inch (1.27 cm) layer of grass clippings on the soil as fertilizer.Depending on how much grass you have, you may be able to cut grass clippings for your garden every one to two weeks.

, Green manure is a good, natural fertilizer for your garden. Combine wheat, oats, rye, clover, peas, vetch, buckwheat, and broad beans. Then, spread the manure over the soil in your garden. Do this once a season.You can buy the ingredients for green manure at your local gardening store or online.

, Wood ash and sawdust add calcium and potassium to the soil. They can also help to raise the pH of the soil if it is too acidic, making it more hospitable to neutral pH plants like vegetables. Sprinkle wood ash or sawdust to the soil. Use five pounds (2.5 kg) of wood ash or sawdust for every 100 square feet (9 square metres) of soil.You can get wood ash from the bottom of your fireplace or your fire pit.
You can get sawdust from your local woodshop.

Fertilize the garden with aged animal manure.,
Use fish guts and bones to make fish fertilizer.,
Fertilize with worm castings.",How to Fertilize a Garden Cheaply3," Manure is a great natural fertilizer for the garden. Use manure from cows, horses, pigs, and dogs. Make sure you age it for six months, as fresh manure is too overpowering for plants. Spread aged manure in a ¼ to ½ inch (0.6-1.27 cm) layer over your garden soil. You can also till it or mix it in by hand.You can buy aged manure at your local gardening center.
Put animal manure in the garden in the fall or winter, before you do any spring planting.

, Fish guts, bones, and heads are a great source of plant nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous acid, and amino acids. You can use fresh guts, bones, and heads from fish like tuna or salmon. Or, freeze fish parts during the year so you can make fish fertilizer in the spring.Collect fish parts from your own cooking or buy fish parts from your local fish merchant.
Combine 1 part fish with 2 parts water in an airtight container. Place it in a sunny spot far from your home to avoid the smell. Stir the mixture every two days for about two weeks. Then, apply the fish fertilizer to your garden.
You can also take the aquarium water from your tank and use it to fertilize the garden. Only use fresh water from a fresh water tank, not salt water.
Fish fertilizer is particularly good for leafy greens, beets, Brussel sprouts, and broccoli.

, Worm castings contain beneficial nutrients for the soil. You can buy worm castings from your local gardening store or start a worm farm and make your own. Spread the worm castings over the soil to fertilize it.Add enough worm castings to cover the soil completely in a thin layer.

Go to an organic garden supply center.,
Try a major retail home and garden store.,
Purchase online or by phone.",How to Buy Organic Dry Fertilizers2," Organic garden centers specialize in organic products and will have the biggest, highest quality selection of organic dry fertilizers to choose from in store. You could also try a general garden center, as many of these will carry some organic dry fertilizers, as well, but the selection will be considerably less.

, The availability of home and garden chains is a definite plus, since you can find a store within a short drive of nearly any city, and the low cost offered by many of these stores is another positive. On the downside, you may have trouble finding a wide selection of organic dry fertilizers to choose from, and you may not be able to find one that suits your garden’s specific needs.

, The best way to get maximum selection is to buy online from a manufacturer or specialized retailer of organic fertilizers. If you are uncomfortable buying online, you can usually locate the seller’s website and place an order using the phone number listed there. When buying online, however, it is vital that you check reviews and reputation. Otherwise, you could end up getting scammed. An online store that has some sort of organic certification is an even better option.

Clean as much of the meat and fat off of the bones as you can.,
Place them on a microwavable plate and microwave them for three minutes in three separate increments (a total of nine minutes).

Place the dry, brittle bones into a heavy iron pot, then gradually mash them with a piece of wood or a hammer.,
Work of all your natural fertilizer 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the root ball and 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) into the depth of the soil.

,
During the growing season, work gently around the root ball.",How to Make Chicken Bone Fertilizer,";
,,, Wear goggles to keep from being hit with little bone fragments. Stir the now-smaller bone fragments around to reposition them. You can keep mashing them until you have mostly powdered bones with some larger fragments, but it's best to mash them into a fine powder.


Once you have the powder, you can also add eggs shells for added calcium, which will make your plants more disease resistant. Microwave the egg shells for two minutes, then grind and add.

,, The roots will spread, so keep adding bone powder as they grow, but keep the powder a 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the root ball. Rainwater will gradually work it towards the secondary roots in no time. The secondary roots grow very rapidly, so keeping the bone meal farther away is usually no problem, since these little roots will search for the meal on their own.

Conduct a soil test to determine what nutrients and minerals may be missing in your soil.,
Calculate the area of your garden to determine how much fertilizer you will need.,
Determine what supplements you need, based on the soil test results and the type of plants you intend to grow.,
Multiply the decimal from the measuring step by the recommended fertilizer rate from your soil test.",How to Buy Fertilizer," While test kits are available online and at garden stores, you will get the most accurate results if you contact your county agricultural extension agent.;

Measure the length of the garden, lawn or flower bed. Multiply that number by 2.
Measure the width of the growing area. Multiply that number by 2.
Add the numbers together.
If the area is less than 1,000 square feet (92.9 square meters), divide it by 1,000 (92.9) to get a decimal to use for calculating the amount of fertilizer you will need. For example, if your garden is 680 square feet (63.17 square meters), your multiplier will be .680.
If you are planning to fertilize a lawn interrupted by several flower beds, calculate the area of the beds and subtract that from the area calculation for the lawn.

, Have this information on hand when you go to the garden shop to help you process how to buy fertilizer more readily.


Plants with dense foliage generally benefit from higher levels of nitrogen, which helps grow greener leaves by encouraging the production of chlorophyll. Because nitrogen leeches from the soil easily, you may need to apply it more frequently than other components.
Plants producing fruits or seeds, like vegetables or berry plants, will require more phosphorus and potash. Phosphorus supports the development of a strong root system, while potash helps plants tolerate weather stress and resist disease.
Flowering plants may benefit from the addition of phosphorus, which also helps to strengthen plant stems and encourage heavier blooming.

, For example, if your test results recommend 2 lbs.(.9 kg) of potash per 1,000 square feet (92.9 square meters), you would multiply .680 x 2, to determine that you will need 1.36 lbs. (.6 kg) for your garden.

Store unused fertilizer in its original package, if possible, in a dry, safe place.",How to Use Commercial Fertilizer," When buying a granular fertilizer, the bag should list the contents, including the percentage of three basic chemicals that are fundamental for plant growth. These three chemicals are represented by the label NPK on most fertilizer bags, and are, as follows:


Nitrogen. This is essential for leaf growth, and is used in higher proportion where a large plant and lots of foliage are desirable. Certain plants extract nitrogen from the atmosphere. One example is the leguminous plants, which include peas and beans. They have nodules on their roots that actually absorb nitrogen directly from the environment, and require little additional chemical nitrogen in their fertilizer. Corn, grains, and other crops that have narrow leaves, on the other hand, often require more nitrogen to thrive. It is represented by the N in the standard fertilizer label.
Phosphate. This is another chemical that plants require for good health. It is a product of phosphate mines or industrial waste, and plants use the chemical phosphorus in cellular processes. Phosphate is more common in soils containing a lot of clay, and is quickly leached from sandy loams or basic sandy soils. It is represented by the P in the standard fertilizer label.
Potash. This is the third chemical in the fertilizer description. It is also used by the plant at a cellular level, and is necessary for good bloom production and healthy fruiting of the plant. It is represented by the K in the standard fertilizer label.;
, Lawns and landscaping may benefit from a fertilizer blend with a larger proportion of nitrogen and moderate amounts of potash and phosphate, whereas garden plants are likely to benefit more from a specialized blend using less of one element, and more of another. If you are unsure of the exact needs of your plants, ask at your local garden supplier, or contact a government official specializing in agriculture, like the USDA or the County Extension Service in your area.

, Garden supply centers, farm suppliers, and county agriculture agents often can have soil samples taken and analyzed free of charge or at low cost. This type of analysis can be made for specific crops and used for calculating exact requirements for optimum fertilization. Failure to use an analysis means you will likely use too much or too little fertilizer.

, Application rates can be determined by measuring the area you plan to farm, then multiply the pounds per unit of area (X thousands of square foot, or acres) of the chemicals your soil analysis recommends, but if you choose to forgo this method, you can apply your fertilizer using your best judgment.

, Fertilizer is sold in different sized bags, with larger bags usually costing less per pound (kilo), so you may find you will need to choose one that offers the best compromise for your purposes. A balanced fertilizer like 8-8-8 (10-10-10, or 13-13-13) may be the best choice for your garden. Also look at these other factors:


Secondary nutrients are needed in lower proportions than the basic three chemicals noted above, and help maintain the soil quality and contribute to healthy plants. The secondary nutrients include these:

Calcium
Sulfur

Magnesium.


Micro-nutrients. These are also essential for good plant health, and may or may not be included in your fertilizer choice. Look for the following, in particular:

Iron, in soluble form, helps with blooms, and to keep foliage green
Copper, in soluble form, also helps keep foliage green, and will improve resistance to some diseases
Zinc
Manganese.


Decide if you want to combine other products with your fertilizer before purchasing. Special formulations of fertilizers that include herbicides and insecticides are available, and can be used to save application labor and time. Using these, however, limits you to areas where the chemical additives will not have an adverse effect. This includes fertilizers that contain pesticides that will contaminate plants, and herbicides that will damage the plants you are intending to grow. In general, using insecticides and herbicides on specific problems allows you to decrease the amount you need, and target problems with more effective results.

, There are a number of different methods for applying fertilizer, including direct application by hand, broadcast application, dilution application and using mechanical equipment to side dress the fertilizer to the growing bed. Which method used depends on the amount of fertilizer to be applied, the size of area it is to be applied on, and the size of the plants you are fertilizing.


Pre-plant application on a small area can be done by scattering fertilizer over the entire area and the tilling it into the soil. Apply at a rate of one or two pounds for each 100 square feet (9.29 square meters) maximum to avoid over-fertilizing the area.
Broadcast pre-plant application is suitable for larger areas, and a typical rate of application would be 200-400 lbs/acre (pounds per acre), using a calibratable fertilizer spread either pushed by hand, or pulled by a lawn tractor or farm tractor. After application, till the soil to incorporate the fertilizer and decrease the chance of run-off if rain occurs.
To avoid poisoning the plants, especially tender young ones, dilute the fertilizer into a bucket or watering can filled with water. Use that solution to water your plants. This method also helps the plant absorb it easier. After watering the plant with fertilizer, water it another time, this time with regular water. This second watering is done to remove fertilizers that may have dropped on leaves and stems. Unwanted fertilizers on leaves might cause damage and corrosion.
Direct application to individual plants or plants in rows can be done by pouring the fertilizer into a clean, dry bucket, then walking down the row dropping the fertilizer next to plants. Avoid dropping the fertilizer directly on plants, as the chemicals can burn them. Use a small amount, around one tablespoon each for small plants.
Direct application to row crops can be done with a cultivator equipped with a side-dressing apparatus. This apparatus consists of a hopper with a wheel to drive a dispensing mechanism and chutes to direct the fertilizer to the row.

, This can be done using a cultivator or tiller, or by simply using a hoe to stir the fertilizer into the soil.

, Overproduction of foliage without fruit production is one sign of over-fertilization, and weak, undersized plants usually indicates under-fertilization. Other factors, including disease, lack of water or sunlight, and insect damage may be mistaken for under-fertilization, so close observation and familiarity with the plants you are growing is essential for success.


Repeat the application of fertilizer as needed to maintain good plant growth/ crop production. Using smaller amounts of fertilizer at frequent intervals may be more beneficial than applying single applications at a high rate, as some of the fertilizer can be lost by leaching or in run-off if heavy rains occur after it is applied.

, Chemicals in fertilizers are corrosive, and metal parts can be damaged if leftover material is not removed thoroughly.


Store your fertilizer spreaders or other tools in a dry place when not in use, and make sure they are well lubricated and maintained.

, Opened bags should be taped or tied shut to prevent moisture from causing the fertilizer to clump, dissolve, or harden into a solid mass.

Evaluate the results.",How to Choose Organic Fertilizer," In order to choose the right organic fertilizer for your garden, you need to know the composition of your existing soil. There are a variety of tests that you can do, such as tests for pH, nitrogen, and phosphorus. These will let you know the status of different components of your soil.Soil test kits for specific aspects of your soil are available at garden supply centers.
Private laboratories and state cooperative extension services test all aspects of your garden soil for a small fee. Contact your local extension service for more details.;
, In order to choose the right organic fertilizer, you will need to know what chemicals the plants you are growing need in order to thrive. Do some research about the plants you are growing and what type of soil they like. These conditions differ for all plants.


For example, if you are growing blueberry bushes, you will want to make the soil acidic.If you are growing dahlias, you need to pay attention to the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in your soil., Figure out what fertilizer can supply the right nutrition. Different fertilizers will supply different nutrients to your soil. Some common organic fertilizers include:Bird and animal manures: Good source of nitrogen and microorganisms. Needs to be well-aged or composted before applying directly to the garden.
Blood or bone meal: A slow release source of nitrogen. It also has trace minerals. Needs to be applied just before planting and used sparingly.
Fish meal: Source of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements. Releases quickly into the soil.
Greensand: Rich in potassium and micronutrients. Used to break up clay soils.
Shellfish meal: A good source of calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and micronutrients.
Rock phosphate: Great for flowering plants. Provides long term phosphate addition.

, Read the packages of different fertilizers available to you to assess how much of certain nutrients they have. You will want to look at their ingredients, the pricing, claims made on the labels, and special instructions for application.Different gardening and home improvement stores will have different products. If you don't like what you see at one, go to a different store.

, The numbers on an organic fertilizer label refer to the percent of three key nutrients in the product: nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and potassium (K). For example, a fertilizer that is marked 6-12-10 will be 6% nitrogen, 12% phosphate, and 10% potassium. These nutrients are always listed in the same order.Other nutrients will be listed separately.
You will want to pick whatever product you think will supply the right nutrients, is sold in the right amount for your purposes, and is a good price.

, If you are having a hard time picking between specific fertilizer products, discuss your options with a store employee at your local garden center. They should be able to steer you towards a product that will be right for your specific needs.


Employees at gardening stores may be more helpful than those at more general home improvement stores, as they deal exclusively with gardening needs.

, Some fertilizers are easily mixed into the soil with a shovel. However, there are some that need to be spread evenly across the surface of the soil before being mixed in. This assures that you get an even application. This type of fertilizer should be applied with a spreader.Fertilizer spreaders can be found at your local garden supply store. In some cases, they can be rented temporarily instead of being bought outright.

, How much fertilizer you use will depend on the health of your soil and the amount of space you are fertilizing. The more unbalanced the soil, the more fertilizer your soil will need and the larger space you are fertilizing, the more fertilizer you will need.Follow the directions on the packaging to figure out how much to use for the space you are fertilizing.
In most cases, you will need to do a small amount of math to figure out how much fertilizer to use. The packaging will likely suggest the amount of fertilizer to use on a specific amount of garden space. You will need to divide or multiply to figure out the suggested amount for your specific size of garden.

, Once you have applied the fertilizer according to the package directions, it may take some time to see any results. If the chosen fertilizer isn’t performing as expected, then you can try a different product.


However, you should give the fertilizer some time to make an impact. Read the instructions on the product container to find out how long it takes for the fertilizer to make an impact.
You can also speak to a professional gardener or garden store employee if the fertilizer isn't working as desired and you are not sure why.

, Any weeds left will compete with the green manure crop.

,


If using legumes (the most commonly used crop for green manure), the soil should be approximately 6.5 to 7.6 pH.For the greatest benefit, compost the soil about 30 days prior to growing the green manure crop."
"
Sow seed across the area chosen, in either late autumn (fall) or early winter.,
Choose to either plant in rows or broadcast (spread) the seeds.,
Rake the seeds into the soil.",How to Use Green Manure Crops2," A good time to sow is early autumn, to catch the warm soil. Sow to a depth of about two to three times the seed's width (or follow the packet instructions).Legume seeds are the best choice - look for alfalfa, clover or lupins.


Generally good seeds for green manure crops: Alfalfa, cereal rye, agricultural mustard and Banner fava beans.Specialized seeds: Alsike clover (for very deficient soils); fodder radish (for deep nutrient retrieval and a huge amount of green manure); wooly pod vetch (hardy, good in dry and drought or for poor soils); foul maddummas beans (good with heat).Food producing seeds that double as green manure: Barley, oats, hard red spring wheat, etc.Seeds suitable for cool season sowing: Fenugreek, fava bean, oats, lupin, woolly pod vetch and subclover.Seeds suitable for warm season sowing: Millet (French white or Japanese), mung bean, buckwheat, cowpea, lablab and soybean., This may depend on the seed or your preference for working through the area when ploughing (plowing) it back into the soil. If broadcasting, don't toss all the seeds at once; toss with care, then keep some seed back to infill gaps.

, Firm down the soil. (If wished, tamp down with a flat board, to remove air spaces in the soil).Then water thoroughly.

"
"
Allow the crop to grow.,
Once the crop has almost matured but before it tries to go to seed, chop it down.",How to Use Green Manure Crops3," Be sure to water it sufficiently. The time for the crop will depend on the seed chosen. In both cases, read the standard the packaging for irrigation needs and expected maturation times.

, Allow it to wilt on top of the soil, then plough (plow) or dig it back into the soil, to a depth of around 25cm or 10 inches. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria found in the root nodules of the legume crop will be ploughed (plowed) back into the ground and will help break down the plants. As this happens, the soil structure improves markedly.


Digging in is not strictly essential. If you'd prefer the green manure matter to simply break down, it can be used as mulch."
"
Plant a green manure crop again the following season.",How to Use Green Manure Crops4," Once this cycle is completed, your soil is now ready for replanting with your choice of plants. However, it is a good idea to not plant new plants (either a non-green manure crop or a green manure crop) in the area for at least two weeks. The green manure can suppress plant growth for at least this amount of time.Alternatively, a green manure crop can be left to grow for up to two years, before being ploughed (plowed) back in."

Cover your pile.,
Air your bin.,
Turn your compost.,
Give your compost time.",How to Compost Horse Manure," Find a place on your property that is on high ground. A compost pile that is too low to the ground will become damp easily. You also want to make sure that the area is close to your horses’ stalls. The closer the spot is to the stalls, the easier it will be to move the manure to compost pile. Your site does not necessarily need boundaries. However, having enclosures can keep your compost in one place.


Some prefer bins to piles. For example, you can create a system where you use two bins to store waste and compost. Once the first bin has been filled with waste, you should leave it to compost. You should store any extra waste in the second bin.;
, In order to get the right amount of air into your compost pile, your compost heap needs to be a certain size. You will want your heap to be about three feet tall, wide, and long. You want your bin to be able to contain the right amount of manure need to make compost. The way you do this will depend on what type of system you want to use.

, Examples of carbon-rich materials are sticks, dried leaves, dried evergreen needles, sawdust, cardboard and paper. To avoid anaerobic decomposition, a type of composting that happens without oxygen, gather these materials and mix them into the manure., You compost needs to be covered properly in order to be protected by the elements. In order to do that, you will need to lay tarp over your pile of compost. Find a tarp that can cover your bin and place it on your compost.You want to make sure that your compost does not get too wet due to precipitation or too dry because of heat. Therefore, covering your compost is a good way to keep it in a state that will be beneficial.

, Compost needs the right amount of air. If the center of your pile does not receive enough air, then the composting will take a long time. Air can be added in several ways. You can turn the pile again and again. You can also place piping in your compost so you can get air.


If you put pipe in your compost container, then you should place it in the middle of your container. Buy five-foot long PVC pipes and arrange them in the center of your container. You want them to jut out from the inside of your container. If they are placed this way, then your bin will be properly aerated.

, Every few days (or up to a week), it is a good idea to use a pitchfork to toss the compost around and redistribute it. This allows a fresh supply of oxygen to penetrate the compost and feed the aerobic bacteria that drive the decomposition.


Mix your ingredients. You should make sure that the material that you are composting has been completely blended. You can do this by using a pitchfork to turn your pile. Keep turning till everything has been mixed together.
Keep the pile damp. You should pour water on your compost pile. Do not add too much water. You should add just enough to give the pile moisture.

, Composting takes a long time. Leave the pile to sit and decompose; the entire process can take at least three months."

Examine the compost to be sure the manure has cured sufficiently for use.",How to Cure Manure," Take into consideration prevailing winds, neighbors, and water runoff when choosing where to put your pile.;
, Some people may choose to build 2 or 3 box structures side-by-side so that pile is contained. There are also various ready-made composters available at garden supply or hardware stores. If you are not using composting bins, the manure pile should be at least 3x3x3 and no larger than 5x5x5.

,, The manure will need to be exposed to air to cure properly. Do this by either flipping the manure pile into the next composting bin or moving the center of the pile to the outside and the outside edges to the center. This will allow the manure to cure evenly throughout the pile.


If you are using the pile method, you can aerate the compost pile by using a tractor, by hand, or by inserting PVC pipes into the pile to act as chimneys. If you do not roll the pile, composting will still occur, but it will take longer.

, Curing manure requires a certain amount of moisture, and if your pile is not exposed to rain or if you are composting during a dry season, you may have to add moisture.


Test the moisture in the pile by squeezing a portion of the material from the center of the compost manure. If a few drops appear, the compost is in good shape. If there are a lot of drops or too few you will need to adjust the moisture content.

, The compost should be dark, crumbly, and soil-like. The temperature should be within a few degrees of the air temperature, and the volume will have decreased to 1/3 the size of the original pile.

Purpose: Do you want the mulch to control weeds? To cover a pathway? To reduce evaporation? Each of these is a valid reason and each way requires differences in application.

Availability: Can you use something you have in your yard, such as grass clippings or fallen leaves, or will you purchase a mulch?



 



Permeability: A layer of plastic sheeting may discourage weeds, but it will also discourage watering.

Biodegradability: Do you want the mulch to break down and become part of the soil (bark, leaves, wood chips) or not (rock, plastic, rubber, tumbled glass)?







Appearance: Is the mulch going to feature in a front landscape or simply cover your vegetable garden patch for the winter?;
, If there's anything you want to do in advance of mulching, do it.

Pull weeds or cut them close to the ground, if you are mulching for weed control. While not strictly necessary, it will help the mulch, and anything under it, to lay flat, and it will slow down the weed growth. Remember, mulch prevents weed growth by excluding light.

Enrich the soil and dig the beds, if you plan to do so. Biodegradable mulch can break down into rich, loose soil without this preparation, but it will take time.
Lay down anything you want under the mulch, such as landscaping fabric or plastic. Try adding several layers of newspaper or cardboard (remove tape and labels first) if you'd like a biodegradable means of blocking weeds.
Install any borders or edges.







,


You may be able to collect mulch for free in your neighborhood, simply by volunteering to take neighbors' leaf piles or lawn waste.
You can purchase mulch in large bags from most home centers with nurseries or if you need a large quantity, ask about buying in bulk and even having it delivered. And, of course, you can produce your own from your own garden waste.
Some communities collect yard waste, shred it, and offer it to residents as mulch or compost. Ask your municipality if they do this, and if not, whether they would consider implementing such a program.






Call tree services in your area. Many will drop off a heap of chipped or shredded tree trimmings in your driveway. If you do this, be prepared to get a large load the material. It won't look like bark nuggets or other decorative mulches you can purchase, but it's still excellent for covering garden areas.

, Many nurseries and home centers will gladly help you load your car. If you are hauling it by bike or walking, take a small trailer or a cart to wheel it home in. Once at home, use a wheelbarrow to ferry the mulch to where it will be applied. If you don't have a wheelbarrow, try partially filling a wheeled trash can or using a cart. For smaller quantities, a bucket or empty plant pot will do., The depth of mulch is really important if you want to retain moisture and prevent weed growth. Aim for at least two to four inches (5-10cm) of depth.

The one place you don't want mulch is right up against plant stems and tree trunks. Leave at least a little margin (four to six inches) for the plant to breathe, and to help prevent moisture-depletion or water-logging problems.
Depending on your garden, you can use the mulch to create basins for water.

, Rather than layering it on top of it too much, try to put only about a 1½"" (3 cm) thick layer of mulch down. Any more could be damaging, and any less won't be very helpful.,, You can dig old mulch into the soil and let it finish decomposing, or you can simply spread new mulch over the old., You can do this by pruning certain plants back and covering them entirely with mulch. The mulch provides insulation. Don't forget to remove the mulch in spring."
"
Consider what can be done before the heat comes.,
Evaluate your water use scenario.,
Work to increase shade.,
Work according to the type of plant you grow.,
Try to group your plants according to water needs, so plants needing low water are together and plants needing high water sit together.,
Increase the amount of wind-breaks.,
If the future for your area looks to have increased heat and less rainfall, start replacing many of your plants that just will not survive no matter what protection you can offer them.",How to Protect Your Garden During a Harsh Summer," Quite often forecasters will warn when a few hot days are likely to be coming, or if the season as a whole is expected to be severe. You can also check online by searching for weather forecasts in your local area.;
, If there is, or is going to be minimal water restrictions, then the job is much easier, but if you have severe water restrictions then protecting your garden may need additional work and foresight.


Water saving methods include using mulch - at least a 10cm or 4 inch thick layer, using drip system reticulation (which is best hidden under the mulch), using water retention products such as water retaining crystals, bentonite or attapulgite clays - the cheapest source of these is often clay based granulated kitty litter (if it dissolves in water, it will offer even better water retention capabilities), and as much organic materials such as compost and other soil improvers that you can budget for.
Water in the evening or early morning to best avoid evaporation and the water getting hot in the sun's rays. It is recommended to water deeply and often but when the water supply is low, it is better to water deeply and occasionally, as that encourages deeper root growth into cooler (and hopefully more moist) layers of soil. Frequent light watering encourages lush growth but also promotes shallower roots so that the plant is less prepared to cope when there is a reduction or no water coming on a hot day.
Use a watering spike - this is simply a sprinkler nozzle on a large plastic reticulation sprinkler extension with a connector to the hose. These parts are cheaply sourced from hardware and reticulation stores. As mulch can sometimes mesh to form a tight layer that prevents water access, using a water spike can poke through the mulch and get the water right to the root zone. This does disturb the soil layers that should be replaced as much as possible after watering to maintain the soil ecology.
In times of heat shock, a seaweed extract based liquid fertiliser treatment often reduces heat stress and it may help protect the plant in future.

, This maybe using shade sails, tree cover (selecting more drought hardy trees or palms) or a short term solution using an old sheet or dust cloth during extreme weather.


The catch is these will make the plants less sun hardened, so a short term solution should only be a short term solution or a more permanent fixture. Short term protection should be removed as soon as possible because if the plant gets accustomed to the shade it will experience more stress when the shade is removed.

,


For vegetables, a short term spurt of hot weather will not usually harm them, although over a longer period you may see signs of the heat shock and reduced growth. You may experience some wilting which may recover when it cools off in the evening. However, long term planning may recommend shifting where you plan to plant your produce to a less exposed area. Vegetables may also change priorities and change from growing leaf or fruit into ""bolting to seed"". This means herbs and leafy or green vegetables will start to flower for seed production, rather than making more edible yield which takes up more water the plant could use elsewhere. Some fruiting plants like tomatoes may grow a short burst of small fruit then the plant will die back or completely die off. This is the plant saying that it does not consider the current environment right so it is producing for the next generation of plants when the weather is more desirable.
If you grow plants in pots or in small movable boxes, it is easier to move these to a more protected area. Purchase a generous size pot-saucer to go under the pot (available from hardware stores) to fill up with water before you leave the house for the day. These can be a haven for mosquitoes, so take adequate precautions.

Lawns are difficult to maintain in high heat. Many go dormant or die off, but recover or grow back when the weather is better. Longer but slower watering (which would apply the same amount of water as a typical higher pressure sprinkler on a short period) and application of soil wetting agents is the best that can be done for over-exposed lawns with water restrictions. It is best to mow much higher to give the lawn a better chance of shading itself. Avoid the use of chemical pellet type fertilizers, as the heat will make them release a mass hit of fertiliser that may cause chemical burning to the grass. Any fertiliser should be a weak liquid based solution, or a soil-improving top dressing (such as compost or good garden soil).
Small shrubs and particularly flowering shrubs with delicate, or soft green leaves can be the most hard hit, as their native environment prefers milder conditions. Apart from shading, soil improvement options and watering needs, these plants can benefit with a very gentle trim to encourage more leaf growth for shading - only providing the water is kept up to their needs. Occasional misting of these plants can protect them as they absorb a lot of water through their leaves. Otherwise consider transplanting to a better area, or turning into indoor plants if they are able to survive such a change.

, This makes watering easier and allows the plants to form small ecosystems which protect each other.

, Wind is amazingly effective at drying out soil, plants, and mulch, so a living screen such as a hedge, or a some form of fencing is recommended. Ideally it should allow some air flow through, so the fencing does not get hit with high winds and eventually blow over. A fence that allows some air movement as well is recommended, as sheet metal fencing gets very hot in the sun and can radiate heat onto the nearest plants. If no air can circulate, the garden is likely to turn into a heat trap. If possible, shade the fence with a tree, or install a screen in between the fence and the plants to block heat.

, This can be done by donating the plants that won't thrive to nurseries, friends in cooler areas, or to botanical gardens and zoos if they have the environment and facilities for them. Lawn can be replaced slowly by gradually increasing the area of garden beds, or by replacing them with artificial grass. The quality of artificial grasses has improved greatly over recent years, so is a worthwhile substitute if properly installed.

Assess your plants' watering needs.,
Buy a lawn sprinkler, a garden hose, an automatic water timer, and an inexpensive rain gauge.,
To figure out how much water your lawn sprinkler is putting out per hour, set the rain gauge in its path while watering.,
On subsequent waterings, set the timer for the time needed to get an inch of water.,
Water your landscape on a regular schedule even if it looks like it may rain.,
For the first week of plant rescue, water the landscape so it gets 3 inches (about 8 cm) the first week.,
For the second week of plant rescue, water the landscape so it gets 2 inches (about 5 cm) the second week.,
For each week thereafter, water once per week so the landscape gets one inch (25 mm) per week.

,
For each week thereafter, water each tree once per week so each gets 2-3 quarts for every foot in height (per week).

,
At week three, get nutrients on your landscape.,
Follow the fertilizer package directions and apply balanced liquid fertilizer to your landscape using the garden feeder that attaches to your sprinkler.

,
Fertilize once per month thereafter during the growing season, unless the package directions indicate otherwise.

,
Amend your soil by applying compost or composted manure.,
Compost or manure can be obtained at garden centers or hardware stores in 40-pound bags for under USD$3 per bag.

,
Follow directions for spreading the compost on the bag.,
If your landscape is mulched, rake away the mulch before applying the compost.,
Apply compost or manure only once per year.",How to Rescue Dying Landscape Plants," Under-watering is a far more common problem than overwatering.


As a general rule, each square foot of the landscape needs about 2-3 quarts of water weekly. Or, about 20 liters (5.3 US gal) per square meter. Put another way, it needs to receive at least one inch (about 25 mm) of rain or water each week.
Most trees need about 2-3 quarts of water once per week for every foot in height (spread evenly around its root system). Thus, a 20 ft tall tree should get 40-60 quarts of water once per week. Or, about 18 liters (4.8 US gal) per week for a 6 meter tree.;
, You can get these at most hardware stores or garden centers. This is a small investment (probably USD$50 or less) compared to replacing thousands of dollars in landscaping. Most people fail in maintaining their landscape because they try watering all plants by hand. This usually leads to gross under-watering because of wrongly estimating watering needs. It is also massively time-consuming.

, Check it every 15 minutes. Once it hits the one inch mark (about 25 mm), note how much time elapsed. Depending on your home's water pressure and your sprinkling system, this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 120 minutes.

, The automatic timer will shut off the water so you don't waste it. This also saves you many hours compared to hand watering.

, It's unlikely you will over-water your garden even if it does rain.

, To do this, water 1 inch (25 mm) every 48 hours for the first week. During this same period, trees should get 6-9 quarts of water for every foot (about 3 liters per meter) in height, spread evenly around the roots.

, To do this, water 1 inch (25mm) every 72 hours for the second week. At this point, you should notice your landscape greening up quite nicely. Trees should get 4-6 quarts of water for every foot in height, spread evenly around the roots.

,,, The second most common cause of dying landscape plants is inadequate plant nutrition. In other words, fertilize your plants. Inexpensive systems for applying fertilizer are available at most hardware stores or garden centers. Buy a garden feeder that attaches to your lawn sprinkler. The garden feeders usually come packaged with a popular brand of balanced liquid fertilizer. This can usually be obtained for under US$12.

,,, This step should not be ignored. Fertilizer is only a short term solution for immediate rescue. Building the soil organically is a must.

,, If the directions aren't printed, a general rule is one bag for every 10 square feet of planted landscape. (about 1 bag per square meter)

, Then replace the mulch.

, It's best done in the spring in subsequent years, and can be applied more lightly, at the rate of 1 bag every 20 square feet (1 bag per 2 square meters)

Choose vegetables that can be preserved, stored or frozen.,
Grow vegetables that provide a high return on investment.",How to Save Money Gardening1," To save the most money gardening, select vegetables that you like to eat and would normally buy at the grocery store. Do not plant vegetables that you would not purchase on a regular basis.;
, By selecting vegetables that can be easily canned or frozen, you stretch your garden investment and may consume produce from your garden throughout the year.


Plant cool-weather vegetables like onions, potatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and winter squash that can be easily stored.
Plant tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, corn, peas and beets that can be canned or frozen.

, Plant vegetables that are expensive to buy in the store, or that you consume in large quantities. Consider options like tomatoes, green beans, onions, peppers, squash, potatoes, peas, lettuce, beets, spinach, carrots, broccoli, cucumbers and Swiss chard.

Plant herbs for a high return on investment.,
Select herbs that you use for culinary or household purposes.",How to Save Money Gardening2," In most areas, you can purchase a packet of seeds or a small herb pot for about $1.50, which will produce leaves for an entire growing season. In contrast, fresh herbs at the grocery story typically cost about $3 for a single-use packet.

,


Plant herbs that you frequently use in the kitchen, such as basil, rosemary, oregano or parsley. You can use the fresh herbs throughout the growing season, and you can dry the herbs for future use.
Plant herbs that you use for household purposes. Herbs like lavender or lemon verbena can be used as air fresheners, added to soaps or infused in oils.

Plant seeds for a higher return on investment.,
Exchange seeds with friends.",How to Save Money Gardening3," A packet of seeds is less expensive than a plant, and the yield is much greater. A seed packet can produce dozens of plants for less than a single established plant or a cell pack of seedlings.

, Because seed packets typically provide more seeds than you need for a single growing season, exchange seeds with gardening friends. By exchanging seeds, you get more varieties of produce and lower your seed costs.

"
"
Plant produce in stages.",How to Save Money Gardening4," Rather than planting an entire crop of seeds at once, plant them in stages over the course of several weeks. This enables you to harvest in stages, and therefore consume the produce over time, rather than all at once. Succession planting allows a constant harvest in your garden, reducing the chance of produce waste.

Isolate the agave and pups from their surroundings.,
Loosen the dirt ball around the roots of the agave plants.,
Wiggle each pup a little.,
Pull gently on the small agave pup.,
Check for intact roots.",How to Remove Agave Pups from the Mother Plant," Depending on the variety of agave you have, you may wish to don a pair of gardening gloves to keep from getting pricked by thorns, if present, on the leaves.


Remove the plants from the pot. Do this carefully so you do not injure the plants. Tip the pot on its side, allowing its contents to come out. You may need to squeeze or push on the sides of the pot a little if it is a flexible pot. For ceramic or other hard pots, you can get the dirt and root ball out easier by running a trowel between the dirt and the pot to loosen the dirt from the sides of the pot.
Dig up agave sets that are in the ground. Use a shovel and dig around the plants, leaving a generous amount of space to keep from severing the roots. Some of the mother plants can be quite large. In the event the group of plants is too extensive to dig up, loosen the dirt with your shovel around the plants you wish to remove and proceed with the steps to remove agave pups.;
, Break the dirt apart with your hands or with your trowel. You may wish to wear gardening gloves for this step.

, This action will loosen the pup from the mother plant and allow it to be easily removed.

, The plants should separate easily so you will not need to use much force. Pulling aggressively will compromise the strength and structure of the small plant, harming it so it does not grow.

, The pup will need its roots to grow. The mother plant can withstand minor root damage but the pup will need the roots to survive the trauma of bring transplanted.

Examine your schefflera to see if it has a single stem or several stems.,
Determine how you would like the plant to look immediately and in the future.,
Check the general condition of your plant.,
Reduce the height of a schefflera plant by cutting an upright stem just above a growth node.,
Reduce the width of a schefflera by cutting any horizontal branches back to just above a leaf node.,
Cut all stems down to 6 inches from the base to rejuvenate a bare bottomed, straggly plant.",How to Prune a Schefflera Plant," This will influence how you go about pruning your plant. Schefflera with multiple stocks usually give you more options when pruning. They can grow in fuller and bushier, as they just have more places for leaves to grow. Schefflera with only one stock may be more suitable for developing a tall thin plant.


Keep the natural shape of your plant in mind when trimming. Fighting the natural growth pattern of your plant will be more difficult than simply shaping and trimming it as it grows.
This is especially important to look at when you are buying a new plant. If you want a full, bushy plant, be sure to pick a schefflera that has multiple stems so it will fill in and expand outward and upward. If you want a plant that will grow taller and stay relatively slim, pick a schefflera with only one stem (and trim any other stems that might pop out of the soil).;
, Some people want a tall and skinny plant, while others would like a short and bushy plant. It all depends on where you would like your plant to live and how much care you can give it. Part of trimming a plant is deciding how you want it to grow and helping it along that path.


On a schefflera the growth nodes, the place on a stem where new growth can develop, are located at the point on the stems where the leaves sprout. Because the schefflera usually has abundant growth and many nodes at which to trim, thinking about how it will grow in the future when assessing where that plant needs trimming will help you to promote growth in specific directions.Make this decision before cutting any leaves! Have a plan before you start so that you avoid mistakes and trim too many leaves.

, Before trimming your plant make sure that it is suitably potted and healthy. Make sure that your plant is in good soil and that the soil is moist. Before trimming your plant you may even want to take the opportunity to repot it, if you suspect its roots are crowded and you want to promote growth.


You should also check to make sure the leaves are healthy. If the leaves are looking discolored or getting brown spots you may need to address some problems, either with over watering or a lack of nutrients in the soil. Schefflera should not be kept in super moist soil. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. If this does not improve the condition of the plant, you may want to replace the soil it is potted in.

, In other words, trim it right above where a leaf has sprouted. Trimming off the growing tip of a stem will prevent it from quickly gaining height and will promote a fuller appearance in the area you cut.


Use bypass type pruning shears, the kind of pruning shears that cut with two blades, just like scissors. Other types of shears have a tendency to crush stems, as opposed to cutting cleanly through them. Sometimes unwanted height in a schefflera is caused by a lack of light. The plant is basically growing up to try to find more light. Keep this in mind when finding a suitable place for it to live.

, Keep in mind that you will get renewed growth at the node where you cut, so you may want to cut the plant back further than you currently desire, in anticipation of it filling in in the future. Schefflera can really handle some aggressive pruning, so don't be afraid to give it a good haircut!


Once again, use bypass type pruning shears so that you do not crush the stem.

, Sometimes these plants get neglected and become horribly overgrown and if you cannot figure out a way to shape the plant through gentle pruning, you can trim it all the way down. This give your plant a fresh start and it will give you the opportunity to better control how it grows in the future. Don't worry, it will grow back with a vengeance if it is given enough light, moisture, and nutrition.


When trimming your plant back, make sure to leave 2 to 3 nodes on each stem. This will give the plant ample spots at which to form new growth.
The large pieces you have cut off your plant would make great cuttings for propagating new plants. Place a cutting with at least two layers of leaves into moist soil for a few weeks. This will give the cutting enough growth nodes to keep growing. Roots should sprout from the bottom of the cutting and the plant can then be repotted. "

Knowing the advantages of seed collecting will help you decide if you want to start your own seed bank.


The cost of seeds has increased, while the number of seeds in pre-packaged envelopes has decreased.Collecting and storing seeds from your own garden ensures that you always have backups if any of your favorite plants die.Companies are increasingly using genetically modified products, or GMOs, which reduces a plant’s natural defensive mechanisms. Collecting your own seeds ensure that you get the purest plants possible.Collecting and storing your own seeds allows you to control their quality. Many pre-packaged seeds aren’t harvested at the most optimal time and are also not necessarily stored in the proper way.;
, One of the most difficult parts of collecting seeds is knowing when to harvest them. You’ll get better at identifying which seeds are ready for collecting with practice, but having a few basic facts at your fingertips will help guide you through the process.


Seeds need the living plant to give them nourishment while they swell into full size in the seed coat.Collect seeds from plants before frost or it rains. Seeds may absorb moisture, swell and crack, which damages the ability to properly germinate.Depending on what seeds you’re collecting, the growing and seed harvesting season begins in March and ends in fall. Late summer is the peak season.Check plants regularly for fading flowers and forming seeds. If plant heads are turning brown, this is also a good time to collect your seeds.You can collect seeds while they’re still green, but let them continue to ripen in the pod or seed head. Harvest seeds when the seeds are a good size and then let them finish maturing in a bag or on some newspaper in a cool place.Don’t necessarily pick seed heads as soon as petals fade. For plants like sunflowers, for example, wait until the visible seeds have plumped up, a sign that they’re mature., If you want to make sure that the seeds you harvest will yield the best plants, make sure that they are healthy and ripe. This will ensure that they not only bloom beautifully, but also that you can store them for a longer period of time.


Only save garden seeds from healthy plants that sprout during good growing seasons.Seeds that have been exposed to significant swings in the weather are likely not going to be healthy because the extreme changes in temperature can crack the seed’s hull.
Seeds are healthy is if they plump up on the plant, which is also a sign that they’re mature.Seeds that are dry on a plant are not healthy and you shouldn’t collect them for your seed bank.

, If you plan to collect seeds throughout the growing season, it’s a good idea to keep a seed collecting kit ready so that you can nip plants as soon as you notice that the seeds have matured. You can put together a kit with a few simple items from your home.


A good seed collecting kit will have a small pair of scissors or pocketknife to nip the plants; paper envelopes, paper bags, or small plastic bags in which to put the plant or seeds; and a pen or marker to label the seeds as you gather them.You can also use small tins and prescription bottles to save seeds.Bamboo skewers will help you remove and collect sticky seeds., Plants come in innumerable forms and identifying where their seeds are can often be difficult, especially for beginning collectors. Learning a few basic facts about plant shapes can help you more easily identify where the seeds are.


The largest family of flowering plants are called Compositae (Asteraceae) and include flowers such as sunflowers, black-eyed Susans, daisies, and zinnias. Many of these flowers have a green, yellow, brown or black ""eye"" in the center which produce both the flowers and the seeds.The seeds will develop in that ""eye"" forming a seed head. Oftentimes the ""eye"" looks like a button and sometimes it can look a bit like a cone like in purple coneflowers and Rudbeckias. Some Compositae flowers, like those of marigolds, have tight bunches of petals, with no “eye,” but the seeds develop right in the center. When sowing these seeds the easiest method is to break apart the cone or button and sow the seeds directly in the ground.
Plants in the mint family, such as basil, grow tiny flowers along a stem. These tiny flowers produce very small seeds that are best harvesting by snipping the entire stalk.The seeds of vegetables and fruits, including tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers are inside the flesh of the plant.Strawberries are an example of a fruit that have seeds on the surface., Every day or couple of days, check to see if plants or seeds have matured and are ready to harvest. If they are, either remove the seeds or snip the flowers for smaller plants so that you can prepare them for storage.


Use the scissors, knife or bamboo sticks from your collecting kit to harvest the ripe seeds.
If you’re dealing with plants that have tiny seed-producing flowers such as basil, snip the entire stalk to let the seeds fall naturally into an envelope or container.Shake seeds into the envelopes or bags from your collecting kit. You can also cut off stalks of plants and hang them upside down, which will helps release the seeds.This will help you keep plants separate before you dry and place them in final storage containers.
Make sure to not put too many plant stems or seed heads into your envelope or container so that they have room to dry properly.Make sure to keep each different kind of plant or seed separate so that you don’t cross-pollinate plants.

, It’s important to properly prepare your seeds for storage after you’ve harvested them. This will ensure not only that your seeds don’t mold but also that you can save them for longer periods of time.


Just as when you collect seeds, it’s important keep each different seed separate as you dry them for storage.
It’s very important to have good air circulation when drying seeds so that you can store them. Spreading out the seeds on sheets of paper or paper plates for a few days is the best way to dry them for storage.days.
Don’t dry seeds in or on plastic because it can promote the growth of mold or fungus., For plants from the Compositae and mint families, it’s best to remove as much of the stems and leaves as possible and then place them upside down in large paper bags and envelopes so that their pods and seeds dry out. Shaking the bag so that the seeds don't clump together ensures that they will dry out evenly., There are many plants, such as tomato and cucumber, that have their seeds embedded within a moist flesh. Before you can dry these for storage, you’ll need to remove and wash them.


Remove the seeds from vegetables such as cucumber and tomato with a tool or your fingers. Wash them to remove any plant flesh and then dry them on paper., As each of the types of seeds you harvested dries, transfer them to small envelopes or containers for storage. Make sure to label each packet so that you can easily find seeds for planting in subsequent growing seasons.


Once your seeds have dried, transfer them to small envelopes, for example coin envelopes, or containers such as a clean Altoids tin.This will ensure that they stay dry and last as long as possible.
Make sure to transfer one type of plant at a time in order to not mix seeds from different plant families.
Label each of the envelopes or contains with a pen or marker so that you can easily find seeds for swapping with friends or using in your own garden.

, Once you’ve transferred the seeds to envelopes or containers, you can create a seed bank in a jar or another container. This will help you keep your seeds orderly and in one place so that you can use them whenever you like.Desiccants such as silica gel can help maintain as little moisture as possible in your seed bank., In order to use your seeds in subsequent growing seasons, you need to store them in a cool and dry place, such as a kitchen pantry. This will help extend their shelf life and ensures that when you finally plant them, the yield the best plants.


All seeds have a limited shelf-life that ranges from a few months to a few years.Seeds from annual, perennial and biannual plants, as well as herbs and vegetables are excellent for storage. Less optimal are seeds from fruiting trees, shrubs, houseplants and tropical plants.You can extend the life of your seeds by keeping them in a cool and dry place. You may also want to check your seeds regularly to make sure they haven’t molded or germinated in their packages."

Look for dragon fruit that is red or yellow in color.,
Determine if the “wings” on the fruit have started to wither.,
Cut open the dragon fruit.",How to Tell if a Dragon Fruit Is Ripe1," When a dragon fruit is not ripe it will be green in color. As the fruit matures and ripens, the outer skin color changes to red or yellow, depending on the variety.When ripe the outer skin should be bright and even-colored. If the fruit has a lot of dark blotches on the skin, similar to bruises on an apple, then it may be overripe. A few spots, however, are normal.;
, Dragon fruit wings are the leafy part that extend off of the fruit. When they start to dry out, turn brown, and wither, the dragon fruit is ripe and ready to be eaten. Conversely, if the wings are still colorful (ie red or yellow), that means the fruit is underripe and still needs more time to ripen.Once the dragon fruit has reached the stage of ripeness where the wings start to wither, the fruit should come off the vine fairly easily with a light twist. If the fruit falls off the vine on its own, it is overripe.

, The inside of a dragon fruit is usually white, deep pink, or purple, depending on the variety, and contains tiny black seeds. The black seeds are edible and are similar in appearance to those found in a kiwi. When ripe the inside of a dragon fruit should appear juicy yet firm in texture: like a cross between a melon and a pear.When a dragon fruit is overripe the inner flesh will turn brown in color, similar to the bruised flesh of a banana. You should not eat fruit that is brown or dried out.

It should be soft, but not too mushy. If it is really mushy, then the fruit is likely overripe. If it’s very firm, it will need a few days to ripen.Only use this method if you are growing and harvesting your own dragon fruit. Squeezing a dragon fruit can leave the fruit bruised, which is inconsiderate to vendors and other customers in a store or market setting.
You can purchase or harvest a dragon fruit that is underripe and leave it out on a counter for a few days at room temperature. It will likely ripen in a couple days. Test the ripeness daily by pressing the skin.

, Dragon fruit can get damaged skin from rough handling and transportation mishaps. For example, if the fruit is not packaged properly during transportation, they may roll into each other. They might also become bruised from being dropped. If damaged the fruit will contain noticeable blemishes and will be much smaller and shriveled due to moisture loss.Check all sides of the fruit and avoid purchasing fruit that has been cracked, split open, or damaged.

, One sign that a dragon fruit may be overripe is a dried out stem. Touch the fruit to determine if the stem is brittle, shriveled, and dried out."

Harvest dragon fruits when they are close to fully ripe.,
Remove the thorns from the fruit before picking.,
Detach the dragon fruit from the vine by twisting.",How to Tell if a Dragon Fruit Is Ripe3," Dragon fruits, unlike many other fruits, do not ripen as much after harvest and as a result should be harvested when they are almost fully ripe.Once the color of the fruit has changed from green to yellow or red, then it is ready to harvest.
The small leaves on the sides of the fruit (also known as the “wings”) will also start to fade or turn brown as the fruit ripens.
You can also determine the ripeness by counting the days after the plant flowers. Typically the fruit is ripe a minimum of 27 to 33 days after the plant flowers.
Proper time of harvesting is four days after the color of the fruit changes. For export purpose, however, it is important to harvest slightly sooner, a day after the color changes.

, You can remove the thorns by using pliers, brushing them off, or with gloves. When the fruit is ripe the needles should begin to shed anyways, and as a result they should not be too difficult to remove. However, you should always wear gloves and be cautious because the needles are very sharp., When a dragon fruit is ripe and ready to be harvested, it will detach from the plant easily by twisting a few times. If you have to pull too hard on the fruit then it is likely not ready to be harvested.Do not wait until the dragon fruit has fallen off the plant. This means that the fruit is overripe.

Get out your barrow or cart and three buckets.,
Leave bucket one empty.,
Plan what needs gardening.,
Get your MP3 or radio ready.,
Start gardening.,
Take regular breaks.,
Finish up when your planned time is up.",How to Power Garden," Place the buckets into the barrow or cart in readiness for the next steps.;
, Line bucket two with a plastic bag. In bucket three, place your gardening gloves, twine, garden tools in readiness for gardening. Also place your cell phone in a sealed plastic bag into this bucket. This last trick stops you from feeling worried about the phone ringing (you can also take the cordless phone from the house if preferred).

, Decide by looking at the areas of the garden that are most visually concerning (what the neighbors are looking at) and what will become a jungle if you don't tackle it now! Select these areas and give them time limits - say half an hour here, one hour there, an hour or so over the other side. Map these out in your mind, or on paper, including breaks for snacks, lunch etc.

, Have your favorite songs or podcasts ready to go. You can skip this step if you prefer the sounds of nature. It is, however, a good chance to catch up on study if you're learning a language or studying something!

, Bucket one is for compostable items only - namely, seed-free weeds, dead-headed flowers, etc. Bucket two is for throwing away or mulch-machine items, such as diseased plants, twigs, branches, seedy weeds etc. Wheel the barrow or cart from garden bed to garden bed as required, taking care to empty out the buckets once full (it helps to have space available in the compost bin and to have a garbage can already lined etc. for taking the waste).

, It's important to stop and refresh for 5 to 10 minutes here and there, to have a snack or a drink. If you don't do this, you'll wear out quickly and feel less inclined to keep power gardening.

, You can return next weekend or whenever you have some more spare time. It's important to stick to your designated time limit, as this builds a healthy habit for future power gardening sessions and leaves your enthusiasm intact.

,
Remove all the branches.,
Cut the bare log of the tree into 2 foot (60.96 cm) pieces.

,
Remove the tree stump.",How to Remove a Tree,"


You might only need to remove a few branches if the tree is interfering with another object. If you are unsure if the tree is dead or dying, you can call an arborist or tree doctor to diagnose the problem.;
, Check to make sure the tree isn't caught up in wires or other trees. Make sure there is room for the tree to lie flat on the ground.


This might involve estimating the height of the tree.

, Take a step back so you can see the entire tree and the surroundings.


A tree will be much easier to remove if you can fell it the way it's organically angled. It's possible to fell a tree in any direction though.

,


A decayed or hollow trunk is unpredictable. You might not be able to fell it to direction you intend because a decayed tree can collapse at any point.

, These routes should be clear of obstacles. Escape routes are used if the tree begins to fall out of control.

,


Small trees can be sawed with a handsaw. You will need a chainsaw for trees with a trunk diameter of more than 1 foot (30.48 cm).

,, This is called the undercut and it should be about a quarter of the tree's diameter deep.

, This is called the backcut and it releases the stress the undercut places on the tree.

,, Start from the bottom of the tree and work your way up to the top.

,,


Drill holes into the stump with a drill. Pour wood-eating chemicals into the holes.
Let the stump decay away on its own. This takes anywhere from 5 to 10 years.

Read your plant tags when you buy organic plants and starts.,
Sharpen your pruning shears and loppers.",How to Prune Organic Plants1," They should specify whether this type of plant responds well to pruning. For example, some tomato plants should be pruned and others should not be pruned.


Always save your plant tags. Unless you are a professional gardener and you take care of your plants daily all year round, you will want to file the tags away. You can refer back to them for instructions on pruning or winter care.;
, You can use anything from small pruners to pole pruners, depending upon the size of your plant. You can prune small plants with sharp kitchen shears.

Thin branches of both trees and shrubs.,
Don't scalp your trees or shrubs, only pruning the top.",How to Prune Organic Plants2," These trees can leak sap onto the ground below if pruned in the late fall or winter. Maples, elms, walnuts, dogwoods and birches should be pruned earlier than other trees or shrubs.

, You will have a better idea about the shape of the tree, and the tree will have started to go dormant.


For example, prunes, crab apples, honey locust, poplar, sumac, spruce, juniper, cherry, bald cypress, Bradford pears and Callery pears should all be pruned at this late time of the year.
In addition, shrubs like camellias, hydrangeas, beauty berries, mallow and barberries should be pruned at this time as well.

, You want to choose a time in mild winter or late fall to begin your pruning on shrubs and trees.

, These are the first things you should prune with sharp pruning shears.


Always cut at an angle like that of the branch collar. The branch collar is the bark where the branch meets the trunk. Make sure your pruning mirrors that angle. However, do not cut into the branch collar.

, This will allow you easier access if you cut in thirds. It will also help to ensure the branch doesn't rip off on its own. It is much better for the tree to have a clean cut with pruning shears than to rip it off.

, You will need to be extra careful during pruning if disease is a problem.


Wait until the tree is not wet. Water can spread disease, so prune on dry days.
Pick a place to prune below the diseased portion. This will help you to stop the infection.
Clean your pruning shears between cuts with a solution of water with 10 percent bleach. This can kill disease and stop it from spreading. Make sure to do this before starting on another tree that has no signs of disease.

, Choose to cut the smaller branch of the 2.

, Cut back branches to avoid breakage in the future. Places with a lot of traffic or mowing can lead to breakages, making the tree more susceptible to disease.

, This will allow sunlight and air to reach the center of the plant. It will promote photosynthesis.

, Cut according to the tree's natural shape. Trying to shape it with a flat top is likely to promote weak growth, rather than strong, natural growth.

Decide if your tomato variety is determinate or indeterminate.,
Choose the right structure for your tomato plants.,
Put a 6-foot (1.8m) stake in the ground just after you plant your tomato.,
Prune the lowest branches of tomatoes, both determinate and indeterminate, so that they do not touch the ground.,
Cut indeterminate tomato branches to a single stem.,
Prune the fruit to 3 fruits on the first clusters.",How to Prune Organic Plants3," Determinate tomatoes are often called ""bush"" tomatoes, and they should not be pruned. Indeterminate tomatoes have a vine-like structure that can be pruned.

, Before you prune, you should ensure that you are giving your tomato plants the right support. Determinate tomatoes do well in cages, whereas indeterminate, or pruning-friendly, varieties do better with long stakes.

, Tie the vine to the stake with twine or ribbon. Continue to tie the vine to the stake as it grows.

, This will prevent blight and insects, especially during the wet season. Try to keep the first 12 inches (0.3m) clear of the ground.

, Remove the side shoots regularly, about every 2 to 3 days.


Although pruning young tomato plants may seem strange, it will actually help the plant to grow and produce more. You can begin pruning after about 4 weeks.

, Then, they can be pruned to 4 fruits on later clusters.

, Sharp scissors will do less damage and more good for organic plants.

, Prune young plants by cutting off their leaves. Prune older plants by cutting off whole branches of the stem.

, This will yield the best flavor.

, Try to always prune away leaves before they start to flower. Removing flowers will redirect the energy into leaf production.

, Leave 1 inch (2.5cm) of stem above the soil. This will allow them to grow again.

, If it cannot be refrigerated, place them inside airtight containers.

, Trash cans and compost piles that are open to the air will attract, feed and hatch more bugs. Take out trash daily during roach infestation.

, Water bugs live in places that are rarely cleaned and moved.


Recycle newspapers and food containers every week. Make sure your recycling containers have tight fitting lids over them.
Remove old cardboard boxes. These are popular hiding places.

, Pet water bowls, tarps, glasses of water, plant saucers, bird baths and rainwater can produce inviting places for water bug hatching.

Make sure your storage container is well ventilated.",How to Store Dahlia Bulbs," Before you can remove dahlia bulbs from the ground, you will need to cut down the stems. You should do this as soon as the first frost of the season has arrived.Cut back the stems until they're about 6 inches (15 centimeters) from the ground.
You can now leave the roots for two to three more weeks before removing the bulbs.;
, To start removing the bulbs, use a fork to gently loosen the soil surrounding the bulbs. Be careful not to dig too close to the stem or too deep into the ground. You do not want to accidentally cut into the bulbs and damage them.Use wiggling motions to remove the dirt.
Loosen up a small circle of soil around each bulb.

, Once you start to see the bulbs, you can remove them. You can use a blunt-ended stick to remove soil surrounding the bulbs. Then, insert your fork under the bulb. Push back on the fork gently to lift the bulb out of the ground.Go very slowly as you lift the bulb. You do not want to break off any of the stems. You will need them next year for the flowers to bloom again.

, There will be a lot of soil clinging to the bulbs. This should be removed prior to storage. Gently shake off as much soil as you can. Then, rinse off the remaining soil using water.Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands.
Be extremely careful when shaking and rinsing the bulbs. You do not want to cause them any damage. If damaged, you will not be able to reuse the bulbs next year.

, You should not store the bulbs until they're completely dry. This process takes about three weeks. After you've removed the bulbs from the soil, place them upside down in a pot.Place the pot in an area away from direct sunlight during the drying process.The pot should be placed in a dry, airy space. A storage shed or greenhouse would work well., After three weeks have passed, you can prepare your dahlias for winter storage. They should be packed into storage containers with either peat moss or dry leaves.Use a tray to store your plants. Place your bulbs in the tray, keeping them at least 8 inches (20 centimeters) from one another and the sides of the container.
Cover the bulbs in peat moss or dry leaves. Then, cover the container with a piece of burlap or a similar material.

, If your area is not prone to extremely cold winters, you can leave the tray outside near your garden. However, if temperatures drop below 16°F (−9°C), you need to store the dahlia bulbs in some kind of shelter. The area must be dry, cooler, and well-ventilated for the bulbs to thrive.A dry cellar, greenhouse, or cupboard in a cooler area of your home, such as a basement or attic, are all good areas to store dahlia bulbs.
For best results, the storage area should have a temperature between 39° to 45°F (4° to 7°C).

, You don't want to neglect your bulbs until the coming spring. Throughout the winter, check on them regularly. If you notice any signs of decay. If you notice the bulbs are shriveling, mist them with water. If any portion starts to rot, trim that portion off and remove it from the container., You should always remove your bulbs at the right time of year. This way, you have the best chance of them re-blooming in the spring. The first light frost of the season is usually the best time to remove the bulbs, but it's vital to remove them before a hard frost. Make sure to get them out of the ground before it becomes consistently below freezing in your area., You want to make sure your bulbs are stored at a low temperature. Storing bulbs inside your home, in a place like the kitchen, is not recommended. Warm cupboards and cabinets will destroy dahlia bulbs. Store them in areas in your home with a lower temperature, like the attic or basement., There should be some holes and slots in the storage container you choose. If bulbs cannot get access to air, this will cause them to decay. Always select a well-ventilated storage container when storing dahlia bulbs."

Store daffodils in the refrigerator if you live in a warm climate.,
Check your bulbs periodically.,
Exclude fruits from the storage area.",How to Store Daffodil Bulbs," Daffodils must complete their natural growing cycle after they have bloomed so that they can store enough nutrients to bloom again the following year.;
, Simply twist or snip the foliage off before excavating the bulbs. Be careful not to damage the bulbs when you dig them up as bruised bulbs have a greater likelihood of spoiling in storage.

, Loosen the soil all the way around each group of bulbs by pushing a shovel or garden fork into the soil about 6"" (15cm) away from the stems.

,, Once the daffodils have been unearthed, all bulbs that show signs of disease should be discarded. This prevents them from contaminating the others.


Damaged bulbs should likewise be tossed because they are not likely to bloom again.

, Before removing the roots, brush off the bulbs to remove dirt and outer layers of loose skin.

, The bulbs should be allowed to air dry on a tray for a day or so. This hardens them and helps keep them from rotting in storage.

, You may want to dust your bulbs with a fungicide, a pesticide, or with both before storing them. This will help keep bugs and disease at bay.

, These types of bags allow air circulation and help to prevent rotting. Make sure to store the bags in a well-ventilated place.



Alternatively, you can place the bulbs in boxes and cover them with media—sand, perlite, peat moss, or vermiculite. Pour dry sand or vermiculite into a storage container or cardboard box until it is about one-quarter full, then place the dried daffodil bulbs upside down on the layer and pour several more inches of the vermiculite or sand on top.

, Make sure the storage environment has a temperature of about 50-60℉ (10-15℃). Cool temperatures keep the plants in dormancy and prevent them from blooming prematurely.

, If you are growing more than one daffodil cultivar and/or other bulb plants, you will need to label the bags to prevent confusion the following spring.

, Daffodils need a chilling period of 16 to 18 weeks before the flower becomes fully formed inside the bulb. At that point they're ready for light and warmth.


If you cut the time short, the flowers may emerge but they will not be fully formed.

, You should monitor the bulbs to catch any problems that may occur. Remove and discard any unhealthy organic material or diseased bulbs to avoid spread of rot or disease.

, Fruits which ripen in the refrigerator emit ethylene, a gaseous hormone. This hormone aids the ripening of fruit and the blooming of flowers. Exposure to this hormone will encourage your bulbs to start the blooming process prematurely, before they've had the necessary chilling period to form the flower. Therefore, make sure that any bulbs that you keep in the refrigerator or kitchen pantry are segregated from ripening fruits.

Be aware that whiteflies easily build up a resistance to pesticides.",How to Get Rid of the Whitefly," Use a small hand vacuum, or hold the furniture-cleaning nozzle of a standard vacuum cleaner. Walk around your infested plants and suck the pests from the undersides of the leaves and foliage. This method is quick and straightforward, and it can remove whiteflies from all stages of the development cycle – from larvae to mature, plant-munching adults.Vacuuming is most effective as soon as you notice an infestation.










When the vacuum bag is full of whiteflies, trade it out. Seal the vacuum bag inside an airtight plastic bag, then put it into the freezer for at least 24 hours to kill off the insects. Once all of the flies are dead, you can empty the bag into the trash.;
, Use garden clippers to trim away as much as you can without killing the plant. You can also pluck infested leaves by hand. Look for white eggs and wingless ""crawlers"" on the underside of the leaves. Extremely infested leaves may be coated with a sticky or waxy fluid—honeydew—that is produced when the feeding nymphs ingest plant juices.Leaves may also appear pale and wilted.



Only trim as much as is healthy for the plant. If a particularly delicate plant is infested, you should cut away only the most infected leaves. If the plant is hardy, consider paring all the way down to the stem in order to stop the infestation in its tracks.Make sure to properly dispose of the diseased leaves. Burn them or seal them into an airtight bag. If you don't handle the leaves carefully, the whitefly infestation may spread again., The whitefly matures in 4 stages: from eggs, to nymphs, to pupa, to the adult fly.Each method typically only targets certain stages in the fly life cycle. Thus, if a method targets the adult fly, you will need to keep applying that treatment until all of the existing eggs have matured into adults. You will need to be quick and diligent in your treatments to make sure that the newly-formed adults do not lay new eggs.The nymph and adult flies are the only stages that cause physical damage to the host plant. Younger whiteflies will, however, mature into more damaging forms if left unchecked.
For the best application timeframe, check the lifespan and stages of your particularly whitefly. Various species—including the Silverleaf, Fig, Greenhouse, and Bandedwing whitefly—each have a different lifespan.

, Pay special attention to the undersides of the leaves, where most of the whiteflies live. Be aware that this method only kills the adult insect. Wash every 3 or 4 days to eliminate the new whiteflies as they emerge from pupa. Depending on the type of whitefly, you may need to continue this treatment for several weeks until the infestation is gone.










If you use a highly-concentrated soapy solution, try applying it at the end of the day to avoid burning the foliage.

, Various other species of insect love to feed upon the whitefly, and you might be able to rein in the infestation by bringing the right predator into the ecosystem. This predator will depend on the type of whitefly. Consider green lacewings, lady beetles, ladybugs, minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, wasps, and damsel bugs.



Be careful when intentionally introducing any new insect species to your garden. The predators may take care of your whitefly infestation – but you may soon find yourself contending with far too many of the new bug! Research before you act.

, You can buy these traps in garden stores, or you can craft them at home. To make your own: coat a sturdy yellow surface (cardboard or wood) with a slow-drying adhesive substance. Glue, honey, motor oil, or petroleum jelly are good choices. Whiteflies are said to be attracted to the color yellow. When they flit to the yellow trap, they land and cannot free themselves from the glue.










If you make your own trap, you may need to reapply the adhesive as it dries out. Glue, for instance, may dry within a matter of minutes or hours. Motor oil or petroleum jelly may be less immediately effective, but might stay sticky for longer.
Make sure to remove the traps if you use a spray or a wash, or if you introduce natural predators.

, Whiteflies tend to group on the undersides of plant leaves, and your trap will be be more likely to catch the insects if it is near their natural habitat.









, Take down the traps once the whitefly population is mostly dead, and you only find a few flies caught each day. The traps also have the potential to kill whitefly predators. Thus, they may not be well-suited to a low-level infestation unless these predators fail to keep the whiteflies in control. If the whitefly population bounces back and returns, then you can feel justified in resetting the traps., French and Mexican marigolds tend to repel whiteflies, as do nasturtiums. Put these companion plants into your garden to keep the pests from returning! Be aware that this is a preventative measure, and not a great solution for existing infestations.Pot marigolds and calendulas are not effective repellents. Make sure to use the right variety! If you aren't sure, visit a nursery and specifically ask about companion plants that repel whiteflies.

, In a 32-ounce spray bottle, mix rubbing alcohol with water at a 2:5 ration. Then, add a tablespoon of liquid dish soap. Use the spray bottle to coat the leaves of plants that are at risk for whitefly infestations. If you don't overdo it, the spray shouldn't harm most plants – and it might keep the flies from putting down larvae.










Consider using a natural tree oil spray, such as Neem oil.

, Earthworm castings, when added to the fertilizer bed of whitefly-infested plants, have been found to repel the flies within a matter of weeks or months.As an added bonus, these castings are a rich natural fertilizer, and they can greatly stimulate plant growth. Ask for earthworm castings at a local garden store., Spread a layer of aluminum foil or reflective plastic mulch on the ground around susceptible plants. This may make it much harder for adult whiteflies to locate host plants, which in turn can bring make them less likely to successfully lay eggs.This step will require special water considerations. Plants surrounded by plastic mulch will need a drip irrigation system.
Do not use mulch in hot weather. Too much mulch may overheat the plants.

, On one hand, a commercial pesticide is sometimes an effective way to quickly kill off the pests. The whitefly, however, is notoriously resistant to chemical products. Furthermore, these chemicals are often toxic to other organisms in the immediate ecosystem – including the plants and benign insects in your garden, pets and local wildlife, and even your family. Try to keep pesticides as a last resort.


, Indeed, the eggs and pupae are able to resist most common insecticides. If you do use chemicals, be sure to switch them out in several-day rotations to keep your fly population from adapting. Even so, there is a strong chance that the whiteflies will adapt. You may unwittingly create a strain of pesky super-flies!

Never use food preparation utensils for this purpose. Even if you only intend to use a measuring cup for your pesticide, it could accidentally be picked up and taken into the kitchen later.
Mix your pesticide in the application equipment if possible, to avoid handling it during use. Commonly, compressed air or pump up garden sprayers are used for this purpose. In agriculture, tractor mounted, PTO driven equipment is used to apply pesticides on crops and farm land.

, This can be accomplished by reading the information on the label under ""application rate"", generally in terms of gallons per acre, or 'gallons per 1000 square foot"". Measure the area you intend to treat, and calculate the amount of material required to treat it. Storing left over mixed pesticides is generally not a good idea, but if you must, label the container according to contents and date mixed, and keep it tightly closed.

, Use copious amounts of water, and do not allow run off from washing to go into waterways. Keep the washing operation away from wells or other drinking water supplies.

, This is usually listed on the warning and usage label for each specific product, and the following are some common items.


Safety glasses. These keep chemicals or dust from getting in the applicator's eyes.
Rubber gloves. Rubber, neoprene, or other chemical resistant gloves protect your hands from chemicals which may be absorbed through your skin.
Long sleeved shirts and long pants. Another barrier protection for your skin. When the application process is complete, remove clothing and rinse it thoroughly before laundering.
Rubber boots. Because leather or cloth boots can absorb and accumulate chemicals, it is often suggested that the person applying pesticides wear rubber boots.

,, If you are using a liquid spray, no one should reenter the area until the product is completely dry.

, Use only products specifically labelled for this purpose, and remove any loose items such as clothing, books, and toys prior to applying.

, Chemicals undergo changes over a period of time, and pesticides may become unstable, more toxic, or ineffective after the expiration date listed on the package.

, If insects return before the reapplication date, you will need to find a different control method. Most pesticides recommend treating (or retreating) a crop or area at specific intervals, often coinciding in the development rate of insects from egg or larval stage to adult. Overuse can create chemical resistance in the target insect and toxic levels of chemical buildup in the soil, plants, and environment the pesticide is used on.

,, For use on edible crops, carefully follow the label instructions in regard to the period prior to harvest that pesticides may be applied, since simply washing the product will not remove the poison.

, This will ultimately give better control of insects and decrease the frequency of application.

, This contributes to safety by decreasing the use of poisons altogether. Planting certain flowers like marigolds, and herbs like garlic will naturally decrease the insect populations in your crop. Bacillus thuringiensis or ""BT"", is a bacterium compound which attacks certain insects when topically applied to plants, while being harmless to humans and animals.

"
Look at the surface of the leaves.,
Check for white webbing on the plant.,
Confirm the presence of spider mites.,
Be particularly vigilant with certain species of plants.,
Be especially alert during dry and dusty weather conditions.",How to Get Rid of Spider Mites1," If your plant is indeed infested with spider mites, the leaves may have yellow blotches on them. When light falls on the leaves, you may see a silvered look or even streaks of bronze or silver.


While mites usually attack the underside of leaves, they can sometimes get greedy and also eat the upper side of leaves and flowers. Eventually, the mites will suck holes right through the leaves - providing the most obvious evidence of infestation.
Even if you can't find holes in the leaves, your plant may still have spider mites, so keep an eye out for other signs of infestation.
Other signs of mite damage include distortion, deformation, wilting, spotting, streaking or discoloration on the surface of the leave. If the mite damage gets particularly bad, the leaves may start to fall off.;
, This is a giveaway sign of some spider mites. The webbing usually clusters around feeding areas. Note that not all species of spider mite will produce webbing though.

, Spider mites are so small, they can be very difficult to see. However, one method you can use to confirm their presence is to take a sheet of white paper, place it beneath the plant you suspect to be infested and and lightly shake the stem of one of the leaves.


A certain number of the spider mites should fall onto the paper. They can be viewed more easily with a magnifying glass.
Spider mites come in a variety of colors, including red, green, yellow and brown. They have eight legs and tend to move quite slowly.
Be on the lookout for spider mites with spots on their backs - these are known as two-spotted spider mites and can be particularly hard to get rid of., There are some plants which spider mites seem to favor more than others.


In particular, pay attention to possible infestations on miniature roses, fruit trees, bananas, potted begonias, beans, mint, broad-leafed weeds, strawberries, frangipani and indoor houseplants.
Be aware that the two-spotted spider mite has been known to infest over 100 different species of plant.

, These are the conditions where spider mites can cause the most damage, as they are thirsty and are seeking moisture from the leaves of the plant. This also means they are very attracted to anything grown under glass, including plants sitting inside on your windowsills.

"
"
Remove badly infected parts of the plant immediately.,
Wash and wipe indoor houseplants regularly.,
Use plant-based miticides.,
Spray outdoor plants with a hose.,
Use a homemade herbal tea.,
Try organic salts.,
Control weeds around plants.,
Encourage the presence of ladybugs and other insects that prey on spider mites.",How to Get Rid of Spider Mites2," Pick up any leaves that have fallen off the plant and pull off any badly damaged leaves from the plant itself. This will prevent the mites from affecting other plants nearby. Place the leaves in a sealed plastic bag and throw in the garbage or burn.


If an entire plant is infected, you should consider removing it completely. This will give other plants a better chance at survival.
Water affected plants only from above and keep removing any infected plant pieces as soon as you spot them.

, Given that it is fairly easy for the householder to clean indoor plants this way, it can be the most effective and non-toxic method to rid the plants of spider mites.


You can use either plain water or a solution of tepid (cool-warm) water mixed with a very mild dish detergent or soap. Use 3 tablespoons of soap per gallon of water.You can use any kind of soap, but castile soap is particularly effective. Or, you can also use an insecticidal soap.
Use a sponge soaked in the water to wipe down individual leaves of the plant, or place the water in a spray bottle and spritz the underside of the leaves.
Apply the soap solution again, six days later, if the infestation continues. Be aware that some species of plant are particularly sensitive to soap, so consider testing the soap solution on a small section of the plant before spraying all over.

, There are a number of commercially available miticides which use natural ingredients to kill the spider mites, but leave the plant and other insects unharmed. The three most popular ones are as follows:


Pyrethrum is a natural pesticide which is made from a plant closely related to the chrysanthemum. It is the best pesticide to start with when targeting spider mites, however some spider mite species have developed a resistance to it, so you should keep a close eye on plants even after spraying.
Cinnamite is a non-hazardous pesticide derived from cinnamon oil. Although it is very safe to use and is effective for killing the spider mites themselves, it will not destroy the eggs. As a result, it will need to be used approximately every 3 days over a two week period, to ensure that all of the newly hatched eggs are killed also.
Neem oil is a miticide derived from the nuts of the Neem tree. It is great for targeting infestations, but also works well as a mite repellent and a treatment for powdery mildew.Rosemary oil is also effective as an organic pesticide. Try spraying a solution of rosemary oil and water onto the leaves of an infested plant. The rosemary oil will kill the spider mites, but leave the beneficial, predatory species of mites alone., Attach a spray nozzle to your outdoor hose and use it to water any infested outdoor plants. Set the water to a high pressure and try to target the underside of the leaves in particular. This should help to wash spider mites away.

, If you want to make your own miticide at home, you can make an herbal tea by mixing a tablespoon of ground cinnamon, a tablespoon of ground cloves and two tablespoons of Italian seasoning in a quart of water.


Bring the water to a boil, then take off the heat. Once it has cooled slightly add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of crushed fresh garlic. Leave to sit until the water cools completely, then strain through a cloth or coffee filter.
Add a squirt of dish soap to the tea, then pour into a spray bottle. Spray the underside of the infested leaves with the tea every three days over a two week period. This should effectively kill the mites.

, Fatty acids or potassium salts can be abrasive against mite bodies. Apply these late afternoon, to give the maximum time for the wetness to remain on the plants, to get to the mites.


Mist susceptible plants with water in the evening to make the environment cooler and more moist. This works well for the two-spotted spider mites which prefer warm and dry environments.

, Don't give mites extra hiding places and launchpads to attack the plants that you actually want to grow in the garden.


In particular, remove all broad-leafed weeds.
Remove all debris remaining after harvest. This includes removing plant stumps, fallen leaves and any other plant matter.

, Predator insects, such as lacewing larvae, predacious thrips and ladybugs can decimate spider mite populations if encouraged to stay in your garden. However, one of the main reasons that spider mite populations develop in the first place is the use of pesticides which kill their natural predators. Therefore, you should avoid using pesticides such as carbaryl, malathion and imidacloprid.These insects can be purchased online, from garden centers or through advertisements in gardening magazines. Alternatively, herbs such as amaranth and borage can naturally attract ladybugs into your garden.
Ask the supplier for details on how to make the most of using predator insects, noting that you'll have less success if using them in a mixed planting area.
Predatory mites can also be used against spider mites. Look for Phytoseiulus persimilis or other predatory mite species at the garden center (ask the retailer for the brand names it comes under, as this differs from country to country), then follow the release instructions.
Under the right conditions, predatory mites can decimate a spider mite population. Interestingly, ladybugs (or ladybirds) will leave predatory mites alone, targeting just the spider mites!

"
"
Use rubbing alcohol.,
Purchase a proprietary product suitable for outdoor spider mites.,
Try getting rid of the mites with liquid sulfur.",How to Get Rid of Spider Mites3," Isopropyl rubbing alcohol will effectively kill spider mites. Simply pour a little of the rubbing alcohol onto a clean cloth and use it to wipe the underside of the infested plant's leaves.

, There are sprays or wipes available from garden centers and hardware stores. Use according to the manufacturer's instructions.


If spraying specific chemicals (such as dienochlor, dicofol, azocyclotin, fenbutatin, bromopropylate, propagate), it is recommended that you do not use the same product more than three times per growing season. This will help reduce the chances of the mites gaining resistance against the chemicals.

, Spraying liquid sulfur is another option for getting rid of spider mites. Do not use powdered sulfur because it can get into the air and you or someone else might inhale it. Make sure that you do not spray liquid sulfur within 30 days of using an oil on your plants or in temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit."

Watch for eggs.",How to Get Rid of Red Spider Mites Organically," Spider mites are attracted to many plants, including indoor and outdoor, with some of those being strawberries, melons, beans, tomatoes, eggplant, pea pods, ornamental flowers, trees, and most houseplants. , When checking for spider mites, you'll be able to identify plants they have infested by the state of the plant. Spider mites suck the sap from the plant, which causes damage to its leaves. Some noticeable signs of spider mites are:


Yellow, tan, or white spots on the leaves
Very small white or red spots on the leaves that move (these are the spider mites)
White, cottony webbing that appears on the underside of the leaves
Eventually leaves may curl up after changing color and fall off

, Before you begin treating spider mites, it's good to be familiar with what they look like and the harm they cause. If you are unable to see them on the leaf, hold the stem of your plant over white paper and gently shake, causing the spider mites to fall on the paper. Spider mites are very small, so they can be difficult to see, but with a magnifying glass you will be able to make out a small body with eight legs, and a red, brown, yellow, or green coloring.
Spider mites are most common in hot, dry and dusty conditions and most prevalent in places where they have no predators, such as plants that have been treated with insecticide. , By using chemical pesticides, you can often kill the insects that prey on spider mites, making it easier for spider mites to grow and populate on your plants. Spider mites have also been known to develop quick resistance to some pesticides, so it's best to control spider mites with natural methods. Female spider mites can produce up to 300 eggs continuously over a few weeks. If some eggs are unable to be killed by pesticides, the mite problem may only get worse.

, Before taking any steps to remove spider mites, you'll want to remove the infected plants to an area without any other plants. This will prevent the spider mites from spreading and harming your other plants.

, After removing the infected plant to an isolated area, begin pruning the plant, removing any stems, leaves, or other infested parts of the plant and throw in the trash. Make sure to remove until all webbing is gone. Unfortunately, you may have to remove entire plants to prevent mites from spreading to other plants if the plant is overly infested. Make sure to throw leaves directly in a trash bag so they won't spread. Throwing them in your compost pile will allow spider mites to escape to your other plants.

, Using a high pressure water hose or nozzle, spray plant generously. This will dislodge spider mites from the plant and kill some of them, reducing the number of spider mites on your plant. If treating an indoor plant, use a wet sponge or take it outdoors to spray. This treatment typically has to be repeated in order to effectively remove spider mites.

, This is a great step, because allowing natural predators to inhabit your plant will keep spider mite population to a minimum, if not dissolving it completely, and you won't have to worry about spider mites continually infecting your plants. You can purchase these predators from reputable nurseries.Ladybugs, lacewing, and predatory mites are the best predators for spider mites
The best time to release predators is when spider mite levels are relatively low. You'll also want to make sure the predators you purchase are appropriate for the plant you'll be placing them on and for the season in which you'll be using them. , Soap sprays are a common, natural way to kill spider mites. Combine two tablespoons of gentle soap, one to two tablespoons of cooking oil, and a gallon of water. Spray plants thoroughly, repeating every four to seven days until spider mites appear gone.


Gentle soap, such as baby shampoo, may be better because heavier soaps like dish detergent can damage plants. However, you can use a harsher soap as long as you test it on a small area of the plant first, making sure the solution doesn't burn the leaves.
Cooking oil will smother the insects and help the solution stick to the leaves.
Be careful not to spray solution on plants when you notice beneficial insects as this will harm them as well, and avoid spraying when the sun is directly on the leaves as it will likely dry up the solution. , This solution is a common way to control mites and other pests. Combine one teaspoon cayenne pepper or hot sauce, one quart of warm water, and a few drops of liquid dish detergent. Let the solution sit overnight and then sift it through a fine strainer. Spray on the bottom of leaves, keeping it away from your face, and shaking frequently to prevent ingredients from settling. Always test solution on a small portion of the plant to make sure it doesn't harm the leaves.
To make an even stronger solution, add minced onion and garlic.

, Many essential oils can help kill and prevent spider mites. These solutions are beneficial because they will not harm the plant itself, and have natural properties that react with the spider mite, often killing it. Mix a solution of these oils in a one liter bottle, filling half of it with lukewarm water and then adding 10 to 20 milliliters (0.34 to 0.68  fl oz) of essential oil. Some oils you might use are: Neem oil
Eucalyptus oil
Lemon oil
Cinnamon oil
Peppermint oil
Rosemary oil
Chrysanthemum oil
Thyme oil


For oils with a gentle smell, use higher concentrations, and those with a stronger smell, use lower concentrations.
Never pour essential oils directly onto plant without diluting them first as this will likely damage the plant.

, Plants that are stressed are more vulnerable to spider mites. Make sure plants are adequately watered, are in healthy soil, and receive optimal light., Periodically dust the leaves and branches of your plant, as this will help prevent spider mites. In dry, dusty areas spider mites are thirstier and so they will cause more damage to your plant if you provide that environment for them. , Just targeting spider mites with one treatment is likely not going to get rid of them completely. During warm weather seasons, eggs are laid continuously, and so management and repetition of treatments is vital to keep spider mite population to a minimum or nonexistent. Do frequent water sprays on your plant, as well as pruning leaves if you notice any eggs (small white specks on the underside of leaves) or mites.It may also be beneficial to keep the plant in an area where air can circulate freely.

, Scorpions feed on insects, so if you have an issue with roaches, ants, or other bugs in the house, you'll need to solve that problem before the scorpions will go away. Here are a few good ways to keep the insect population down in your home:


Clean up crumbs and do dishes promptly so bugs don't have a food source.
Sprinkle borax or diatomaceous earth around the baseboards and under the sinks in your home; these natural substances kill insects.
Consider spraying insecticides around your home to kill insects. Do research and approach this method with caution, since some insecticides are poisonous to humans and pets.
Keep the population down outdoors as well, since scorpions prefer to live outside.

, Scorpions like to hide in dark places, especially during the day. Get rid of structures in and around your home that could be used as a convenient hiding place by a scorpion. Take the following measures to keep scorpions from hanging around:


Store cardboard boxes on shelves instead of the floor.
Don't keep clutter around your home or under the beds.
Keep your closets and bedrooms neatly organized. Scorpions like to hide in shoes and piles of clothes on the floor.Outdoors, trim back bushes and foliage that scorpions can hide under. Get rid of piles of wood, rocks or yard clippings.Trim back vines and other potential hiding spots.

, Scorpions can slip through an opening the size of a credit card. Sealing your home is an important method for keeping them from invading. In order to make sure your home is secure, take the following measures to seal the doors, windows and foundation:


Use caulk to fill in holes and cracks in your walls, baseboards or the foundation of your home.
Make sure your windows close tightly and the screens are sealed so scorpions can't climb in.
Get door seals to prevent scorpions from coming in under the doors.

, The best way to get rid of scorpions as fast as possible is to hunt for them at night, when they're most active. It's not for the faint of heart, but killing them one at a time is a good way to reduce the scorpion population around your home, fast. To hunt scorpions, you need the following equipment:


A black (ultraviolet) light. They glow in the dark, so you'll be able to see them clearly by using a black light to search them out. Get a flashlight or headlamp with a black light bulb.
A tool you can use to kill them. In parts of Arizona, long-handled tweezers used to break the scorpions' exoskeletons are the weapons of choice. You can also use a long knife or wear a pair of heavy boots to step on them.

, Look on exterior walls, at the bases of walls and fences, under bushes and other foliage, under rocks, and other outdoor cracks and crevices close to your home. Shine your black light in all of these areas to set scorpions aglow.


Scorpions don't normally reside in grass, so you probably won't find many there.
You can also look indoors in your attic, along baseboards, and in any other areas where you've seen a scorpion.

, Use long-handled tweezers, a knife, or the bottom of your boot to kill the scorpions. Then put them in a trash bag, tie it up and discard it with your regular trash.

, Hunt at night with a UV flashlight and Raid ant and cockroach spray. Spray each scorpion directly with the spray. This spray has the fastest activation.

If the scorpion is high up a wall or on the ceiling, spray with Raid wasp and hornet spray to reach.

, Spray an area 6 feet (2 yards) wide around the exterior of the house. Spray up to a height of 1 foot (.3 yards) on the foundation wall. Apply insecticide around the windows, doors and baseboards inside the house. Spray basements, garages and closets with insecticide. Apply insecticide to any stacked materials where scorpions may hide.

, These substances will kill scorpions before they are able to enter your home. Spread pesticide dust and wettable powder around electrical outlets and plumbing fixtures, and in attics. Fill in cracks with pesticide dust.

, If you continue to have problems with scorpions, call a professional pest control agency.

, Sticky traps designed to catch insects or mice work well for trapping scorpions, too. Set them out around sources of water and in dark corners of your house. When you catch a scorpion, throw the trap away and set out another one.

, Some cats like to hunt scorpions, so having one around can really help to keep the population down. Chickens, too, enjoy eating scorpions, so consider getting an outdoor chicken coop.

, Ground cinnamon is a natural scorpion repellant. Sprinkle it in dark areas, windowsills and around your baseboards to keep scorpions away.

Pull up sunflowers from your garden.,
Remove sunflowers using chemicals.,
Keep the sunflowers from getting sunlight.,
Cut down sunflower stalks.,
Remove sunflower root balls from the soil.",How to Get Rid of Sunflowers1," You can get rid of sunflowers by pulling them up from the soil with your hands. Try to do this before the seeds develop. If the seeds develop, removing the plants becomes harder because the seeds could get dislodged and scatter around your garden. Any seeds that scatter may regrow the following year.


If you have to remove mature sunflowers with seed heads, put some sheeting down—like an old dust sheet or tarpaulin—underneath the plants. This will catch any seeds that fall. Shake the cloth into the compost can once you’re finished.





;
, Sunflowers are broad-leaved plants so a broadleaf weed killer should get rid of them. Check the manufacturer’s instructions before using the weed killer. In most cases, the approach will be to carefully apply the weedkiller to the leaves of the plant you wish to remove.


Take care not to get any on nearby plants you wish to keep. Chemical controls will only work on growing plants. Any dead, woody plants will need to be cut back and dug up.

, One intense approach to getting rid of any unwanted plant is to keep it from receiving any sunlight. To do this:


Pin a light-excluding material, such as weed barrier sheet, also known as landscaping fabric, over the area affected.






Some gardeners have success by laying several sheets of newspaper on the ground and pinning it down with a heavy mulch such as well-rotted manure or bark chips. By the time the newspaper rots away the seeds below will no longer be able to grow.
Whatever you use, take care to choose a material that permits water to penetrate. You’ll need to keep the cover on the ground for roughly six months to a year.

, Once sunflower blooms fade, a tough stalk remains in the ground. These aren’t easy to remove but it can be done. Cut the sunflower down to knee height using a small saw or pruning shears to cut through the woody stem. Grab the remaining stalk and pull it out of the ground.


If it’s really hard, try hacking away at the roots a bit with a mattock or trowel. This will help loosen the plant’s grip on the earth.
Remember to use gardening gloves.

, Once dislodged, sunflower root balls should be removed from the soil as much as possible, as it will be hard to plant around the tough roots.


The woody root and stalk won’t compost very quickly, so consider burning them instead. However, use extreme caution when doing this.

Look for adult scales.,
Identify ‘crawlers’.,
Familiarize yourself with what scales do when they get on a plant.,
Spot signs of scale damage.",How to Get Rid of Scale Insects1," Scales are usually off-white, tan or brown but can also be other colors. Most of them have a smooth, flat covering but some may look cottony or fluffy. The adults do not move.;
, The young scales, called crawlers, have legs and will move very slowly, or are blown by the wind, to a spot on a plant that they like. Crawlers are often not the same color as the adults of the species. Cottony cushion scales, for example, are off-white but the crawlers are orange.


After the crawlers get to their spot, they will attach to the leaf or stem and eventually lose their legs.

, When they attach to the plant, they pierce it with their mouths and suck the plant juices out.


Scales can become a problem for gardeners all over the world.They survive the winters on plant leaves and stems only to reproduce again when the weather warms and make a meal out of any nearby garden plant.

, The first symptoms are yellow, falling leaves. Eventually twigs and entire limbs die and the tree bark cracks and oozes sap. Soft scales will do some damage but they rarely do enough damage to kill a plant. The most serious problem they cause is honeydew which is a clear, sticky secretion they leave behind as they feed.


Aphids, small, soft-bodied insects excrete honeydew as well. They are usually green or red, although they can be nearly any color, and are more mobile than scale insects.
Sooty mold, a fungus, will often grow on the honeydew causing unsightly dark spots on the leaves and interfering with the plant’s ability to absorb sunlight.

Remove sunflower seedlings by hand.,
Do not try to burn away seedlings.,
Dig up perennial sunflower roots.,
Prevent annual sunflowers from self-seeding.,
Remove annual sunflowers when they are done flowering.,
Restore your soil after removing the sunflowers.",How to Get Rid of Sunflowers2," Provided you can recognize what a sunflower seedling looks like, you can remove sprouting sunflowers by hand removal or by hoeing. Hoeing works well on a dry day as any seedlings you uproot will dry out and die before they can re-root.


A sunflower seedling has a small stem and two green, oval shaped leaves at the very top of the stem. In a week, it will have four leaves, all pointing out from the center of the stem, almost like the top of a helicopter.

, It isn’t recommended to try burning away seedlings as this is a dangerous method of removal but some gardeners risk it anyway.


This is especially unwise in dry conditions or near any flammable materials, such as a wooden fence.

, Perennial sunflowers naturally regrow year after year from the same plant. These have deeper roots than annual sunflowers and the roots have tubers and rhizomes attached. You’ll see perennial sunflowers emerge in the early spring, which is a bit sooner than annuals. Perennial sunflowers spread via their roots as well as via seed, so you need to dig the roots up to be rid of the plant completely.It’s best to burn the root mass or put it out with the trash rather than compost it as it may regrow.

, Annual sunflowers will self-seed (scatter their seeds which will regrow the following year) if left to do so. Birds will also help scatter the seeds by feeding from the seed head. It’s best to cut back the flowers immediately after the blooms are past their prime.If the plant still has other flower heads that are coming out, try to remove old blooms by cutting off the spent flower heads where they join the plant. This allows you to enjoy the other flowers as they emerge.

, Once all the flowers are spent, cut the stalk of the annual to about knee height. This allows you to pull the remaining stalk out of the ground.


If you aren’t bothered about leaving a woody root mass in the ground and don’t intend to pull it, you should cut it off as close to the ground as possible.

, Sunflowers are ‘hungry’ plants that will absorb a lot of nutrients from the soil. Other plants that you put in the same spot may miss out on nutrition if you do not restore the soil.


Use an improver such as compost or well-rotted manure before you replant the area. Do this immediately after removing the sunflowers. Try to do this in the fall before the ground gets too cold.

Rub the scales off your plant.,
Try using insecticidal soap.,
Avoid using regular house soap.",How to Get Rid of Scale Insects2," Scales can attack houseplants, even if they are never put outdoors. They often go unnoticed at the greenhouse or store where the houseplant is purchased and flourish on the plant after it is brought home. Remove scales from houseplants by rubbing them off with an old toothbrush, your thumbnail or a cotton swab dipped in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol., Insecticidal soap can also be sprayed on houseplants to kill scales. Mix about 5 tablespoons of insecticidal soap or a very mild dish soap into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.Pour the soap into a spray bottle and spray the plant, including the undersides of the leaves and stems, until the soap solution begins to drip. Repeat the treatment every four to seven days until the scales are gone.

, Do not use laundry soap, automatic dishwasher soap or highly concentrated dish soap that has additives or antibacterial ingredients. They can damage the plant leaves, causing discoloration and leaf tissue damage.

Use the same methods as those used for houseplants when fighting a small-scale attack.,
Prune away parts of the plant that are infested with scales.,
Spray the plants with horticultural oil.,
Keep the seasons in mind.",How to Get Rid of Scale Insects3," Scales are most prevalent outdoors where they infest all species of trees, shrubs, perennial plants and annual plants. When the plants are small enough and infestation is not too severe, get rid of the scales in the same way as you would houseplants.Scrub the scales off with your nail or an old toothbrush.
Spray the plant with an insecticidal spray every four days or so.

, When the scale infestation is severe, use sharp hand pruners or loppers to trim off branches and leaves which hold high concentrations of these insects.


Make the pruning cut about 1/4-inch above a leaf or at the base of the branch.
Use a garden hose to spray off the pruners or loppers before using them on another plant to remove any scale insects that may be left on them., This is also commonly called summer oil or dormant oil, to kill any remaining scale insects. Spray the oil on the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems. There are various horticultural oil formulas on the market that are all equally good. They are commonly mixed at a rate of 2 to 4 teaspoons per gallon of water, but this varies.Read and follow the manufacturer’s recommendations carefully. Shake the spray bottle vigorously to mix it initially and every few minutes while spraying to keep the oil mixed with the water.

, Spray the plants in early spring to kill any scale insects that have survived the winter before new growth starts.During the summer, spray the plants for scales in June, July and August but only if they return after the early spring treatment.


Horticultural oils work by smothering the scale insects that are on the plant when it is sprayed. The treatment may have to be repeated after a week or two.

"
"
Test the spray on a leaf or two.,
Avoid windy days.,
Do not spray plants when the leaves are wet.,
Avoid using the oil on humid days.,
Avoid using the oil on certain plants.,
Wear protective glasses when using the oil.",How to Get Rid of Scale Insects4," Wait 24 to 36 hours to make sure the plants are not sensitive to horticultural oil. Some plants, like junipers, cedars and Japanese maples can be damaged by oil.


If there does not appear to be bleaching or yellowing on the test leaves, go ahead and spray the whole plant.

, Do not spray plants with horticultural oil when it is windy as the oil could drift to other plants that do not need to be sprayed and damage them.

, This is because the oil will not make good contact with the plant and could be washed off before it kills the scales.

, When the relative humidity is 90 percent or higher, horticultural oil should not be sprayed on plants because it will not evaporate quickly enough. If the temperature is over 100 °F (38 °C), the plant leaves could be damaged.


Alternatively, if the temperature is below 40 °F (4 °C) the oil will not cover uniformly, making it much less effective.

, The leaves on plants that are stressed or wilting from lack of water are more likely to be damaged when sprayed with horticultural oil. In addition:


Do not spray oil on young, new plant stems or leaves as it will likely damage them.
Plants that have been treated with sulfur for fungal diseases within the previous 30 days should not be treated with horticultural oil.The oil could cause a plant-damaging reaction when it comes in contact with the sulfur.

, Horticultural oil is not very toxic to people or animals but it can irritate the eyes and skin."

Mow the brambles in mid-summer during the flowering time.,
Burn the bramble patch each year.,
Cut the canes and treat each with a glyphosate herbicide.,
Spray large bramble infestations with a wide-coverage foliar herbicide.",How to Get Rid of Rampant Brambles," Use a mower or a tractor with a shredder attachment. This will remove the nutrient-rich stems and starve the roots. This will also eliminate berry production, which will reduce next year's seed bank.;
, Brambles are very sensitive to fire; however, this does not kill the roots. This method can also be used to reduce seed production.


Since brambles take 2 years to produce berries, the first year for cane growth and the second for berry production, use methods that eliminate each year's cane growth. This can help in to control brambles, but will not eradicate them.

, Place the glyphosate in a spray bottle or pump sprayer. As you cut each cane, spritz the remaining base plant with the herbicide. Dead canes do not need to be cut or treated. This is a time-consuming method, but one of the best available to combat brambles. With this method, a burn should be carried out to kill the seeds.


Wear protective clothing such as gloves, long pants, a long-sleeve shirt, and mask when spraying herbicides. Remove and wash clothing as soon as possible after spraying.

, These herbicides will kill the plants that the touch the spray, but often a repeat spray is required to reach the plants that were protected by the taller plants.

Smother the quackgrass.,
Solarize the grass.,
Use an herbicide.,
Dig it up.,
Suppress the grass with another crop.,
Maintain and manage the weed.",How to Get Rid of Quack Grass," Quackgrass can be nearly impossible to kill without affecting the neighboring plant life, but if you don’t mind small patches of grass being killed then this is a good method. Place dark plastic or tarp over the location of the quack grass patches (cut the plastic to fit) and use rocks to anchor the edges. This will block out the sunlight and rainwater, effectively killing off the quack grass over a 3-4 week period.;
, Instead of removing the sunlight from the grass, why not overheat the weed and kill it with too much sun? During the summer, place clear plastic over each patch of quackgrass, and anchor it with rocks or stakes. This will create a greenhouse effect under the plastic, and solarize the soil the grass is growing in. This will take several weeks to complete, but it should kill most of the grass., Unfortunately, there are no herbicides on the market that selectively kill just quackgrass (other than expensive professional products). Therefore, using an herbicide is guaranteed to kill your quackgrass, but it is also guaranteed to kill any other grass or plants around it. The only successful herbicide for this task is ‘Round-Up’, which is available at most garden stores and nurseries.


If you want to try to get a more selective quackgrass kill, use a paintbrush and paint the Round-Up onto the leaves of the quackgrass instead of spraying it.

, Quackgrass grows using a specific root-form called rhizomes which grow deep into the ground and are very hardy. As a result, it is nearly impossible to completely dig them out, but you can try with some minor success. Dig out the grass with the dirt surrounding it about 1 foot (0.3 m) deep and wide. Pull out any roots that you can see, but avoid breaking them off (as each could sprout a new patch of grass). Fill the hole with fresh topsoil, and cover with black plastic or thick mulch to prevent a new patch from coming back., If you’re not bothered by planting something other than grass to block out the quackgrass, then you can effectively suppress the weed by seeding a more vigorous green plant. Try planting a cover crop, such as buckwheat, which will quickly dominate the quackgrass and take up most of the soil space. When the cover crop flowers, you can till it into the soil and further suppress quackgrass growth.Keep growing cover crops for several seasons. Eventually, you will completely eliminate the quackgrass.

, If you’re not up for killing your lawn or putting a lot of time into eliminating your quackgrass, then don’t! You can effectively manage the quackgrass in your lawn by forcing it to blend in. Increase the amount of nitrogen fertilizer you use on your lawn to help with the health of your preferred grass. Mow it frequently as well to limit the appearance of the quackgrass."

Look for signs of grubs.,
Check for grubs.,
Decide if you need to treat.,
Use beneficial nematodes to get rid of any type of grub.,
Use spores for Japanese beetle grubs.,
Seed and fertilize your lawn in the fall.,
Let your lawn grow long.,
Don’t overwater.",How to Get Rid of Grubs1," One of the major signs of a grub infestation is irregularly shaped brown patches of dead grass, but that can be caused by a number of different factors as well. If you think you may have grubs, look for other signs as well, including:Holes in your lawn caused by birds and mammals digging in the grass to get to the grubs
Grass with no roots
A spongy feeling when you touch or walk on the lawn;
, When you do find evidence of grubs, the next step is to search your lawn to inspect for the larvae. To do this, find a small spade or shovel and go to one or two of the dead patches of grass.Dig up square-foot (30 cm by 30 cm) portions of lawn where the dead grass meets the green grass
Dig to a depth of about two inches (five cm)
Look for C-shaped bugs with legs on the inside of the body near the head
If you find these larvae, it means you have grubs

, Even if you find grubs in your lawn, it’s possible that you may not have to get rid of them, depending on how many there are. A few grubs aren't actually going to hurt your lawn or cause too much cosmetic damage, especially if your lawn is healthy.There is no need to take action to get rid of the grubs if you find fewer than five per square foot.
If you find more than five but fewer than 10 grubs per square foot, you'll only need to treat your lawn if your grass isn't healthy.
Regardless of the state of your lawn, you'll need to get rid of the grubs if you find more than 10 per square foot.

, The scientific name for these is Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, and they are microscopic, parasitic worms that invade grubs and release bacteria that kill them. It’s important to note, however, that this is a long-term method, and it can take the worms up to three years to fully control your grub problem.For the best results, apply the beneficial nematodes in the late afternoon, and water the lawn immediately after applying them.Because beneficial nematodes need to invade the bodies of grubs in order to propagate, you must choose between using this method or using a chemical pesticide.
These worms may be sold under the name Hb nematodes, and you can buy them through gardening stores, catalogues, and online.

, Bacillus popilliae is a bacterium that can be used to kill the larvae of Japanese beetles. Because it’s a spore, it comes in the form of a powder that you can sprinkle on your lawn to get rid of grubs. Like the worms, using Bacillus popilliae to get rid of grubs is a long-term solution, rather than a quick fix.


To use Bacillus popilliae, you can spray it onto your lawn with water, or sprinkle the dry powder onto your grass.
Like the beneficial nematodes, you'll have to choose between using Bacillus popilliae or chemical pesticides, because the spores won’t work without a grub population.A Japanese beetle grub can be distinguished from other grubs by the end of its body. Whereas most grub bodies end in a rounded stump, the Japanese beetle grub has a pointed end.

, Beetles don’t tend to lay eggs in grass that’s long and thick. By seeding and fertilizing your lawn, you can repair any damage the grubs have done and deter new beetles from laying more eggs.


In spring and fall, rake away dead grass from any brown patches. Water your lawn, then sprinkle new grass seed over any thin or dead areas.After reseeding, fertilize the lawn to help the dead patches regenerate and the new seeds to thrive.

, Because beetles don’t like long grass either for egg-laying, let your grass grow longer than you might otherwise once it starts to grow back.


Keep your grass about two inches long. Raise the blades on your lawnmower to increase the length that it will cut the grass., An easy way to prevent your lawn from becoming a breeding ground for grubs is by letting it dry out or watering it as little as possible. Beetle eggs will die without water, so starving them of it will kill the eggs before they even hatch into grubs.


Many grubs lay eggs in July, so it’s especially important to keep your lawn dry in July and August.Beetles will also avoid laying eggs in a dry lawn, so you should consider not watering your lawn in the last week of June as well.

Determine if a synthetic pesticide is necessary.,
Try a synthetic pesticide for all grubs.,
Apply a preventive insecticide for next year.",How to Get Rid of Grubs2," Synthetic pesticides can be quite strong, dangerous to apply, and damaging to the environment. To ensure it’s necessary to treat your lawn at all, first determine if you have grubs, and then decide if the problem is big enough to require treatment.


Look for indications that there are grubs in your lawn, such as holes, grass with no roots, browning patches, and patches that feel spongy.
To determine for sure if you have grubs, dig up a square-foot (30 cm by 30 cm) patch of grass to a depth of two inches (five cm) and look for grubs.
Don’t treat your lawn if there are fewer than five grubs, and avoid treating if your lawn is healthy and you find fewer than 10. If there are 10 or more grubs, treat your lawn.

, When you’ve gone through and determined for certain that you have grubs and need to treat, you can use a curative pesticide that will kill grubs almost immediately. The two types of curative pesticides you can use are carbaryl and trichlorfon (sold under the brand name Dylox).Water your lawn both before and after applying the pesticide to ensure that the chemical sinks in to the soil to where the grubs are.
Apply curative pesticides to your lawn in fall, spring, and before May.
You can find these types of pesticides in home and hardware stores.
Make sure you wear gloves, a protective mask, and other safety gear when applying pesticides.

, There is another type of pesticide that can help control grubs, and it’s a preventive pesticide that’s meant to kill upcoming generations. Typically, this type of pesticide is applied in June or July, after you’ve already sprayed with a curative pesticide.


To protect pollinators such as bees from the pesticide, mow your lawn to remove flowering weeds before applying the product.To stop your grass from burning, water your lawn thoroughly all summer after applying the insecticide.
Preventive pesticides include those sold under the brand names Merit and Mach 2.

Identify the poison ivy.,
Take protective measures.,
Dig up small plants.,
Cut down larger plants.,
Apply herbicide.,
Discard removed poison ivy plants.",How to Get Rid of Poison Ivy1," Poison ivy can take the form of an upright woody shrub, and trailing shrub, or a woody vine, but the leaves are always compound leaves consisting of three leaflets coming off the same stalk.Each leaflet is generally 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. The middle leaflet is usually slightly bigger than the other two.






The leaves have pointed tips and are often green and glossy, but some poison ivy plants have dull green leaves, instead.






Poison ivy plants can grow in a range of areas, but it is most commonly found along wooded trails, roadsides, and fenced rows.;
, Wear gloves as you work to prevent the plant from coming into contact with your skin. Wear long pants, long sleeves, socks, and shoes. Cover as much skin as possible.


Discard or wash the gloves after the plant has been removed. Also wash the clothes you wore. Thoroughly rinse the washing machine after washing your work clothes to avoid contaminating the rest of your laundry.







, New or small poison ivy shrubs can be dug up using a shovel. When removing the plant, remove all parts, including the entire root.


Note that poison ivy plants can grow from root sections, so the entire root must be removed in order to ensure that the plant will not return.






Removal is most effective when the soil is moist.

, If you cannot pull or dig out the root of a long vine or mature plant, use sturdy garden shears to cut the plant off at the base.Sever the plant as close to the ground or visible base as possible.
Keep up on the process. You may need to continually cut the plant down before you successfully starve it.
Thoroughly clean the shears after cutting the plant to wipe away the poisonous oil. Use soap and water or bleach diluted with water.

, Chemical herbicides can be applied to freshly cut poison ivy or to poison ivy plants that have not been cut.


To maximize effectiveness, apply a chemical herbicide immediately after you cut the plant down to the ground. Do not wait to do so since the plant may close the fresh ""wound,"" thereby eliminating your ability to access the plant's roots through the exposed portion.
Note that herbicides capable of killing poison ivy will also kill other plants. For this reason, it is important that you apply the chemical directly to the poison ivy plant. One of the best ways to do this is with a small foam paintbrush.
When possible, look for an herbicide that is specifically labeled for use against poison ivy. Chemicals commonly used against poison ivy include glyphosate, triclopyr, and amino triazole., Any plants or plant sections that have been removed should be wrapped in a plastic bag and thrown out.


Do not burn the poison ivy. When burned, poison ivy produces a dangerous smoke that can cause damage to your eyes, skin, or respiratory tract.

"
Use white vinegar.,
Apply a salt-and-soap treatment.,
Pour boiling water over the poison ivy.,
Plant grass.After removing or cutting down any poison ivy plants you notice in the area, scatter grass seed.",How to Get Rid of Poison Ivy2," Fill a spray bottle or garden sprayer with plain, undiluted white vinegar and apply directly to the poison ivy.As with chemical herbicides, vinegar can be applied to untrimmed leaves as well as cut stems.
Vinegar will take longer to work than most chemical herbicides, but as long as you are willing to put in the extra time, the treatment should work.

, Combine 3 lbs (1350 g) of salt, 1 gallon (4 liters) of water, and 1/4 cup (60 ml) liquid soap in a garden sprayer. Apply the concoction directly to the poison ivy.


Use the treatment primarily on uncut leaves. You can also use it on cut stems, however,
For an even stronger solution, add vinegar into the mix. Dissolve 1 cup (250 ml) of salt in 1 gallon (4 liters) of white vinegar over low heat. Once cool, stir in about 8 drops of liquid dish detergent and apply the solution to the poison ivy as a spray.

, Boil a kettle or pot of water and dump the hot liquid directly over the roots of the poison ivy plant.


This will need to be done on a daily basis, and it may take quite some time before the plant actually dies off.
The boiling water can be dumped on the base of the plant, but for best results, dig away some of the soil surrounding the base to expose a portion of the roots directly.
Note that even dead poison ivy plants have poisonous oils on them, so you should still take precaution when removing them.

, When grass grows, the roots choke out the roots of the poison ivy, making it difficult if not impossible for the plant to come back.


This treatment takes quite some time since the grass needs an adequate amount of time to grow. In the meantime, you should keep up on removing or cutting down poison ivy plants you see.

Wash the area immediately.,
Use a cool compress.,
Apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream.,
Try taking an antihistamine.,
Call your doctor, if necessary.,
Wash all tools and clothing thoroughly.",How to Get Rid of Poison Ivy3," Within 15 minutes of coming into contact with poison ivy, wash the affected area of skin with warm water and mild soap.The plant oil enters the skin quickly, so you should wash the area as quickly as possible to reduce the severity of the rash.
Use a brush to scrub under the fingernails. Otherwise, plant oil trapped under your nails can spread to other parts of your body.
Remove any clothing that came into contact with the poison ivy plant. Change into fresh clothes after washing the area.
If you suspect that your pet came into contact with the plant, you should immediately bathe the animal to remove poison ivy oil from its fur.

, The rash can cause discomfort and sweating, but sweat and body heat can make the itching worse. Apply a cool compress to soothe the itching and keep yourself cool.


You should also wear loose, light clothing to prevent yourself from becoming too warm.

, Gently rub a thin layer of either product over the poison ivy rash as needed.


Calamine lotion and hydrocortisone cream can both reduce itching and blistering.
Follow the label instructions concerning how much to apply and how often.

, An over-the-counter antihistamine medication may be used if lotions and creams are unable to soothe or stop the itching.


The itchy rash produced after coming into contact with poison ivy is actually the result of an allergic reaction that most people have to the poison ivy plant. Antihistamines are used to treat allergies, so they often have an effect against allergy-related rashes like this.
Always follow the instructions on the label of the antihistamine concerning dosage.

, If the rash is especially bad and does not respond to home remedies, contact your health care provider.


In severe cases, a doctor will usually prescribe steroids. These may be administered by injection or in capsule form.

, Any clothing worn when you came into contact with the poison ivy must be washed to prevent the oil from spreading. Likewise, all tools used when treating yourself for a poison ivy rash must also be washed.


Wash clothes in hot water and detergent. Thoroughly rinse the washing machine when done.
Wash tools in a diluted bleach solution or with rubbing alcohol.

Bathe in lukewarm water, and do so at least once per day for the duration of the rash.
You could also try a soak with aluminum acetate. Products containing aluminum acetate can also be purchased at most drugstores.

, Combine 3 tsp (15 ml) of baking soda with 1 tsp (5 ml) of water and mix until a paste forms. Apply this paste to infected areas.Baking soda is a natural remedy against itching associated with poison ivy.
You can also take a baking soda bath to relieve itching caused by large poison ivy rashes. Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) of baking soda into a bathtub of warm water and soak in the bath until the water begins to cool.

, Witch hazel extract, available as splashes and balms, can be applied directly to the rash.


This is an astringent product that tightens the skin, thereby relieving the itchiness of the rash and cooling it down.
The product is natural and made from the bark of the witch hazel tree.

, Aloe vera gels and lotions should be applied directly to the affected skin.


Aloe vera products are made from the inner part of the aloe vera plant.
Compounds in this plant relieve itching and can accelerate healing.

, Apply a thin coat of tea tree oil directly to the poison ivy rash, rubbing it into the skin until the oil nearly vanishes.


Tea tree oil is a natural anti-inflammatory. Applying it reduces the redness and swelling of the rash.
The oil is a product of the Australian tea tree.

, If you are near the ocean, stand in the water and gently rub some of the ocean sand over your poison ivy blisters. Once the blisters break, allow the ocean water to pass over the wounds.


This treatment dries up the poison ivy remarkably fast, and rashes may clear up within one or two days.
Note that you must use natural ocean water. Do not use water from a fresh water source, like a lake, and do not attempt to mimic the effect of ocean water by combining water and salt.

Remember to inspect bushes, pipes, or sidewalk edges as ants like to build their nests near structures.

, You can use over-the-counter insecticides, or, for more severe cases, buy products from a professional.

, You can also use a granular insecticide that can be applied with water. While these insecticides kill the ants that are underground, you need to apply one to two gallons of insecticide to each mound to kill the entire colony.


Make sure that you wear gloves to prevent chemical burns.
Follow directions on the insecticide labels. If you don’t use enough water, you will not exterminate the ants; they will just relocate.

, Apply baits to the ground when no rain is expected for the next 24 hours.


Apply baits when the worker ants are searching for food. To determine when they are searching for food, leave a piece of food by the mound. If you observe ants around the food within 10-30 minutes, begin applying the bait.

Understand the basics of this weed.,
Mow the weed out.,
Dig the weed out.,
Cut them down.,
Spot spray or wipe.",How to Get Rid of Onion Weed," It is highly invasive and multiplies through the division of bulbs and also by seed. This makes it a rapid grower and difficult to shift once it has taken hold.;
, Be relentless and continue to mow over the weed. Eventually this exhausts the bulbs and they die off. You have to be consistent, regular and determined with the mowing, however.

, Often onion weed perches where no lawnmower will ever manage to go. This requires the determined gardener to wield the shovel and go and dig the weeds out. This is no mean feat and should be done by the fit only. Get a helper if that isn't you. Unfortunately, digging can often disturb the bulbs and lose some of them back to the soil in the process, to regrow next season. Don't lose heart; keep at it.

, If you can't mow them, and digging is just too tiring for you, try cutting them. Use long shears and continue to lop them off, time and time again. As with the lawnmowing, eventually this will exhaust the bulbs and they'll give up.

, Ask your local garden centre for a suitable spray or wipe-on weed killer and use strictly in accordance with the instructions. A lot of gardeners do not like resorting to spraying or using chemical solutions, and with good reason. If you do resort to this solution, ask for a spray or wipe-on weed killer that does not impact human health, can be spot sprayed directly on the weed rather than around on other plants (wipe-on's already do this by definition) and is short-lived so that its effects are very controlled.

Likewise, if you are setting a snail trap, you should water the garden to encourage them to be active and take the bait.;
, This is where snails hide during the day and lay eggs.

, Place them around the base of plants that snails like to chew. The snails have difficulty sliding over the rough edges of the shells.Garden snails particularly like beans, cabbage, basil, delphinium, hosta, dahlia, lettuce, strawberries and marigolds.

, These include geraniums, impatiens, ornamental grasses, sage, rosemary, lavender, begonias, California poppies, fuchsias and lantana., You can even place a copper collar around plants that are planted in the soil. Snails can’t climb up a thick copper collar.


You can buy copper bands at garden shops, but make sure it is at least six to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) wide.

, Coffee grounds will dry out the soil and snails don't like travelling on dry ground.

, Snails will eat the pellets and therefore die from poisoning, just be aware that these are poisonous to wildlife and your pets as well.

, Snails have difficulty travelling across sand/bark and tend not to try unless they are desperate.

, Salt is highly dangerous to snails and can kill them but it isn't a good idea to scatter it near plants or on a place where you are going to grow some plants.

, Birds, toads and even some types of snakes will feed on snails (mostly birds).

, A great, natural solution to get rid of not only snails but other creatures as well.

Keep your houseplants hydrated.,
Remove dust from your houseplants once per week.,
Create a humid environment for your houseplants.,
Shade your houseplants from direct sunlight and hot temperatures.,
Place predatory mites on your houseplants.",How to Prevent Spider Mites on Houseplants," Watering your houseplants as needed on a regular basis will prevent spider mite infestation, since spider mites only thrive on houseplants that are dry.


Use cold water instead of lukewarm water to water your houseplants. Spider mites will not infest your plants if the temperature is too cold.;
, This will prevent spider mites from nesting and laying eggs on the dry, dusty leaves; in addition to providing an environment in which existing predator mites can feed on spider mites.


Depending on the indoor climate and environment in which your houseplants reside, you may need to remove dust as needed, which can be once every few days or once every 2 weeks.
Dust your houseplants by spraying them with powerful jets of water or use a damp, wet cloth to dust each leaf separately. The method you use may vary depending on the size of your houseplants or where they are located inside your home.
Place your houseplants in a large sink, bathtub, shower, or outside next to a garden hose.
Use a powerful jet hose or spray nozzle to spray water on the leaves of your houseplants to remove all the dust.
Spray and dust on the undersides of leaves, where spider mites will thrive more often to escape direct sunlight.
If you decide to dust your houseplants with a soft, damp cloth, wipe down each side of each leaf on every houseplant.

,


Mist your houseplants using a spray bottle of cold water between 2 and 3 times per day.
If your houseplants reside in pots that sit atop platters or dishes, fill each platter with water to provide extra humidity.

, Excessive exposure to heat may dry the leaves of your plant and attract spider mites.


Draw the curtains or close the shades near your plants during the hottest hours of the day and when they are exposed to direct sunlight.
If your indoor environment does not allow you to provide shade for your houseplants, you can place a humidifier next to any houseplants at risk for spider mites.

, Certain types of predatory mites will prey and feed on spider mites without harming your plants.


There are several species of predatory mites you can choose from; however, the most common types of predatory mites are Metaseiulus occidentalis, Phytoseiulus persimilis, and Phytoseiulus longpipes.
To prevent Metaseiulus occidentalis from dying, you must make sure that the temperature in which your houseplants reside averages between 44 degrees and 89 degrees Fahrenheit (6.66 degrees and 31.66 degrees Celsius).
Purchase predatory mites from gardening vendors on the Internet or order them by mail from a horticultural website.
If you do not have Internet access, you may visit your local nursery or gardening store for assistance or recommendations for ordering predatory mites.

Decide on the type of plants to grow.,
Choose a potting soil with plenty of nutrients and compost.",How to Prepare an Indoor Garden," It should be the room that receives the greatest sunlight as well as have a good strong floor. Try to locate the garden close to a water source.;
, Many websites have downloadable and/or printable design templates available if you need a reference.

,

Clay pots are a popular choice, but can leak. If you choose to use clay as your planter option, be sure that you place plastic sheeting on the floor and observe the water leakage carefully.






Terracotta pots can have a tendency to dry out quickly, so water must be added frequently.






Glazed ceramics or redwood pots are a good choice and come in a variety of sizes.







, Consult your local extension office, online sites and local residents for specifics on your area.

When choosing vegetable plants, take into consideration the amount of space you have. Using an online or printed design can especially help in this area. Consider how much space you have and what type of vegetables you wish to plant.






Tomato plants can easily be grown inside in large pots, with two or three to a pot. Remember that they grow quite tall and will probably need support such as stakes or cones.






Beans are always a good staple, but it is best to choose bush rather than pole when space is an issue. Onions can also easily be grown indoors, but you may want to consider the scent!







, The organic types are generally best.

Find out what kind of plant it is.,
Check the sun or shade you need.,
Check the water you need, according to the type of plant.,
Check the leaves for insect pests.,
Check if the pot is big enough for the plant.,
Perform plant surgery in serious cases.,
Groom plants by cutting or pulling off damaged parts.,
Pay attention to the plant.,
Keep animals away from the plants.",How to Nurse a Potted Plant Back to Health," Miniature roses are very different from cacti or succulents. A little palm tree is not the same as African Violets. Some plants are very picky about where and how they live. Check a garden book or take the plant to a local nursery if you want to positively identify it. Then you know what conditions it needs.;
, Most indoor plants want lots of (indirect) sunlight, though a few burn in direct sun. See where your plant is living. It's likely too dark. Move it near a window but don't let it sit for hours in direct sun unless it's a cactus or succulent. If the plant looks thin, scraggly, with pale leaves, it probably needs more sun. Outdoors, move the pots around to a shadier or sunnier spot.

, Your plant could be dry or drowning in its pot. Cactus need very little water, but ferns need a lot.


Feel the soil. If it's hard and dry, it needs more water. Move it out of the direct or all-day sun and water it daily until the soil feels damp whenever you touch it.
However, many pots don't have enough drainage (a small hole at the bottom to let out extra water) and they may be drowning as you water them and they can't dry out a little. Feel the soil; if it's muddy, it's too wet. Tip the pot over and punch a hole in the clay or plastic. Place it in a window or breezeway to dry it out.

, Turn over the leaf. Can you see tiny moving insects? or little white or black spots? For indoor plants, take the whole plant and wash it in a sink or tub gently with warm water. Be sure to drain the soil well afterwards (hole in the bottom, in sun or breeze). For outdoor plants, wash it gently in a light hose spray , spray can, or watering can.

, Plants grow up and they need more room, like the kids! If you see roots growing out of the bottom drainage hole, it needs more room. If the plant covers the entire surface of the soil, and spills over the edge, it might also need more room. A few plants like to be ""root bound"" and squeezed in, but most want space.

, Indoor plants may need to be transplanted to get rid of dry or wet soil, or give the plant more room.


Get a new clay or other pot and wash it. Make sure there's a hole in the bottom.
Add some good potting or other garden soil, and scoop out a hole in the middle for your plant. Make sure there's enough room around and under it, so it won't touch the pot.
Pull the plant out of the old pot, or break the pot if necessary. Try to get the roots without tearing or breaking them. Use your fingers and gently dis-entangle them.
Move the plant and roots that you can get into the new pot's soil, and cover the roots with fresh dirt. Pack the dirt around and push down gently to secure the plant firmly in the new soil.
Water the transplanted plant thoroughly until water comes out the bottom and then let it rest for several days before touching it again. Let the soil dry out a little.

, Take a scissors or clippers and snip off old flowers, dead leaves, rotten stalks until you have healthy stems showing. This may feel radical but your plant is in trouble. Get rid of anything dead, shriveled, yellow, mushy, or diseased. Hopefully you have intact roots, and a major stem or two to begin growing again. It may take months for the plant to return.

,


Watch the amount of light it gets throughout the day. Does it get burned in the late afternoon sun? Does it never get any sun at all? Check your house and patio for optimal places.
Check the watering schedule. For automatic drip systems, check the minutes per day per plant. Adjust as needed. If watering by hand, maybe measure the amount of water carefully and add or decrease as needed.

, Cats, dogs, rabbits, deer, can all destroy your plants. Plants can also be poisonous to some animals.


Keep indoor pets away by placing plants out of reach or otherwise erecting barriers.
Keep outdoor animals or pets away with fences, wire mesh covers or mulch around the soil. Deer and rabbits can destroy a plant in one night. Move the plant to a safe location and begin emergency care to encourage re-growth. Push roots back down, give some fertilizer, cut away damaged foliage, and wait for the roots to take hold again.

Wait for the early spring or fall.,
Pick an area that receives full sunlight.,
Choose an area with well-drained soil.,
Avoid nearby plants.,
Dig out a shallow hole.,
Form a dirt mound in the center of the hole.,
Fan out the roots and angle them downwards.,
Bury the bulb.,
Plant extra bulbs about three feet (91 cm) apart.,
Fertilize a growing plant.,
Water the plant sparingly.,
Add dry mulch in autumn.,
Cover the plant with fleece or cloches before spring.",How to Plant Eremurus," Eremurus bulbs are usually available for purchase in spring and summer. Wait until the beginning of spring and fall to buy them. Spring is the plant’s above-ground growing season, but in fall, the bulb will settle in and expand underground., Eremurus will survive in partial shade but does best in a full day of sun. Look around your planting area for spots out in the open. Keep the bulb away from structures and tall plants that provide competition for sunlight exposure., Eremurus plants also benefit from minimal water. One way to check your planting area is to look at it after a hard rain. Avoid any spots where puddles remain after six hours. Find a spot without standing water and make sure the soil doesn’t stay soggy.You can amend soil by mixing in an organic mulch such as bark or compost. Adding the mulch will raise the area a little, leading to better drainage.

, Eremurus prospers when it doesn’t have much competition. Other plants, besides providing resource competition, disturb its brittle roots. Select a clear area to maximize the plant’s chances of success.Only low-growing plants that come up late in spring can come near eremurus. Examples include white wood aster, Lamb’s Ear, Chinese silver grass, and nasturtiums.

, Once you’ve selected a location for the eremurus bulb, get your spade. Because eremurus grows along the surface, the hole should only be six inches (15 cm) deep. Continue digging to make the hole 15 inches (38 cm) wide., In the center of the hole, pile up loose dirt. Make the mound high enough so that the crown of the bulb will be right below the surface of the soil. You may also use coarse sand for your mound, which will improve water drainage.Find sand at home improvement stores and garden centers.

, If your eremurus bulb has tangled roots, separate them. The roots are very brittle, so pry them apart carefully. Point the ends slightly downward towards the dirt., Lay the eremurus in the hole on top of the mound of dirt. Fill in the hole with about four to six inches (10-15 cm) of dirt. The plant’s crown should be the closest point to the surface and will rest right underneath it., Eremurus plants grow best when undisturbed by other plants. At the very minimum, make sure they are at least a foot (30 cm) apart. More space will ensure the plants don’t damage one another., Once you notice the plant beginning to sprout, add fertilizer to help it grow. Use a high potassium fertilizer such as potassium sulfate or sulphate of potash. General fertilizers can also be used to help reinvigorate plants after a frost early in the spring. Spread the fertilizer around the plant’s crown once a month., Because eremurus thrives in environments with minimal water, you probably won’t have to water it at all. The only time would be when the plant starts growing leaves in the spring. If the plant looks like it is drying out, you can try giving it a light sprinkle of water. After the plant flowers, the leaves will die and the plant will go dormant in summer., Before winter, spread mulch around the crown of the plant. Choose a dried mulch like bark or straw. You can place down nutrient-rich compost first and layer the mulch over it. Don’t cover the plant’s crown. The mulch will help resist the winter cold without causing the eremurus to absorb moisture., Because eremurus sprouts in the beginning of spring, it can be damaged by lingering frost. Right before spring begins, roll out garden fleece over the eremurus or cover the bulb’s crown with a cloth. Either of these products from a gardening center will provide the plant with sunlight while resisting the cold weather.Cloches are clear, bell-shaped jars and function like small greenhouses, creating a warm environment for the eremurus growth.

Keep all houseplant pots in an impermeable saucer.,
Do not overfill your houseplant pots.,
Clean up soil spills immediately.,
Grow your houseplants in sturdy pots.,
Avoid using slender plant stands to support your houseplants.,
Grow plants that do not require soil.,
Use plastic pots rather than ceramic or clay pots.",How to Prevent Houseplants From Damaging the Carpet," The most effective step you can take to prevent carpet damage is to place all pots onto a dish or saucer. Plant pots are designed to let excess moisture slowly drip out of the drainage hole at the bottom of the pot, which poses a risk to carpet and other surfaces. Allowing this water to collect on a glazed plate or dish and then evaporate into the air will protect your carpet from water damage.;
, Filling your pots to the brim with potting mix creates a risk that the excess soil will be spilled over the top when the pot is repositioned or even nudged. Instead, leave about an inch (25 mm) of space between the soil and the rim of large pots.

, If you do spill potting mix onto your carpet, you'll want to vacuum it up as soon as possible. The real risk of carpet damage occurs when the soil is ground into the carpet underfoot and allowed to penetrate for a long period. This can lead to staining and water damage.

, Any large plants that will be placed directly onto the floor should be grown in stable pots. Wide, shallow pots are less prone to tipping than taller, narrower pots, and so should be preferred when attempting to minimize carpet damage.

, If pets and children overturning your houseplants is a concern, then avoid placing pots on tall, slender plant stands. If you support your plants on a stand, use a large, multi-pot stand that is less prone to tipping and spilling soil on your carpet.

, If you cannot seem to keep potting soil from getting into your carpet, you can opt for houseplants that can be grown without soil. Air plants can be grown in nothing at all, while plants like lucky bamboo can be grown in water alone. Some cacti and succulents can be grown in gravel alone, which is much easier to remove from carpet than soil.

, If a clay pot is overturned, it is very likely to break and spill all of its soil onto your carpet (along with the broken shards of the pot). Using pots made from plastic, bamboo, or other unbreakable materials will help keep carpet damage to a minimum if pots are tipped over.

Obtain fresh seed pods from an active plant.,
When seed pods appear on an adult plant, wrap the pods with wire or twine.,
Remove the pods from the plant once they mature.,
Set the seed pods out on a flat surface.,
Remove the ties from the pod and gently crack it open with your thumbnail.",How to Plant Desert Rose Seeds1," Fresh seeds are likely to produce, but dried seeds have a low success rate.


Alternatively, you can obtain fresh seeds from a garden supply store or other reputable dealer.;
, If the seed pods open, the seeds will disperse, and you will not be able to use them to grow a new plant.

, They must be allowed to mature before removal; otherwise, the seeds may not be developed enough to grow. When the seed pods try to open, they are mature and ready for removal. Clip them off with a sharp knife or pair of scissors.

, Allow them to dry.

, Each pod should contain multiple ""feathery"" seeds.

Prepare a plastic seedling tray or small pots.,
Fill your containers with well-draining growing medium.,
Scatter the seeds over the growing medium.,
Cover the seeds with soil.,
Fill a wide tray or bin with stones and water.,
Sit the seedling tray on top of the stones.,
Spray the soil with water from above once every three days.,
Place the entire structure over a heating pad set to low.,
Cease above-soil watering once the seeds germinate into seedlings.,
Transplant the seedlings into more permanent containers.",How to Plant Desert Rose Seeds2," If the containers you use do not have drainage holes, you should poke one hole into the bottom of the container before proceeding. In the case of plastic seedling trays, this can be done by poking the tip of a pen or large needle into the bottom of each compartment. The hole does not need to be large.

, Vermiculite works well, as does a mix of soil and sand or soil and perlite.

, If using seedling trays or containers with a diameter of four inches (ten centimeters) or less, only plant one seed per compartment. If using a larger pot, spread several seeds evenly over the soil.

, Only use enough soil to just barely cover the seeds, preventing them from blowing away. The seeds should not be buried deeply.

, The stones should completely cover the bottom of the tray, and the water should not rise above the level of the stones.

, Refresh the water daily to provide the seeds with sufficient water from below.

, Use a spray bottle until the surface of the soil feels moist to the touch.

, During germination, the soil and its seeds should be kept at a temperature between the range of 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (27 to 29 degrees Celsius). Periodically test the soil with a thermometer to monitor the temperature accurately.

, This should occur within the first week or two. You should still water the seedlings from below for the first month.

, Each seedling should have about six “true leaves” at the time of transplant.

"
Select a medium-sized pot or container with one or more drainage holes.,
Fill the pot with well-draining potting mix.,
Mix a handful of slow-release fertilizer into the potting mix.,
Dig a small hole in the middle of the soil.,
Gently remove the seedling from its present container.,
Place the seedling into the hole and pack the soil around it.",How to Plant Desert Rose Seeds3," The pot should be between six and eight inches (15 to 20 centimeters) in diameter. Desert roses do not mind being somewhat root-bound; in fact, they often grow better this way. You will need to re-pot the plant as it grows bigger, however.


Unglazed ceramic pots work best since the soil can dry out in between waterings.
If using a clay pot, select one that is a little wider than necessary to provide the roots with extra room for expansion. Clay is more likely to crack with the pressure of expanding roots.

, A mix made of equal parts sharp sand and cactus potting soil works notably well. Avoid heavy soils that do not drain well, since desert roses prefer somewhat dry roots and can rot quickly if kept saturated.


Sharp sand, also called silica sand or builder's sand, has sharp, jagged edges and looks similar to small-grain aquarium gravel. It is often used to prepare concrete, and you can usually find it in a home improvement store.

, Check the instructions provided on the label of the fertilizer for more precise measurements.

, The hole should be the same depth as the container currently holding the seedling.

, If being grown inside a thin plastic seedling tray, lightly squeeze the sides of the compartment until the seedling breaks free, soil and all.

, The seedling should be firmly fixed in place.

"
Place the pot in full sun.,
Consider artificial lighting if you cannot provide adequate sunlight.,
Water the desert rose regularly.,
Keep your plants warm.,
Feed your desert rose with frequent applications of a liquid fertilizer until it flowers.,
Continue to feed your desert rose with ample amounts of fertilizer even after flowering.",How to Plant Desert Rose Seeds4," A south-facing window that receives plenty of direct sunlight is ideal, and your desert rose should receive at least eight hours of sun per day.

, Place your plants six inches (15 centimeters) below fluorescent grow lights, and allow them to soak in 12 hours of light per day.

, Allow the soil to dry out in between waterings and only add water once the top inch or two (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of soil feels dry to the touch. Water lightly when necessary, making the soil moist without saturating it.

, Ideal daytime temperature ranges between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius), with night temperatures dropping by as much as 15 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius). Never allow the soil to drop below a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). At this temperature, the plant could suffer severe damage or even death.

, Use a 20-20-20 fertilizer, diluted to half strength. A 20-20-20 fertilizer has completely balanced levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen encourages the growth of foliage, phosphorus mainly helps with root development, and potassium maintains the flowers that bud. If the fertilizer contains a higher percentage of any one element, your desert rose may develop poorly.

,


Give your desert rose a water-soluble liquid fertilizer every other week during the spring.
By summer, switch to a single application of slow-release palm fertilizer.
Feed your plant with another application of slow-release fertilizer during the early fall.
Give the flower a few doses of liquid fertilizer during the winter, as long as you manage to keep the temperature of the soil at or above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius).
After three years, when the plant matures, stop giving the desert rose liquid fertilizer. It can still benefit from slow-release fertilizer, however.

Jasmine and lavender are great ideas for the bedroom, as the scent of these plants can promote restful sleep and reduce anxiety levels.
Aloe vera and snake plant both help purify the air, which can be helpful for locations in the home that the whole family frequents, or rooms that are subject to a variety of smells and chemicals, such as the living room, bathroom, or kitchen.Positioning houseplants largely involves compromising between ideal locations for the plants' needs, and your desired locations based on aesthetics. Inhospitable locations can still be utilized by selecting very hardy species of houseplants.;
, Choose a container that satisfies your aesthetic desire for the plant, as well as the needs of the plant. There are a variety of containers available for your plants, from simple ceramic pots to troughs.


Wall mounted or hanging baskets are perfect for taking advantage of vertical space, especially if you have a plant that can grow to great lengths or hang, such as grape ivy or hindu rope plants.
Boxes or troughs can be used if you have a collection of plants that visually complement one another and have similar watering and lighting needs.
Even old tin cans can be used, giving a home-grown, DIY look to your plants., Your house has a theme, whether you recognize it or not, and there are a variety of plant types that can complement this theme. The color of the plant and its flowers, for example, can help round out the existing color of the room, or the smells of the plant itself can complete the ambiance.


Common themes for homes include Victorian, American Country, and Casual Easy Living. A certain plant may find itself more at home in one type of home than another (a rose in a Victorian home, or a sunflower in a casual home, for example)., Use all of the room available to you when furnishing rooms with plants. One tiny plant in a large space will not greatly change the mood of the room. The plant will just look out of place!


Larger plants with large leaves, such as dracaenas or philodendron, can fill up a large, sparsely furnished room.
In smaller rooms, large plants appear to crowd. Instead, choose a smaller plant that has larger, visible leaves, such as the aralia or anthurium., Designing a houseplant setup takes time, and your setup will need to be adjusted as you progress. Perhaps you will notice a plant thriving in a location that you assumed would be inhospitable, or perhaps there is a certain location in which you cannot seem to keep anything alive. Use these experiences to reorganize your houseplant setup to keep your plants alive and well.


If you have trouble keeping your plants alive, try raising a few sturdier plants. Succulents are incredibly hardy and nearly impossible to kill. Cacti can thrive without needing very much water.
Some plants, such as the English ivy or ZZ plant, are very adaptable, and able to make do with a variety of lighting situations., Place your plant near a window that provides the amount of light they need to survive. Not all plants require the same amount of light, and some will need different types of light, such as indirect or direct.


Plants that require low light, such as the kentia palm or Peace Lily, should be placed near north-facing windows.
Plants requiring medium or indirect light, such as the aralia or begonia, should be placed near west- or south-facing windows. Keep them 1 to 2 feet from the window itself.Plants requiring bright or direct light, such as the amaryllis or episcia, can be placed directly on the windowsill of windows facing south or west., Many plants require a reasonably humid environment, or at least one that is not terribly dry, such as ferns. Some areas in the house will be drier or more humid than others. This will dry the plants' leaves and soil out.


For example, a windowsill just above a baseboard heater will tend to be drier than other windowsills in the home.
Homes with central heating tend to be especially dry during fall and winter.
Purchasing a humidifier can help provide moisture to your plants., This helps spread moisture among plants. Moisture released by one plant will be picked up by another! Remember that plants still need good air circulation to prevent disease.


Avoid placing your plants too close together. Their leaves and vines may get tangled, and this can reduce the air circulation each plant receives.
Leaves that touch between two plants may also allow insects to easily move from one plant to another.

, Don’t place your plants in areas where the temperature will swing throughout the day. Most plants prefer a constant temperature of between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, though there are some exceptions.


Plants that prefer cooler temperatures (between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit) include plants such as the Tulip, Azalea, and Primrose.
Plants that prefer hotter temperatures (between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit) include plants such as the caladium, bromeliad, and geranium.Windowsills can become drafty during the colder months of the year. During this time, pull any plants you have resting there away from the window by a few inches.
Similar draft problems can occur for plants that are located near entrances to the home. Keep plants closer to the interior of the house to avoid exposing your plants to this kind of draft., Plants have several requirements for healthy growing, with the specifics of these requirements differing from plant to plant. Ask your florist for an information card or sheet detailing the exact requirements of your plants so that you can place and treat them appropriately.


Light requirements for some plants can be supplemented with artificial lights, such as fluorescent lights.
Signs that your plant may be receiving too much light include brown patches on leaves, leaves that look faded or washed out, or the plant wilts at midday., Make sure your plants get the amount of water they need to survive. This amount will increase or decrease based on the overall temperature and exposure to sunlight the plant receives. Take care not to overwater your plants – this is just as damaging as not giving them enough water.


Plants that are receiving too much water will appear wilted, have yellowing or browning leaves, and may begin to grow algae in the soil.To test whether your plant is dry, dip your finger one inch into the soil. If the soil up to this point is dry, add water.
Make sure to keep your plant container drainage holes unblocked. Remove excess water from the drainage saucer to avoid overwatering., Fertilizer provides nutrients your plants need that they may not receive in an indoor setting, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Read the labels of your plant to understand what fertilizer mixtures work best for the health of the plant.


Fertilizer mixtures will be labeled in accordance to the percentages of nutrients they contain.
Give new or re-potted plants a few months to adjust to their environment before fertilizing., Remove any insects you see feasting on your plants. Prolonged infestation will damage your plant, sometimes irreparably.


Many types of insects can be removed or controlled through non-chemical means. Simply washing your plant with a cloth dipped in a detergent solution (1/2 teaspoon per quart of water), can remove aphids, mites and other small insects from leaves.
Larger insects, such as caterpillars or millipedes, can be removed by hand.
Indoor insecticides may be used if you continue to have problems, but be very careful when doing so. Spray in an open, well-ventilated area, and make sure no pets have access to the plant, which could now harm them if they decide to have a taste.For instance, you may want to use houseplants to liven up a dark, windowless bathroom. Or, your favored window may face north and be covered in shade from neighboring buildings or plants.

Increase the relative humidity in your home during winter months, when indoor air becomes very dry.",How to Overwinter Indoor Plants," Don't expose plants to radiators, space heaters, hot air vents, open doors, or cold drafts. Don't let foliage touch frigid window panes.;
, You should water the majority of houseplants when the dirt is barely damp or nearly dry to touch. There are a few exceptions to this rule, however.


Wait until the dirt is totally dry before watering cacti and succulents.
Water ferns frequently because they like soil that is evenly damp.

, If you choose to feed as part of winter plant care, cut the fertilizer's strength by at least 50 percent. Resume normal feeding in the spring when the plants show new growth.

, They can be repotted when new growth appears in spring.

, Plants receive less sunlight during winter months when the days are shorter and the sun is less intense.


Place plants between 6 inches (15 cm) to 15 inches (38 cm) beneath the fluorescent tubing. Turn the lights on for up to 16 hours per day.
Rotate overwintering houseplants on a regular schedule when using fluorescent lights. The light tends to be weaker at the ends of fluorescent tubing.

, Cleaning leaves as part of winter plant care will also improve appearance and control bugs.


Gently wash the leaves of large-leaved plants with a sponge or cloth dampened with water. Place your hand beneath the leaf for support while you wipe the upper side clean.
Dust off hairy-leaved plants, such as African violets, with a dry cotton swab or watercolor paint brush.
Set potted plants in the shower and turn on the spray for a gentle cleansing. Use lukewarm water.

, There are numerous ways to raise air moisture for indoor plants during winter.


Put a cool vaporizer inside rooms with plants.
Place potted plants on a tray filled with wet pebbles or gravel. Don't let the bottoms of the pots stand below water.
Huddle indoor plants together in one area. This raises the humidity in the immediate vicinity of these houseplants because water evaporates from the dirt and moisture escapes via the foliage.
Set water-filled pans near heat registers.
Take overwintering plants into the bathroom when you take a shower so the plants can soak up some steam.

Check for poorly defined green shoots, yellowing older leaves and premature leaf drop.,
Look for spindly growth and dropping leaves that turn red or purple.,
Spot yellow or whitish new leaf growth, with green veins.,
If you have blue-green foliage tinting and the tips or edges of the leaves are withered, this indicates that there is a potassium and phosphorous lack.,
Consider repotting a neglected plant to give it fresh soil and a new start.

",How to Identify Deficiencies in Container Plants," If these are present, this indicates that the pot plant has magnesium deficiency. Remedy by spraying a mixture of water and some dissolved Epsom salts to the soil and on the plant's leaves. Try to spray under the leaves for better absorption.;
, This indicates a nitrogen deficiency and is easily remedied with the application of any general fertiliser.

, This is a clear indication that the plant is suffering from iron deficiency. Add compost and manure to lower the pH level in the pot soil. Spray the leaves with iron chelates.

, Fruits will also not form well under these conditions. Add potash to the soil to improve the potassium content, as well as a general fertiliser.

Utilize as much natural light as possible.,
Familiarize yourself with the aspects of lighting that are relevant to plant growth.,
Browse for different types of grow lights.,
Position your plants and set up your lighting.",How to Light Up an Indoor Garden," Designing a lighting scheme for indoor plants begins with acknowledging a simple truth: plants will never respond to electric light as well as sunlight. If you have a windowsill or covered porch that gets a lot of natural light, position your garden there. Even diffused sunlight can produce much better results than wholly artificial light.;
, Before buying lights and setting up your indoor garden, you'll want to consider just what type of light is needed. Plants respond to 3 different aspects of light: color, intensity, and duration.


The color of light is determined by the wavelength of the light waves. Sunlight contains the full visible spectrum of light, and plants respond to each of these colors. However, red and blue light are the most important for plant growth. Lights marketed as grow lights will typically be predominantly red and blue.
The intensity of light needed will vary between plants. Succulents, cacti, and other plants originating in arid regions typically require a large amount of light. Rainforest understory plants like pothos and philodendron prefer lower amounts of light.
The duration of the light is also important. Plants do not like to be exposed to light for 24 hours every day. In fact, plants can be classed as either short-day or long-day varieties, which prefer 8-10 hours or 14-18 hours of daily light respectively.

, Grow lights can be purchased from nurseries, home improvement stores, some lighting stores, and some specialty online retailers. While plants will benefit a little from any type of electric light, it is important to consider a few different features of grow lights when planning your indoor garden.


Fluorescent tube lamps are the standard choice for lighting indoor plants. Full-spectrum bulbs are the best, and will often be packaged as ""grow lights."" Bulbs marked as ""cool white"" will have a preponderance of blue wavelengths, while ""warm white"" bulbs will have more red wavelengths. In general, blue light boosts leaf growth, and red light aids in flowering and fruiting.
Newer LED lamps can provide the same spectrum and intensity of light as fluorescent lamps while using much less energy. LED bulbs also last much longer. Look for LED lights specifically packaged as grow lights.

, Once you have purchased your lighting, you can set up your indoor garden. Use a mix of natural and electric light if possible, and be careful to position plants that prefer full sunlight closest to the grow lights. You may want to rotate plants through different positions regularly to ensure each is getting adequate light.

Select some pots.,
Find a good potting mix.,
Decide which plants you would like to place in your pots.,
Place soil in the pots.,
Put the plant or flower into the pot, digging a small hole in the soil to accommodate the root ball, or base, of the plant.,
Water the plant.,
Maintain your potted plants by watering them regularly and trimming away any dry or dead leaves.








,
Follow the same steps if you are growing your plants from seeds.",How to Grow Potted Plants," Pots can be any containers that will hold the plants while they grow.









Make sure there is at least 1 hole at the bottom of the pot. This will allow water to move and drain through the soil freely. Include a saucer or dish under the pot to prevent leaking.
Choose any pots that you find appealing. They can be simple or decorative, and they come in all sizes. Lightweight pots such as plastic and resin are easy to move around. For sturdier pots, choose those made from wood or clay.;
, Soil from your yard or garden will not work for potted plants. You need something loose and light.


Buy a soil mixture from your local garden or home improvement store. Make sure it includes peat moss and other organic matter.
Look for a potting mix that include fertilizers. Some soil comes with time-release fertilizers, which will cut down on your plant maintenance by fertilizing the soil when it is needed.

,


Consider the space that you will keep your potted plants in. Choose plants that will do well in sun or shade, depending on where you plan to keep them.
Check the tags on the plants in the garden center for tips on how much sunlight and water each type of plant requires.
Assign one plant per pot. Even if you have a large pot, use only one kind of flower or plant in it. This will prevent overcrowding.

, Fill the pot up to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the pot, and pat the soil down lightly with your fingers to push out any pockets of air.








, Fill in the pot with additional soil.








, Keep the soil moist, but not saturated with water. Pay attention to any watering instructions that come with the plant.








,, Instead of placing the plant in the soil, sprinkle the seeds onto the soil and cover with additional soil.

Determine what type of plant to grow.,
Learn what color light is needed.,
Choose your bulbs.,
Set up your light system.,
Provide the proper duration of light.,
Maintain your bulbs and plants.",How to Grow Plants With Grow Lights,"


Purchase the seeds for the variety or flora you wish to grow indoors. Base your decision on the space in your home and the amount of electricity you can use. Vegetable plants require more light than many exotic plants, for instance.;
,


Research the plant you have chosen to determine the colors on the light spectrum your particular plant utilizes most. Most plants use the entire spectrum, but red and blue are the most important. Your research should tell you what color your plant craves most. For example, African violets do best under blue light, but they also need red to flower.

,


Pick incandescent bulbs for a superior source of red light. These bulbs are most commonly used in the home. The amount of blue light emitted from incandescent bulbs is poor, however.
Select fluorescent bulbs to achieve as much as 3 times more light intensity than incandescent bulbs. There are different bulb options within the category of fluorescents. Cool white bulbs are good for plants needing blue and yellow-green light. Warm white bulbs give off more red and orange light. Full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs are the best of both worlds; they are used for many different indoor plants.
Opt for high-intensity discharge lamps if you are growing a large amount of plants. They are extremely energy efficient and produce the most light out of the three types. They are also the most expensive type of bulb.

,


Find a location in your home to set your plants and install the lighting. Hang the bulbs the proper distance away from your specific type of plant. The distance between light and plant varies, but at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) is a good rule. Avoid placing lights more than 40 inches (101.6 cm) from the plant.

,


Give your plants a break from grow lights periodically. Plants need rest periods in order to respire. A common duration of light is 12 hours, but some plants require more and some require less.

,


Rotate your plants every week so each side receives the same amount of light.
Change out bulbs when they begin to age. This is especially important for fluorescent bulbs, which dim at the ends over time.
Water and fertilize your plants as needed.

Obtain a piece of ulva algae.,
Grow ulva algae in nutrient rich water.,
Place the algae in an area with high flow.,
Make the water the proper temperature.,
Keep the water at the right pH level.,
Place the algae in moderate lighting.,
Prune the algae when it gets too big.",How to Grow Ulva Algae1," To start growing ulva algae in your aquarium, you can go to a local pet store or order the algae from the internet. If you live near the coast, you may be able to find some ulva algae in the ocean and try growing it from that plant.When you are looking for ulva algae to purchase, you may also want to look for sea lettuce, which the plant also goes by.;
, Ulva algae does best when it is in nutrient rich aquarium waters. If your aquarium’s nutrient levels are low, you can use iron supplements to help the ulva algae grow properly., You should place the ulva algae in an area of your aquarium where the water flow is highest. This algae helps to filter nitrates and phosphates out of the aquarium. Placing it in a high flow area will help filter the most out of the water., Ulva algae grows best in moderate water temperatures. It can survive in waters between 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or 18 to 26 degrees Celcius. However, it does best in water that ranges from 72 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit, or 22 to 25 degrees Celcius., Ulva algae needs a certain pH level. Your aquarium should be between 8.1 to 8.4.You can use chemical additives to change the pH level, or use natural agents that will adjust the pH.Make sure to change the chemistry of the water slowly. Your fish may die if you change the pH more than 0.3 in 24 hours.

, Ulva algae can do well in moderate to high lighting. It can even last for a few days in no light. The algae does best in lighting of three watts per gallon or more., Your ulva algae may start to get too big as it grows. This type of algae can get as large as 12 inches (30.5 cm). Pruning the algae can help keep the size under control. Just clip off part of the algae. You can feed it to your fish, give it to someone, or throw it away."
"
Put the algae in the sump compartment.,
Move it to the main aquarium.,
Drop the algae in the aquarium water.,
Anchor the algae to a surface.",How to Grow Ulva Algae2," Because of the algae needs water flow and floats, you can place it in the sump compartment of the aquarium filter system. Sump compartments are the secondary tanks that are connected to the display aquarium tank that helps filter the water.This will allow the algae to absorb the nitrates and phosphates it needs for growth., After the algae has filtered the nitrates and phosphates, you can move the algae into the main part of the aquarium. You can prune part of the algae and place it in the tank for the fish to eat. Alternately, you can move the entire plant into the main aquarium part for the fish to eat on., If you don’t want to place the ulva algae in the sump compartment, you can place it directly in your aquarium. You can drop it in the water, where it will float on top of the water., Algae is a free floating plant. However, you can attach it to a rock or shell in your aquarium. Use a touch of superglue to attach the algae to whatever surface you want in your tank. Alternately, you can try tying a string around part of the algae and the surface you want to anchor it to."

Get the fern started indoors, especially if you live in an area with unreliable weather for your particular breed of fern.,
Figure out the time of year best for planting.,
Get the fern ready to be moved.,
Dig out a generous ball of the roots.,
Dig a hole the same size as the root ball and place the fern inside.,
Pour water into the area.,
Fill in excess space with soil Don't pack too tightly, leave the soil soft.

,
Monitor the plant and make sure it is growing at the same rate as before you planted it.",How to Plant a Fern," All types of ferns require a different climate, however most prefer a hot humid atmosphere. Grow the fern indoors until you begin to see multiple leaves spring out from the center. The goal is to grow it until you have enough roots to hold it a ball in your hand, however you do not want to pull the plant out of the ground prematurely. If you're not sure whether the fern is quite ready to be planted outdoors, leave it in the ground for a while longer.;
, During the Spring season (where winter is cold and wet where you live) is best. In warmer climates Fall is preferable.

, If your fern is a good size and is actively growing, cut the leaves by half of their length. This will make it easier to move and relieve the stress of the plant.

, Don't be afraid to pull up a lot of dirt along with the roots. The shape of the ball isn't too important, so don't worry about shaping it afterwards. This will hurt the roots more than anything.

, Leaving a generous amount of space for the hole to fit is okay, as you will be filling it in and watering it in the extra space.

, Water more than you normally would as this will get the soil ready and begin to get the fern used to it's new area.

,, The growing rate should be fairly close to the same. If the plant isn't responding well move it back to where you had it before. Don't move the plant's location too often as this injures the plant.

Use the right soil.,
Water your plants the appropriate amount.,
Make sure the plants have sunlight.,
Keep the environment a good temperature.,
Get rid of bugs.",How to Grow Miniature Houseplants1," Succulents and cacti need well-draining soil. You can purchase cactus soil that is already mixed. Put your succulent or cactus in a pot with drainage holes then put it in the cactus soil. If you want to put your succulent or cactus in something besides a regular pot, layer the bottom of the container with pebbles before you put the plant and soil inside. , Succulents and cactus can go a long time without water, but they do need water to survive and grow. Water your plants only when the soil is completely dry, to avoid killing it by overwatering. It is better to under-water cacti than it is to overwater them. Pour the water on the soil, not on the plants itself, to avoid rot. , Succulents and cacti do best in bright indirect sunlight. Experiment with different spots near windows to see where your plants thrive. If you notice your plants withering, meaning the leaves look yellow or transparent, move them to a brighter spot. Make sure your plants are not getting sunburned from too much light. In the northern hemisphere, succulents tend to burn near south facing windows. You can move your plants to an east facing window if they are getting too hot. , Succulents like to be warm in the summer (between 70° and 80° Fahrenheit, or 21°-27° Celsius) and cool in the winter (between 50° and 60° Fahrenheit, or 10°-16° Celsius). Most succulents can handle temperatures higher or lower than that, but don’t let the plants get below freezing. If you keep your plants next to a window, you probably won’t have to worry about the temperature too much. , Because you are growing plants indoors, you probably don’t have to worry about bugs too much. If you don’t use a well-draining soil mix and don’t let your plants dry out completely between watering them, you might get gnats (very small flies). Another bug that likes to attack succulents is mealy bugs (white, fuzzy bugs with many legs). If you notice any mealy bugs, spray your plants with rubbing alcohol and pour rubbing alcohol over the soil to kill any eggs. "

Choose the right herbs to grow.,
Choose the correct pots.,
Choose the right soil.,
Give your herbs good lighting.,
Water the herbs the correct amount.",How to Grow Miniature Houseplants2," There are many different types of herbs you can grow. If you are brand new to the experience stick with an easier herb, such as bay tree, chive, mint, or parsley. More advanced herbs are oregano and rosemary. The hardest herbs to grow are basil, cilantro, and sage. Do not start out with difficult herbs if you have never grown herbs before. , Choose a pot with drainage holes. Use terra cotta to help the herbs breathe. The pots should not be smaller than 6 inches in diameter for individual herbs. If you want to grow herbs together, put two or three in a pot that is 8 inches deep and 10 inches in diameter. You can grow different kinds of herbs in the same pot, but don’t mix herbs that have different watering schedules, different soil needs, or are very different sizes. , Use high quality, organic soil. Different types of herbs like different soils. Chives and mint like damp soil. Sage, basil, oregano, bay, thyme, and rosemary like well-drained soil. You can buy potting soil that stays damp for longer or well-drained soil that stays dry at a gardening store. For growing rosemary, thyme, and basil, add eggshells to your soil. Put the eggshells in a food processor with water and add them to your soil. , Grow your herbs on a southwestern window, to get good light. If you can’t get enough light from a window you can get clamp-on reflector lights with bulbs. Place the lights very close to the herbs (about four to six inches away). Brown spots on the foliage means the herbs are getting too much light. Plants with long stems and very few leaves are not getting enough light and need more. , Herbs don’t need very much water. Overwatering herbs is the biggest mistake people make. Let the herbs dry out completely before watering them. Put your finger in the dirt all the way down to the roots to see if they are dried out. You will be able to pick up on a pattern of how long it takes the plants to dry out. To water your herbs put them in the sink and water the base where the stem and dirt meet. Let the water soak through. When the herbs are drained completely, put them back on the saucers. Never leave water in saucer or the herbs’ roots will rot. "

Keep the roses in bright, direct sunlight.,
Water the roses regularly.,
Use good soil.,
Remove dead flowers regularly.,
Prune your miniature roses.,
Let the roses rest in the winter.,
Pay attention to the leaves.",How to Grow Miniature Houseplants3," Miniature roses like bright and direct light. The flowers won’t bloom unless they have enough sun. Make sure to keep them next to a sunny window.


The humidly in the environment should be high to moderate.
Keep the miniature roses at room temperature., Roses need to be watered regularly. Check their soil every day or two to make sure it is well hydrated. Water the roses thoroughly when they are growing. Make sure the top 2.5 centimeters of soil dries out between watering. Don’t get water on the leaves because that can cause fungus to grow.


In the winter, keep the soil only slightly moist. , Miniature roses grow best in potting mix with a neutral pH level, such as pH 7. In the spring and summer, give your miniature roses a fertilizer every two weeks. Use a high-phosphorus fertilizer that has micronutrients. , Whenever you see a flower that is dead, remove it. This will keep the roses looking their best and encourage the flowers to bloom longer. Use sharp pruners to pluck off the dead flowers. Using your hands can damage the stem and give your roses diseases. Cut the flowers at a 45-degree angle. , They won’t need pruning when they are still new plants, but they will when they get older. When branches start dying or crossing and rubbing each other, you need to remove them. Fall is the best time to prune because it is after flowering. If you prune your miniature roses yearly, you will promote growth and health. Pruning also helps your roses have a better looking shape. Use pruning shears and cut the stem a quarter inch above the leaf axil at a 45-degree angle. , Not pruning, not giving your roses fertilizer, and leaving them alone in the winter will give your roses a longer life and better health. Keep your roses cool during this time. Don’t leave them outside where they will freeze. Move your roses to a basement or garage where they will be cool. , Black spots on the leaves means that they have a fungus from being in damp conditions. Cut off the affected leaves and treat the foliage with a blackspot fungicide. Keep your roses in good air ventilation to avoid blackspot.


Yellow leaves on your roses can be from not enough sun, dry soil, or dry air. "

Leave leaf litter under your hedge.",How to Plant a Beech Hedge," Beech isn’t too fussy about location and will tolerate both sun and partial shade as well as windy locations. Beech will thrive in either acid or alkaline soil.The only thing you should really avoid when picking out a spot to plant your hedge is soil that has a lot of clay in it, or that often gets soggy (be it from a sprinkler or a downward slope that makes water collect in that area).;
, If you are not sure what type of soil is located in the area where you hope to plant your hedge, try giving a handful of moist earth a squeeze in your hand. If it tends to clump together rather than crumble, it’s probably got clay in it. If your soil has high amounts of clay, you’ll find that it gets really hard when it dries out, and may even form cracks on the surface.


If you have these conditions, Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) may be a good substitute for beech.

, You should prepare the ground at least one season ahead of planting, ideally in the spring or summer. When you come to plant the hedge in winter, the ground will be much harder to work than it is in the warmer, drier months. Use a spade to turn the soil over to help improve drainage. You can also add a soil improver, such as well-rotted horse manure or spent mushroom compost.Fresh horse manure can ‘burn’ young saplings so don’t use it immediately before planting. Part of the reason for preparing your site this early is so the manure can rot down in the soil, becoming helpful for the plant rather than harmful.
You can also purchase prepared soil improvers from your local garden supply store.

, Consider getting a weed killer to deal with the problem for you—just make sure that it is a substance that neutralizes itself when it comes into contact with the ground (this way it won’t harm your plant).


If you start preparing the ground a year before you plan to plant your hedge, you can also use special weed control fabric or big sheets of cardboard. Place these sheets over the area where you will plan to have your hedge. Weigh them down with rocks and other heavy objects. The fabric or cardboard will keep light from reaching the soil, so no weeds will be able to grow in that spot.

, Saplings are sold either as bare-root plants, which are cheapest, or as potted plants, which are bulkier to store, heavier to move and more expensive to buy. Both work equally well but bare-root plants will need planting quickly after delivery. Plants supplied in pots are more forgiving if you make them wait a while.


If you aren’t able to plant your entire hedge within a short period of time, such as a day or weekend, consider potted plants., Saplings for hedge planting are often called ‘whips’ and are usually about 60 centimeter (23.6 in) tall. Don’t be dismayed if bare root plants arrive looking like dead sticks—later in the year they’ll burst into leaf.

, When your bare root plants arrive, check them briefly to make sure they are undamaged at the point of delivery. If the wrapping material has dried out, water it and then store the plants still in their packaging. If you obtained pot plants, just keep the soil moist until they are planted. Young vulnerable pot plants may prefer a sheltered spot to avoid wind damage.


Bare root plants should be stored in temperatures just above freezing and the root casings should not be allowed to dry out. Avoid keeping them in a heated area such as in your home. An unheated shed is probably best.

, Ideally plant on a calm or cloudy day so that your plants don’t have to cope with wind and the drying conditions of wind and sun. Wait until the soil isn’t frozen solid or waterlogged before you start planting.


You should plant your saplings in late winter or early spring for the best results.

, It’s common to plant smaller plants at a higher density than more mature ones. This is because younger plants are more vulnerable to failure than older ones. To achieve a good density of hedge, plant your saplings in a staggered double row. If your saplings are bare-root, it’s best to plant at a density of between 3 to 7 plants per meter.For a hedge that becomes dense even more quickly, plant a staggered double row of between 5 to 7 plants per meter.
Although plants do need space, there will inevitably be some failures leading to gaps, so it’s usually best to plant at fairly high density if you have an adequate number of saplings to do so.

, For pot-grown plants supplied in soil, the best density really depends on the size of the plant. Check the plant label for the supplier’s advice but it’s usually best to aim for density of between 4 to 6 plants per meter.


If you’re planting in a single line, aim for 4 plants per meter.
If planting in a staggered double row as is advised, aim for 6 plants per meter.

, The plant will appreciate a few hours root soaking in a bucket before you begin. Don’t leave them in water overnight though as their roots could get soggy and start to rot.To minimize the amount of time your roots are exposed to the air, let the plant’s roots continue to soak in the water until the very moment you are ready to put them in the ground.

, Remove each plant from the bucket and remove any broken or twisted roots using pruning shears or a sharp garden knife that gives a clean cut.


Don’t remove any more root than is absolutely necessary.

, Create a little mound of soil at the center of each hole and plant your sapling at the top with the roots draped around it. Be careful not to bend or force the roots into unnatural shapes and positions or they could become damaged.


The first root should be just below the soil’s surface. You shouldn’t be able to see any roots above the soil line.

, Fill the hole with soil and press lightly on the topsoil to firm it down. Immediately water each sapling as you plant it. Watering the plant right away will help to settle the soil and remove any air bubbles that could have been trapped under the soil when you filled in the hole.

, The mulch will help your plants to stay warm, retain water, and fight off weeds. You don’t necessarily need to use store-bought mulch; you can use things just as effectively.These home-grown mulches include:


Grass clippings.
Well-rotted manure.
Leaf litter.
Bark chips.

, You can protect your plants from wind and wildlife by setting up protective sleeves or guards around your plants. One of the most commonly used protective sleeves are spiral plastic tree guards that expand as the tree grows.

, The most common cause of young plant failure is a lack of water, so you may need to water your hedge regularly for the first two years of its life.


However, be sure to only water it when the ground is dry around the base of the plant, as having to ‘hunt’ for water at a deeper level of ground helps the plant develop sturdy roots.
Pay particular attention to your plant’s water needs if its first summer in your yard is a hot and dry one. It will need more water than normal.

, Your beech hedge will look tidier and grow thicker if you prune the plant in the end of summer or early autumn. Autumn is the best time because you will be able to avoid disturbing nesting birds because your hedge plants will be dormant and will lack leaves. Don’t be afraid to cut the hedge back fairly hard as this will help it grow thick and dense.


For the first two years, prune the beech plants by using plant clippers to cut back the longer shoots and cutting off the tips of shorter ones. This will help the plant grow thicker and denser.
From three years and up, trim the sides of the hedge. You will want to trim the plant into the shape of an ‘A’ with a flat top so that light can reach all of the parts of the hedge equally. Try to keep the base of the hedge at about 3 ¼ feet (1 m) at the base, and then thin as you go up to your desired plant height., While this may sound odd, plants can use an annual boost of nutrients to ensure that they grow up strong and healthy. You can scatter plant feed pellets on the soil around your hedge and use a rake to gently work them into the soil.


Alternately, you can use a water-soluble feed purchased at a garden supply store.

, Your hedge may be at risk of getting eaten or choked out by weeds, particularly when the hedge is new. If you are concerned about animals eating your hedge before it is established, consider putting a fence around it. To protect your heads against weeds, you can lay down weed-proof matting underneath you hedge to suppress weed growth. You can purchase both fencing and matting at a garden store. To make your own weed-proof matting:


Lay down pieces of newspaper under your hedge. Cover the newspaper with wood chips. The layers of newspaper and wood chips will keep light from reaching the weeds that want to grow, effectively suppressing the weeds.

, After your hedge has become established, you can let it mulch itself. Each season your hedge will drop leaves. Let the leaves remain under the hedge because they will act as a mulch by suppressing weed growth.


If you want to keep the area looking tidy, sweep up the leaves around the hedge, but the let the leaves that fall under the hedge remain where they are.

Select a bush that is hardy in your area.,
Consult the plant tag for growing recommendations - especially note the cold hardiness and the plant's preference of growing conditions.,
Once you have determined a species of plant has a good chance of survival in your yard, select the most healthy and vigorous specimen available.,
Get the plant home without damaging it.",How to Plant a Bush1," Not everything for sale in a local garden shop will be hardy. Occasionally shops will offer plants for sale that are only able to grow in your area under special circumstances.;
, Ask yourself ""Do I have, or can I make, these conditions in my yard?""

, Look for thickest stems, heaviest leaf cover, no broken or dead twigs, etc.

, If in the open bed of a pickup, consider covering the plant with some sort of wind protection for the ride home.

"
"
Select a spot for the bush in your yard, keeping the following in mind:


Growing conditions of the plant.,
Dig a hole that is twice as wide and twice as deep as the pot or root-ball of your bush.,
Place mulch or well rotted compost in the bottom of the hole.,
Toss in a handful of slow release fertilizer.

,
Add a shovelful or two of dirt to cover the fertilizer somewhat.

,
Fill the hole with water and allow it to absorb into the compost and surrounding soil.,
Remove your bush's roots from the pot or burlap wrap.

,
Gently spread out any roots that have become pot bound.

,
Place the root ball centrally in the hole.

,
Keep the previous soil line on the plant even with ground level.

,
Back fill the hole around the roots with the earth you removed from the hole earlier, gently tamping the soil to hold the bush upright.

,
Use the extra earth to form a small berm of earth around the base of the plant.,
""Water in"" your new bush from the top to remove large air pockets and help the soil to settle in down around the roots.

",How to Plant a Bush2," Make sure the plant is getting the recommended amount of sunlight.
Easy access to water. Out of reach of a hose means you'll have to carry water in buckets... not an attractive alternative.
Protection from hazards such as digging dogs, heavy winds, Downspout torrents, etc.

, Set the earth aside on a piece of cardboard or tarp to protect the grass around the hole. (this may not be a consideration in new construction)

, You want a layer that is one fourth to one third the depth of the hole. This will help retain moisture in dry periods and will help retain soil aeration in wet periods.

,,, This will soften the surrounding earth for the new roots to grow into and pre-wet the compost.

,,,,,, The berm should be just slightly larger around than the top of the bush is... with a wide basin left at the base of the stalk/stem to hold water.

,"
"
Water the bush by filling the berm/basin once a week and allowing it to percolate down into the bush's roots.,
Fertilize as recommended on the plant tag... usually once a year just before foliage emerges is best.

",How to Plant a Bush3," You could set up an inexpensive irrigation system to do a smaller, daily watering as well.

Watch the weather as summer comes to a close.,
Choose a location to overwinter your plants.,
Transplant plants to pots, if necessary.,
Transport your plants to your indoor location.,
Care for your plants while overwintering.,
Replant your plants when the weather is suitable.",How to Overwinter Tropical Plants1," The weather can sometimes change quickly and unpredictably. Because a sudden drop in temperature or unexpected frost can kill your tropical plants, you should keep a careful eye on the weather during the transition from summer to winter.


A good rule of thumb is to begin preparing to bring plants indoors when the temperature reaches around 50 to 60°F (10 to 15.6°C).
To prevent unexpected plant death, you may want to research the tropical plants you wish to save. This way you'll be certain of the lower range of their temperature resistance.;
, Most tropical plants need high heat, bright light, and high humidity to continue growing and stay alive. A bright, sunny, well heated room or a garden window can be an ideal place for this purpose.


Putting your plant in this kind of location will trick it into thinking it's still in its growing season. This will keep the plant alive and active during the winter months.
The ideal light and humidity for many tropical plants may be more than your home can provide. In many cases, decreased growth indoors is common.
Many tropical plants grow to quite large sizes. In this situation, you may not have room in your home to store your plants., Water the plant well one to two days before transplanting. Use a shovel and dig a wide circle around the tropical plants you are going to put in pots. After that, carefully dig toward and then underneath the roots of the plant until the roots come free with enough dirt attached to keep all roots covered. Put the plant in a pot and add a suitable nutrient rich filler, like compost, to complete the transplanting.


For best results, you should transplant most plants in the evening, while nighttime temperatures are still in the 50°F (10°C) range.
Generally, you should lightly water your plants after transplanting. This helps reduce the negative effects of this activity.
You should inspect your plants well for insects before bringing them inside. Failing to do can result in your house becoming infested with bugs.
You can always shave excess dirt off a root ball with your shovel, but it will be impossible to reattach a severed root. Err on the side of caution when digging., Depending on where you'll be keeping your plants, you may want to lay down towels or a drop cloth in the storage location first. Dirt can stick to the bottom of pots or spill from them, creating a mess. A drop cloth will help prevent this while you arrange your plants.


You can remove your drop cloth once you are certain your plants are clean and the dirt properly contained.
You may want to leave a drop cloth, a mat, or a similar kind of holder beneath your pots. In some cases, excess water may leak out of the pot and dirty your home.

, Your plants will still need water, light, and other nutrients, like fertilizer, while overwintering. The frequency of watering and feeding, however, will depend on the kind of tropical plant. Generally, you should:


Keep the soil of your plants moist, but not wet. Over watering can lead to harmful conditions, like root rot.Care for your plants according to a consistent schedule. Failing to do so can ""shock"" the plant, resulting in brittle, unhealthy, or dead foliage.
Keep your plant in the same location. Moving your plant frequently throughout your house is harmful to its health.Prune off dead or unhealthy parts of the plant. Removing the struggling parts of a plant will encourage healthy growth elsewhere., When the weather is warm enough for your tropical plants, take them outdoors where you wish to plant them. After that, take your shovel and dig a hole deep and wide enough to fit the root ball entirely, then:


Water the plant until the soil is saturated. Then, use your fingers to gently slide the potted plant from its pot and carefully disentangle the root ball.
Add a little plant food to the bottom of your hole to help promote growth following transplanting. Insert the root ball into the hole.
Fill all empty spaces with dirt and cover the top of the root ball, which should be about level with or slightly below ground level. Your overwintered plant is now transplanted back outdoors."
"
Choose a suitable location.,
Pot plants, if necessary.,
Move plants to the hibernating location.,
Check your plants while they are hibernating.,
Retain heat with mulch or ground cover.,
Remove mulch and allow your plants to regrow.",How to Overwinter Tropical Plants2," When hibernating plants, you'll want a cool place that is completely dark and stays above freezing throughout the night. Ideally, the temperature of your hibernating location should range from 40 to 50°F (4.4 to 10°C). Some places you might want to consider include:


Crawl spaces
Garages
Outbuildings (like sheds, barns, etc.)
Unheated/unfinished basements, Plants in the ground should be doused with water a day or two before they are dug up with a shovel. After digging up the plant, the roots should be fully intact and there should be enough dirt on the root ball to keep them covered. Put the plant in a pot and fill in any empty spaces with nutrient rich filler, like compost.


Generally, you should transplant your tropicals in the evening and lightly water them following transplanting., If you have to walk through a nicer part of your house to get to the plant hibernating area, you may want to lay down towels, newspaper, or a drop cloth to prevent the spread of dirt. After that, take your plants to the storage location.


Plants that are already potted can be moved directly to their hibernating location. However, you may want to clean these off, first.
You may want to have a permanent cover, like a plastic mat, to catch any loose dirt or decayed plant matter and keep your hibernating location clean., Sudden drops in temperature can influence the temperature of your hibernating location, too. In the event of a drop in temperature, you may need to relocate your plants somewhere warmer. The soil should remain slightly moist throughout overwintering. Add water sparingly as necessary.


If you have tight space constraints, you may want to lightly prune away large limbs or growths. In most cases, though, heavy pruning should be saved for spring., Many tropical plants will be too sensitive to survive winter weather, but some more resilient plants may be able to survive mild winters with a little help. Ground cover, like a thick layer of mulch that completely hides the plant, helps keep roots warm and alive. You might also:Use a frost cover, which are available at most home and garden stores. This is essentially a piece of fabric used to completely cover and protect plants from cold damage.

Even an old blanket, carefully wrapped around a plant, can work as a frost cover. Be careful your cover doesn't crush the plant.


Build or purchase a cold frame or hoophouse for your plants. These are simple structures that permit good light while keeping frost at bay., When the weather returns to suitable conditions for your covered, hibernating plants, use a shovel, rake, or hand spade to remove the mulch. Be especially careful not to damage the roots. To give your plants the best chance of growing back, you may want to use fertilizer. Be sure you water the plants adequately, so they have enough nutrients for the spring re-growth phase.


When waiting for your plants to come out of hibernation and regrow, try to be patient. Some plants may take up to two months to start regrowing."
"
Identify plants that can be replanted.,
Wait until the first light frost.,
Overwinter your regrowing material.,
Plant your tropical plants when summer arrives.",How to Overwinter Tropical Plants3," Many kinds of tropical plant produce special structures, called bulbs, tubers, and corms, from which the plant can be regrown. These are generally found in the ground or at the base of the stem. Common tropicals that produce these kind of structures include:


Elephant ear
Cannas
Caladium, This is the ideal time to harvest regrowing material. After the first light frost, the leaves of your plants should be slightly brown. This shows that the plant has entered its dormant phase. At this point, you should:


Use garden shears or a spade to cut stems to approximately 6"" (15.2 cm) long. Then, carefully dig up the plant.
Gather all tubers, bulbs, and corms. These are generally bulbous growths at the base of the stem., There are many techniques you might use for storing bulbs, tubers, and corms. In most cases, you should wash excess soil from the regrowing material with warm water and allow it to air dry. Then:


Spread out regrowing material in containers with good ventilation, like milk or bread crates. Keep material separate and pack it with peat moss, wood chips, or sawdust.Store your packed crates in a cool, dark place with a temperature that is consistently 40 to 50°F (4.4 to 10°C).
Every month, check your regrowing material. Remove and throw away rotten plant matter, and rejuvenate shriveled matter with a light mist of water., The ideal planting condition will depend on the kind of tropical plant you are growing. Generally, regrowing material should be planted in holes as wide as the plant matter and 2 to 3"" (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep.


After planting, you'll have to care for your plant according to its needs. This may involve things like regular pruning, watering, and fertilizing.
Some of your regrowing material may not sprout. It's not uncommon for a few plants to fail."

Check soil drainage.,
Install French drains for slow draining soil.,
Mix in organic matter for fast draining soil.,
Protect the root crown of your trees with a mound.,
Build a raised bed to protect root crowns if you’ve got the tools.,
Break up soil at the planting site for better root growth.",How to Prepare Soil for Fruit Trees1," Break out your shovel and dig a hole in your planting area. You only need to go down about a foot (30.5 cm). After that, fill the hole with water. The water should drain within 3 to 4 hours, at which point you should fill the hole again with water.


If the hole does not drain within 3 to 4 hours during the first and second water filling, your soil won’t likely drain well enough to support a fruit tree.
If your hole drains completely in less than 3 hours, the soil may be too sandy. To improve this, add organic matter to the soil as described in the following steps.
Soil that drains poorly can be improved with a drainage system, planting mounds, or raised beds, all of which are described in the following steps.;
, A layer of thick, sticky clay underneath your topsoil could be clogging things up. Removing this layer isn’t really a cost effective option, so a DIY French drain system may be the best solution for slow draining soil.

French drains are a kind of underground drainpipe installed to improve drainage. Once they're put in and the grass regrows, they'll be all but invisible.Generally, French drains are installed by digging a sloping trench through areas of poor drainage to a drainage area. A drainage pipe and coarse backfill, like gravel, are inserted in the trench, then covered with dirt., Soil that is sandy or coarse may drain too quickly for your trees to receive enough water. Use well-composted organic materials in the backfill for tree holes to increase moisture retention while the roots establish.After mixing in organic materials thoroughly, test drainage with the previously described hole-drainage check (water should drain in 3 to 4 hours).
The amount of organic materials you’ll need to add to the backfill will depend on the severity of your drainage problems.

, The upper part of the root system slightly underneath the soil line is called the root crown. This part of the tree is vulnerable to excess moisture. By raising the planting area with a mound, the root crown will be better protected.


Mounds are made by backfilling soil into holes to create a gentle slope rising to the tree in the center. The tree’s soil line should be 6 to 12 in (15.2 to 30.5 cm) higher than surrounding soil.
For mounds that are 6 in (15.2 cm) high, you should also use a width of at least 2.5 ft (.76 m).
For mounds that are 10 or 12 in (25.4 or 30.5 cm) high, use a width between 3 and 4 ft (.9 and 1.2 m).
Avoid making steep slopes with your mounds. Gentle slopes will prevent the soil from eroding., A raised bed is a simple wooden box that holds in soil around the tree, keeping its soil line high. This pretty much eliminates the erosion that will eventually happen with mounds, which is a definite plus., Soil that is packed tightly will resist root growth. Your trees roots will establish better in an area widely cultivated with a shovel and rototiller. Do not cultivate lower than the recommended planting depth for your tree.

Holes for trees, generally, should be double the width of the roots. The depth shouldn’t be greater than the root ball, except when the soil is really compacted, then you’ll want a little extra room.
If you notice a lot of clay while breaking up the soil in the planting site, use a shovel to cut channels into the sides of the hole. This will encourage outward root growth."
"
Decide on plant location.,
Arrange your plants before transplanting.,
Dig a hole.,
Sprinkle compost in the hole.,
Loosen the roots.,
Fill in the soil around the plant.,
Mulch the area around the plant with leaf mulch or straw.",How to Plant1," When gardening location is everything. Make sure your plot of land receives the correct amount of sun, provides enough space and good soil for growth and the elevation allots proper drainage. Face your garden to the east, as morning sun provides the best, cool light perfect for growing plants.
Soil should be loose and dark in color, not red and clay-like or sandy. Loose soil means there is plenty or aeration, making it easy for roots to grow, while the dark color indicates nutritious soil.;
, Do not dig or remove your plants from the pot until you have decided exactly where you want to place each one. Not only will this save time and energy, but it will help lessen transplant shock.


Since plants are not meant to be removed and replanted, transplant shock is inevitable. The plant may not root well, leading to unsuccessful growing. However, if the root ball, the mass of soil surrounding the plant’s roots, is disturbed as little as possible, the plant is more likely to take to its new environment.

, The hole should be the same depth as the root ball, though twice as wide. The extra width gives the plant’s roots space to grow.


Place the plant in the hole to make sure the plant’s will rest in the ground at the same level as it was in its original pot.
Remove any rocks from the hole and break up chunks of soil so the plant has a loose and clean space.

, This will fertilize the roots and provoke healthy plant growth.


Add about 1 to 3 inches of compost for planting flowers or vegetables.
Next, create a 2 to 3 inch barrier of soil between the compost and roots. This layer will keep the compost from stealing nitrogen from the roots, but will still be close enough to filter nutrients into the soil. , This will prepare the roots to better integrate with the soil. Hold the plant upside down. Hit the bottom of the plant with a flat hand and slightly massage the root ball, gently squeezing and slightly pulling apart. You are creating small pockets for the roots to spread out and grow. However, it is very important that you do not to damage the roots or remove too much dirt from the cluster.


If the plant doesn’t come loose, it is root bound. Score the edges of the pot with a dull instrument and loosen with your finger. Spread out the roots of root-bound plants when you plant them in the ground.

, Use the soil you have already removed to completely fill the hole.


Make sure your plant sits in in the ground at the same height as it did in its original pot. Plants too low in the ground will flood, while plants to high may not root properly.

, Keep the stem of the plant free of the mulch, so that air can circulate. Water and fertilize as directed by the plant’s instructions.Mulch is important for healthy plant growth, reducing the amount of surface evaporation for the soil, moderating the plants temperature and protecting the roots from weeds and other hindrances.

Don't mulch the ground before planting.",How to Prepare the Soil for Strawberries," Observe your possible locations over a few months time and pick the sunniest spot with the best water drainage. Avoid planting strawberries in an area that is excessively windy. Too much wind blows away beneficial insects.;
, Your garden catalog will have a zone map included that you can consult, or you can talk to the people at your local garden center to find what grows best in your climate.

, A pH level of 6.0 to 6.5 is the best soil for growing strawberries, but a range of 5.5 to 7.0 is also acceptable.


You can check the pH level yourself by purchasing a kit at any garden supply center. Put soil into the provided container, add a measured amount of the provided testing chemical and compare the resultant color to the kit's color chart to determine your soil's pH level.
Alternatively, you can take or mail a sample of your soil to a local county extension office. They will test the soil and provide recommendations on how to adjust your soil for the best results when growing strawberries. They can also recommend the best strawberries for your area saving you some real disappointment in the future.

, Break up any large clumps of soil and remove any weeds or stones. Watch for harmful grubs and other insects, and remove them. If you need to adjust the pH, now is the time to apply the lime. Mix it into the soil thoroughly.

, Work in several handfuls of bone meal per square yard (meter) at the same time.

, Aged cow or horse manure are good choices and readily available at garden centers.

, Allow the soil to have as much exposure to sunlight as you can so that the ground is warm enough from planting.

Determine the type of soil you have and make amendments to get a loamy mix.,
Add plenty of organic material to your soil.,
Dig and aerate your soil each season.,
Ensure that the soil for your roses is dry and friable (easily crumbled) when you begin to make improvements to it.,
Check your soil for good drainage by digging a hole a foot deep (30cm) and filling it with water.,
Ensure the soil where you plant your roses has a pH of around 6.5, which is slightly acidic.,
Consider adding other amendments such as bone meal, blood meal or NPK ( Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium).,
Take a shortcut and use a bag of good grade potting soil in which to plant your roses.",How to Prepare Soil for Roses,"

Clay soil will hold water but does not drain well. It is usually highly alkaline and will need a lot of organic matter added to it. Adding gypsum will improve clay soil and ensure good drainage.



 


Sandy soil will drain well but requires frequent watering. It will also need to be amended with organic material.






Very organic soil is usually highly acidic and will have both good drainage and moisture retention. You may need to add lime to increase the pH level.





;
, You can buy compost from garden centers or use grass clippings and leaves from around your yard. Till them into the soil in the fall or in the spring as soon as you can work the ground. Preparing the soil in your rose garden in autumn allows the material to decompose all winter.

, With new rose beds, use a roto-tiller or spade to turn the soil in fall and again in spring. If you have existing roses, turn the soil over near the rose bush and loosen the roots as much as possible, but be caution not to damage the rose bush.

, Pick up a handful of soil and squeeze it. Soil that is too wet sticks together while soil that is too dry crumbles.

, The water should drain out in around 15 minutes. If it takes much longer or drains too fast your may need to add more amendments.

, This is the soil usually found in woods and forests.


Test your soil with a home kit or send it to a soil testing lab in your area.
You can raise the pH level by adding lime if the soil is too acidic. If it is too alkaline, add garden sulfur. If your roses grow poorly and have yellowing leaves, it may indicate that your soil is too alkaline.

, A balance of 1:2:1 is best.


Phosphorous helps roses bloom. Avoid too much Nitrogen as it will cause more foliage growth and fewer blooms.
Alfalfa pellets, epsom salts, fish emulsion or manure are also good additions to the soil and will help your roses flourish.

, This can be expensive if you are creating a large rose garden, but the soil is already amended and ready to help your roses grow to their best potential.

Some tests include strips, vials, and mild reagents to test your soil and interpret the results, other tests send samples to labs for analysis, some kits do both!, Technically, you can test your soil whenever you feel like it, but choosing your moment has its benefits. Testing in fall or early in spring will give you time to make adjustments to your soil before planting.

Also, shoot dry conditions when testing your soil. Moisture in your sample can sometimes throw readings off.If you live in a part of the world where your growing season doesn't start in spring and end in fall, perform your test instead at either the start or end of your growing season.

, A mild soap and water will be more than enough to prepare your tools. Rinse all soap thoroughly from the tools, as it can give a false reading. Dry the tools with paper towel, and you’re ready to take a sample.

Similarly, wash, clean, and dry a bucket for harvesting samples. Lay out some newspaper on a flat, out of the way location; this is where you'll set out samples to dry., You want a good cross-section of the planting area. Dig five holes spaced out evenly around where you’ll be planting. Each hole should be 6 to 8 in (15.2 to 20.3 cm) deep. Harvest soil samples by cutting a half-inch (1.3 cm) slice from the side of each hole.

Harvested soil goes right in the bucket. When you’ve harvested all your samples, mix them together. When the soil is well mixed, lay it out on the newspaper you prepared earlier to dry.
When necessary, use the sample container that came with your kit to collect the required amount of soil (usually, it’s about a pint).
pH tests often only require you to add a reagent to a sample. The interaction between these two should create a vivid change in color, indicating the pH level according to the kit’s pH color chart."

Reduce soil acidity when necessary.,
Raise the pH of soil that’s too basic.,
Avoid fertilizing before planting.,
Use nitrogen light fertilizers for established trees.",How to Prepare Soil for Fruit Trees3," Acidic soil can take a long time to really balance out. This can be done by mixing limestone (or garden preparations with limestone in them) in with your soil. Add limestone in fall every year for a few years and you should notice an improvement.

Unfortunately, most of the eastern half of the US has acidic soil. This doesn’t necessarily mean your soil won’t support fruit trees, but it may benefit from amending it with limestone., Sometimes referred to as “alkaline soil,” soil like this is found in much of the central and southwestern US. Add in a soil conditioner to your dirt, like one containing sulfur or gypsum.

Soil conditioners are available at most hardware stores and home centers. Try Sphagnum peat moss as an organic alternative.
If you have access to compost materials, apply these regularly to decrease alkalinity. Be sure to take readings as you balance to make sure you don’t make the soil too acidic., It’s very easy to overload the root system of fruit trees. Their roots are sensitive to direct exposure to fertilizer. Never add fertilizer or manure directly to the hole in which you’ll be planting a fruit tree.Fertilize from the top of the soil after the first pruning of the season and as close before budding as possible.
If you tree starts budding sooner than expected, you can still fertilize up through June. Late summer and fall will put trees at risk of frost damage., Nitrogen will make your trees grow in a way that will require more pruning but will actually decrease fruit bearing wood. Each tree will have its own unique needs, but most fruit trees require high phosphorus, potash, and iron."

Water the plants with a gentle watering can or nozzle.,
Maintain your plants as they grow.",How to Plant2," The pot should be 2 inches deeper and wider than its original nursery pot, as the plant will need room to grow.

, Porosity, how much air and moisture can escape from your pot’s material, is key to plant growth. Glazed terra-cotta, plastic and metal hold in moisture while unglazed terra-cotta, wood and paper pulp allow the plant to breathe. Become familiar with your plant’s specific watering needs in order to decide which pot material is best. Material also affects the overall style of your garden. Choose a material that fits with your personal style as well as the location.

, Accessibility should be taken into account. For example, if you will need to move the pot around, chose a lightweight metal or composite instead of thick ceramic.

, Without holes in the bottom of the pot, water will sit in your plants soil, flooding the roots and subsequently rotting them.


If you can’t find a pot with holes, you can drill them yourself, as long as the pot isn’t too fragile.

, This barrier will reduce soil leakage through the bottom holes. Buy a saucer in a complementary color to keep the excess water from leaking onto your furniture or deck.


You can also purchase pot feet or a stand if you want the water to drain directly onto an outdoor surface.

, If this is your first time potting a plant, try planting small plants or seedlings. Consult your local gardening center about what plants do best in your climate.


Ask if any of the species you are buying are invasive. Plants like mint should be planted with their original small pot intact to keep them from spreading out and killing other plants over time.
Non-invasive annuals can be planted three to five to a pot.
Invasive annuals should have their own pot or be contained within a smaller pot.
Choose plants that don’t have dense root balls. They will become easily parched and they will be more likely to die.
Choose plants that need the same type of soil and sun.

, You will need the plants, the pots, potting mix and a trowel.


If the site requires you to bend over in order to plant, you might try elevating the pots on a bench or table in order to save yourself from unnecessary back pain.

, Then, do a dry run. Place the plants inside the container and judge where they should sit to keep their soil at the same level as in their original containers.


Use a potting mix, instead of garden soil. Choose one with slow release fertilizer granules, so the plant is taken care of over a long period of time, or purchase your own granules to mix in.
To make your own batch of potting soil, combine five parts of compost, one part vermiculite, one part builder’s sand and one-quarter part dry organic fertilizer.

, Start with the center plant then move on to surrounding plants. Sprinkle more soil with every plant you add to the arrangement. They should be covered to the same level as they were in their original containers.

, Follow watering instructions specific to your plants found on their packaging.


Right after plants are moved to a new environment they need special care so they take to their new home. Water whenever two to three inches of soil is dry.

, Add more soil if the soil compacts in a few months and tend to your plants as indicated on the package. "

Enjoy your gift to the earth!",How to Plant3," As with any plant, trees need homes that will promote healthy growth. Analyze the surroundings of your planting site to make sure it fits all the requirements necessary for your tree to flourish.


Consider the tree’s future height and canopy spread. Make sure there are no objects in the way that will deter the tree from growing to its full potential.
Consider the tree’s characteristics. If the tree is deciduous, make sure the location allows for piles of leaves. If the tree will bare fruit make sure this will not create a hindrance for you or your neighbors.
Consider the proper amounts of soil, sun and moisture. Consult experts either at an arboretum or nursery, even your community’s local tree board, in order to confirm you are planting the correct tree for your environment. , The area should be loose enough that the tree roots can easily penetrate the soil.

, It should be slightly shorter than the height of the root ball. You will form a mound with the soil.

, Lay the seedling or young tree on its side. Hit the bottom and sides of the container with a flat palm. Do this in gentle but firm strokes until the roots have been loosened.

, Take caution not to damage the seedling or the roots.

, This is a sign that the tree has overgrown the container. Loosen the circling roots and uncurl them so they are extending away from the trunk.


Trees with hardened circled roots may need to have them cut. However, this should only be done when there are few circling roots and a fairly large root ball.

, The root ball should extend one half to one inch (1.3 to 2.5cm) above the level of the ground to discourage rot. If it does not, lift it from the bottom and introduce more soil.


Adjust the tree’s position in the hole by lifting from the bottom of the root ball. Never lift using the trunk.
Ask someone to help you determine if the tree is straight and sitting properly in the soil.

, This will boost the nutrient content of the soil and provide the tree with a healthy environment for growth.

, Mound some soil above the ground level, but don’t cover any of the trunk. Pack the soil in toward the root ball with the heel of your hand.


The uppermost portions of the tree’s roots are the most vulnerable to flooding. Make sure you create a mound about 6 to 12 inches above the soil depending on tree size. , A berm not only adds design interest to your garden, but helps create the drainage necessary for your growing tree.


Fill the entirety of the existing hole with more soil, continuing to mound, adding a definite ridge around the circumference of the circle.
A berm should generally be 4 to 5 times as wide as its height.

, Keep two inches (5cm) of space between the mulch and the base of the trunk.

, This is not always necessary, but often young trees can be unsteady and need a little help. Be sure to move the stakes around the perimeter so they don’t go through the root ball.

, New trees should be watered with approximately 15 gallons (56.8 L) of water once every week for the first month.

, Follow specific care instructions for your new tree and watch it flourish and grow.

Test your soil's pH level.,
Enrich your soil using compost and peat moss before planting herbs.,
Add agricultural lime or dolomite to the soil if your pH reading was acidic (too low).,
Consider setting up raised beds if you have poor drainage.",How to Prepare Soil for Planting Herbs," Most herbs do best in neutral soil that is neither too alkaline nor acidic. PH readings ranging from 6.5 to 7 are optimal.


Buy a soil pH testing kit.
Take a small soil sample from the area where you plan to plant your herb garden.
Open the pH testing kit and follow the included directions to find the pH of your soil.;
, This is a good idea even if you pH reading falls in the ideal range.


Use a shovel to dig down to 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm).
Continue to shovel and overturn the dirt, breaking up any large clumps to lighten the texture of the soil.
Search through the soil for any weeds. Remove any you find to prepare the soil for herbs.
Add your organic matter to the herb garden soil and mix well with your shovel or a hoe to make sure it becomes fully incorporated into the soil.

,


Wait until early spring or fall before adding lime to your soil as you want to allow the lime time to meld with the soil. Do not plant herbs shortly after adding lime.
Purchase lime or dolomite at a garden center or nursery.
Reference the application ratio on the lime package to see how much to add to your soil. You may want to opt for a lighter application of lime if you are unsure which ratio to use. Over-application of lime can be very difficult to correct.
Mix lime into soil and incorporate thoroughly.

, Most herbs will grow poorly in moist soil.

Continue caring for your orchid as before.",How to Repot an Orchid," The ideal time to repot an orchid is right after it finishes flowering, when it begins to produce new growth. However, you don't need to repot your orchid every time this happens; rather it should be done no more frequently than every 18 - 24 months. If you're not sure when your orchid was last repotted, and it seems to be growing out of its pot, yours may be overdue for a repotting. Take a look at your orchid for the following signs to know if it's ready to be repotted:


Several roots are growing over the pot. If you see many roots - not just one or two - dangling over the pot, your orchid needs more room, and it's time to move it to a bigger space.
Some of the roots are rotting. If they seem soggy, and the potting material is no longer draining properly, you'll need to repot the orchid.
The plant is growing over the edge of the pot. If the bulk of the plant is leaning way over the edge, it needs more space.;
, Being overzealous with orchid repotting can throw off the plant's growing cycle. An orchid should only be repotted if the above symptoms are evident. If it looks to be healthy and well contained in its current pot, put off repotting for another year. It's better for the orchid to get a little overcrowded than to be repotted too soon., Now that you know it's time to repot your orchid, it's important to figure out the right type of potting material to use. Many orchids used as house plants are epiphytic, rather than terrestrial, meaning they don't grow in soil.These types of orchids will die if you repot them in regular potting soil.


A combination of fir bark, sphagnum moss, charcoal and coconut husks is appropriate for many orchid genera. Most common orchids will do well with this mixture:4 parts fir bark or coconut husks
1 part medium charcoal
1 part perlite


If you're not sure exactly what kind of orchid you have, packaged potting mix for orchids is a safe bet for most epiphytic orchids. It's available at many nurseries and home and garden centers.
If you have a terrestrial orchid, you'll need soil that is crumbly and retains water well. It should have a high content of perlite and wood matter.Ask at your local nursery for the particular mix that's right for your orchid genus.

, When repotting an orchid, you'll need a pot just an inch or so bigger than the pot the orchid originally came in. You want to provide a little more space, but not too much - otherwise, the orchid will concentrate its energy on growing roots, and you won't see flowering for many months. Look for a plastic, clay, glass or ceramic pot suitable for your orchid size.


Make sure the new pot has drainage holes. If it doesn't drain properly, the orchid roots will rot.Some orchid species have roots that can photosynthesize. If you have a Phalaenopsis, consider getting a clear glass or plastic pot to let the sunlight in.
If you need to choose a pot that's on the larger side, you might want to add some broken terra cotta chips to the bottom of the pot. This will help the potting material in the middle of the pot, which tends to stay wet, drain more effectively.

, Fill your new orchid pot with the potting mix, then dump it into a container about twice its size. To prepare orchid potting mix, you'll need to soak it in water overnight. This will help it retain enough moisture to sustain the orchid., Go ahead and fill the bucket or bowl to the top with hot water. Don't use cold water, since the potting materials won't absorb this as well. Be sure the soil is at room temperature before repotting the orchid.

, You can use a strainer that you'd normally use for food (you'll want to clean it well afterward) or a large piece of cheesecloth. Drain out all the water so that all you're left with is wet potting mix. Run more warm water over the mix to rinse out any dust.

, Carefully lift the orchid from its old pot, loosening each root individually. If the roots are stuck to the pot, use sterilized scissors or knife to help free them. It's important to use very clean equipment, because orchids are prone to getting diseases.


You can sterilize your trimming tools with the flame from a lighter or by wiping with rubbing alcohol on a rag.

, Use your fingers and a clean pair of scissors to carefully clean up the roots. Pick out the old mix - charcoal, wood chips, moss, and so on - and discard it. Use the scissors to clip away rotten or dead roots, taking care not to damage any healthy plant matter.


Roots that are soft and limp are probably dead, so go ahead and remove them.
Untangle the roots carefully by easing them apart with your fingers.

, If you're using a pot that you've used before for orchids, clean and sterilize it with boiling water to get rid of toxins and kill potential disease vectors. If the pot is large and deep, line it with broken pieces of terracotta or packing peanuts to help with drainage. If you're using a shallow pot, this step isn't necessary.

, The older growth should go toward the bottom of the pot, with the newer growth toward the sides, where it will have more room to spread out. The top part of the root mass should be at the same level it was in the previous pot. That means the new shoot should be above the surface of the pot, with most of the roots below the surface.

, Pour some in around the roots. Shake the pot and tap on the side of the pot to help the potting material settle lightly packed around the root coils. If you do use your fingers, press gently so that the live roots are not damaged. Make sure there are no big air pockets. If parts of the roots are left uncovered, they won't grow properly.


It helps to pour in just a little potting mix at a time. Work that around the roots with your fingers, then pour in more mix and keep going.
Continue pressing in the mix until it's level with the top of the pot.

, Stake the plant upright or clip it to the side of the pot so it does not fall over or grow crookedly.

, Place it in a temperate spot with partial shade. Water it sparingly or according to the needs of your particular orchid.

, Keep the center of the plant even with or slightly below the pot's edge and tuck your growing medium into all air gaps.

,,, You can move it to a brighter or slightly sunnier spot once it has had a chance to acclimate to the new pot and growing spot., This can be done by placing the orchid pots over a shallow dish in which you keep water, or by installing a mister., Orchids don't like to be moved, so pick your positioning for it and leave it be other than for renewing water source as needed. Orchids grow slowly, so if your plant is down to just one viable leaf? It may take 6-12 months before you can expect it to blossom.

Test the soil for pH and nutrient levels.,
Mix sulfur into the soil to lower the pH or add lime to raise the pH if it needs to be adjusted.,
Figure out what fertilizer you need based on the nutrients in your soil.",How to Fertilize Lantana1," Soil pH for lantana should be between 6 and 6.5.If the pH is 6.8 or higher, lantana may not be able to absorb the nutrients even though they are available.;
, The amount of sulfur or lime required to change the soil pH varies, depending on the soil texture.


For example, it takes ¼ pound of aluminum sulfate to change the pH of 25 square feet of sandy soil from 7.5 to 6.5 but it takes 1/2 pound of aluminum sulfate to make the same change in loamy soil., The nutrient levels present in the soil should be used to determine which fertilizer ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium is best for lantana. Fertilizers are sold with the ratio of Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium listed on the bag.


If nitrogen levels in the soil are at an acceptable level, use fertilizer with a ratio of 0-10-10 or something similar. If the phosphorus levels are already good, use fertilizer with a ratio of 10-0-10.
Do not use compost or compost tea to fertilize lantana. Nutrient levels in compost are highly variable. It could have nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium levels that are too high which can damage lantana.

"
"
Mix fertilizer into the garden soil before planting the lantana, if possible.,
Mix fertilizer into the soil if your lantana is already planted.,
Do not get fertilizer on the plant stems or leaves.,
Consider the season.",How to Fertilize Lantana2," Sprinkle 2 pounds of fertilizer over each 100 square feet of garden space and mix it into the top 4 to 6 inches of soil with a dirt shovel or tiller., Sprinkle the fertilizer over the soil around the plant in early spring and mix it into the top 2 inches of soil with a hand rake.


Be careful not to disturb the roots by mixing it in too deep.

, It will burn them. If the fertilizer does get on the plants, wash it off right away with water from the garden hose. Water the lantana right after spreading the fertilizer to help wash it down to the roots.

, In early summer, if the lantana is growing well and blooming profusely, give it another dose of fertilizer but use only 1 pound per 100 square feet."
"
Pick out the right fertilizer.,
Feed your lantana frequently.,
Use water-soluble fertilizer and apply the fertilizer solution immediately after watering the lantana.,
Dilute the fertilizer.,
Watch for signs that your lantana is not getting enough, or getting too much fertilizer.",How to Fertilize Lantana3," Container-grown lantana should be given houseplant fertilizer for flowering plants with a 5-10-5 ratio once each month.A higher middle number, which is phosphorus, will help promote more profuse flowering.
A container-grown lantana must be given houseplant fertilizer. Garden fertilizer will burn the roots because it is too strong.

, When grown in a container, a lantana needs more frequent applications of fertilizer because it is watered more often than lantana planted in the ground.


With such frequent irrigation, the fertilizer is washed out of the soil quickly.

, Do not give fertilizer solution to a dry lantana as it will burn the roots.

, A common dilution rate is 1 teaspoon of liquid fertilizer per quart of water but this varies, depending on the fertilizer formula. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.


Water it generously until the water flows freely from the bottom of the container to help wash excess fertilizer from the soil. After the lantana recovers and begins growing again, only give it fertilizer every six to eight weeks.

, If the leaves on the lantana turn yellow it is probably due to lack of nutrients. Increase the application frequency to twice each month.


If it stops growing and blooming or if the leaves wilt and develop dry brown edges, it is getting too much fertilizer.

It is best to use a container with a diameter little more than double the diameter of that of the caudex (swollen base). It should have at least three holes at the bottom to facilitate drainage and aeration. Cover the holes with gravel up to one fourth height of the pot.;
, This should be done in line with the usual succulent mix. Use one part of garden soil, one part of coarse (river) sand and two parts of leaf mould and mix them thoroughly. Please remember to grind the soil and the leaf mould well before mixing. Alternatively, one part garden soil, one part compost, half part coarse sand, half part perlite and half part vermiculite can be used.

, Adeniums prefer bright light; hence, place the pots in an area where plenty of direct sunlight is available. In most areas it is best to provide the highest level of light possible. The exception are locales that experience extremely high temperatures combined with low humidity and drying winds. Under these conditions you will need to provide some shade during the seasons of most intense weather.

,


Fill the pots until the desired level with the potting mix so that the tip of the roots will touch it. 
Then, hold the plant carefully at the centre of the pot, allow the roots to hang inside and place rest of the potting mix loosely around the roots until it covers them up.
Tamp down the mix delicately, if necessary with a small stick, around the roots. You may also knock the pot softly on the ground, to settle the potting soil.

, This means applying water until the potting mix is saturated and the excess begins to run out through the drainage holes.


The amount of time between subsequent watering will vary based on your conditions, container size, and whether your plant is in active growth or not. Ideally, the mix should be allowed to almost dry before watering again.
Provide ample water during the growing season. If your soil is well drained and the weather is warm and sunny, the roots rapidly absorb soil moisture which is lost through normal transpiration. In well drained soils during active growth in the heat of midsummer, plants can literally be watered daily.
Restrict water a bit during cooler, cloudy periods, and cut back on watering as fall approaches.

, During the summer growing season, fertilize as you would with other houseplants. Stop fertilizing entirely during the winter. Nitrogen content of the used fertilizer should always be on the lower side.


A low nitrogen NPK, as in the ratio of 10-15-15 can be used in a diluted, liquid form. Depending on the season, growth rate and the overall health of the plant, this can be mixed with the drenching water every 2nd or 3rd watering. Always dilute more than the stated instructions advise, as recommended dosage is too strong for these plants.
For the organic option, liquid cow dung manure, obtained by mixing fresh cow dung with water (1 Kg in 10 Litres) and storing it for a week, can be used in 1 in 15 dilution once in a week while watering.

,


An annual pruning from the second year of age helps develop a well shaped plant and increase flowering. Pruning is especially required when the branches become unusually long and slender, or the plant looks leggy. It is best undertaken just before the onset of spring, when the plant is coming out of its winter lethargy and is getting ready to produce new offshoots.

,


For a good caudex to grow, Adeniums need to be transplanted periodically. A plant that is growing well can be taken out of its old pot at the onset of spring, its root system thoroughly washed of the old soil mix, treated with anti-fungal, air-dried for 10 days and then re-potted into a fresh medium, in an one size larger pot. The caudex should be lifted up by half to one inch at every re-potting and any damaged or tangled up roots should be carefully slant-pruned before the roots are treated with anti-fungal medication.

,



Seeds: The real trick to adenium seed starting is to make sure that you start out with fresh seeds. Fresh seeds will have a higher germination rate as well as germinating faster.

Begin starting adenium seeds by preparing a container with a well-draining growing medium, like a perlite or sand and soil mix. Place the seed in the growing medium, just covering them with the growing medium.
Water from below daily and from above once every three days until the seedlings appear. Keep the temperature of the growing medium at between 80 and 85 F.
Your adenium seeds should germinate in one week, if the seeds are fresh. If they are not fresh, it may take longer (if at all).
Once the seedlings appear, water only from below. In about a month, the seedlings will be large enough to transplant to a permanent container.



Cuttings: Take a cutting from the tip of a branch. Allow the cutting to dry out for a day or two, then wet the end of the desert rose cutting and dip it in rooting hormone. Stick the cutting into a well draining growing medium like perlite or sand mixed with soil. Water the cutting daily, making sure the water is able to drain out of the soil. Use a spray bottle and mist the cutting daily as well.

The cutting should take root in about two to six weeks.
Take out the rooted cuttings, and repot them in individual pots.

For most orchids, spring is the ideal time for transplantation, but there are also other factors to consider. An orchid should be transplanted:After the plant has bloomed and is growing new roots or leaves
When the roots and plant start to overgrow the current pot
When it’s not currently flowering or forming new flowers
If the pot breaks
If the plant becomes infested with bugs
If growing medium is wet and not draining properly;
, Pot choice for orchids is important, and this includes the size and the style. Transplanting an orchid into a pot that’s too large will force the plant to focus on root growth rather than flowering. Also, for an orchid to survive, it has to be placed in a pot with drainage holes.


Pick a pot that will allow for one to two years of growth, but nothing larger than that. If you're not sure about how much growth there will be, opt for a pot that’s just one size larger than the current one.You can use plastic or terra cotta pots for orchids. Terra cotta pots require more frequent watering.
Use pots with holes in the sides so there's lots of air flow.
Opt for a shallow pot versus a deep one to prevent water buildup.

, Most orchids don’t grow in the ground like other plants, but instead grow on trees. Because of this, many orchids cannot grow in regular potting soil, and instead need a very loose soil that’s amended with chunks of bark and other organic matter.Popular mediums for orchids include coconut husk, sphagnum moss, perlite, fir bark, and mixtures of these.

, Before transplanting your orchid, give it some water three days prior to help reduce the shock of transplanting. Don’t give it more water than usual, however. Instead, give it enough to moisten the growing medium it’s currently in.Remember to fertilize your orchid once per week with a weak 20-20-20 fertilizer solution., Many orchid media are dry, and soaking the medium before transplanting will help it absorb and retain more moisture. To soak the medium:Fill the new orchid pot with as much growing medium as you'll need to repot the orchid
Transfer the medium to a bucket that’s about twice as large as the new pot
Fill the bucket the rest of the way with water
Let the medium soak for one to two hours
Strain the medium through a fine-mesh strainer
Pour running water over the medium to remove dust

, Once you remove the orchid from its current pot, you'll need a sterilized knife or scissors to trim dead roots and leaves. It’s important to use a sterilized tool to prevent the spread of viruses and diseases.


One way to sterilize your cutting tool is by holding it over an open flame until the metal glows red hot.You can also soak the knife or scissors in a disinfectant, such as iodine or alcohol. Soak for about 20 minutes.
Another way to sterilize your instrument is by boiling it in water for 20 minutes.

, Place your hand over the base of the orchid so your hand covers the top of the pot. Hold the pot with your other hand, and gently turn the orchid upside down into the hand that’s cradling the plant.


If the orchid is clinging to the pot, massage it out by gently wiggling it back and forth.
Only cut roots or stems if you cannot gently shake the orchid loose from the pot. If you have to make any cuts, preserve as much of the root or stem as possible., While still holding the plant carefully with one hand, gently pick away as much old medium as possible with your fingers. When you’ve removed the bulk of the medium, rinse the roots under warm water to remove the remainder.Removing all the old medium will ensure that your orchid gets the most nutrients possible when you transplant it, and will make sure any bugs are destroyed.

, Once your orchid is clean, inspect it carefully for dead leaves, stems, roots, and pseudobulbs. Use your sterilized cutting tool to trim away any roots that are soft and brown, any leaves that are yellowing, and any pseudobulbs that are black and shrivelled.


A pseudobulb is a feature on some orchid types. It’s a bulbous growth near the base of the plant that will have a leaf growing from it.If you're transplanting multiple orchids at once, sterilize your cutting tool in between plants by wiping it with a disinfectant or heating it with a flame.

, Cinnamon is a powerful fungicide that can help protect the orchid from infection and rot. Use ground cinnamon and sprinkle the ends of any roots, stems, pseudobulbs, or leaves that you trimmed off.You can also use an orchid-specific fungicide.

, Gently bring your orchid to its new pot and place the roots inside. Make sure the plant sits in the new pot at the same depth as it did in the old one, or so that the lowest leaf’s base is a half-inch (1.3 cm) lower than the pot’s rim.If your orchid is sitting too low, remove the plant and add a layer of medium to the bottom of the pot.


For orchids with pseudobulbs, position the orchid so the pseudobulb is at the edge of the pot.
For orchids growing from a single major stem, position the orchid in the center of the pot.

, Sprinkle the growing medium into the pot, and use your fingers to gently press the medium in and around the roots. Add enough medium so that it comes up to the base of the orchid.


When you’ve added all the medium and packed it loosely around the roots, carefully tilt the pot from side to side to make sure the orchid doesn’t flop around. If it does, pack in a bit more medium.To settle the medium in place, pick up the pot and gently tap the bottom against a flat surface a couple times.

, Spray the orchid with water for three weeks, but only after the roots begin to grow. Once the orchid is settled in its new pot, add enough water to soak the medium thoroughly. Over the next few weeks, you may have to water the orchid more frequently until the medium is able to absorb and retain more moisture.


Once the orchid is fully established, water it every two weeks or so, when the medium becomes dry to the touch.
Make sure that you fertilize your orchid once per week using a weak 20-20-20 fertilizer solution., Orchids can easily become top heavy if they have a lot of flowers that bloom at once. Prevent them from slumping over by attaching the plant to a stake.


Insert a thin bamboo stake into the center of the pot.
Gently tie the main stem to the stake with soft string. Tie the plant at the middle and near the top., To reduce the plant’s stress from being repotted, move it somewhere that gets filtered sun only. Keep it out of full and direct sunlight for about a week. To provide more humidity, mist the stems, leaves, and roots twice a day for a week.You can also cover the orchid with fleece to help provide extra humidity.
After a week, return the orchid to its regular place. Orchids like full but not direct sunlight. Behind a curtain or shade is ideal.

Trace the spike to the base of the pseudobulb.,
Cut the spike as close to the pseudobulb as possible.",How to Prune Orchids1," You should only trim the orchid after its flowers have died off. Ideally, the spike attached to the bloom should also show signs of yellowing.


Usually, the flowers will last roughly eight weeks before they die off.;
, Follow the spike down until you see the point at which it emerges from the pseudobulb. This will usually lie somewhere between the pseudobulb and a leaf.


The pseudobulb is a notably thickened portion of the stem with an oval or bulb-like shape. It typically lies just above the ground.

, Hold the spike upright and still with your non-dominant hand. Use your dominant hand and a sharp cutting tool to cut the spike as close to the pseudobulb as possible.


Be careful so that you do not cut your fingers or cut into the pseudobulb. You can leave as much as 1 inch (2.5 cm) of old spike behind.

Try to determine the age of your orchid.,
Look at the color of the orchid's leaves.,
Measure the humidity of the air surrounding the plant using a humidity meter.,
Determine the temperature around your plant during day and nighttime hours with a thermometer.,
Make sure that the orchid gets sunlight during the day and darkness at night.,
Be sure to fertilize your orchid with 20-20-20 fertilizer once every month.",How to Make a Vanilla Orchid Plant Bloom," Unfortunately, vanilla orchids cannot bloom until they are three years old. If yours is younger than three, it will not bloom and cannot be rushed.;
,


If they are dark green, that means they are getting too much sun exposure. Move the plant to a less sunny area.
If the leaves are yellow or even a brown color, this means that there is not enough sun exposure. Try moving it to a sunnier spot, such as a window ledge.
If the leaves are a light green, that means there is a perfect amount of sunlight reaching it. The incorrect amount of sunlight can inhibit the blooming.

, Vanilla orchids require fifty percent humidity in order to bloom.


If the air seems too dry, try placing the plant on a tray and fill the tray with water so that the air fills with humidity as the water evaporates. Top off the tray as often as needed, to ensure the tray has standing water in it at all times.

, Orchids require a temperature of 70 °F (21 °C) during the day but allow a ten degree drop in the evening in order to bloom properly. Set your indoor temperature controls to make sure the temperature is set just right for proper blooming of your orchid plant.

, This plays a huge role in the proper blooming of Vanilla orchids.

, Cut back on fertilization every six months when the orchid grows more slowly. Under-fertilization will result in no blooming at all or just a few small blooms.

Wait for the flower to die.,
Locate the inactive bud.,
Make the cut.",How to Prune Orchids2," The flowers on your orchid should be dead before you prune the spike. To cause as little potential damage as possible, you should also wait until the top of the spike shows signs of yellowing.


Note that this type of pruning should only be done to mature orchids that have reached a minimum foliage height of 12 inches (30.5 cm).

, Look at the bracts or beige bands running down the spike, each positioned roughly 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart. The inactive bud should be located just below the widest bract.


This bottom bract should widen into the shape of a shield.
When you prune the orchid just above this bud, you cut away a portion of the spike containing hormones that prevent the bud from growing. In doing so, you allow the bud to begin growing again, and you may see a new spike growing within a few weeks. This spike has the potential to flower again.

, Grab the spike with your non-dominant hand and keep it upright and steady. With your dominant hand and a sharp cutting tool, cut the spike 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the wide, shield-shaped bract.

"
"
Wait for the flowers to fade.,
Find the old bud sheath.,
Locate the point at which the bud sheath meets the stem.,
Cut through the sheath and the spike.",How to Prune Orchids3," Only prune your orchid once the flowers wither and die. The spike attached to the blooms should begin to yellow, as well.

, You should see the vertical spike emerging from a wide, green section of plant material, known as the bud sheath. When you shine a light at the back of this sheath, you should be able to see the lower part of the spike.


Note that a bud sheath will either be green or papery brown. Color is not necessarily an indication of sheath health, though.
The bud sheath protects immature buds as they bloom and will not die off even when the flowers and spike are dying.
Make sure that the sheath is an old one. Ideally, you should see flowers or spikes visible. If you cannot see any from the top of the sheath, squeeze the sheath gently to make sure that there are no fresh, healthy buds inside.

, Trace the sheath down the stem, toward the pseudobulb. The sheath and its spike originate at the top of this pseudobulb, usually protected by one or two leaves.


Note that the pseudobulb is a portion of the stem that emerges directly above the ground. It is wider than the rest of the stem and looks somewhat bulb-shaped.

, Hold the upper part of the sheath and spike steady with your non-dominant hand. Use a sharp cutting tool to cut through both the sheath and the spike, positioning the cut as close to the base of the protective leaves as possible.


Do not cut through the leaves or the pseudobulb.

"
"
Wait for the blooms to fade.,
Remove the spike, but not the stem.,
Cut surplus stems only when repotting.",How to Prune Orchids4," Make sure that the flowers are spent before you prune the orchid. The blooms should be wilted, and you should see the spike yellowing or browning.

, The flower spike begins at the tip of the stem, directly above the top set of leaves. Hold the spike still with your non-dominant hand, then use your dominant hand to make a clean cut at the base of the spike using a sharp cutting tool.


Avoid cutting into the stem.
While not always the case, the stem is usually green while the spike is often brown or greenish-brown.
The spike has no leaves on it, so you should be able to determine where the stem ends and the spike begins based on that.

, A strong orchid will usually have at least three mature stems, even though these stems will no longer flower. The best time to remove a surplus of old stems is when you re-pot the orchid.


The stems gather energy and produce food for the rest of the plant, so it's beneficial to keep them until they die completely.
When you do prune stems, choose stems that are leafless and yellowing. After removing the plant from its current pot, cut the horizontal rhizome--the horizontal root stem attached to upright, dying stem. Carefully remove the portion attached to any shriveled stems before transplanting the orchid into its new pot.

"
"
Trim blackened leaves.Regularly examine your orchid leaves for black spots or similar signs of damage.,
Cut off unhealthy roots when re-potting the orchid.,
Leave healthy growth alone.,
Only prune during the orchid's rest state.",How to Prune Orchids5," Use a sterile, sharp cutting tool to trim only the damaged portions.


Do not cut off any portions of a leaf that are undamaged.
Leave undamaged leaves intact, no matter how many other leaves have been damaged.
Orchid leaves will blacked due to a range of causes, including bacterial disease, fungal disease, over fertilization, over watering, and exposure to hard water.
You can also remove whole leaves that have yellowed and withered, but only if the leaves have weakened so much that you can remove them by lightly pulling on them with your fingers.

, When you remove the orchid from its current pot, examine the roots. Look for any unhealthy roots and carefully cut them away with sterile, sharp scissors or clippers.


Unhealthy roots will look brown and feel mushy.
Make sure that you only cut away unhealthy roots that are dead and dying. Work carefully to avoid accidentally pruning off healthy roots.
To verify that a root is dead, cut off a small piece first. Examine it more closely. If it still looks fresh and white, do not cut any more of that root, since it is still alive. If it looks brown, shriveled, or rotted, continue cutting the rest of that root away.

, No matter which portion of the orchid you are pruning—spike, leaf, or root—you should only cut away unproductive or visibly dying portions of the plant. Removing healthy growth can hurt your orchid.


The sole purpose of orchid pruning is to remove unproductive parts of the plant so that the rest of the plant can get a higher concentration of nutrients. Pruning healthy parts of the plant will not improve the way the orchid grows in later seasons.
Orchids utilize a process called ""trans-location."" During this process, dying parts continue feeding healthy parts by moving nutrients. As such, you should avoid pruning any part of the plant until it shows visible signs of death.

, Usually, an orchid enters its rest state during the late fall.


An orchid pruned during its growth cycle can go into shock and suffer permanent damage.

Sow your seeds (optional).,
Make sure to give your seedlings enough space.",How to Grow Black Eyed Susan Flowers1," Black Eyed Susan plants thrive in full sun but will also grow in partial or bright shade. They are not very particular about soil type or pH though, which makes them easy to grow just about anywhere, even if they have to deal with some shade.;
, While they don’t necessarily care about the pH of their soil, they do prefer organically rich soil that drains quickly. If the soil is predominantly sand or clay, mix in a 2- to 3-inch depth of sphagnum peat moss, well-aged cow manure, compost or leaf mold.


This addition of organic matter will improve soil fertility, texture and drainage. Use a rototiller to mix the organic matter into the soil to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).

, Plant Black Eyed Susan plants in early spring right after the last expected hard frost has passed. Plants are readily available at garden centers.


Black Eyed Susan can also be planted by seed. When starting from seed, sow them directly into the soil in your garden around the last frost date, or start them indoors around the end of February or beginning of March.

, Sow the seeds in a half and half mixture of sand and sphagnum peat moss. Leave the seeds so that they are barely covered with the soil mixture. Keep them warm, between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 to 23.8 degrees Celsius), and moist until they sprout.


When the seedlings have two sets of leaves, transplant them into cell packs or individual pots.

, Whether you grow your seedlings from seed, or purchase your seedlings at a nursery, you will have to give them enough space in your garden. Seedlings should be planted about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart so there is plenty of room for good air circulation around the plants after they reach their mature width. Increased air circulation reduces the likelihood of fungal diseases.


If the seeds are sown directly in the garden, thin the seedlings to 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart when they are a few inches tall.

Water them only once or twice each week during dry spells from the second year on. Try to avoid getting the foliage wet, as this can cause mildew to form.

, Spread a 2-inch depth of organic mulch over the soil around the plants to help retain moisture in the soil. You don’t need to give your plants fertilizer, as they grow well enough without it.

, Remove the flowers as they begin to fade to encourage the plants to produce more flowers or, if more Black Eyed Susan plants are desired, leave a few of the flowers on the stems to go to seed.


Trim all of the stems right down to the ground in late winter to make room for fresh growth in the spring.

, This dividing should be done in March. Prepare the planting site before digging them up if the divisions are to be replanted. Water the plants one to two days before digging them up. To dig your plants up and divide them:


Push a dirt shovel into the soil all the way around the plants 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the stems to sever the roots. Push the dirt shovel into the soil again and lift the whole clump up with the tip of the shovel.
Carefully work the plants apart, being sure to leave a good fist-full of roots and three to five healthy stems on each division. Replant them right away or pot them up in soil-based potting soil to give away to neighbors, friends and family.

It's much easier to buy a bird of paradise plant or cutting rather than to start the plant from seed, but if you have patience it can be done. Look for bird of paradise seeds or plants in your local garden nursery.


If you live in an area where the climate is conducive to growing bird of paradise outside, you may be able to find seeds and cuttings in more than one variety.
If you live in a place with cold winters, where bird of paradise won't survive outside, you're more likely to find a mature bird of paradise that has already been potted as a houseplant.
If you prefer to plant seeds, get fresh seeds, soak them in water for three days (changing the water daily), and plant them while they're still fresh.;
, Bird of paradise requires a steady temperature between 50-72 degrees Fahrenheit (10-20 degrees Celsius). If the temperature dips below freezing or gets very hot where you live, bird of paradise will die if planted in the garden. Luckily, it grows very well in a pot indoors, so you can enjoy bird of paradise no matter where you live.

, Bird of paradise grows best in rich, moist soil that has been amended with plenty of compost so that it drains well. Good drainage is key to the health of bird of paradise. The plant will die if its roots stay wet and waterlogged.


If you're planting bird of paradise outdoors, till the soil in your planting bed to a depth of 12 inches (30.5 cm). Work in 4 inches (10.2 cm) of rich compost or other organic material in order to enrich the soil and promote good drainage.
If you're planting bird of paradise in a pot, fill up a large clay pot (equipped with drainage holes) with rich, loamy potting soil. You can mix in a tablespoon of bone meal to make the soil even richer.

, Bird of paradise requires full sun, so look for a spot that gets at least five hours of sunlight per day. It can survive in partial shade, but it flourishes in sun.


If you're growing bird of paradise inside, it's important to keep it in the brightest room in your house. When the temperature outside is right, you also have the choice to place the plant in a sunny spot outdoors; just make sure to bring it in when the air gets too hot or cold., Depending on the variety you have and the level of care you give it, bird of paradise can grow to be 5 ft (1.5 m ) tall. It's a large plant that takes up quite a bit of space, so space your plants about 6 ft (1.8 m) apart if you’re planting outdoors.

, Inadequate watering is the most common cause of death for bird of paradise. It's very important to keep the soil evenly moist, but not drenched. Water the plant deeply one or two times a week, giving the soil time to dry out a little in between waterings. Aim to water give the plant about an inch of water per week.


From November through February, water just once a week. The soil should be kept a little drier in the fall and winter months. You can also mist the plant in order to keep the humidity up.
If you're watering a bird of paradise in a container, water until it begins to come through the bottom of the pot. Be sure place a drainage dish under the container and discard excess water.

, This helps keep bird of paradise healthy and happy during the spring and summer. Use a 10-10-10 fertilizer around the base of the plant every two weeks from March through September., The bird of paradise doesn’t require much pruning. You need only cut off old flower stalks at the base of the plant to keep your bird of paradise healthy. Do this in the springtime for best results., If you're growing bird of paradise outside, make sure aphids and other pests don't cause damage. If you see aphids on the stalk or leaves of your bird of paradise, pick them off and put them in a pail of soapy water. You can also rinse them off with a strong burst from the hose, and repeat as necessary.


Using pesticides on the plant may harm it, so it's better to take care of pests by physically removing them or rinsing them off.

, If you live in a place where the temperature drops below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) in the winter, you'll need to bring your potted plant inside. Make sure to do so before the first frost of the season, or your bird of paradise may suffer.

, A mature bird of paradise plant can be divided into two or even three parts, so you'll have a few extra plants to keep or give to your friends. Carefully remove the the plant from the pot, making sure not to damage the roots. You may need to use a spatula or another tool to help you remove the root ball.

, You'll see smaller shoots coming off of the main stem or trunk. Follow them down to the attached roots and carefully untangle the roots so you can separate the plant into two or three parts. A bit of root damage will be inevitable, but try to cause as little as possible.


You may need to use a knife to help you complete the separation.
Cut off roots that get bent or damaged once the plants are separate. A clean cut is better than a tear.

, This step is not completely necessary, but it can help to increase the chance that the new cuttings will survive and grow into healthy plants. You can find rooting hormone at any garden center. Follow the directions on the product's package to lightly dust the ends of the roots with rooting hormone., Remember to choose a rich, well-draining potting soil, and fill each pot to within a few inches of the rim. Plant each cutting in the center of a separate pot.

, This gives the cut roots time to form a light protective seal, which will keep them from getting waterlogged when you water. After two or three days, care for the plants as instructed above.

, Indeed, the sunnier, the better. This plant is a good bedding plant. If you'd rather grow it in containers, it will be happy to grow in pots, window boxes and hanging baskets.

, This plants should not be water-logged.

, Once established, the plant should be watered weekly during the warmer months and sparingly during winter and cooler weather.

, This will also encourage lots of purple blooms.

, This is important to encourage new wood growth and to stop the plant from becoming too straggly and sprawled.

The seed-started begonias tend to be a bit smaller and difficult to grow, while bulb begonias are sturdier and larger plants. Both varieties come in many color options including shades of pink, white, purple, yellow, and red. Bulb and seed begonias are annuals, although the bulbs can be saved and replanted in later years. Growing begonias from seeds or bulbs is quite difficult, so it is recommended that you head to your local nursery to pick up a small potted begonia to transplant.


In rare opportunities, you may find a type of perennial begonia, but these aren’t common.
You can choose to start begonias from cuttings as well.;
, Begonias are one of many common flowers that can be grown successfully both indoors and outdoors. They like light or dappled (rather than full) shade, making them the perfect addition to your houseplant collection. If you plant your begonias in a pot, choose a location in your house on an eastern, western, or southern facing window. They can also be placed on a shaded porch, which gets plenty of ambient sunlight. If you’re planting them in garden, place them in a shady patch under other larger plants or on the northern side of your garden.


Begonias can handle partial sun, but avoid placing them in direct sunlight. Also, red-leaved begonias handle heat better than green-leaved begonias.
If the shade is too dense, your begonias won’t grow properly. Choose an area with indirect sunlight and partial shade.
If you don’t have any indoor window space for potted begonias, you’ll need to use a fluorescent lamp in order to provide them with a bit of light.

, Rather, don’t prepare soil at all, as begonias grow better in soil-free garden mix than then do in typical ‘dirt’. Prepare a mixture of ⅔ peat moss and ⅓ soil-free potting mixture (available at gardening supply stores and nurseries). Begonias like acidic, well-draining environments which the peat moss mixture easily provide. If you must use soil outside, incorporate plenty of peat moss and organic matter into the soil to provide the best environment for your begonias.


If you use a peat moss mixture, soak the moss in boiling water and allow it to cool prior to planting the begonias.
You can use a 20-20-20 liquid fertilizer on your soil/soil mixture for some added nutrients for the begonias.

, Begonias are annuals, so they won’t grow back each year. Therefore, each year you will have to replant them, typically in mid spring. Begonias don’t handle cold temperatures and frost well, so wait until at least one week after the final frost of winter to plant them. If nothing else, plant them in a pot early indoors, and then transplant them outdoors when the weather warms up., If you are planting your begonias outside, dig a hole a few inches deep for seeds and bulbs, or large enough to cover the root ball of a potted plant. Begonias that are going to be placed in raised beds or pots should be given a container only slightly larger than their root ball, or intermixed in a larger container with other potted plants. Begonias don’t need much space, so feel free to plant them closely to other plants in your garden, or near the edge of your pot/bed., Remove the bulbs, seeds, or transplant and place it in the hole you’ve dug. Each begonia plant should be placed in its own hole, although these can be put close together. Cover the top of the root ball, bulb, or seeds with a few inches of soil/potting mixture. If you’re planting a small begonia plant, break apart the root ball a bit before placing it in the hole.

, Most plants need a bit of extra watering after first being planted, in order to avoid what is known as ‘transplant shock’. Give your begonias a heavy watering, so that the soil is moist but not drenched. The flowers will need to be watered every few days from there on, either manually or with a sprinkler system. Begonias don’t tolerate heavy waterings well, so keep the soil moist but not wet. In fact, if it rains heavily in your area, you may have to move your begonias onto a porch or indoors to prevent them from drowning.


Be sure to water at the base of the plant, rather than directly on the leaves. Also, don’t mist your begonias.

, If you planted your begonias in a pot on your porch or indoors, you won’t have to deal with weeds much. However, if your plants are in an outdoor garden, check for weeds every few days and pull them out. Add a 20-20-20 liquid fertilizer about once a month, or mix in a bit of compost and peat moss for added nutrients. You can choose to mulch your garden if you would like, as this will trap moisture (meaning less frequent waterings) and prevent new weeds from sprouting.

, Over time, you’ll notice that the flowers on the begonia plant will begin to brown and die. At this point, you should do a process known as ‘deadheading’. This involved cutting or pulling off the dead flower head, so as to promote new growth and divert nutrients to other parts of the plant. At the end of the blooming season, remove all the dead buds and leave the green plant. This way, the nutrients the plant gathers will all be stored in the bulb for the next growing season, rather than going to help the flower buds that are already dead.

, Although outdoor plants are always at risk for abuse from nature, indoor plants can become pest-ridden as well. Keep your begonias safe from slugs and snails outdoors by crushing eggshells and placing them around the base of the plant. Indoor plants often become infested with mealy bugs, which can be killed with a bit of regular rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. Other pests can be done away with a mild insecticide used for gardening. Talk to a local nursery worker to get advice on the best method for your begonias., Begonias aren’t typically used in floral arrangements because they lack long stems, but you can pick the flowers for decorative uses such as pressings. Pinch or pluck the flower from the top of the greenery, avoiding taking too many leaves/too much of the stem with it. You can pick as many as you like during the growing season, as they should grow back after several days.

, If your plants aren’t dead when it begins to freeze outside, you can save them by bringing them indoors. This really only works for potted plants outdoors, though. Place the pots in a window that gets lots of sunlight. For the first 1-2 weeks indoors, the begonias will drop lots of leaves, but this is normal for being transplanted. They should be good as new after acclimating to their new environment.

, At the end of the year when your plants are all preparing for the winter, you can save the bulbs from your begonias to replant the following spring. Wait until the plant has completely browned, and then pull all the major stems/leaves from the bulb. Put the bulb(s) onto a grate or screen in a cool, dry area to dry out for 5-7 days. When they are totally dry, they can be put away for storing. The bulbs should then be placed in a cardboard box full of dry peat moss until they are ready to be replanted in the spring."

Watch out for pests and disease.",How to Grow Asters," If you choose to sow seeds indoors, you should do so roughly one to two months before your expected transplant date.


Note that seed germination tends to be fairly uneven, so do not expect all of the seeds you sow to grow.
Since seed germination is so unpredictable, many gardeners prefer to buy seedlings from a garden nursery or to use plants divided from previously established asters.;
, Fill the compartments of a large plastic seedling tray or flat with a seed starting soil blend.


You can use plastic cups, pots, or other small containers if you do not have a seedling tray. The containers should be 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) deep.

, Place one seed in each seedling compartment. Push the seed into the soil until it is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep.Lightly brush soil over the hole created by the seed after setting it into a compartment.

, Loosely cover the seedling tray with plastic wrap and place the entire thing in a refrigerator. Keep it there for four to six weeks.


Chilling the seeds artificially mimics the chilling process seeds would undergo in nature. Using a refrigerator instead of using the cold ground outdoors ensures that the seeds will not freeze and die.

, Remove the seeds from the refrigerator roughly two to four weeks before the last expected frost. Place the tray in a sunny spot indoors.


This spot should receive at least six hours of sunlight each day.
You will need to wait until the seedlings form before you can move anything outdoors. This will usually happen quickly.

, Transplant aster seedlings outdoors in early to mid spring after the threat of frost has passed.


This is true regardless of whether you are working with seedlings started indoors, seedlings bought from a nursery, or plants divided from previously established asters.

, Asters thrive in sites receiving full sun to partial shade. The soil can be rich or of average quality, but it must be capable of draining well.


Avoid planting asters in heavy clay soils since these tend to drain poorly.
Planting asters at the top of a slight incline or hill can improve soil drainage, but it is not strictly necessary to do so.

, Unless the soil is notably rich already, you should mix a little nutrient dense compost into it before transplanting the asters.


Use a garden fork or tiller to loosen the top 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm) of soil at the planting site.
Add 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of compost. Mix this compost into the loosened soil using the garden fork., Each hole should be twice as wide as the diameter of the seedling compartment or pot currently holding the aster plant. The depth of the hole should be roughly the same depth as the current container.


Space individual plants 1 to 3 feet (30 to 90 cm) apart. Miniature varieties may only need to be spaced apart 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm).

, Gently press on the sides of the plastic compartment holding each seedling. Start from the bottom and slowly work your way up. The seedling, its root ball, and the attached soil should ease out of the compartment.


If you have difficulty removing the seedling, dampen the soil with water first. Wet soil is more compact and easier to move.
If you cannot press on the sides of the container to remove the seedling, tip the container on its side and carefully insert a trowel down one side. Wiggle the trowel around inside the pot until you can glide it out along with the root ball and attached soil.

, Place each aster plant in the center of its planting hole so that the top of the root ball is even with the surface of the soil around it.


Carefully fill in the rest of the hole around the root ball with some of the soil you previously removed from the planting site.
Use your hands to gently pat the soil firmly in place.

, As soon as the seedlings are in the ground, you should water the soil thoroughly to help settle the soil and encourage the plants to establish themselves.


There should not be any major puddles on the surface of the soil, but the soil should be visibly damp.

, Surround the asters with 2 inches (5 cm) of mulch immediately after planting and every spring.


Before adding new mulch in the spring, remove any old mulch.
Mulch keeps the soil cool in the summer and warm in the winter. It also helps to limit and prevent weed growth.

, Monitor the amount of rain you get each week during the growing season. If you get less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of rain during one week, you should soak the soil of the planting site.


Asters are sensitive to moisture and will usually become visibly weakened if they receive too much or too little moisture.
Plants that receive too little water will usually lose flowers and leaves.
Plants that receive too much water may start to yellow and wither.

, At minimum, you should mix a thin layer of compost into the soil each spring before new growth starts to form.


For even better results, mix a balanced, general purpose fertilizer into the soil once a month. Apply the fertilizer as directed on the package label.

, You'll need to do some light pruning in the spring and some heavy pruning in the fall.


Pinch young shoots in the spring to redirect growth outward. Doing so will create a bushier plant.
Cut the entire aster plant back once the foliage dies in the winter. Cut down stem portions that appear sickly or scraggly, or trim the stems back completely to 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) above the soil line. Most aster varieties can withstand either option. Cutting the plant down can improve its long-term growth habit, but doing so will also delay flowering by several weeks.
If you live in a colder climate (USDA hardiness zones 5 and below), you may want to wait until spring before doing major pruning. Leaving the plants intact over harsh winters can improve their odds of survival.You can also remove dead flower blooms on an ongoing basis to improve the overall appearance of the plant, but doing so is not necessary for the health of the plant.If you do deadhead old blooms, do so carefully since new buds tend to be located nearby.

, Many asters can grow without staking, but if you have a larger variety that begins drooping, install a stake and train the foliage upright.


The stake you choose should be about 12 inches (30 cm) taller than the current height of the plant.
Hammer the stake into the ground roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) away from the main stem of the plant.
Use wool yarn or nylon stockings to gently tie the branches of the plant along the height of the stake.

, Dividing the plant as it gradually becomes fuller will allow it to distribute its resources more effectively. As a result, the plant will remain vigorous and the flowers will remain plentiful.


Wait until spring before dividing plants.
Carefully dig out half to two thirds of the established plant. Leave the remainder in its current location.Divide the portion you dug out into two or more sections. Each clump you divide off should have three to five shoots.
These divided portions can be planted in another area of your garden or a friend's garden. Treat these divided portions as new seedlings and transplant them accordingly.

, Asters don't often have difficulties with pests and diseases, but some varieties can fall victim to powdery mildew, rusts, white smut, leaf spots, stem cankers, aphids, tarsfonemid mites, slugs, nails, and nematodes.


Prevention is better than treatment. Your best option is to choose disease-resistant aster varieties for your garden.
When problems do arise, treat them with an appropriate pesticide or fungicide.

Purchase seeds at a garden store.,
Determine whether the seeds are hardy annuals, half-hardy annuals or tender annuals.,
Evaluate the size of the seeds.,
Determine the germination requirements.",How to Grow Annuals From Seed1," Seed packets are widely available at local garden centers, national garden store chains and online seed distributors. To ensure you are purchasing fresh seeds, check the date stamp on each seed packet.


Buy seeds in bulk. Some garden centers offer seeds in bulk, which can be less expensive than seed packets. Before purchasing bulk seeds, be sure you have a large area to plant all of the seeds because they cannot be stored for future growing seasons.;
, The category of the annual will determine when and where to start the seeds. Some annuals can be seeded directly into garden soil, while others should be started indoors. Consult the seed packets or seed catalogs to determine how hardy the annual is.


Select hardy annual seeds that can be sown directly in an outdoor garden. Plant hardy annual seeds in early- to mid- spring, as soon as the soil is ready for planting. Hardy annuals include spider flower, bachelor's buttons, pinks, calendula, larkspur, nigella, snapdragons, baby's breath, pincushion flower and heliotrope.
Choose half-hardy annual seeds than can be planted outdoors after the threat of hard frost has passed. Half-hardy annuals can withstand a light frost, but temperatures should not dip below 25 degrees F (3.89 degrees C). Some examples of half-hardy annuals include painted tongue, statice, China aster, nicotiana, chrysanthemum and salvia.
Start tender annuals indoors or after the threat of all frost. If starting the seeds indoors, start the seeds 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Otherwise, seeds can be sown directly into the ground in late spring or early summer when the nighttime temperature stays above 40 degrees F (4.44 degrees C). Tender annuals include cosmos, morning glories, marigold, zinnias, celosia, sunflowers and amaranth.

, Annual seeds come in a variety of sizes. Larger seeds are easier to plant directly into the garden soil, while smaller seeds (some are as small as dust particles) are harder to handle and may need to be planted indoors. As a general rule of thumb, plant seeds that are 1/8-inch (.32 cm) or larger directly in the outdoor garden soil.

, Many annual seeds germinate in 4 to 7 days, but some can take 3 to 4 weeks. Most annual seeds germinate in darkness, but others may require special lighting. Some seeds, such as morning glories and lupines, have hard seed coats that need to be soaked prior to planting. Research the germination requirements for your annual seeds before planting them.

Transplant the biennials to an outdoor location.,
Transplant the biennials to their permanent location.,
Mulch the plants through the winter.,
Sow a new set of biennials for the next season.,
Uproot the biennials after the second growing season.",How to Grow Biennials Successfully," Selecting biennials is largely a matter of aesthetic preferences. Because they are drawing from 2 years worth of plant growth, the flowers produced by biennial plants tend to be larger and more impressive than those of annuals. This makes them ideal for high-impact focal points in your garden landscape. Some examples of popular and hardy biennials include Hollyhock, Foxglove, Wallflower, Sweet William, Forget-me-not, and Evening Primrose.;
, A few weeks before the last frost, you can start sowing the seeds. This is best done indoors using plastic cell packs, egg cartons, or other small containers. Fill the containers with potting mix and sprinkle the seeds over the top. Moisten the soil and cover loosely with plastic wrap to hold in the moisture. As soon as the leaves begin to appear, remove the plastic wrap. Keep the containers in a sunny location.

, After a few weeks, the plants should have grown 2 or 3 leaves, at which point they should be transplanted outdoors. You can plant them in their permanent location at this point, but they will fare better if placed in a nursery bed, cold frame, or greenhouse. Make sure to keep them watered and weeded for the first few weeks.

, You can do this anytime during the first growing season, but you must get the plants into their permanent location at least 6 weeks before the first frost or they won't establish themselves for the winter. By the onset of the first winter, biennial growth will be limited to a basal rosette of leaves - a circular cluster of leaves positioned near the soil.

, Covering the biennials with mulch is a good way to protect them from harsh winter weather, especially in cold regions. Mulch helps regulate soil temperature as well as preventing any weed growth.

, Because biennials only flower after 2 years, you'll want to sow new plants the second year so that you can enjoy flowers each year. This can be done following the same process as above. Note that most biennials are very adept at self-sowing, meaning they will readily seed the ground around them with new plants. This process can often provide you with continuous growth without any outside help.

, After the plants have finished flowering, you can either let them wither away in place or uproot them. Uprooted biennials can be placed in your compost pile, although you should take care to avoid getting their seeds in your compost or you will have them sprouting up everywhere in your garden.

Prepare the soil.,
Determine the lighting requirements for your annuals.,
Plant the seeds.,
Water as directed on the seed packet.,
Fertilize the seedlings with an organic, granular slow-release fertilizer.,
Thin the seedlings.",How to Grow Annuals From Seed2," Annuals typically thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 6.3 and 6.7. Add 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) of peat moss, compost or manure to the garden soil to build up organic matter and create a healthy environment for the seeds to grow.


Consider adding a seed-starting mix to the soil. Seed-starting mixes can be found at most garden centers. These nutrient-rich mixes can encourage seed growth.

, Consult the seed packet to determine how much light the annual plant will need. Many annuals need full sun, which is considered 6 or more hours of sunlight each day. Others, such as begonias or impatiens, thrive in the shade. Choose a location best suited for the sunlight requirements of your annual seeds.

, Consult the seed packet to determine the recommended depth and spacing for planting your annual seeds. In general, plant an annual seed at a depth that is 2 or 3 times the seed's diameter.


Plant small seeds near the top of the soil. To plant very small seeds, pour the seeds into the palm of your hand, take a pinch of the seeds with the thumb and forefinger of your opposite hand, and sprinkle the seeds over the soil. Using your hand, tap the seeds lightly into the soil so they are lightly covered with soil.
Plant larger seeds further into the soil. Use a screwdriver or pencil to poke a hole into the soil at the depth recommended on the seed packet. Place the seed into the hole and fill the hole with soil. Tap the soil lightly with your hand.

, Keep the water around the seed moist, but don't over-water or create puddles of standing water around the seeds.

, Fertilize the seeds immediately after planting. In most cases, annuals planted in the ground will not need additional fertilizer after the initial application.

, As seedlings begin to emerge, thin the plants so they are not growing right on top of each other. Consult the seed packet to determine the ideal spacing between mature plants.

However, annual seeds can be planted in almost any type of container, from egg cartons and plastic cups to muffin tins and milk cartons. Be sure to poke a drainage hold in the bottom of each container.

, Use a seed starting mix, available at most garden centers, to grow your seeds indoors. Regular garden soil will compress the seeds and prevent root growth. Wet the soil before adding it to the growing containers.

, Consult the directions on the seed packet to determine at what depth to plant the annual seeds. A good rule of thumb is to plant the annual seed at a depth that is 2 or 3 times the seed's diameter.

, Some experts recommend keeping containers on top of a refrigerator, which is warm and usually out of direct sunlight. Ideal temperatures for seed growth are usually between 60 and 75 degrees F (15.56 and 23.89 degrees C).

, The soil should be moist, but not too wet. Do not overwater the seeds or they may rot.

, Once the seeds sprout, transfer the container to a warm, sunny location. For best result, choose a bright south-facing window or place the seedlings under fluorescent grow-lights.


Thin seedlings to 1 plant for every 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), or 1 seedling per small container.

, Plant the seedlings on a cool, cloudy day. Excessive heat, sun and wind can stress to seedlings and may kill tender transplants. If the transplant day is sunny, plant the seedlings late in the day to avoid the harsh mid-day sun.


Remove weeds from the garden soil where the seedlings will be planted.
Plant the seedling. Dig a hole that is large enough for the seedling's root system, and place the seedling in the hole. Cover the hole with garden soil and gently tap down the soil around the plant using the palm of your hand.
Water the annuals after transplanting. During the first few weeks, keep the soil moist while the plant's roots become established. If plants start to wilt, water immediately.

Water regularly.,
Fertilize annuals in pots or containers.,
Mulch around the annuals.,
Stake tall annuals.",How to Grow Annuals From Seed4," Once they begin blooming, most annuals will flower throughout the growing season. To keep them blooming, pinch off (deadhead) old flowers as they begin to wilt or fade. As long as the old blooms are removed, the plant will continue to produce flowers. Consult the seed packet to determine if your annuals benefit from deadheading. Some annuals, such as begonias, should not be deadheaded.

, Annuals have shallow root systems, so they require regular watering. For best results, water in the morning so the plants dry in the sun. Soak the soil completely, but be careful not to overwater, which can cause disease and fungus buildup. Monitor the health of your annuals to determine how often you need to water. If leaves or flowers droop or wilt, water the plants immediately.

, Annuals in the ground that were fertilized at planting typically do not need additional fertilizer. However, container-bound pots should be fertilized every few weeks with a water-soluble fertilizer. This will help maintain colorful flowers in the containers.

, Most annuals benefit from mulch, which helps the soil to retain moisture. Mulch also can help keep out weeds. Use organic mulch like shredded leaves, bark, grass clippings or other organic materials to improve the soil around the annuals.

, Some tall annuals can fall over, especially when they are in full bloom with heavy flowers. To keep them upright, stake them with wood and tie the tall stems to the stakes using twine.

"
Plant peonies in the late summer to early fall, at least six weeks before the ground typically freezes in your area.,
Dig a hole about 15 inches (38.1 cm) deep and wide enough to comfortably accommodate the roots.,
Wait for them to bloom.,
To make your peony produce even larger blossoms, leave only one of the large round buds on each stem, pinching off the smaller buds early in their development.",How to Grow and Care for Peonies," Choose the location for your peonies carefully. Once they are established, peony plants do not like to be disturbed. Plant them in a location where they will receive at least 6-8 hours of full sunlight daily during the growing season. Peonies won't grow well in wet soil or clay, but a raised bed will help avoid these problems.;
, Be very careful to not plant your peonies too deeply. Plant the new plant only to the level of soil the plant is presently growing in for good results. This is one area that peonies are very touchy about, it you get the “eye” to deep the plant will not bloom. However, you can dig it up and try again, planting more shallowly the next time. The tops of the pointed, red budding shoots should be an inch or two above the soil surface. Individual plants should be spaced about three feet apart.

, Peonies will begin to bloom anywhere from one to three years after they are planted, depending on the variety. The heavy blooms tend to flop over, especially after a rainfall, so you may want to stake your peony plants. An easy method of staking peonies is to set four stakes in the ground around the plant, then lace heavy twine back and forth from stake to stake to form a twine grid for the stems to grow through. You can also buy metal supports for peonies at garden centers.

, Cut off older blooms as they begin to fade but do not cut back the foliage until after a hard freeze. Then cut them back hard, leave only a few inches of growth, they will benefit from the “hair cut”. To avoid fungal diseases, the clippings should not be added to compost.


Ants on peonies are normal. This is a natural and temporary activity. It is believed that peonies produce small amounts of nectar and other ant attractants to encourage ants to help in opening the dense double flower buds found in many peonies. The ants may be found covering certain varieties and avoiding others, this is totally normal. Once the buds have opened the ants will disappear - also normal.

To show off the colorful annual blooms, select a container that draws attention to the plant, rather than the container.


Select a container that has drainage holes in the bottom or sides. Drainage is a key factor in growing healthy annuals. If the containers don't provide adequate drainage, the root systems of the annual plants may rot.
Choose a container that is big enough to support mature plants. Annual seedlings are small, but grow quickly. Ensure your container is large enough to contain fully grown annuals.;
, Each type of annual requires different growing conditions, such as sunlight, wind and heat. Choose the annuals based on the desired location of the container. If the container will be placed on a sunny patio, select annuals that thrive in full sun and high heat. If the container will be placed under a tree, select annuals that thrive in cooler temperatures and in the shade.


Consider combining several different types of annuals in 1 container. When placing several types of annuals in a single container, make sure the plants have similar growing requirements. Shade-loving and sun-loving plants are not likely to thrive in the same container because of their different growing condition requirements.
Select annuals based on the type of container used. For hanging baskets, select cascading or trailing plants. For pots on the ground, choose upright plants.
Add texture to containers. Add texture with foliage annuals, such as dusty miller, coleus, ivy, spikes or asparagus fern. The foliage annuals do not produce flowers, but provide interesting textural elements to the containers.

,


Mix together equal parts potting soil, perlite and sphagnum moss. These materials can be purchased at most local garden centers or through online retailers.
Fill the container with the potting medium. Do not fill the container completely, but leave about 1 or 2 inches (2.54 or 5.08 cm) unfilled at the top of the container.
Water the sphagnum mixture in the container. Add warm water until the water begins to flow from the drainage holes in the pot. When the water drains, the growing medium is sufficiently moist throughout the container and ready for planting.

, Lightly place the annuals in the container before planting to evaluate the placement and spacing between plants. Annuals can be planted closer together in a container than in a garden bed. A good rule of thumb is to leave about half the suggested spacing around annuals in a pot. For example, if an annual requires 4-inch (10.16-cm) spacing in the ground, it may be planted 2 inches (5.08 cm) away from another plant in a container.


Place taller plants in the center of the container, with small plants around the perimeter.

, Dig holes that are the same depth of the cell packs or nursery pots. Place each annual in a hole, keeping the root ball intact. Using the palm of your hand, cover the hole with the growing medium and gently tap down around the plant.

, Be sure to water the annuals immediately after planting.


Check the soil in the container daily to determine if the annuals need more water. How often you water will depend on the type of annuals, the container size and weather conditions.
Water enough to soak the growing medium until excess water begins to flow from the drainage holes in the container. The growing medium should be moist, but not soggy. The sphagnum moss will help the annuals retain water more effectively than plants in other growing media, so annuals planted in a sphagnum moss mixture typically require less water.

, Fertilize with a water-soluble fertilizer once a week. Apply the fertilizer at a quarter of the recommend rate on the label to avoid burning the annuals. Too much fertilizer will kill the plants.

, To promote healthy growth, trim dead leaves and remove spent blooms. Annuals will bloom longer if you deadhead faded blossoms, which prevents the flowers from going to seed.

Select African Violets at your local nursery, greenhouse or retail store.,
Choose an area in your home with bright sunlight to grow African Violets.,
Water your indoor African Violets carefully.,
Place your African Violets in the saucer for no more than 30 min.,
Feed your African Violets every week.,
Remove new growth, also called suckers, that grow on the main stem of your African Violets.,
Keep your African Violets cooler and dryer in the winter.,
Repot your African Violets as needed.,
A ""soilless"" mix or 1/3 African violet soil, 1/3 perlite and 1/3 vermiculite in dry climates does very well.",How to Grow African Violets Indoors," Because many houseplant enthusiasts grow African Violets as part of their collection, they are usually easy to find.


Decide which color you prefer, or try growing different varieties of African Violets.;
,


Make sure the light is slightly filtered or not direct during the spring through autumn months so it does not damage or dry out the plants. In the winter months, place your African Violets in direct sunlight to be sure they get enough natural light each day.

, The best watering method is to place the pots in a saucer of water to allow for steady watering and maintain a vital humidity level around the plants.

, and then pour off the excess water. It will have absorbed what it needs by then and you can be sure you will not have over-watered.


If you decide to water your plants from the top, be careful not to get moisture on the leaves as this will damage them.

, 1/4 to 1/8th tsp of fertilizer per gallon of water. 20-20-20 general fertilizer or a fertilizer with a higher middle number. Don't use the ""super bloom"" fertilizers as they can burn the plants.

, These small, new stems can grow large and make the plants misshapen and uneven in appearance.

, The plants experience a dormant phase so cutting back on water and heat will help them thrive when winter is over.

, Twice a year for standards (large ones) and once every 3 to 4 months for small ones. Leach the soil between time every 4th watering. (Pour water through the top of the soil without touching the leaves until the water runs through clear or almost clear.)


The rule of thumb for potting is make the pot 1/3 the size of the diameter of the plant. Small violets will never go in a bigger than 2 1/2"" pot. Break the leaves back to only 3 or 4 main rows of leaves on the small ones so they will fit and bury the ""neck"" or cut the roots off and bury the neck depending on how long the neck is.

, You might consider using more perlite if you use a self watering pot or are in a damper climate.

Sow amaranth seeds indoors.,
Time your seeding carefully in colder climates.,
Move plants outdoors once the threat of frost has passed.,
Sow seeds outdoors in warmer climates.,
Ensure you have suitable soil.",How to Grow Amaranth Flowers1," Individual 3in (8cm) pots are best. If planting in a shared bed, space seedlings 10 to 14 inches apart from one another. Lightly cover each seed with about ¼ inch of soil, and place the bed out of direct sunlight, in an area where is will not be exposed to cold.Keep the seeds around 70°F (21°C). Your seeds will germinate in 10 to 14 days.;
, Ideally, plant them 6 to 8 weeks before you can move them outside. They will still be small enough to easily transplant at this age, but will be harder to replant if much older., Plant your amaranth in a mostly sunny location. In seasonal climates, late May or early June is the best time to transplant seedlings. Replant seedlings about 20 inches (51cm) apart, in soil that will drain well, and in a location that receives plenty of sunlight.If you did not plant seeds indoors early in the season, you can sow seeds directly outdoors once you’re sure there will not be another frost.

, While indoor planting is recommended in areas that get frost, you can directly sow amaranth seeds outdoors in places where frost is not a concern. Once soil temperature maintains at least 70°F (21°C), thinly sow seeds in rows. Sow about a dozen seeds per foot, which will allow one gram of seed to sow a 50 ft row.
If planting multiple rows, space them 12 to 16 inches apart. It will take about a pound of seed to sow an acre.
If it rains before the seedlings emerge, break up any layer of crust that develops on the surface of the soil. Otherwise, the crust may prevent seeds from sprouting.
Seeds will germinate in 10 to 15 days.

, The soil in which you grow your amaranth should not contain too much clay. Additionally, test your soil’s pH. Amaranth is less sensitive to soil variability than many other plants, but will grow best in soil with a pH between 6 and 7. Extremely rich soil will actually reduce a plant’s amount of flowers.If you're hoping for flowers, don't fertilize or otherwise enrich the soil. Ultimately, amaranth will grow in most soil types that are suitable for gardening.

Try Amaranthus caudatus.,
Plant Joseph’s Coat.,
Select another amaranthus variety.,
Grow amaranth for food.",How to Grow Amaranth Flowers2," One especially popular variety of amaranth for flowering is A. caudatus. Several different cultivars of caudatus all produce long-lasting flowers, in either erect or drooping tassels. Tassels of red, maroon, or yellow-green will last for as long as eight weeks.Go with a Green Thumb cultivar for bright green flowers that are likely to last a while.
Opt for Loves-Lies-Bleeding for long drooping clusters of dark red flowers. Go with pygmy torch for more erect maroon clusters.

, Another especially popular amaranthus variety is A.tricolor, which is also known as Joseph's Coat or Summer Poinsettia. This plant is the classic option for growing popular edible leaves referred to as Chinese Spinach. It can grow quite large, with relatively unimposing flowers but an especially attractive and richly colored foliage.Cut back buds on A. tricolor to encourage branching. This will also delay flowering, but will ultimately lead to a larger and more vibrant plant.

, A. viridis will provide long, green flower clusters, which will branch and cascade especially desirably. They are favorable for sunny locations, and can hold up especially well in a drier climate.A. Cruentus, meanwhile, will give you large, golden flowers tassels that are likely to swing in the breeze.
A. hypochondriacus, or prince's feather, is described has having ""leaves of purple, red or green. The tips of its stems are crowned with large erect spikes of tiny bright red flowers."", Choose a smaller variety for decor and salad greens. Some of the amaranth varieties that are commonly planted as decoration will also provide you with healthy greens. In, fact, amaranth greens are one of the hardiest salad greens for growth in hot weather. On the other hand, if you’re growing amaranth for the seeds, the lighter-colored seeds, the better.Amaranth leaves taste a bit like spinach, and contain plenty of nutrients, including protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
Specifically, red-leaf vegetable amaranth will provide medium green leaves with a bit of dark red. In addition to the health benefits, these will also increase the visual appeal of a salad.
Tampala is the best variety for greens in particular. Black-seeded amaranth are also best suited for greens, as opposed to seeds.

"

Weed carefully at first.,
Encourage the plant to grow.,
Cut and dry flower clusters.,
Pick leaves as you need them.,
Check seeds for ripeness.,
Gather seeds.",How to Grow Amaranth Flowers3," The first few weeks of care are especially important. Take care when weeding, as amaranth seedlings resemble some common weeds. Planting in rows, or carefully remembering specific plant location can help prevent you from accidentally pulling them up. Once the plant is about a foot tall (30 cm), it will begin to grow quickly, and will shade out any weeds in its immediate vicinity., Once the plant develops a terminal bud (located at the end of the plant’s main stem), cut it off to encourage branching. This will also encourage more young, tender shoots, which are ideal for use as salad greens., You'll start to see flowers around June if you planted in early spring. Flowers will continue to bloom fully from July until the first frost. You can cut off clusters of flowers to dry them and hang them as decor, though do not do so if you also wish to harvest seeds from the same branch., The leaves of many amaranth varieties are healthy and hearty lettuce options. Younger greens are best for fresh salads, while older greens are preferable if you want to cook with them., Seeds are usually ripe three months from planting. The best way to determine whether they are ready to harvest is by shaking or rubbing flower heads between your fingers. If the seeds are ready, they will fall from the flowers readily.If you see numerous birds hanging around your amaranth plants, this likely indicates that seeds are ready to harvest.
You can harvest seeds even after cold weather returns. In fact, seeds are easiest to harvest a few days after a hard frost, right at the end of the growing season.

, Bend individual plants into a five-gallon bucket or wheelbarrow and rub the seed heads between your palms. While this may take a good amount of care, it will minimize the amount of other debris that falls from the plants, and reduce your need to sort through the seed later on. This will only gather the especially dry seeds, allowing a secondary harvest a week or so later.Try rubbing flower heads onto a screen balanced on top of your collection bin. This will allow you to blow away finer debris before dumping your seeds in whatever receptacle you’re using.
Dry seeds further by leaving them in the sun or a constant source of low heat. Store dry seeds in an airtight container somewhere cool and dry.

Pick, rather than cut, the flowers.,
Monitor for pests and diseases.",How to Grow Alstroemeria," You can plant alstroemeria bulbs in the spring, early summer, or fall, depending on your climate. Alstroemeria grows best when temperatures do not exceed 68° F (20° C) daily and range from 40 and 50° F (4 to 10° C) at night.If you plant alstroemeria indoors, you can do so any time of the year as long as you place the plant in a temperate location.;
, Alstroemeria plants need soil with good drainage so the roots don’t rot. You may want to mix your soil with peat moss, compost, ground bark, or decomposed manure to help it drain.Alternatively, you could use a mix of 1:1 perlite and vermiculite or 1:1 organic and inorganic material if you plan to grow your alstroemeria in a container., Alstroemeria grows best in locations with full morning sun and some shade in the afternoons.If you’re growing alstroemeria indoors, pick a sunny window ledge or a spot with lightly filtered sunshine., Fill a bucket with water, and then place the alstroemeria bulbs into the water overnight. Soaking the bulbs for 24 hours will jump-start their germination process., Dig 6-8 inch (15-20 cm) holes in the potting medium.If you’re planting outdoors, space the holes 24 inches (60 cm) apart to allow room for spreading. If you’re planting in containers, plant each bulb in a large container (1 gallon or 5 liters) with drainage holes., Place 1 bulb into each hole, with the pointy side facing up. Cover the bulb gently with soil or potting medium. Lightly tamp down the soil or potting medium around the bulb., Generously water your freshly planted bulbs. Monitor their moisture level daily until the plant pokes through the surface, keeping the soil consistently moist, but not sopping wet., Once your alstroemeria is established, it won’t need as much water. Lightly water when the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil is dry. Too much water will lead to root rot, so take care not to overwater your alstroemeria., You can feed alstroemeria with a high potash fertilizer each week during the growing season when your flowers are blooming. Potash fertilizer contains potassium to help your plants thrive. You should be able to find this type of fertilizer at your local garden shop or hardware store., Placing protective mulch around your alstroemeria can protect it from extreme temperatures. You can mulch with straw or bracken. Keep the mulch at least 2 inches (5 cm) from the alstroemeria stem to avoid rotting at the base of the plant.If you live in an extremely hot climate, you may want to place mulch around your alstroemeria in the summer.
If you live in a cold climate, you should place mulch around your alstroemeria in the winter.

, Whether you want to bring some alstroemerias inside to put in a vase, or you need to remove spent blooms, you’ll need to pick out each stem. Pull one or more entire stalks out of the soil or potting medium. Don’t cut the flowers, as the underground meristems will respond to the damage and die.Each flower has it’s own stalk, so you won’t harm the entire plant by pulling a few stalks.

, Look out for aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies on your alstroemerias. If you find these pests, remove them with a strong stream of water then apply an insecticidal soap.To avoid a disease called root rot, be sure to water only until moist, choose a well-draining soil, and leave room between your plants for air to reach your alstroemerias."

Water regularly while establishing.,
Fertilise in late winter or early spring.,
Prune.",How to Grow Agapanthus," There are large and dwarf varieties of agapanthus, and differing flower colours from purple to white. Dwarf varieties can be used in smaller garden beds, as border edging, or in mixed garden beds.;
, Ensure that there is plenty of space for it to bulk out. Part-shade to full sun will be tolerated by agapanthus. As the shade increases though, the flowering will decrease, so bear this in mind when selecting a spot.


Most agapanthus have a moderate frost hardiness.

, Agapanthus will tolerate most soil types. It grows best in good loam soil with some organic matter added (compost material).

, You can plant them in massed clumps such as a large garden bed or you can plant them in dense rows to create a line for a driveway or path.

, Agapanthus can tolerate less watering than many other plants and can thrive in a hot summer.

, Use a slow release fertiliser or pellets.

, It is important to trim off the flower heads following flowering. Doing this provides the plant the best opportunity to store energy for the next flowering season the following year. It will also stop seeds from setting in your garden.


Also take the chance to trim off dead leaves and stems.

Enjoy the lovely flowers.",How to Plant Hibiscus," Hibiscus come in a variety of colors and appearances, but what is more important than choosing the look of a hibiscus plant, is finding one that will thrive in your local environment. There are two general types of hibiscus bushes: tropical and hardy. Tropical hibiscus will grow in areas with warm weather and temperatures above 50 °F (10 °C) year-round. Hardy hibiscus are hybrids that have been developed to grow in cold areas whose temperatures may drop below freezing in the winter.


Tropical hibiscus have more plentiful blooms, but they die off after only 1-2 days. They are typically in shades of pink, peach, and purple.
Hardy hibiscus hold their blooms for longer than tropical hibiscus, but don’t have as many and are more ‘bushy’. They generally come in hues of red, white, and pink.;
, As with most flowering plants, there are three general ways you can grow your hibiscus: from seed, from a transplant, or from a cutting. Growing hibiscus from seed can be fun, because you can create an entirely new cultivar by crossing two existing varieties of hibiscus. On the other hand, growing from seed requires the most work, and may not be successful. If you’re looking for ease and immediate results, you should find a pre-existing potted hibiscus to transplant into your garden.



Growing from cuttings is the least likely to be successful, as it requires very specific conditions in order to work out. If you’re new to gardening or growing hibiscus, avoid growing from cuttings.
You may not have much variety of choice when growing from a pre-existing potted plant, as nurseries typically only carry a few varieties of hibiscus seedlings or transplants., As heat-lovers, hibiscus should not be planted until well after the winter season has ended. Wait until outdoor temperatures are consistently between 60–70 °F (16–21 °C) before considering planting. If the temperature drops to 55 degrees, the plant will stop growing. If it drops to 45 degrees or colder, the plant will die. This is less true for hardy varieties of hibiscus, but is still an important reminder of the necessity of heat for these plants.


Call your local agricultural extension for specific advice on when to plant in your area., Hibiscus are sun-loving plants, but they can’t handle too much direct sunlight without getting sunburned. Choose a location in your garden that gets 4-6 hours of direct sunlight a day, and ambient sunlight for the rest of the time. Typically this would be on the west or south side of your garden. The hibiscus can be shaded by larger trees if necessary, but will need space to spread out, as they may eventually take up two or three times the space of their original size.


Some hibiscus plants have lived over 40 years, meaning that you could be dealing with a very large bush. Make sure you find a permanent location for your hibiscus to start.Try to find a location that has good drainage; water-pooling will drown out your hibiscus. On the other hand, avoid a location that is primarily sand.
Make sure to test the soil’s drainage and permeability before planting. To do this, dig a hole, pour a gallon of water in it, if the water doesn't disappear within an hour, then amend the soil to deal with the extra clay in it. If the water drains too quickly when you pour it in, then consider adding come clay.

, Hibiscus have picky soil requirements, so it is worth it to take time to amend the soil prior to planting them. Test the pH of your garden soil; hibiscus prefer acidic soil, so anything above 6.5 on the pH scale will have to be made more acidic. Additionally, you’ll need to supplement the soil with plenty of nutrients and fertilizer. Mix in a garden compost several weeks (or months, if you have the time) prior to planting. You’ll also want to add a fertilizer to the soil mix, that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium.


If the pH of your soil is too basic, add in peat moss to balance it out.
Common low-phosphorus/high-potassium fertilizers include a 10-4-12 mixture, or a 9-3-13 mixture.

, Use a shovel or gardening trowel to prepare your holes for planting. Each hole (for a single plant or hibiscus seed) should be as deep as the roots go, and at least twice, if not three times, as wide. The loose soil around the plant will allow for better drainage, and should not be tamped down. Plant each hibiscus plant at least 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) away from each other.


In cold climates, plant the bulbs deeper than you normally would. In warm and soggy climates, plant the bulbs closer to the surface.

, Carefully place each hibiscus plant into its own individual hole, being careful not to damage the root ball. Refill the hole with soil, going only as high as the base of the stem. Covering up the stems with soil could kill the plant over time. Give your hibiscus a heavy watering two to three times in a row immediately after planting to help reduce the risk of transplant shock.

, Try to keep your hibiscus plants moist, but not soaking wet. Make sure that the soil your hibiscus are in is damp at all times, as when it dries out, it can cause wilting and heat stroke in the plants. In the winter when the plant is dormant, only water when the soil gets very dried out.


Make sure that you wait one to two weeks before you fertilize the plants.

, It may be beneficial to add a layer of mulch to your hibiscus garden, as this will block out weeds and trap in moisture. Pull out any weeds on sight, so that your hibiscus are not forced to compete for space and nutrients. Tropical hibiscus tend to have issues with pest on occasion, more so than hardy varieties. If you notice spotting or decaying leaves, try using an organic insecticide to kill off any disease or bugs that are harming the hibiscus.

, Although pruning sounds counterintuitive, it actually helps to promote new growth and causes more blossoms to appear. There are several methods of pruning, but they all work by cutting branches just above a node (leaf joint) at an angle away from the center of the bush. This will send a signal to the plant to grow more branches at this location, outwards and away from the center of the bush.


If any part of your hibiscus dies, you should do corrective pruning and cut it off. This will remove the unsightly part of the plant, and may even cause it to re-grow from scratch.
Never cut off more than ⅔ of a single branch at a time, as this can harm the hibiscus more than it helps., Hibiscus will produce flowers for many months, although each individual bloom will likely only last a few days. You can leave the flowers on the bush, or cut them and use them in tea or cooking.

Wait for the right time to plant hostas.,
Choose a location with the right amount of shade.,
Amend and till the soil.,
Soak the plants.,
Untangle the roots.,
Dig holes and plant the hostas.,
Add a top layer of mulch.,
Provide the plants with consistent moisture.,
Prune dead leaves in fall.,
Prepare the hostas for winter.",How to Plant Hostas," Hostas aren't overly sensitive to cold, so you can plant them as soon as the ground is warm enough to work in the spring. Spring and late summer are the ideal times to plant hostas, because they are in active growth phases and will take root easily.


If you're going to plant hostas in late summer, do it at least six weeks before the first frost.;
, Hostas are shade-tolerant plants that require minimal amounts of sun – though they also won’t thrive in deep shade. The ideal location is somewhere protected from strong winds and hail, that’s shaded between the hours of noon and 4 p.m., and that receives some filtered sunlight.You can protect hostas from sun, wind, and hail by planting them under established trees. Make sure you don’t plant them too close to the roots, however, or the hostas will have to compete for nutrients.
Hosta’s shade tolerance depends on the type. As a rule, those with yellow leaves can survive more sunlight than hostas with green, blue, or white leaves. Blue hostas need the most protection from the sun.Hostas will also thrive near outer building corners that still get some mild sun exposure.

, In the area where you want to plant the hostas, till the ground to a depth of 8 inches (20 cm) using a manual tiller, rototiller, or hoe.Amend the soil with organic matter that will loosen the soil, discourage rodents, and acidify the soil slightly.


Good organic matter for hostas includes aged manure or compost, peat moss, and leaf mulch.
The ideal pH for hostas is between 6 and 6.5.
Hostas don’t need a large space for planting. If you're planting individual hostas, the hole only needs to be as wide as the root system.

, Sometimes hostas come from nurseries in bags with bare roots. It’s especially important to soak the roots if that’s the case with your hostas, because it will help prepare the plants for transplanting.Choose a bucket or bowl that’s slightly smaller than the crown of the hosta.
Fill the bucket with cold water. Rest one hosta crown on the rim of the bucket so the roots are soaking in the water below. Repeat for each hosta.
Soak the plants for at least an hour before transplanting. If you're not transplanting the hostas immediately, leave them soaking to keep the roots moist.

, Right before planting, remove the hostas from the buckets and use your hands to gently untangle the roots. Use your fingers to carefully comb the roots so there aren't any tangles, and ensure all the roots are facing the direction they're growing in.Hostas, especially potted ones, are susceptible to tangled roots. The plants can strangle themselves if you try to plant them in the ground with their roots tangled.

, For each hosta, dig a hole in your prepared garden bed that’s about 2.5 feet (76 cm) wide and 1 foot (30 cm) deep. Place one hosta in each hole, making sure the roots don’t become bent or tangled. Fill the hole loosely with soil, but do not pack the soil around the roots. Make sure only the roots of the plant are buried, and that the entire crown is above the ground.Water each plant thoroughly immediately after planting.
Leave enough space between the hostas to accommodate for their mature width. This will depend on the variety of hosta you have. If you're not sure, leave about 3 feet (76 cm) of space between the hostas.

, The mulch will help keep the soil moist, prevent weeds from growing, and protect the plants from rodents. After planting, add a 3-inch (7.6-cm) layer of mulch to the top of the garden bed around the hostas.


Ideal mulch for hostas includes shredded bark, pine needles, or mulched leaves., Soak the soil after you plant the hostas. Keep the soil evenly and consistently moist throughout the life of the plants. Hostas that are exposed to lots of sun need even more water to prevent burning.


Give the hostas about an inch (2.5 cm) of water per week during active growing phases in spring and summer., Hostas will enter a dormant state in fall and winter, meaning they won’t grow and won’t require as many nutrients. When fall arrives, prune the hostas by trimming off dead or yellow leaves.Dying leaves can still suck nutrients from a plant, so you can help the hostas conserve energy for winter by removing these leaves in fall.

, Hostas are hardy plants and will survive the winter, but they’ll have a better chance of thriving if you prepare them for the colder months. After the ground freezes, cover the ground around the hostas with fallen leaves, and pack more leaves around the crowns of the plants.Leave the hostas packed and covered with leaves until after the last frost in spring.
Covering the plants with organic matter will also help maintain the soil temperature and moisture level.

Once you do this, you can sprout the cutting in water. To propagate a new African violet in water, you'll need a sterilized cutting tool, a thin-necked bottle (such as a sterilized beer bottle), and a plastic bag or wrap.Select a large and healthy leaf from a healthy African violet.
Include 2 inches (5 cm) of stem and cut the leaf from the plant on a 45-degree angle. The cut side of the angle should be on the top of the leaf.
Fill the bottle with lukewarm water.
Place the stem of the leaf into the neck of the bottle, so that the stem is in water and the leaf is resting above the rim.
Cover the leaf and top of the bottle loosely with plastic to help keep in the humidity.
Place the leaf somewhere warm that gets lots of filtered light.
Add more water as necessary to keep the stem submerged.
Over the next several weeks, the cutting will begin to sprout baby African violets.;
, Alternatively, you can also plant that same cutting directly into soil rather than sprouting it in water. To do this you'll need your healthy leaf and 2 inches (5 cm) of stem cut from a healthy violet, a small pot of clear plastic, potting soil, and a plastic cover or wrap.Fill the pot with loose potting soil.
Press the cut stem a half-inch (1.3 cm) into the soil.
Cover the top of the pot with a clear plastic cover or wrap.
Place the cutting somewhere warm where it will get lots of filtered sun.
You probably won’t need to water as long as the plastic keeps in the moisture.

, One way to grow African violets is to start them from seed, though this is less common than propagating the plants from cuttings. To grow African violets from seeds, you'll need seed starters, a plastic cover or wrap, a spray bottle, growing lights, and a medium suitable for African violets, such as milled coconut and perlite or pasteurized peat moss.Water the medium and allow it to dry out so it’s moist.
Fill the seed starters with medium.
Spray the top of the medium with water.
Sprinkle a few seeds into the top of each starter cell.
Cover the top of the cells with plastic.
Place the seed starters 10 inches (25 cm) below the grow lights.
Provide the seeds with 12 to 14 hours of light per day.
If the environment stays humid thanks to the plastic wrap, you won’t need to water.

, Seedlings should reach a certain size before they're transplanted, but plants sprouted from cuttings will be ready to transplant after a certain amount of time.


For seedlings, wait until the seedlings have leaves that reach 2 inches (5 cm) in width.For cuttings, the babies should be ready in about eight to 10 weeks, once new leaves are roughly the size of a dime.

, African violets grow best in a slightly acidic medium that has a pH between 6.4 and 6.9. Because the medium must be loose, well-draining, and allow for free root development, African violets are not often grown in soil.


Most garden and home stores will sell a medium specifically designed for African violets.
You can also make your own African violet mix by combining equal parts perlite, vermiculite, and peat moss., Because African violets are grown indoors, choosing the right pot is like choosing the right home for your plants. These plants grow best in pots that are sized for their root systems. Don’t put your plant in a pot that’s too large, otherwise it may not bloom.A good rule of thumb is to put your violet in a pot that’s one-third the size of the plant itself, because this will match the size of the root system.
For the current size of your seedlings or babies, a 2-inch (5-cm) pot will probably be sufficient.
You can use either plastic or terracotta pots for your violets. Plastic pots require less watering, but terracotta pots provide more air flow.

, When you propagate violets by cuttings, you could have as many as 15 babies grow from a single parent. These must be separated before they're planted. Gently turn the cutting, along with all the soil, out onto a newspaper or table. Carefully remove the soil with your fingers to reveal the cut stem and all the babies.To distinguish one baby from another, look for small clusters of leaves that are attached to the parent.
When you’ve located all the babies, carefully trim each one from the parent using a sterilized cutting tool.

, Fill your small pots with your African violet medium. Leave the medium loose, and don’t pack it down.With the tip of your pinky finger or a pencil, make a half-inch (1.3 cm) indentation in the soil at the center of each pot.


Gently place each seedling or baby plant into the hole in the soil. Make sure all the leaves and stems are above the soil.
Loosely cover the roots with extra medium.

, Add some water to each pot so that the medium is moist. Place the pots with the new plants in a location that’s warm, gets lots of indirect sun, and that’s humid.


If you don’t have a humid location available, set up a humidifier where the plants are growing.

, African violets thrive best when their soil is somewhere between dry and moist, so give them water when the soil starts feeling dry to the touch. Over or underwatering the violets could prevent the plant from blooming.


Use room temperature water rather than cold water, otherwise you could chill the roots. If this happens, the leaves or flowers may start to curl.
Don’t get water on the leaves or flowers, as this can lead to rings or spots forming on the plant.If you get water on the leaves or flowers, gently dry the area with an absorbent towel.

, African violets need lots of light, and they won’t flower if they don’t get enough sun. However, they will scorch easily in direct sunlight, so their placement in the house is very important.


In winter, the plants will do best near a window that faces south or west in the Northern Hemisphere, or north or east in the Southern Hemisphere.In summer, the plants will be better near a window that faces north or east in the Northern Hemisphere, or south or west in the Southern Hemisphere.
To provide bright and indirect sunlight, provide shade by placing the plants behind lightweight curtains.

, These plants need lots of nutrients to continue producing flowers year-round, and the best way to ensure they get what they need is to provide them with fertilizer.


There are specific fertilizers available for African violets, but the important thing is to provide them with balanced nutrients.
A good fertilizer would be a 20-20-20, which means it has equal quantities of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for feeding the violets.

, The best temperature range for African violets is between 65 and 75 F (18 and 24 C). Keep them in an area where you can maintain this temperature, and keep them away from drafts and other things that could cause sudden temperature fluctuations.Anything below 50 F (10 C) will almost certainly kill the plant.

, The ideal humidity level for African violets is between 40 and 60 percent. You can monitor this with a hygrometer. To add more humidity to the air, consider installing a portable humidifier in the room where the violets are kept.


Violets that don’t get enough humidity will grow slowly, and while they will produce flower buds, they likely won’t bloom., Because African violets thrive in small pots, it’s important to repot them regularly to keep up with their growth. When you repot, make sure you use new soil, and a pot that’s one size larger than the pot they're currently in."

Divide daylily plants every 4 to 5 years after initially planting them.",How to Plant Daylilies," You may find another gardener in the process of dividing daylilies who would be willing to share some of the root divisions with you.;
,, Dig a hole approximately 12 inches (30 cm) deep, and 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm) in diameter to accommodate each root division you have.

, Place a root division on top and fan the roots out over the cone.

, Do not tamp down the dirt.

,, Over-watering can cause crown rot. Daylilies are drought-resistant, but bloom best when they have adequate water.

, Daylilies don't require winter mulch.

, Dividing the plants will rejuvenate them and improve blooming.


Divide daylilies after they have bloomed, but prior to the first frost.
Raise the whole daylily plant clump from the earth. Slice it into 6 to 8 sections (root divisions). Each should have several growth buds on the roots.
Lop off the tops of the divided root sections.
Replant the individual sections. Arrange the new sections so that 24 to 30 inches (60 to 75 cm) of space lies between the sections. The daylilies will grow and fill in those gaps.

Buy them from your local nursery or order some from a catalog. Here are some popular varieties to start with if you're new to planting bulbs:


Crocuses: These flowers are usually white or purple, and because they bloom so early they symbolize the beginning of spring.
Daffodils: These yellow or white flowers are early bloomers with a trumpet-like shape.
Hyacinths: Pink, purple or blue hyacinths give off a lovely scent in the spring.
Tulips: You can't go wrong with these classic bell-shaped flowers, which come in an endless variety of colors.
Dahlias: These flowers are brightly-colored and bloom a little later in the season.
Iris: These flowers are tall and beautiful, they naturalize easily and will multiply rapidly each year.;
, Hardy bulbs need cold winter temperatures to thrive, so they are planted in the fall before the ground gets too hard. Tender bulbs die in cold temperatures, and need to be planted in the spring.


Hardy bulbs are more common and include crocuses, daffodils, hyacinths and tulips.
Tender bulbs include dahlias as well as less common bulb varieties.

, When you're deciding what bulbs to buy, mix and match varieties and colors. Choose bulbs that flower at slightly different points in the season so you'll be able to enjoy the blossoms throughout the spring.

, Bulbs need plenty of sunlight, but since they emerge before trees have grown new leaves in the spring, spots that are usually shady can work just fine.

, Bulbs are hardy and grow well in most types of soil. Get it ready for planting bulbs by cultivating it with a hoe, making sure it is loose and free of rocks and weeds.


Choose a spot with good drainage. If the bulbs are waterlogged they won't grow.
Add a little compost as you cultivate the soil, especially if it's especially dry or sandy.
Avoid areas shaded by your house or another building.

, This will help you imagine how the bulbs will look when they grow. You could plant tulips around your mailbox, or make a row of daffodils along your stone walkway.

, It's important to plant bulbs at the proper depth. If the package your bulbs came in doesn't include this information, look it up online to make sure you dig a deep enough hole for each type of bulb.


Bulbs can generally be planted quite close together. If you want them to grow in clumps, dig a larger hole to accommodate more than one bulb.
For large patches of bulbs, space the holes a few inches apart, and plant as many as you want.

, Bulbs are either teardrop-shaped or flat, and it's important to plant them with the right side facing up so that the roots can grow in the right direction.


For teardrop-shaped bulbs, plant them with the pointy side up.
For flat bulbs, plant them with the flat side up.

, Once the bulbs are in their holes, you can add bulb food or bone meal, available for purchase at your local nursery. This will encourage healthy flower growth, but the bulbs are still likely to grow if you don't add fertilizer.

, Fill the holes back up with soil and pat them a bit to make sure the soil is packed. Water the area, then cover with a layer of leaves or another type of mulch to protect the bulb beds.

, If you plant bulbs in the fall, you can forget about them until spring. They'll start popping up when the ground thaws and the weather turns warm.

, Bulbs are abundant but have a relatively short growing season. They look beautiful outside, or you could cut them for an indoor bouquet that will last a few days in a vase of water.

, Many varieties of bulbs grow for several years in a row. After about 2 -3 years, it will be time to plant new bulbs.

Keep clematis well watered.,
Provide a support for the clematis.,
Fertilize the clematis.,
Prune dead or damaged stems at any time.,
Prune away the oldest stems.,
Perform annual pruning according to the cultivar's requirements.",How to Plant Clematis," Clematis flowers come in an enormous range of shapes and colors, from pink blooms that span 6 inches across to drooping blue bells to starry white flowers. They've grown in popularity in recent years, so many nurseries offer dozens of varieties to choose from. When you decide which cultivar to buy, take the color, shape, potential side and sun requirements into account. Clematis often take several years to flower, so look for a potted plant that's already a year or two old. Here are the most common clematis cultivars:Nelly Moser: Has large, pink flowers and is one of the most common types of clematis. It's hardy and easy to establish.

Ernest Markham: Has stunning magenta flowers and grows vigorously on trellises and arbors.

Niobe: Has red flowers and is a suitable choice for growing in a pot, since it doesn't get very large.

Princess Diana: Has pale pink, bell-shaped flowers and does particularly well in very hot climates.

Jackmanii: Has deep purple blooms and grows vigorously; a widely available favorite.

Venosa Violacea: Has abundant blue-violet blooms.

Apple Blossom: Has small white blooms; grows as an evergreen.;
, Clematis may come in an amazing range of shapes and sizes, but they have similar needs when it comes to sun and temperature. They are hardy plants that require at least 6 hours of full sun per day.Clematis are hardy from growing zone 3 to zone 9.A few varieties of clematis will grow in partial shade, but they won't reach their full potential unless they have full sun for 6 hours per day.
Look for a spot with low-growing perennials and groundcover that will shade the roots of the clematis but allow it to grow into full sun about 3 or 4 inches off of the ground. Clematis need cool roots and full sun on the vine and flowers. If you can't find a spot with groundcover, you can plant it later or mulch around the clematis to keep the roots cool.
You can also plant clematis near the base of a shrub or small tree. The clematis will grow up the branches without harming the ""companion"" shrub or tree., The location shouldn't be so dry that it doesn't retain moisture, but it should drain well enough that standing water doesn't sit around the roots of the clematis. To test whether the soil in an area drains well, dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water drains immediately, the soil is on the sandy side. If the water stands in the hole, the soil has too much clay, and doesn't drain fast enough. If the water slowly but steadily seeps into the soil, it's just right for clematis.

, Clematis prefer the soil to be neutral or alkaline over acidic. If you conduct a test and determine that the pH is a little too acidic, sweeten the soil by mixing in limestone or wood ash., Dig a hole several inches deeper than the pot the clematis came in, so that when you plant it the soil comes right up to the first set of leaves. Before you plant the clematis, amend the soil by working in compost and granular organic fertilizer.This will ensure that the plant has enough nutrients to establish itself in the first few months after planting.


If you're working with soil that tends to be clay heavy (slow to drain), dig the hole a few inches deeper than you normally would. If your soil is sandy (quick to drain), a slightly shallower hole will be better for the plant's roots, so they're close enough to the surface to get plenty of water., Very gently remove the clematis from the pot it came in, taking care not to rip or break the fragile roots and shoots. Set the root ball into the hole and pat the soil around its base stem. The soil should come up to the first set of leaves; if it doesn't, lift out the root ball and dig the hole a bit deeper. Leave the stake in place so that the young clematis has something to grow against for the first year.

, Place 4 inches of straw or another type of mulch around the base of the clematis to keep the roots cool. You can also plant or encourage the growth of low-growing perennials whose leaves will shade the roots of the clematis throughout the summer., Give the clematis long, deep drinks of water whenever the soil seems dry. To test whether it is dry, stick your finger in the soil, then pull it out. If you didn't hit wet soil, it's time to water the clematis.


Don't water the clematis too often, though; since the roots are shaded, water may tend to sit for a longer period of time before it evaporates.
Water in the morning, rather than in the evening, so that the water has time to dry and be absorbed before night falls.

, Clematis will not grow unless they have a vertical structure to climb. During the first year, the support that came with the clematis will be sufficient for the plant's needs, but after that you'll need to provide a larger support, like a trellis or arbor, to encourage it to grow bigger.


Clematis grows by twisting its leaf stems around slender supports like twine, fishing line, thin branches, or screens. Be sure the support you provide isn't too wide for the leaf stems to reach around. It should be less than .5 inches (1.27 centimeters) in diameter.
If you have a trellis or arbor made with wide pieces of wood, line it with a screen or attach some fishing line to provide a support thin enough for the clematis to wrap around.
As the clematis grows larger and reaches around the support, you can help it stay in place by ""trussing"" it: loosely tying it to to the structure with fishing line., Every 4 to 6 weeks, feed the clematis with 10-10-10 fertilizer or side dress it with compost by spreading it around the plant's base. Clematis requires plenty of nutrients to grow strong and produce abundant flowers., While clematis aren't prone to being affected by pests, they can get a fungal disease that can cause the entire plant to turn black and die. If you see a dead or wilting stem on the clematis, use a clean pair of pruning shears to trim it away at the base. Disinfect the shears in a bleach solution between cuts so you don't spread the disease to other parts of the plant.

, Since flowering becomes less abundant on stems over 4 years old, you can cut off the oldest stems to encourage new ones to grow. Wait until after the first bloom of the season, then use a pair of clean pruning shears to remove the stems at the base stem., Clematis does well with an annual pruning to encourage fresh growth. However, different cultivars require pruning at different times of year. It's important to know exactly when to prune your specific cultivar, since you can damage the plant if you prune it at the wrong time of year.



Plants that bloom on old wood, meaning the flowers appear on last year's stems, require no pruning except to cut back their size a bit and keep them contained. After they flower, prune back to a pair of healthy buds. (Apple Blossom is in this group.)

Plants that bloom first on old wood and again on new wood, meaning the flowers appear on last year's stems and new spring stems, need to be pruned to remove weak growth. Prune them in early spring, before they bloom, to remove weaker stems, then again after they bloom to improve their shape. (Nelly Moser and Ernest Markham are in this group.)

Plants that bloom on new wood, meaning the flowers appear only on new spring stems, should be cut back to 12 inches at the beginning of spring. (This includes Niobe, Princess Diana, Jackmanii, and Venosa Violacea.)

Take a 5- to 6-inch (13- to 15-centimeter) clipping from a mature plant in the spring or early summer.,
Remove most of the leaves.,
Dip the end of the stem in rooting hormone and shake off the excess.,
Fill small cups or plastic seedling trays with potting soil.,
Place the cutting 2 inches (5 centimeters) deep in the potting medium.,
Wet the soil using a gentle spray.,
Keep the cutting in a warm spot, located in shade to indirect partial sun as it develops.,
Gently tug on the cutting after one to five weeks.",How to Plant Confederate Jasmine1," Select a shoot with a semi-ripe stem that is mostly green with hints of light brown, snipping it off with sharp scissors directly above the node. Do this in the early morning, when the plant is full of moisture.;
, Use scissors to snip away all the large leaves, but you can leave the small, fresh leaves growing at the tip of the cutting alone.

, Regardless of the cutting or the conditions it grows in, rooting hormone can give your plant a helpful boost. While helpful, though, this step is not always necessary.


If you have had luck growing other plants without using rooting hormone, or if the clipping you took came from a notably strong confederate jasmine plant, the cutting will likely take root even without the use of rooting hormone. Make sure to keep the soil, moisture, and temperature conditions ideal to give your cutting the most opportunity to grow.
If you have never grown a plant from a cutting before, or if you have had difficulty doing so, you should seriously consider using rooting hormone. Rooting hormone is also beneficial in cases where your cutting may not have the chance to sit in ideal conditions.

, The container should be no more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) deep. Use a potting mix that consists of soil and organic material, like peat. Selecting a mix that includes perlite can improve drainage.

, Make a hole with your finger or the blunt end of a pencil before inserting the stem to avoid putting unnecessary strain on the stem itself. Pack the soil around the stem to hold it firmly in place.

, Use a spray bottle, since a watering can is likely to moisten the soil too much. Do not drench the growing medium. As your cuttings develop into seedlings, you should avoid allowing the medium to dry out, but you must also prevent it from becoming soggy.

, Direct sunlight can dry the soil out too quickly, thwarting its development.

, Resistance indicates the development of roots, which means that it is ready to be planted in a more permanent spot. Check your cutting after each week. If you do not feel any resistance, allow your cutting to continue growing, checking again the following week.


If you do not feel any resistance after the first two months, and the cutting has begun showing signs of withering, dispose of it and try again.
If you do not feel any resistance after the first two months, but the cutting looks as healthy as ever, enough of a root system may have developed for you to attempt transferring it. The roots will be weak, however, and the plant will have decreased odds of survival, so it is your decision whether or not to exert additional energy or whether you would prefer to try again with a new cutting.

Choose a location for your columbine.,
Prepare the soil for planting columbine.,
Start plants indoors from seeds for an economical approach to growing columbine.,
Plant columbines in containers if you do not have much outdoor space.",How to Plant Columbine," These plants grow best in an area that gets full sun in the morning and partial shade in the afternoon. If you are unsure of the sort of light your area will receive, watch it for a few days and chart the sun exposure to determine if growing columbine in that area will provide optimal conditions for your plant.;
, This flower thrives in soil that is well drained and rich in nutrients. Porous, slightly alkaline soils are the most favorable for newer plants, but once the columbine is well established in a garden, it grows well in nearly any soil condition.


To ensure the soil has the right amount of nutrients at the time of planting columbine, add some fertilizer right away. You can continue to fertilize your plant monthly throughout the growing season to create a healthy root system and larger, more vibrant flowers.







, The seeds must have a few weeks of cold before they can germinate, so keep seed packets in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 weeks before planting. People in colder climates also plant their seeds outdoors in the fall and let them germinate naturally in the spring.

, Because these plants also attract bees and hummingbirds, some people planting prefer columbines near windows where they can watch the wildlife. Columbines require a potting soil rich in nutrients and sufficient diameter in the pot to spread up to 1 foot (0.3 m). Container plants tend to dry out more often, so frequent watering is also essential to keep plants in top condition.

Insert a stake, bamboo pole, or trellis behind the jasmine.",How to Plant Confederate Jasmine2," Areas of an outdoor garden that receive at least six full hours of direct sunlight are considered ""full sun,"" while areas that receive three to six hours of direct sun are labeled as ""partial sun."" Eastern and southern areas of the garden that receive the sunlight in the morning and early afternoon are most preferable.

, Loose soil promotes better drainage and makes it easier for the roots to spread.

, Compost provides the plant with nutrients and sand allows the soil to drain more effectively. Manure and perlite can be used as substitutes for the two additives, respectively. Dig these elements into the top 1/2 to full foot (15 to 30 centimeters) of soil.

, For instance, if you grew your seedling in a 4-inch (10-centimeter) plastic seedling tray, then you should dig a 4-inch (10-centimeter) hole.

, The soil should stay intact around the roots.

, Cover it with soil and gently pat the soil around the stem to hole it in place.

, Soak the soil with water from a hose or watering can until the surface of the soil is visibly damp.

, The pole should be inserted into the ground about 1 foot (30 centimeters) behind the jasmine to avoid interfering with its roots. As it grows, you will need to train it to climb this support.

Fill the pot with additional soil as the stem grows.",How to Plant Confederate Jasmine3," Even though your seedling may not need this space yet, Confederate jasmine expands rapidly, and it will need this extra room soon enough. The pot must also have several drainage holes.

, Doing so prevents soil from falling through but allows water to pass out.

, Use a nutrient-rich, well-draining mix, like one composed of soil, compost, and sand.

, Push down on the stake until it stands against the bottom. Pack soil around it until the pole is firmly fixed in place.

, Tip the seedling container onto its side and gently squeeze the plastic with one hand. With the other hand, guide or ""wiggle"" the jasmine out. The soil should remain intact around the roots.

, Add more potting mix around it until it you bring the soil level up to where it was in its seedling container. Pack the soil around the seedling to keep it firmly in place.

, Use a watering can to pour water onto the soil until the surface looks visibly damp. Pause for a minute or so after you water the soil to allow the water to settle. If the surface no longer appears damp, give the soil more water. Continue pausing and watering until the surface stays wet even after you allow the water to settle.

, Stop once the top of the soil is about 2 inches (5 centimeters) below the rim of the pot.

Water your confederate jasmine regularly.,
Try to provide the plant with bright indirect light.,
Monitor temperature changes.,
Add fertilizer in the spring.,
Tie the vines onto the support pole or trellis as they grow.,
Pinch back the tips of the vine.,
Prune the vine after it flowers if you need to restrict its spread.",How to Plant Confederate Jasmine4," As a hardy perennial, it can handle the occasional drought, but that does not mean you should make a habit of forgetting about it. Once the top inch (2.5 centimeters) of soil feels dry, you can give the plant another watering.


Note that confederate jasmine grown in pots may need more watering than jasmine grown in your garden outdoors.

, If located indoors, you can shield the jasmine with sheer curtains. During the winter, you should allow the plant to soak in at least four hours of direct sunlight each day.


Indirect light is not necessary for jasmine planted outdoors, as long as the jasmine is planted in the ground. Soil dries faster inside a pot than it does in the ground. As a result, a potted jasmine indoors may struggle to retain enough water if kept out in direct sunlight for an extended period of time, while a garden jasmine can stay out in direct sun for several hours without suffering damage.

, If planted in a pot indoors, you should strive to maintain a daytime temperature of 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 22 degrees Celsius) and a nighttime temperature of 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 13 degrees Celsius).

, Use a balanced, water soluble fertilizer, and apply it after you water the plant. If the leaves start to yellow later in the growing season, you may need to apply more fertilizer.

, Use twine or yarn. Training the vines to climb will maximize growth.

, Remove the bud at the end of the vine by pinching it out with your fingers or by snipping it off with a pair of garden shears. Doing so stimulates branching and results in fuller plants. The energy inside the plant will be guided away from the single flower bud and redirected toward side shoots, instead.

, Cut the stem off above the node. Regular pruning can be done to cut the plant back, but occasional pruning can actually stimulate further growth in the same manner that pinching the buds back can. Failing to prune your jasmine may cause it to grow wildly, causing it to overflow and get out of control. Pruning allows you to control the direction of the spread.


These cuttings can also be used to propagate more confederate jasmine plants, if desired.

, Consult the Old Farmer’s Almanac to see which flowers are a good match for the weather patterns and temperature in your area. Certain flowers, particularly annuals, only come into bloom during specific months of the year in cooler area. Other flowers can’t tolerate heat and will wilt if you live in a tropical or desert climate., Maximize the amount of options that will be available to you by planting flowers that will be in season for your event.If your event will be in September, research flowers that will come into bloom around that time. If your event is in early April, it doesn’t make sense to plant a flower that doesn’t bloom until late summer. Gardening magazines can provide good information about the seasonality of your desired flowers.


If you have a greenhouse available for growing, this is less relevant, as you can regulate the climate according to your flowers’ needs.
Full sun is considered six or more hours of direct sun a day. Partial sun is four to six hours of sun a day. And shade is less than four hours of sun a day., Whether you’re getting married at city hall or having a rustic farm ceremony, there are flowers to complement your personal style. Keep the theme of your wedding or event in mind as you plan what type of flowers and greenery you’ll be growing in your garden. If you don’t know where to start, look to your favorite pieces of clothing for some personal style inspiration.


Are you someone who favors classic blue jeans? Maybe white roses, which never go out of style, are perfect for you. Or perhaps you’re more into billowy bohemian tops? Baby’s breath could be your throwback to eras gone by.

, Check out bridal magazines and Pinterest to get some inspiration for your bouquet. Make a list of the colors and types of flowers that appeal to you. Do you like all one kind or a mix of wildflowers? Strive for a look that suits your aesthetic desires while also meeting your growing capability based on space, seasonality, etc.


Many gardening shops actually sell bouquet seed mixes. If you select one, you won’t have to worry about your bouquet aesthetically “going” together or not, as the flowers have been selected to complement one another. Many mixes also call for one set of growing conditions, which streamlines planting.

, Now that you know what will be in season, find out the shade and space needs of your desired flowers. Certain flowers prefer more shade or sun than others. Similarly, some flowers don’t mind being crowded while others need to be plants a certain distance from others to get the nutrients they need. Observe your yard at different times of day to see what spots will give your flowers what they need to thrive.


Most garden shops can give you an idea of a particular flower’s needs for sun and space.

, Before planting your flowers, weed your flowerbed to clear any roots or competing plants from the area. Remove weeds at the root so they don’t grow back to contend with your flowers for sunlight and water., Use a rake to aerate all of the dirt where you’ll be planting. Be sure to break up any clumps of earth or loosen any debris from your flowerbed. This will make it easier for your flowers to take root and grow. When you’re done raking, the soil should be loose and light.

, Spread 2-3 in (5-7.5 cm) of organic matter such as compost, old leaves or manure on top of your raked area to help fortify your soil with nutrients.This will give your flower seeds a good place to germinate and ensure your soil has a good balance of nutritional support.

, Follow the directions on the back of your seed packs to plant your flowers at the right depth and spacing for them to thrive. Water the seeds well right away so they can begin growing.Note how often each type of flower requires watering, and make a calendar reminder for yourself so each one gets the amount of water it needs.

, Greenery in a bouquet is a bit more flexible and less time-sensitive than the flowers. You can grow herbs, which mature rather quickly, and add them to your bouquet for a fresh or unique scent. Scan your yard to see if there are any existing greens that appeal to you as well. Twigs and budding branches, such as pussy willows, can add visual interest to your bouquet without much additional work.


You can always trim non-flowering stalks from your flowers to add some green that complements your bouquet seamlessly. It is not necessary to plant greens unless there are particular ones vital to your look.

, Use clean, sharp scissors to cut the mature flowers for your bouquet shortly before your event. Bring a bucket of cool water out with you for harvest, and place the flowers immediately into the water while you cut the rest of your bouquet. The longer the flowers remain attached to the plant the longer they will last.


Most commercial florists use preservatives like silver nitrate to extend floral life.Homegrown flowers are beautiful but won’t be nearly as resilient.

, To make your bouquet more cohesive, trim all your flowers to a similar length before starting. This is also a good time to dethorn roses and remove any brown or pockmarked leaves you find unattractive.

, Start by placing 2-4 larger flowers in the center of the bouquet to anchor the look. Use floral tape to wrap these flowers to one another. This is the base to which you will wrap and attach other flowers. Add bits of greenery and additional flowers, mixing colors and textures for interest.Wrap floral tape around each flower or stem to secure it to your anchor as you go.

, Use a ribbon to cover the floral tape securing your bouquet for a more polished look. Use a floral pin to secure one end of the ribbon to the floral tape and wrap around the bundle, pinning the finished end with another floral pin to secure it. , If you want a bouquet made from your own flowers, but feel nervous about composing a bouquet yourself, ask a local florist. Many florists are happy to use your flowers to create something professional and polished with your blooms for a small fee.

Choose the right time to plant daffodil bulbs.,
Purchase daffodil bulbs from the nursery.,
Select a good aspect.,
Prepare the soil.,
Plant the bulbs.,
Water well upon planting.,
Fertilize well.",How to Plant Daffodils," The best time for planting is late summer or during autumn. The colder the area, the earlier you should plant the bulbs.;
, You will have a lot of choice, so it pays to spend time doing research into which ones you find the most pleasing. You could either research using gardening books or by looking online, or you could do a reconnaissance visit to the nursery to figure out which ones you like the most, think it over and then return later to purchase.


You can also get good daffodil bulbs through division if you see that your neighbor or a friend has particularly good specimens that you'd enjoy in your garden.

, Daffodils grow best in a sunny spot. Provided they get winter sun, planting them under deciduous trees is fine as there won't be any leaves to cover the sun's rays during the time that the daffodils are growing.

, Daffodils like soil that is well drained and that has a lot of decaying organic matter in it (use your compost). It is important to have dug over the soil about a month prior to inserting the bulbs.

, Larger bulbs will need to be dug in deeper than smaller ones. For larger bulbs, plant to a depth of about 8 centimeter (3.1 in) and keep space between each bulb to about 8–10 centimeter (3.9 in). Smaller bulbs can be planted closer to the surface and more closely together.

, Once planted, however, leave off watering again until the first leaves emerge. Once the daffodil plant is growing strongly, water regularly.

, Good fertilizers for daffodil bulbs include blood and bone mixes. After the flowers die off, it it important to give the plant a complete plant food to help the daffodils regenerate for the next season.

Purchase tubers (bulbs) by mid winter.,
Start the begonias indoors a month before the last frost.,
Plant them in small pots or flats.,
Place the trays or pots in a sunny windowsill and wait for them to sprout.,
Prepare a planting site.,
Plant the sprouted begonias.,
Water the begonias when the soil feels dry.,
Deadhead the begonias regularly.,
Stake the begonias if necessary.,
Gradually withhold water.,
Dig out the tubers.,
Replant the tubers in early spring.",How to Plant Begonia Bulbs," Since begonias need to be planted in early spring, the best time to find a good selection is during the winter. There are hundreds of varieties to choose from, but all tuberous begonias require the same care. You may want to look through a catalog or browse online to determine what type of begonias to plant.


There are over a thousand species of begonias, known to us, and not all of them are tuberous. Other categories of begonias require different care.Begonia flowers range in size from half an inch to almost a foot across. They come in every color except for blue.
Cascading begonia types, such as illumination begonias, are perfect for planting in hanging baskets, since they'll grow over the edge and trail toward the ground. Upright types, like nonstop begonias, grow about a foot tall.;
, In any climate where the temperature drops low enough to cause a frost, you'll need to start the begonias indoors. If you live in a tropical climate that never frosts, you can plant them directly in the ground.


If you live in an area where the summers tend to be particularly hot, start the begonias early enough so that they will be established before the high summer temperatures.

, Buy a good potting soil mix that has excellent drainage, such as a peat-moss based mix. Moisten the mix by placing it in a bucket and mixing it with water until it is damp, but not soggy. Place the soil in the pot or flat you're using to start the begonias, stopping 1/2 inch from the rim. Plant the begonia tubers hollow side-up, spaced three inches apart. Cover them with 1/2 inch of the soil mixture.


Use a 6-inch (15.2 cm) pot for up to two small, 1 to 3-inch (2.5 to 7.6 cm)diameter bulbs or one larger bulb. Use a 10-inch (25.4 cm) pot or basket for three small bulbs.
If you're unsure which potting soil mixture to buy, get a soilless mixture and mix it 3 parts to 1 part with builder's sand.This will provide the right drainage for begonias.
Handle the tubers with care, since they may not sprout if they get bruised or damaged. Look for tiny pink buds or an old stem scar if the bulb doesn’t seem to have a hollow. They indicate the top and should face up.
Make sure the pots or flats you use have drainage holes.

, The tubers need bright light, but it shouldn't be direct light or they will get overheated. Keep the soil moist, but not soggy for the next month or so. The tubers should sprout within two to four weeks, and they're ready to plant when the last frost has passed.


Keep the temperature in the room at 70 degrees or higher. A lower temperature will inhibit the tubers from sprouting.If the tuber sprouts grow over two inches tall before the ground has thawed enough to plant them outside, repot them in larger pots to give them room to keep growing. You shouldn't need anything larger than a 12-inch pot. If you plan to grow your begonias in pots, you can simply transplant them to the larger pots you're planning to keep them in.

, Begonias need to be planted in a place that has partial shade, not full sun or full shade. A little sun is good, but too much will prevent them from blooming. Areas that get early morning or late afternoon sun are best, since the sun is less strong at those times. Look for a spot that's out of the wind, so the fragile blossoms don't blow away when they bloom.


Your climate matter, too. If you live in a cooler area, your begonias will be able to tolerate more sun than a warmer area.
If the soil is dry or doesn't drain well, till it to a depth of about five inches and mix in compost or other organic matter to make sure the area has excellent drainage.

, Dig holes about two inches deep, spaced eight inches apart. Place the begonias into the holes and lightly pat soil around the tubers. The tubers should be covered with no more than an inch of soil, whether you plant them in the ground or in pots., Stick your finger about two inches (5 cm) into the soil to see if you feel moisture. If it's dry and dusty, water the begonias well. Try to keep water out of the center of the developing leaf clusters, since this can cause mildew to form. Take care to water near their bases.


If you're watering potted begonias, water until water flows from the pots drain holes, and dump any drained water that accumulates in a tray or saucer promptly.
For the biggest, brightest blooms, you may also fertilize the begonias every other week with a fertilizer for blooming plants prepared according to label directions.

, They will bloom throughout the growing season, so attend to them often and pinch off any dead or dying blossoms. This will allow the plant to redirect energy to producing new flowers.

, Taller varieties may get so big that they tilt over, and staking can prevent them from breaking. Place a bamboo pole or another stake into the soil a few inches away from the main stem. Attach the stem to the stake using garden twine. As the plant grows, you may need to add more ties to keep it from leaning over. , As the fall winds to a close in November, water less and less until you stop watering altogether. This will help the begonias go into dormancy for the winter. You may do this with either garden or pot-grown begonias.


If you live in a hot climate, forced dormancy isn't necessary, as the begonias will survive the winter outdoors. Trim the begonias back for the winter. They'll begin growing again in early spring.

, Use a shovel to dig them out with a ball of dirt around them. Set them in a sunny window in a shed or garage for up to a week to let them dry out and cure. Store the tubers in open flats lined with peat moss or sand in a cool, dry place for the rest of the winter.Digging the tubers out of the ground is not necessary if you live in a place where the ground never freezes.

, Plant them as you originally did, helping them sprout indoors in early spring and then transplanting them outdoors after the last frost has passed and the ground has thawed.

Choose your containers with an understanding that big amaryllis bulbs can develop very large, heavy flowers.,
Plant bulbs in a nutritious potting compost that have abundant organic material and a good drainage.,
After the initial watering, wait to add more moisture until after you see stem and/or leaf growth to prevent overwatering.,
Apply fertilizer when the time is right.,
Enjoy your flowering containers and snip a stem here or there for use in a vase.",How to Plant Amaryllis," To keep bulbs that are in full flower from toppling over, select pots, tubs or urns that weigh several pounds each when empty.


Depending on the bulb size, pots can be from 10 inches to 16 inches in diameter for two bulbs in each pot. Two bulbs of 2 inches diameter each can go together in a 10 inches pot, with the necks of the bulbs placed 2 inches apart. Bulbs can be planted singly too, but then the pot size should be so as to hold the bulb snugly and its bottom made heavy with some extra gravel and sand.
Place some gravels at the bottom of the pot to make a layer of 1 - 2 inches thickness to cover the holes for water drainage and aeration. Cover it with a 1 - 2 inches thick layer of coarse sand.
Site the container where it will receive sun for all, or, most of the day.;
, The mix should be made up of one part clean builders sand, one part garden soil and one part well-rotted compost. Once this mix is prepared, add a little bone dust and wood ash (if available) in the quantity of one fistful of each to a mix for a 10 inches pot.


Plant the bulb up to its neck in the potting compost, being careful not to damage the roots.  Press the soil down firmly to set the bulb securely in place after planting and also to avoid air pockets around the bulbs.
Water well, gently soaking the soil and settling it around the bulb.

, The bulbs will develop roots as the tops sprout and occasionally flower stalks will develop in the fall. Mid spring is when amaryllis bloom is in full swing. If you like, take pots indoors in the spring, where light and temperatures are less intense; this often extends the blooming period.

, After the flower bulbs have emerged, an application of a balanced fertilizer at intervals of 10 - 15 days is helpful, depending on the growth and size of the plant. A liquid or dry fertilizer can be applied and either inorganic or organic types are satisfactory for this plant. Be sure to read the label carefully so that you apply the correct amount of that particular fertilizer. Once the flowers start blooming, no fertilizer should be applied.

, This won't hurt your plants. When blooming is finished trim off the flower stems. The foliage is evergreen in warm climates and will continue to grow. Water as needed to keep moist through the growing cycle, typically once a week.

Pick your plant out.,
Select bulbs that grow well for first time gardeners.,
Pick out bulbs that will do well if you live in a cold weather climate.,
Select bulbs that do well in a long summer.,
Pick out certain bulbs if you live in an area that often has very long winters.",How to Plant Bulbs in Grass1," There are at least a dozen bulbs that do well in lawns, however, it is important to choose varieties that mature early. You should also choose natural bulbs that remain year after year.


The grade or size of the bulb in not important when seeding a lawn; smaller bulbs will perform just as well as large premium bulbs.;
, Tulips, Anemone, and Grape Hyacinths are great bulbs to choose if you’re new to gardening and bulbs; these bulbs rarely need care once they are planted and naturalize easily without clustering.


They also grow in all zones and don’t need to be stored during the winter season.

, In areas where mowing is not needed until late June, tulip bulbs, such as Greigii or Darwin, can make excellent choices. These bulbs will give off a stunning display long before you will need to cut them back.


Daffodil and crocus bulbs can also work well in cold climates, but they may need to be exposed to south sun during the winter.

, If summers last late into September and October in your area, bulbs like Lily-of-the-Valley or Calla Lilies may be the right choices for you. These plants will continue to flower even during the longest of summers.


If you choose to grow Lily-of-the-Valley, you will have to keep your grass tall, or plant a slow growing lawn, for the flowers to bloom as long as possible.

, There are very few bulbs that will survive long periods of time in harsh winter conditions when left on their own. You can overwinter bulbs by choosing hardy varieties that bloom in the early spring like tulips or lilies.


If you want to plant bulbs that are not as cold hardy, mulch over the bulbs with a thick layer of compost or straw after the cold weather has set in. This works well when bulbs are kept to a small focused area in your lawn.

"

Take your yard into consideration when picking your bulbs.,
Consider whether or not you will be mowing in that area a lot.,
Know what time of year to plant your bulbs.,
Consider how much space needs to be placed between each bulb.",How to Plant Bulbs in Grass2," Naturalizing, or planting bulbs in the grass, can be done with many types of flowering bulbs but they should be selected based on when they bloom and what temperatures they thrive in. Things to consider include:


How much sun and shade your yard gets. Most bulbs should be planted where they will be exposed to six to ten hours of direct sunlight each day. Some bulbs, however, require less sunlight.
What kind of soil you have.
How hot and cold your area gets.

, You should think about how often the grass is mowed. Bulbs depend on their leaves to store food for the following season. The leaves should not be removed or mowed until they turn yellow and begin to wither.


Early spring-blooming bulbs like crocuses are ideal for most lawns because the leaves are usually gone by the time the lawn needs to be mowed.
Later spring, summer and fall-blooming bulbs should be fine where the grass is left to grow naturally.

, Spring-flowering bulbs should be planted in the fall. Summer-flowering bulbs are planted in the spring after the last hard frost and fall-flowering bulbs are planted in late summer.


Spring-blooming bulbs can be planted beneath deciduous trees since they will be grown and nearly done blooming by the time the tree grows leaves.

, The amount of space the bulbs need depends on the size of the bulb. Small bulbs like crocuses can be planted 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart.


On the other hand, larger bulbs like tulips and daffodils should be planted 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) apart.

"
"
Think about using a bulb planter to plant your bulb.,
Know that you can use the “free form” method to plant some bulbs.,
Feed your bulbs once they’ve been planted.,
Water your bulbs to help them grow.",How to Plant Bulbs in Grass3," This method works for all bulbs. You can use a bulb planter to make a hole in the sod, drop the bulb into the hole and pop the sod out of the bulb planter to cover the bulb.


The bulbs should be planted two to three times as deep as the bulb’s width. Water the newly-planted bulbs until the soil is moist to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm).

, In particular, crocus and daffodil bulbs can be planted using the “free form” method. Simply use a dirt shovel or small hand shovel to open a wedge in the ground and drop the bulb into the wedge with the pointed end up.


They will grow their roots into the soil and be covered naturally with leaves and other debris over the fall and winter.

, Give the bulbs fertilizer when they begin to grow leaves. Usually, ½ to 1 pound of fertilizer is sufficient for 50 square feet of planted area but this varies, depending on the fertilizer formula.


A balanced 10-10-10 or 5-10-10 fertilizer works well for bulbs.

, Water them often enough to keep the soil uniformly moist until after they stop blooming. Spring bulbs do not need supplemental water in most areas.


On the other hand, summer and fall bulbs will need to be watered regularly.

Pick a gardenia variety suited to your climate.,
Choose a place to plant your gardenia.,
Test the soil for acidity.,
Amend the soil if necessary.,
Plant in the spring or fall.",How to Plant a Gardenia1," Most gardenia varieties thrive in places with high humidity and plenty of rainfall, like the Southeastern US. Certain hardy varieties can make it through the winter with some protection, and others are suitable for growing in pots and bringing indoors when the temperature gets cold.Varieties suitable for outdoor planting in humid climates include Golden Magic, Aimee, August Beauty, Miami Supreme, and Mystery.
Varieties hardy enough to withstand colder temperatures include Chuck Hayes, Klein’s Hardy, Grif’s Select, and Shooting Star
Varieties that do well in pots that are brought inside in the winter include White Gem, Veitchii, Radicans, and Kimura Shikazaki.;
, Gardenias need full sun to light shade. Choose a spot that's high in the yard and not too close to other shrubs and trees, so the roots don't get crowded. If you can, plant the gardenia in close range to a window or porch so that you'll be able to enjoy its sweet scent when it blooms.


In very hot parts of the southern US gardenias like morning sun and afternoon shade if possible. In cooler areas they will do well in full sun.

, Gardenias require acidic soil with a pH between 5 and 6. If you're not sure about your soil's pH level, get a soil testing kit and find out. Soil that's close to concrete edging and paths tends to be more acidic than soil in other spots. If the soil's pH is over 6, you'll need to amend it before planting your gardenia.

, If your soil has a high pH and low nutrient content, amend it by mixing in sulphur and compost. Use a tiller or a garden hoe to till the soil to the depth of 12 inches (30.5 cm) and work in the materials to distribute them evenly. Test the soil again to make sure the pH level is correct before planting., If you live in a warm climate, it's fine to plant the gardenia in either the spring or the fall. If you live in a colder climate, plant in the spring so the gardenia has time to stabilize before the cold snap comes. The gardenia will produce blooms when the weather warms.

"
"
Water the spot where you're planting the gardenia.,
Dig a hole as deep as the root ball of the gardenia and twice as wide.,
Set the gardenia in the hole.,
Mulch around the gardenia's base.,
Keep the gardenia watered.,
Fertilize once a month during spring and summer.,
Prune the gardenia.,
Look for signs of pest infestation.",How to Plant a Gardenia2," The soil should be moist and rich to provide the right environment for the gardenia.

, This will give the gardenia's roots plenty of room to spread out.

, Remove the pot or any burlap or other substance from the gardenia plant's roots and place it in the hole you dug. Loosen the plant's roots or gently work them apart if it is root bound. Refill the hole with the soil you took out. Water the gardenia well to settle the soil.

, Use wood chips or pine straw to cover the area around the base of the gardenia. This will protect the roots from cool temperatures and prevent water loss in warm weather., Gardenias need regular water all summer long - at least an inch of rain or water per week.During times of heavy rainfall, there's no need to water. Monitor the soil and water the gardenia whenever the soil looks a little dry.


Avoid wetting the leaves when you water the gardenia. Water close to the roots so that the sun doesn't burn the plant.

, To keep the gardenia looking its best, use an acid-loving fertilizer, blood meal, coffee grounds, spent tea, compost, there are many effective options.At the same time, be careful not to over fertilize.

, Prune it once in early spring to shape the bush and get it ready for the growing season. After the flowers have finished blooming, prune the gardenia once more to remove dead flowers and branches.

, Gardenias are prone to getting infested with several different types of insects, especially white flies, scales and mealy bugs. If you see signs of infestation, use a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to take care of the problem."
"
Choose a pot with good drainage.,
Fill the pot with potting mix.,
Add warm water to the potting medium until it feels moist.,
Center the gardenia in the new pot.,
Add fertilizer.,
Add more potting mix if the mix settled below the root ball.,
Place the pot in a sunny spot.,
Water the gardenia at the same time each week.,
Bring the pot indoors in the winter.,
Repot gardenias every 2 years in the spring.",How to Plant a Gardenia3," Look for one that is just slightly wider and deeper than the root ball of the plant you are going to pot. Be sure to use a gardenia variety suitable for pot growing so that the gardenia doesn't outgrow the container.

, Choose a good houseplant potting mix without added fertilizer to fill the pot. Make sure the potting mix states that the pH is below 6. Place enough of the potting mix in the pot so that the top of the root ball will be about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) below the rim.

, Mix it well so there are no dry pockets.

, Fill in around the gardenia with potting soil to the top of the root ball.

, Mix an acidic water soluble fertilizer formulated for gardenias as directed on the package for potted plants. Water the pot with the fertilizer solution until water drains from the bottom.

, There should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the pot rim and the top of the planting medium in the pot.

, Potted gardenias are perfect for sunny porches or patios. Make sure the pot isn't too shaded, or the gardenia won't bloom.

, Potted gardenias only need to be watered once a week. Give the gardenia a good inch of water on the same morning each week. Water the roots, not the leaves, to keep the sun from burning the plant.

, If you live in a cool place, you'll need to overwinter the gardenia inside. Before the first frost in the fall, bring the pot inside and put it in a sunny, humid room. If the air in your house is dry, and it probably is, run a humidifier in the room with the gardenia to keep humidity high enough for the plant. It may also help to set the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water

, Gardenias will slowly outgrow their pots after about 2 years. Buy a larger pot and repot your gardenia to keep it healthy.

Grow from cuttings it you want your field to have a uniform look.,
Prepare your soil.,
Alter the pH of the soil if necessary.,
Try planting a ‘green manure’ crop the previous year.,
Decide how wide the rows need to be.,
Dig your holes.,
Plant the young plants and water well.,
Create an irrigation system.,
Continue to care for your field of flowers.",How to Plant a Field of Purple Flowers in Rows1," If you’re looking to create a uniform row of plants, try growing your plants from cuttings. This essentially means you are growing clones of a parent plant.


Growing from seed or bulb may mean your plants have more variety, which may not be the look you want to achieve.;
, Remove any remnants of the previous year’s crop and any fallen branches, weeds, and stones. Till the ground to break up the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches (15.2 cm). Try to improve the soil by adding well-rotted manure. Add this manure well before you plan to plant your field.


For example, sweet peas will grow better if manure is dug into the beds at least a month ahead of planting time.

, If you need to alter the soil pH, you should also plan to do this well before you plan to plant your field.


For example, if you are growing lavender (which favors an alkaline soil) you might try to add lime to acid soils to raise the pH.

, A ‘green manure’ crop is a fast-growing crop that protects the soil’s nutrients and the soil structure while the field is bare. The green manure is then tilled back into the soil so the nutrients are returned and the soil is ready for the next crop (your flowers).


Green manures include alfalfa, buckwheat and clover.

, This depends on which variety you are growing and what size the plants achieve, as well as how much space you need between rows in order to tend them. Start planning your rows by hammering a stake into the ground at both ends of the first row. Tie a piece of string between the stakes and use this to guide your planting.


Lavender plants need at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) between them, plus room for you to walk between the rows to prune and harvest (you should create rows that are at least the width of your shoulders).

, Dig holes for your plants that are as deep as the plant container and twice as wide. Add a handful of slow release fertilizer, such as bonemeal, to the hole and mix the fertilizer in.


Don’t let the young plant’s roots touch the fertilizer directly.

, You may find it helpful to carry a backpack watering device to help cover the large area of the field. You can then lay down weed proof matting, but this is not essential.


Water the young plants until they are established. Plants will usually become established within a few weeks.

, You may want to lay an irrigation system to efficiently water your plants using minimal water. This is especially recommended for lavender, as watering directly to the base of the plant via an irrigation pipe laid on the ground helps avoid ‘splitting’, a problem that can occur from overhead watering.

, Established plants such as lavender shouldn’t need watering unless it is exceptionally hot, dry or windy.


Check the pruning advice for your particular variety.
Make sure you go out into your field regularly to inspect for problems such as bug attacks or disease.

Understand that you will have to consider the quality of your land when picking out flowers to grow.,
Consider growing lavender.,
Take irises into consideration.,
Think about growing tulips or hyacinths.,
Grow sweet pea if you would like a sweet-smelling field.,
Test out the flower you plan to plant in your field.",How to Plant a Field of Purple Flowers in Rows2," You’ll need to think carefully about what your planting conditions are like when selecting which purple flowers to grow. Think about the type of soil you have, the average temperatures your area experiences, and what you want to get out of your flowers.


The following steps list out some common purple flowers that are grown in rows.

, For stunning, long lasting flowers and a heavenly scent, lavender makes an excellent choice for mass planting. In the fields of France’s Provence region you’ll see fields of them growing in neat clumps. You’ll need a Mediterranean type climate for lavender to really thrive but the plants will grow in US zones 5 through 9, which means that they can survive temperatures that drop down to -20 degrees Fahrenheit (-28.9 degrees Celsius).If you are in zone 5, try the hardy variety Lavendula angustifolia (English lavender).
Lavender requires really well-drained soil such as chalk or sand; avoid growing in clay or poorly drained soil.
If you are keen to get oil from your lavender, Lavandula x intermedia yields well.

Lavandula stoechas is a good choice if you are in zone 7 or warmer. Zone 7 means that temperatures do not drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17.8 degrees Celsius)., Irises are easy to grow from bulbs in zones 4 through 9, which means that they can handle temperatures that drop down to -30 degrees Fahrenheit (-34.4 degrees Celsius). They are also drought resistant. These flowers will make a good choice in an area with lots of deer, as deer generally avoid eating irises.


If you grow bearded iris you may get a second flowering period later in the season. You’ll see the foliage year-round but it can look a bit messy.
These plants will need dividing every few years.

, If it’s early color you want in your field, rows of tulips or hyacinth are ideal. These will return year after year and require little attention. They do, however, need a well-drained soil and possibly a protective mulch to help shelter the bulbs over winter.


Keep in mind that if you grow these flowers, you’ll have a bare field for much of the year unless you plant another crop above them.

, A field of sweet peas is a joy to behold and the scent is divine. Sweet peas are usually annuals but there are perennial varieties. Lord Anson's Pea is a purple perennial. Most varieties will require support and you may need to help train them up their stakes. Sweet peas are great for taking cut flowers as the more you cut the flowers, the more they produce. The plants will look very messy by late summer and need clearing away after blooming. The field will then be bare for the rest of the year unless you plant another crop.

, Before you plant an entire field of one variety of plant, it’s an excellent idea to test out your local conditions by planting ‘pilot’ plants of the same variety. This means planting a small number of the plant you intend to grow and seeing how they thrive in your conditions.


For example if you plan to grow a field of lavender, try growing three plants of the variety you are considering. You might also grow two substitute varieties (or a different plant species altogether) just in case your first choice doesn’t thrive quite as you wished.

Take cuttings from carnation plants.,
Propagate your carnation plants using the layering technique.",How to Pinch Carnations," Pinching carnations as they grow encourages the growth of lateral stems, which means more flowers will grow. Pinching is especially important if you want to grow flowers for cutting.


Pinching also helps the plant to grow bushy rather than as a single tall stem, which some gardeners prefer.
The height at which you pinch the plant stem off is the height at which it should start to bush from. This allows you to influence the height of your plant.;
, Leaf nodes are the swollen bit of stem from which the leaves will later emerge. The leaf nodes usually appear when the plant is about 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall.


Do a second round of pinching about 4 weeks later once the lateral (side) stems emerge. Again, you should pinch the lateral stems once they are about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long.
Nursery plants will often have had their first pinching already if you purchase plants that are at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) high. However, you may want to pinch the lateral (side) stems once they reach 6 inches (15.2 cm) in length if this doesn't seem to have been done at the nursery.
If you grow carnations yourself from seed, you’ll need to do pinch the plants yourself.

, Once the plant is about 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) in height and has about 5-6 swollen leaf nodes in evidence on the stem, remove or pinch off the tip of the stem above the sixth leaf node. The stem should be tender enough to do this with your fingertips.


After this first pinching, lateral (side) shoots should emerge. Repeat the pinching process once these side shoots reach 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm) in length.
After you have pinched your plant, it is a good time to stake it. Tie it loosely to a support such as a sturdy garden cane using string or garden wire.

, Over pinching can delay blooming, so stop pinching once the leaves start to form. If you want to ensure a long flowering season, pinch only half of the lateral stems. This way you get two flushes of blooming.

, Perpetual carnations can be encouraged to flower again by making sure they are watered during dry weather.


This means watering them about every 5-7 days through the summer or perhaps every 3 days in very dry, hot weather.
Also give your carnations regular feeds, pinch the stems and remove the withered flower heads.

, It’s important to protect perpetual flowering carnations from frost. You can grow them under glass or in a polytunnel, but it’s vital to keep them above 45F so you may need a source of heat, even in a greenhouse. Of course, you can also grow them as house plants.

, Avoid using manure or high-nitrogen fertilizers for carnations, as they won’t bloom as well. Also keep in mind that you should never mulch carnation plants.


If planted outside, you should add lime to the soil to improve the alkalinity, and use a fertilizer that isn't too high in nitrogen relative to other components, such as potash (potassium) and phosphorus.

, During the growing season carnations will need feeding regularly – about once every two weeks – with a weak solution of water-soluble fertilizer. Avoid slow release fertilizers or ones labeled ‘granular’. These release nutrients too slowly to be of much use during the growing season.

, After a few years, even perpetual carnations won’t perform as well. You can rejuvenate your carnation plants by dividing at the root to make new plants. To divide a carnation:


Dig it up and gently separate the root mass using your hands. Replant the divided sections and water them well. Continue watering for the next few months once the soil is dry below the surface.

, Taking cuttings is also a great way to reproduce your carnation plants after a few years. Make sure your plant is healthy before you take cuttings from it.


Starting early in the morning, cut a piece of fresh shoot about 4 inches (10.2 cm) in length from a section of stem that isn't flowering. Cut below a swollen leaf node; make sure your tools are sharp and not dirty. Strip off any lower leaf growth.
Dip the stem in some a rooting powder and bury half the length in some sand. Give the cutting some water, cover with a transparent plastic bag and put it into a well-lit place but not in direct sun. A window ledge that is not facing sun is ideal. Make sure you keep the cuttings watered until they root.

, An unusual method called ‘layering’ can also be used to make new carnation plants. Mix some sand and compost in the area close to the plant you wish to propagate from, then water the mix. You want to get a healthy side shoot and remove any leaves from the lower part.


Halfway along the length make a vertical slit in the stem using a thin blade such as a craft knife. This allows you to bend the stem over and plant the cut middle stem area into the soil mix. You may need to weight this down using a piece of bent wire to ensure it remains in the ground where it will root eventually.
Keep the soil mix watered moist for up to 2 months when it will have rooted enough to be removed from the parent plant for replanting elsewhere.

Keep an eye out for pests.",How to Overwinter Lily Bulbs," If you live in a colder climate but have lilies growing outside in the garden, consider lifting your bulbs over the winter to give them a better chance of survival.


Wait until just after the first frost to lift your lily bulbs. Before you lift them, cut the withered foliage back to about.3 inches (0.8 cm) above ground level.
Lifting the bulbs and overwintering them indoors is particularly important for tender varieties of lily, such as tender colored callas.;
, Be sure to dig a much wider hole than to need to avoid damaging the bulb with your spade.


Gently dislodge as much soil as you can from the healthy bulbs without damaging the roots.
Rinse the bulbs under cool running water (eg from a garden hose) to remove the rest.

, It isn’t worth keeping any bulbs that are diseased or damaged. Throw these out with the trash. Avoid composting diseased plant matter as this can spread infection.

, Make sure the bulbs are well-spaced on the tray to allow air to circulate. A cool dark place such as a garden shed or garage is the most suitable location to dry out the bulbs.


Avoid bringing the bulbs into a heated home to dry them out, as the sudden heat may come as a shock. Additionally, mold may be quick to grow in a warm environment.
A temperature of 60–70 °F (16–21 °C) is ideal. The bulbs should not be exposed to sunlight.

, After the bulbs have dried out for a few days, dust them with a fungicidal powder. Put them into paper bags with a small amount of dry peat moss or vermiculite.


You could also use a cardboard box, provided you make some ventilation holes to let air circulate.
Avoid letting the bulbs touch each other — you can put moss or vermiculite between them to prevent this. The idea is to prevent one bulb from infecting another if it develops mold.

, Damp and rot are the biggest threats to overwintering bulbs, so protect them by storing them in a dark, dry place.


However, you should not allow the bulbs to dry out completely. If the bulbs appear dry or shrunken, mist them lightly with water to prevent them from drying out too much.

, Bulbs need to rest for a few months before growing again. Therefore, it’s best to replant them outdoors in mid or late spring, once the threat of frost has passed and the the ground is warmer.


Your lilies are more at risk of rotting due to the winter rain than being damaged by the frost, so avoid replanting if the ground is waterlogged (even if the weather is mild.)

, Lilies will survive outdoors over winter in mild climates that don’t experience much sustained snow, deep freezes or heavy prolonged rainfall in the colder months. They can generally cope outdoors through winter in zones 8 and up.


North America is split into 11 zones, according to the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map. Each zone is 10 °F (−12 °C) warmer (or colder) than the one adjacent to it.
To find out which zone you live in, go to the National Gardening Association's website and enter your zip code.

, After flowering has ended, refrain from watering and allow the plant to die back. Avoid cutting the foliage until it has withered away, as this allows the bulbs to store more energy to last throughout the winter months.

, Lily bulbs will not do well sitting in damp, soggy soil over the winter months. In order to prevent them from rotting as a result of wet conditions, you should do all you can to improve soil drainage.


This usually means incorporating plenty of grit or perlite at planting time to improve drainage.

, Many gardeners also recommend raising the lily bulbs above water level. To do this, raise the surface level of the soil by creating a low mound over each bulb.


This means your bulbs will be less likely to sit in wet earth, so you can prevent them from rotting through the wet winter months.

, To protect the lily bulbs over the winter, apply a mulch of about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of straw or evergreen branches. Alternatively, place an upturned pot or cloche over the location of the bulbs. Do this in the fall before the ground gets cold.

, Wait until all threat of frost has passed and the soil has had a chance to heat up a little before planting the overwintered bulbs outside again. Mid to late spring is usually good time for this..

, Lilies prefer to grow in well-drained soil in sunny locations, however they will tolerate shade for part of the day.


It’s a good idea to incorporate some well-rotted manure or compost into the soil to improve its quality ahead of planting.






It’s best to do this well ahead of planting the bulbs, if possible. A rich soil will help the plant produce flowers.

, Keep the plant indoors at a cool room temperature in a light place such as on a window ledge. This should ensure flowering in the later spring.

, Give the bulbs a good soaking and then continue to keep the soil moist — but not waterlogged — as they grow. You should also water them throughout the summer

, Remember to feed your lilies fortnightly during the growing period – a water-soluble fertilizer added to the watering can is ideal – but stop feeding ground-planted Lilies once flowering begins.


Continue feeding container-grown lilies throughout the flowering period.

, Lilies are generally trouble-free but can suffer from certain pests including aphids and whiteflies. Keep an eye out for these pests and spray as required with an all-purpose bug spray.

Look for a spot where the soil is moist but well-drained.,
Avoid high-heat and lingering puddles.,
Consider planting your tree in your yard, rather than your garden.,
Keep sap and pollen in mind.",How to Plant a Tulip Poplar Tree1," Tulip Poplars will suit clay, loam and sandy soils that are moist but well-drained. Their preference is for acid or neutral soils (pH 6.1-7.5). They can live in zones 4-9. Avoid planting your tree in dry, shallow soil.Tulip Poplars generally won’t thrive in shallow clay soils and tend not to tolerate drought. However, there are some versions of this tree that are native to Florida and will be more drought tolerant than their relatives from elsewhere.;
, Avoid planting your tree in a hot, dry part of your garden or in a waterlogged area where puddles linger after rainfall. Tulips Poplars will do best in a rich, deep, moist loam that is well-drained. They prefer a sunny spot but will tolerate partial shade for some of the day.

, Although Tulip Poplars are a well-shaped and attractive tree they are too large for many gardens and present other disadvantages such as their habit of dropping sap everywhere and their vulnerability to wind.They won’t themselves tolerate full shade however if it is shade you want they are a good choice for providing it for other plants if you do decide to plant the tree in your garden. Of course, you will need to plant shade-loving plants around the tree.

, You should note that some people are allergic to the pollen. The tree notoriously has a habit of dropping sap. This is annoying, especially if your newly washed car is parked beneath the tree. Sap can also be blown by the wind.


If you are planting your tree in your yard, make sure it is far away from your driveway so that the sap doesn’t get on your car.

Prepare your soil ahead of time.,
Plant your tree soon after you purchase the sapling.,
Prepare the sapling for planting.,
Dig your hole.,
Loosen up the roots.,
Plant your tree.,
Add mulch to the area.",How to Plant a Tulip Poplar Tree2," When planting any type of sapling it’s always best to prepare the soil well ahead of time. Incorporate some compost or well-rotted manure into the location for your tulip poplar. To do this:


Add a layer of compost and then rake it into the soil that is already there. This will give the soil an added boost of nutrients.

, Saplings are supplied as bare rooted plants or potted plants. If you are using bare rooted plants, try to plant them immediately after purchase as they will not survive for a long period of time if they are left uprooted..

, Remove any string or wrappings supplied with your sapling. Soak the roots before planting. To do this:


Put the sapling in a bucket of water (ideally rainwater) for a few hours; do not let it soak overnight. Avoid removing any roots or damaging them.

, Dig a hole as deep as your tree roots are long and twice as wide as the roots are wide. If your plant was supplied in a pot, the soil level you plant your tree at should be the same as the soil level of the pot.


If the plant was supplied bare rooted, check the trunk of your plant to see where the soil level was before.

, If the roots are bunched up, try to loosen them a bit by teasing them out as gently as possible. If using a potted sapling, try to retain as much of the original soil as possible as this helps preserve the roots.

, Place your sapling in the hole you created. Fill in the soil around the sapling. To avoid air pockets, pat the soil down well and then water the sapling thoroughly.


However, avoid treading down the soil surface heavily as this can damage roots.

, Apply a mulch of about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of compost, leaf mold or well-rotted manure to the surface of the soil. Make sure the mulch covers the whole area under the sapling. This will help protect the roots, keep weeds from growing and retain soil moisture.

Take a cutting from a healthy tree.,
Trim away any leaves or flowers.,
Keep your cutting somewhere bright but out of direct sunlight.,
Move your cutting outside.",How to Plant a Tulip Poplar Tree3," Tulip Poplars can be grown from seed or from cuttings. Growing from seed will be covered in the next section. To take a cutting:


Cut off about 18 inches (45.7 cm) of recent growth (less than 2 years old) from a healthy-looking tulip poplar tree.

, Along with the leaves and flowers, you should also trim away the lower 2 inches (5.1 cm) of bark using a sharp knife. Dip the peeled end into rooting hormone, then plant it so that about half of the cutting is under the compost in the pot that you have picked out for your cutting.


You should plant your cutting in a compost mix that is suitable for cuttings.

, One way to do this is to enclose the pot in a clear plastic bag, removed every few days to prevent condensation build up. After a few months your cutting should root. If rooting has been successful, it should resist a gentle tug with your hand.

, After several months you can try planting your cutting outside in a semi-shaded area (out of the full midday heat).


Once it is established and a bit more hardy, you can move it to wherever you would like it to be in your yard or garden.

"
"
Consider planting your poplar from seeds.,
Rough up the seeds.,
Plant your seed.,
Care for your tree once it is established.",How to Plant a Tulip Poplar Tree4," If you decide to plant from seed, wait until October when the seeds are ripe. Dry them out for a few days on a plate or tray in your home. After they are dry, soak them overnight in lukewarm water.If you delay planting until spring, keep the seeds in the fridge over the winter in a plastic bag together with a lightly moistened mix of sand and peat.

, After you have dried them out and then soaked them, you’ll need to rough up the outer coating of the seeds to help them germinate. To do this:


You can use sandpaper or wire mesh to scratch up the outside.
You can also use a sharp knife to make a nick in the seed.

, The seed should be planted a quarter inch deep in an area of your garden that does not get the full heat of the sun at midday. Keep your seed watered until it is established, but avoid the soil becoming too wet.

, Tulip trees don’t require pruning. Young trees may be browsed by rabbits and deer so consider protecting the young plants for the first few years if these is a problem in your area.You should water young trees during dry periods until they are well-established: usually for the first 3-4 years of their life.
If your tree loses its leaves early, this indicates drought.

Overwinter your dahlias indoors to prevent them from freezing and to give them a rest.,
Dig up the dahlias immediately after the first frost.,
Carefully lift the tubers with a garden fork.,
Trim and clean the dug-up tubers.,
Dry out the tubers before storing.,
Coat the tubers with a fungicide before storing.,
Pack the dried tubers into a box.,
Store the tubers at a temperature between 40 and 45° F. At all stages of storage, keep the dahlia tubers at a temperatures between 40 and 45° Fahrenheit.,
Check the tubers monthly for signs of dryness or disease.,
If you live in a very cold area, consider storing the tubers in large containers.Those living in areas with very cold winters may want to store their dahlia tubers in large containers that are suitable for holding full-size plants.,
Replant the overwintered bulbs before the last frost.,
Only overwinter dahlias outdoors in zones 7 to 10.,
Cover the soil with a layer of mulch.,
Remove the mulch in early spring and divide the tubers.",How to Overwinter Dahlias," Although dahlias can survive outdoors in US hardiness zones 7 to 10, they will need to be brought indoors in colder areas over the winter months to prevent them from freezing.


However, many gardeners lift their dahlias for the winter even where they are hardy to inspect them and give them a rest over the winter.
This rest is believed to encourage the overall health of the plant and more profuse flowering.;
, Leave the dahlias in the ground until the first hard frost kills the leaves and stems and causes the tubers to begin to go dormant for the winter.Once the foliage has blackened, dahlias can be trimmed to about 2 to 6 inches (5.1 to 15.2 cm) in height so that the roots are easier to remove.






It is best to wait for a day it is not raining to dig up the plants.

, Once you are ready to dig up the tubers, push the garden fork into the soil about 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the flowers. Do this all the way around the plant to loosen the soil, being careful not to pierce the tubers.


Push the garden fork into the soil again and pull back on the handle to lift the tubers up out of the soil. A dirt shovel can also be used for this purpose but garden forks work better.






Be careful not to damage the outer “skin” of the tubers. Damaged outer skin opens the tuber up to disease pathogens., Gently trim the dead stems off the tubers and break off any large clumps of soil by hand. Wash the remaining dirt off with a hose to reduce the possibility of fungal disease.


This can be done by placing them on a piece of hardware cloth suspended over a garbage can or by simply spreading them out on a picnic table and running the water over the tubers until the soil is washed off.

, Lay out some newspapers on a flat surface within a protected area where the tubers will not be exposed to sun or wind. Set the tubers on the newspaper and let them dry for 24 hours before storing - this helps to prevent fungal infection.


Alternatively, you can hang the tubers upside down by their stems for one to two weeks in a cool, arid place until they are dry.

, The American Dahlia Society suggests either drenching the tubers with a liquid fungicide such as Daconil or coating them with inexpensive sulfur dust before storing, in order to prevent fungal growth.


The latter method involves mixing approximately three cups of vermiculite and a teaspoon of sulfur dust together in a plastic bag. The tubers are coated by placing them in the bag and shaking it up.
However, this method may require some further experimentation by home gardeners in order to find the ratio that works best for them.

, Perfectly dry and fungicide-treated tubers can be stored in a box that is first lined with newspaper, then covered with peat moss. Layers of moss and dahlia tuber should be alternated until the container is almost full or all the dahlias are inside.


They should be topped with a final layer of moss then covered with a layer of newspaper before the box is closed up.
Dahlia tubers can also be stored in boxes or trays of dry mediums such as sand, compost, or potting soil.
If one has different types of dahlia tubers, labeling the storage containers is recommended.

, Temperatures that are any colder may kill them.

, Stored dahlia tubers should be checked monthly and spritzed with water if the tubers seem to be drying out.If they are badly dried out, plunging the tubers into a jar of water may be necessary to revitalize them.
During the monthly inspection, if gardeners spot any diseased parts they should cut them off and then disinfect the garden implement that was used.

,


In the early spring, the containers can be moved under a window so that the plants are able to start growing, even if the temperatures are not yet warm enough for them to be safely moved outside.

, Plant your overwintered dahlia tubers back in the garden in the spring, one or two weeks before the last expected hard frost.

, Dahlias will only survive outdoors in winter in zones 7 to 10.


These zones refer to the USDA plant hardiness zone map, which divides the US into zones according to their average annual minimum winter temperature. Each zone is 10° warmer (or colder) than the one adjacent to it.
You can find out what zone you live in by going to the National Gardening Associations website and entering your zip code., Be sure to use plenty of mulch if the plant tubers will be spending the winter outdoors. The mulch should be between 5 to 12 inches (12.7 to 30.5 cm) thick and can be comprised of wood chips, mushroom compost, grass clippings, or other organic materials.

, In the early spring, about March or April, remove the mulch so that the soil warms up properly. Dig up and divide the tubers, then replant them for best results.

Pinch seed pods to help your pansies bloom again.,
Remove any dying blooms regularly.,
Keep the soil moist and apply a phosphorous fertilizer.,
Cut away growth and leggy stems.,
Check for seed pods that were not pinched back as blooms.,
Plant a new blooming pansy if your existing ones begins to die back.",How to Make Pansies Bloom Again1," Pansy seeds will grow in long fall climates or they’ll remain dormant until the next spring in many areas. Therefore, in order to fool pansies into blooming again, you will need to remove the seed pods before the seeds fully form.


This can be achieved by pinching the spent blooms from the plant, cutting back extra growth, and fertilizing for blooms rather than leaves.;
, Check your pansy twice a week for any blooms that have died. Remove all dying blooms from the pansy plant to encourage the plant to put its energy towards new blooms and growth.


Remove any damaged blooms when you remove dead blooms.
Be careful not to accidentally remove any new blooms.

, Water the plant to keep the soil around the pansy moist. Pansies enjoy soil that is damp. Try to apply a phosphorus fertilizer but avoid applying nitrogen to the area unless the fertilizer is a slow release variety, as pansies generally can’t handle high levels of nitrogen.


If the plant is allowed to dry out or receives too little nutrition it will stop producing blooms and need to be replanted.

, Cut back growth and leggy stems from the plant because these areas will not produce new blooms. When these parts of the plant are allowed to grow unchecked, they can drain the energy of the plant, causing it to produce less blooms.

, If you find any existing seed pods, remove them right away.


If your plant is an heirloom you may be able to save the adult pod and collect seeds to start more pansy plants indoors.

, If the plant stops producing blooms and begins to die back, you will most likely need to replace the plant with a new blooming pansy in order to benefit from new fall color.


If this occurs frequently do not feel like you’ve failed; certain areas of the country simply are not suited for year round pansy growth.
If you can’t find new pansies at your greenhouse to plant in the fall, remember that pansies are simple to start from seed indoors.
Plan ahead for next year and start the seedlings indoors four to six weeks before fall. After the temperatures get warmed, plant the new seedlings outdoors.

"

Grow your pansies in the correct conditions.,
Keep critters in mind when selecting a location for your pansies.,
Protect your pansy from the elements.,
Move your potted pansy out of direct sunlight.,
Understand why pansies tend to stop blooming.",How to Make Pansies Bloom Again2," To start, you need to consider the placement of your pansies. They should be in a cool, moist, protected area of your garden.


Consider placing them under a tree that will provide shade for the pansies.

, While the pansy plant is very hardy, its flowers will be eaten by critters, bugs, and anything else that might come along so try to plant them in a protected area.

, Pansy plants will look rough and not well cared for if they are placed in an area with large amounts of wind and rain. Try to reserve a safe spot in your garden for them that is shielded against the wind.

, If placed in a container, be sure your plant does not receive sun during the hottest hours of the day.


Move the container during the summer to a cooler area to encourage blooms year round.

, The reason pansies stop blooming is in the design of the plant. Pansies bloom early in the spring, produce seeds, then die back in the summer.

Keep them groomed.,
Check their growth.,
Divide them.,
Always use the right soil type for the perennial.,
Add compost every spring.,
Keep the insects at bay.",How to Keep Perennials Healthy," Cut away dead and decaying foliage regularly.


Early summer: Dead-head flowers and remove any stringy bits at the end of flowering season. Dead-heading should be done weekly or fortnightly during summer unless you are looking for seed stock. Removing flowers promotes the growth of fresh leaves and often more flowers in many species of perennials. This should be done in early summer. Perennials suited for deadheading include alchemilla, Aquilegias, nepetas, geraniums, pulmonarias and Symphytums. (Winter: Tidy up and cut down the plants. Use garden shears (hand or electric) or secateurs. Make sure the seed heads are finished first and tidy the plants up so that they appear neat.;
, From time to time, it is important to keep an eye on how they are growing, then be sure that they are conforming to growth standards set for them. If they seem to be lagging behind for a long time, you may need to take remedial action to improve their lot, such as fertilizing or shifting their location in the garden.

, If your perennials are up to being divided (and many of them are), this is an important means for thinning them out and moving extra growth around the garden. For most plants, this can be done wherever you feel it is appropriate, although some of the plants need this to be done regularly, as explained below. To divide perennials, simply:


Insert two gardening forks together into the centre of the plant, back to back and gently ease them apart.
Trim away any rotting, diseased or old growth from the inner part of the plant. Also remove woody parts. Select the best pieces of the plant for replanting (usually around the edges).
Replant the two halves - one back where it came from, and the other somewhere else in the garden.
Note that some perennials need regular dividing or they become scraggly and cease to thrive. Watch for heucheras, asters, monardas, sedums and stachys, which do need annual or biannual division. (, This will help ensure trouble-free existence for years to come. It also means ensuring that soil top-ups or fertilizing are very important to remember and do - add this task to your gardening calendar. If a previously moist but well-drained soil suddenly becomes soggy, you may need to either fix the soil, or shift the affected perennials, or you will notice that the plants no longer cope as well and may suffer from root rot or other waterlogging damage.

, Keep the garden space well mulched and add compost to perennials every spring to give them nutrients to draw from. It is also important to feed perennials with nutrients throughout summer.

, Use eco-friendly garden sprays (see ""Relateds"" below for examples) on a regular basis to remove such insects as aphids, thrips, whitefly, beetles etc.

Water thoroughly.,
Cut spent blooms periodically.",How to Start a Flower Garden," Enthusiasm for gardening is great, but can rapidly dry up when the work mounts. Start with a small flower bed, say 25 square feet, which is room for around 20 to 30 plants with perhaps three types of annuals and one or two perennials. You can always increase you plantings as your experience grows.


If even a 25 square foot plot seems like too much, make a small border or do your first flower gardening in a container. Two or three plants sharing a fancy container can look stunning and give you a sample of what's to come.;
, On the other hand, if you're no good at planning on paper, or you know about where and how large you'd like the bed, simply lay it out right there in your garden.


Laying a garden hose on the ground is one way to mark or plan a gentle curve. If you have a lawn adjoining the bed you are digging, remember to leave yourself mower access.

, How much sun an area gets is a prime consideration. Six hours of sunlight will do for the greatest variety of plants. Stay away from underground utility lines and allow at least three feet from a building or fence.

In hot climates, it is best to have some shade from the relentless afternoon sun, so a flower bed to the east of a building or fence usually works best. This also gives some protection from the hot drying winds that usually come from the west.
You can grow a garden even if you get 12 hours of full sunlight, but you should be more careful about which flowers you choose to grow. Pick ones that love full exposure to the sun. Your garden will also need more frequent watering.

, All soils can be improved, but avoid areas with shallow, rocky soil, areas where water stands, or steep slopes. Stay at least 20 feet (6.1 m) away from a large tree or five feet away from a sizable bush. Trees will compete with your garden for water and nutrients.

, While not strictly required, a soil test will help to determine what nutrients the soil requires and will tell you the fertilizers that soil needs as well as its pH. Your local Department of Agriculture extension service can help.

, Once you locate a site and mark out the boundaries with a water hose, remove all sod and pieces of grass or weeds that may re-sprout. Using a spade or garden fork, completely dig up the bed to at least eight inches deep, a foot deep is better. Remove rocks or any debris.

/images/thumb/7/7a/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-6-Version-3.jpg








, Add one or more inches of compost or manure, more if the soil is poor. If the soil is sandy, add peat moss or grass cuttings to improve the soil's water holding capacity. Add lime if the soil is too acid. Most plants like neutral to slightly acid soil.
/images/thumb/d/df/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-7-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/d/df/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-7-Version-3.jpg









Soil amendments such as compost can be bought by the bag or sometimes by the truckload. Work the amendments into the top six inches of soil along with a general-purpose fertilizer such as 10-20-10.

, Smaller plants go in the front of the bed. Most plants are planted at the same depth they were growing. Firm the soil around them. Remember when placing plants that they will grow, so start with extra space and read the labels carefully to see how much space to leave them.

Get a variety of flowers because they bloom at different times and this will keep your flower garden always in bloom.
If you do not have many flowers blooming early spring or late summer, drive around your area and see what is blooming. Go out and buy a few of these and plant them. After doing this a couple of times, you will have flowers almost all year round.

, Like a good waiter, a good gardener will check whether water is required before watering. How much you water will depend upon the needs of your plants, the climate and exposure, and how much rain your yard gets.

Consider keeping your Calla in a pot.",How to Winterize Calla Lily Bulbs1," If you live in a colder climate but have Callas growing in the garden, consider removing your Calla rhizomes, or bulbs, over the winter to give them a better chance of survival. To do this:


Wait until just after the first frost. Cut the withered foliage back to three inches above ground level.;
, Carefully dig out your Calla rhizome. Be sure to dig a much wider hole than you think you need to. Doing this will help you avoid damaging the bulb with your spade., Gently dislodge as much soil as you can from the healthy bulbs without damaging the roots. Rinse the bulbs under cool running water (such as the water from a garden hose) to remove the rest of the soil.

, It isn’t worth keeping any rhizomes that are diseased or damaged. Throw these out with the trash.


Avoid composting diseased plant matter as doing so can spread infection the infection to other plants.

, They should be well spaced to allow air to circulate between them. A cool dark place such as a garden shed or garage is suitable. It may be better to avoid bringing them into a heated home as the heat may be a shock that could cause mold to form on your bulbs.


60 to 70 degrees F is an ideal temperature for rhizome storage. Try not to let them be exposed to sunlight.

, After they have dried out for a few days, put the rhizomes into paper bags with a small amount of dry peat moss or vermiculite. Putting the moss or vermiculite in the bag will help to prevent one bulb from infecting another if it develops mold.


You can also use a cardboard box if you make some ventilation holes to let air circulate. Avoid letting the bulbs touch each other and put moss or vermiculite between them.

, Damp and rot are the biggest threats to overwintering rhizomes, so try to keep them dry where possible and store them in a dark, dry place. They should not dry out completely however. If the bulbs appear dry or shrunken, a light mist with a water spray should prevent them from drying out too much.

, Callas need to rest for a few months before growing again. Try to plant them in mid or late spring once the threat of frost has passed and the ground is warmer.


Your Calla is more at risk of rotting because of the winter rain rather than the frost so avoid planting if the ground if waterlogged, even if the weather is mild.

, You can plant a Calla lily outside in a container and move it inside for the winter. When planting, use decent-quality compost and make sure the container has good drainage holes. Plant the rhizomes with the eyes upwards so that they are just visible in the soil.


Once flowering ends, give the pot a feed with a potassium-rich fertilizer (one suitable for tomatoes will do). After that, cease watering your container-grown Calla lily and move the pot to a cool dark area once the foliage withers away. A dark corner of a garden shed is suitable. Don’t water your plant again for three months and avoid cutting the foliage until it has withered away.

Expect some difficulties in locating varieties of scented camellias.,
Ask your local garden centre to order these varieties in for you.,
Plant them in the garden.",How to Make a Scented Camellia Garden," Not all garden centres will be knowledgeable about the scented varieties. However, if you can furnish them with a list, you will be halfway there. Here are some examples of scented camellias:


Scented Gem






Nymph






Scentuous (hyacinth scent) and Scentsation






Quintessence






Fragrant Pink Improved







C. sasanqua 'Crimson King'







C. sasanqua 'Huge Stevens' - large fragrant blooms





;
, With easy online ordering, it shouldn't be too hard to convince your local garden experts to order some of these varieties in for you.

, When planting a scented camellia garden, consider the usual important factors with making the most of scented plants. Locate the camellias where their scent will have an impact - near bedroom windows, around outdoor-eating areas, in relaxation areas of the garden etc. Scented varieties may be more delicate than other varieties, so providing good shelter is an important aspect. In all cases, camellias must be sheltered from wind, intense sun and frost exposure. Neutral or acidic soil is best and be sure to keep camellias well-drained.

Consider keeping your Callas outside if you live in a mild climate.,
Help your plant to die back.,
Give your Callas some protection.",How to Winterize Calla Lily Bulbs2," Calla Lilies will survive outdoors over winter in mild climates that don’t experience much sustained snow, deep freezes and heavy prolonged rainfall in the colder months. They can generally cope outdoors through winter in zones 8 through 10.


This means that they can survive in temperatures that do not drop below 30 to 35 degrees F (-1.1 to 1.7 degrees C)., After flowering has ended, refrain from watering and allow the plant to die back. Try to refrain from cutting the foliage until it has withered away.

, If you are overwintering outdoors, apply a mulch of about four inches of straw or evergreen branches. You can also put them under an upturned pot or cloche.Do this in the fall before the ground gets cold.

Do not plant your Calla lily until you are sure there will not be any more frost.,
Choose a well-drained spot in a sunny position.,
Plant your rhizome correctly.,
Water your Calla lilies.,
Watch out for pests.",How to Winterize Calla Lily Bulbs3," Wait until all threat of frost has passed and the soil has had a chance to heat up a little before planting the rhizomes outside again.


Mid-spring is usually a good time to move them outside again.

, Keep in mind that if you can’t find a super sunny spot, Callas will tolerate shade for part of the day. It’s a good idea to incorporate some well-rotted manure or compost into the soil to improve it ahead of planting. A rich soil will help the plant produce flowers.

, The rhizome should be planted with the ‘eyes’ facing upward and just visible at the top of the soil. These are the growing points that look like the ‘eyes’ on a potato.


Leave about 12 inches (30.5 cm) of space between each of your rhizomes. Once they are in the ground, give them a good soaking and then continue to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged as they grow.

, Calla Lilies require water throughout the summer. If you dig them up for overwintering indoors, they will need extra water as they get established back in the ground. Remember to feed fortnightly during the growing period—a water-soluble fertilizer added to the watering can is ideal—but stop feeding ground-planted Calla lilies once flowering begins.


Continue feeding container-grown Callas throughout the flowering period.

, Callas are generally trouble-free but can suffer from pest attacks by aphids or whiteflies. Keep an eye out for pests and spray as required with an all-purpose bug spray.

Trace the path of the sun.,
Decide on some annuals.,
Choose some perennials.,
Sketch out a plan.,
Dig your flowerbed.,
Purchase your flowers.,
Plant your flowers.,
Water your plants.",How to Make a Fall Flower Garden," The very first step in creating a flower garden is to determine the garden’s location. Walk around your property and determine the best location for your flower garden to live.Avoid areas that are very rocky or that have steep slopes.
Stay away from large trees and shrubs. (These will compete with your flowers for nutrients).
Look for an area that receives adequate sunlight.
Be sure you can reach your flower bed with a hose for easy watering.;
, Each region has what is known as a ""hardiness zone."" Hardiness zones (categories developed by the US National Arboretum) outline which plants can survive in which areas. Visit http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html to determine which hardiness zone you live within., In addition to knowing your hardiness zone, it will be important for you to know how much direct sunlight, indirect sun, and shade your flower garden will have each day. Spend a few days watching the space where you would like to place your garden and track the amount of sunlight (and shade) this area receives. This will help you select the right flowers for your garden., “Annuals” are flowers that live for only one season. Select some annuals that are well suited for fall weather. Be sure to choose flowers that will thrive in your hardiness zone.Examples of fall annuals include:


Asters

Full sun
Well-drained soil.
Zones 4-8
Grows to 5 inches tall.


Toad Lily

Shade
Moist, well-drained soil.
Zones 4-9
Grows to 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide


Goldenrod

Full sun
Well-drained soil
Zones 4-9
Grows to 4 feet tall.



, “Perennials” are plants that bloom over and over again each year. For your fall flower garden, you will want hearty perennials that live right through the summer and bloom in the fall.Examples of these include:


Russian Sage

Full sun
Well-drained soil
Zones 5-9
Grows to 5 feet tall.


Perennial Sunflower

Full sun
Well-drained soil
Zones 4-9
Grows to 8 feet tall.


Colchicum

Sun or shade
Well-drained soil
Zones 4-9
Grows to 6 inches tall



, Once you know which types of annuals and perennials you would like to use in your fall flower garden, begin to make a plan for where each type of flower will go. It is important to place larger flowers in the back, so that they do not block the sun from smaller flowers. You should also consider the various colors of your fall flowers, and aim to create a dynamic mix., Using a flat shovel, begin to dig up the grass about 4-5 inches around the bed’s perimeter. Then carefully lift out the grass (or peel back sod). Remove any debris and loosen the soil. When you are finished, use a rake to level the bed.


You may also use herbicide to kill the grass, but you will have to wait until the following season to plant flowers there.

, Chances are, you do not want to waste time allowing flowers to sprout from seeds. Instead, it is best for you to purchase flower “starts.” These baby plants are available at most nurseries, and many hardware stores., Once your flowerbed is ready and you’ve purchased your starts, you are ready to plant your flowers. Be sure to have a small trowel and possibly some gardening gloves.


First, water your flowers in their pots.
Carefully remove each flower, and pry apart matted roots with your fingers.
Dig a small hole for each flower.
Add “slow release flower food” to the bottom of each hole. (This is optional.)
Insert your flowers into each hole, and fill in the soil around the plant.

, Once your flowers are planted, you should water them thoroughly. After this, you will need to follow the watering guidelines for each type of plant. Create a watering schedule for yourself, so that you are sure to keep your flowers healthy and hydrated.

Store your flowers in a cool place.,
Recut the flowers.Cutting one or two inches off the stems of your flowers or other cut plants can help to extend their life and keep them fresh as you transport them.,
Trim off any lower leaves.,
Wrap your flowers’ lower stems with rubber bands.,
Wrap the flowers to keep them moist.For this, you should use cotton wool that you’ve soaked in room temperature water.,
Cover the cotton wool with plastic.",How to Transport Cut Flowers1," You can keep your flowers in the fridge before your event or at a venue to keep them fresh longer.


If you do this, make sure the temperature of the fridge is cool but not close to freezing.
Also, be sure to remove any fruits or vegetables from the refrigerator, as they emit a gas called ethylene that can harm your cut flowers.;
,


When you cut the flower stems, do so while they are submerged in water. You can fill up a shallow basin of water for this purpose. Cutting them in water ensures no air gets into the stem.
Use very sharp shears or scissors to avoid pinching the stem instead of slicing it neatly.
You want to cut each stem at around a 45-degree angle.

, You want your stems to be free from leaves that don’t serve a purpose in your arrangement.You want to trim these leaves because leaves that stay damp could rot and cause mold or bacteria to grow around the base of your arrangement.

, If your flowers are already arranged, you can wrap rubber bands around each arrangement. If they aren’t, you can simply wrap according to flower type.


The rubber bands just keep your flowers in manageable bundles as your transport them and assure you don’t lose any of the arranging you’ve already done.

, You want to use a material that will hold the water for a long period of time.


If you want, you can add a small amount of a floral preservative to the water that you soak your cotton wool in.

, You can use any kind of plastic wrap or plastic bag for this to seal in moisture and keep your flowers in place.


Once you’ve wrapped around the cotton wool with plastic wrap, secure over it with a rubber band.

Lay flowers flat in shallow boxes.,
Use cardboard boxes with cut-outs.,
Transport flowers in buckets.If you’re transporting in buckets, you don’t need to wrap the stems of your flowers with cotton wool and plastic.,
Keep your flowers shaded and cool.",How to Transport Cut Flowers2," This method works best for flowers with hardier blooms or for greenery that will accompany the flowers in your floral arrangements.


Gently lay flowers flat in the boxes. Make sure all the blooms face the same way. If you plan on stacking your boxes, close them well, first, so that your flowers don’t get crushed by the boxes above them.

, This works best for more delicate flowers and arrangements that are already complete.


Find cardboard boxes with lids that are the same height as the stems of your arrangements.
In the lid of each box, use a box cutter to cut a hole just large enough for your bouquet to fit into.
Put each of your bouquet arrangements into a hole, making sure they fit snugly and won’t fall over as you drive.

,


Fill five-gallon buckets halfway with water, and put your bouquets in them upright.

, In your vehicle, don’t place flowers in an unventilated trunk or in the direct sunlight from the windows.


Place them on the floor to keep them upright.
Keep the inside of the vehicle cool, so the flowers remain fresh.

Divide and transplant your lilies every three to five years.,
Mark the location of the lilies before the foliage dies away.,
Prepare the lilies’ new location.,
Transplant the lilies a month before the first frost.,
Consider transplanting resurrection lilies in stages.",How to Transplant Resurrection Lilies1," Whether you are moving and want to take your lilies with you, your garden is becoming too crowded, or you have some other reason to transplant your lilies, you should try to divide and transplant every three to five years. Doing this will help to keep the plants from becoming overcrowded and will boost their flower production.


Lilies will divide themselves in the soil and become crowded. This will cause the patch to produce fewer blooms. Having fewer blooms is a sign that it’s time to divide and transplant the patch.;
, Because you need to wait until the lily is dormant before transplanting, it may be hard to find the plant once the foliage has died away. This can be make it hard to know where to dig to gain access to the roots of the plant without damaging them.


One solution is to draw a circle around the plant using spray paint before the flowers fade.
Alternately, mark the spot with a circle of stones, or insert plant markers into the soil (without damaging the bulb).

, At the same time as you mark the plant’s location, it’s a good idea to prepare the new planting area so it has time to settle ahead of planting. Lilies will want a sunny spot with good drainage.


If you know your soil to be clay heavy or have poor drainage, or if you observe puddles forming and disappearing rather slowly when it rains, you’ll need to improve drainage by digging in plenty of grit or compost. Alternately, consider raising the beds.
Weed the soil at the new planting site and incorporate some organic matter into the soil. This organic matter can be compost or manure. Leave the bed to sit for a few weeks or months.

, Resurrection Lilies should only be transplanted when in their dormant stage, which occurs in the late summer and into the fall and winter. Try to transplant you lilies in the fall about a month before you expect the first frosts.


You should note that, while it’s better to transplant the bulbs when dormant in the fall, it probably won’t harm them to be moved in the late summer or winter. However, this can lead to a delay in flower production during the next season.

, Be aware that the lilies won’t always flower again the following year after being transplanted. Sometimes they refuse to flower for several years after the shock of the move. You might want to consider transplanting your patch of Resurrection Lilies in stages over a number of years to ensure you get at least some blooms in the year after transplantation.

Divide and transplant daffodils at the end of the growing season.,
Dig up the daffodil bulbs without damaging them.,
Gently separate the daffodil bulbs.,
Replant the daffodil bulbs as soon as possible.",How to Transplant Daffodils1," Wait until the growing season is over before you begin. When the growing season is over, the foliage will wither away and turn yellow or brown. This usually happens in the late spring or early summer.


If you wait much later in the year you may not be able to find your daffodils, as the plant will be dormant and any visible signs of it hidden under the ground. Because of this, try to take action when there’s still some of the plant visible above ground.;
, Use a garden spade to dig up the bulbs, being careful to avoid damaging them. You’ll want to dig quite a long way from the plant to avoid slicing through it accidentally.


Bulbs are usually planted pretty deep, and over time daffodil bulbs can wriggle a bit lower into the soil, so expect to dig to about the depth of an average spade.

, Once you locate the bulb, gently part it from the earth as carefully as possible, trying not to damage any roots. Gently separate the bulb clumps by twisting and pulling them apart with your fingers. Keep as many of the divided bulbs (also known as offsets) as you want to replant.


The very smallest offsets may not flower within a year. Discard any that are damaged, mushy or show any signs of rot.

, It’s best to replant the bulbs fairly quickly if you can, although they should be fine for several weeks out of ground if delay is unavoidable. Store any bulbs you aren’t planting immediately in a cool dry place.


One ideal way to store them is in a paper bag in a dark corner of a garden shed.

"
Choose a sunny environment.,
Check for good drainage.,
Test the soil pH.,
Chill the seeds, if not already done.",How to Plant Tritoma1," Whether you plant in a container or a garden, make sure that your tritoma have access to full sunlight for at least eight hours every day once they’ve sprouted. Before that period it is best if you give the early seedlings a bit of shade, so that they don’t burn off., Tritoma is native to an area with rocky and rough soil and it still retains some of those characteristics. Water your plants regularly, but make sure that the extra moisture drains away and doesn’t just sit on the surface. If the roots are continually saturated then they may rot off at the base., Purchase a simple dip test at your local gardening center. After you see the results you will know if you need to make any modifications to the quality of the soil. Tritoma does best in a soil pH that falls between 6.0-7.0., If you’ve purchased seeds from a local garden store or online dealer, then they will likely require a bit of extra care before planting. Place the seeds in an airtight container within the refrigerator for six weeks before planting.When you are ready to plant, take the seeds out of the refrigerator and place them directly in the ground.

Wait until the foliage has died back on its own.,
Carefully dig the lily bulb out of the ground.,
Clean and divide the lily bulbs.,
Dispose of any damaged, diseased or stunted bulbs.,
Store the lily bulbs before replanting them in the spring.",How to Transplant Resurrection Lilies2," It’s important to allow the foliage to die away naturally, so don’t be tempted to cut it back. The lily will use the foliage to make energy from sunlight to store during the winter. This will help the plant recover from transplantation and bloom again.


Leave the foliage on the plant until it withers away of its own accord. By mid summer, when the flowers emerge, there won’t be any foliage remaining.
After the flower withers away the plant will go dormant. By the time the fall comes, none of the plant will be visible above ground and the plant should be dormant.

, Carefully dig the onion-shaped bulb out of the ground using a gardening fork, taking care not to damage it. Try to preserve as much of the soil around the root as possible. If the bulb is damaged or shows any signs of rot, discard it. Refrain from composting any diseased bulbs.

, If you think the bulbs need dividing, clean the soil off the roots with the help of a hosepipe. If the bulbs have divided they will have offsets (or baby bulblets) attached. These will look a bit like garlic bulbs with the offsets looking like separate garlic cloves.


To divide the offsets, gently pry them off with your fingers.

, Keep the largest, healthiest looking ones and dispose of any that are damaged or diseased looking. Bulbs that have rot will seem mushy. This is a good time to give away any healthy offsets that you don’t want to other gardeners.


You may now have more bulbs than you realized! It may not be worth keeping the smallest ones. However, if you have the patience to wait several years for them to mature, you might consider planting them amongst larger bulbs or at the back of a bed so you won’t notice a bare patch in the garden.

, If you dig up bulbs in the fall, you can wait and store them over the winter before replanting them in the spring.


Store them in a cool dry place such as inside a paper bag in a shed or cool cupboard.

Replant the lily bulbs 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep and 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart.,
Place mulch over the lilies in the winter.,
Understand that the lily bulbs may take a couple of years to bloom again.",How to Transplant Resurrection Lilies3," In the new planting spot, make a hole about 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep. Resurrection lily bulbs will need about 10 inches (25.4 cm) of space between them and other bulbs.


Place them so that they are sitting on handful of bulb compost and with the pointed end facing upwards.
Fill in the hole with soil around the bulb and tap it down gently. Avoid pressing the dirt down with your feet. Water the area well.

, A two to three inch layer of mulch, such as hay or leaf mold, will help protect the bulbs over winter but you should remove the mulch in the spring to let the shoots appear.

, You should expect that the transplanted lilies might not bloom again the following year, or even the one after. Be patient and don’t give up on them as they will most likely recover from being transplanted eventually.

They will prefer a sunny patch, although they’ll tolerate partial shade for some of the day. A daffodil plant needs to receive at least three hours of sunlight per day.

, Daffodils need a well-drained soil, so try to avoid planting them anywhere that puddles form and don’t easily drain away. Daffodil bulbs rot easily in wet ground.


It’s a good idea to incorporate plenty of compost or organic matter, such as well-rotted horse manure, into the soil. If you aren’t sure how much to use, cover your soil to a depth of 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) with the manure and then mix it with the existing soil.
If your soil is clay heavy and tends to retain water, you might may want to add some grit into the soil to improve drainage.

, To plant each bulb, dig a hole three times as deep as the bulb is wide—that’s around 6 inches (15.2 cm) in depth for a 2 inch (5.1 cm) bulb.


If you can, add a trowel full of compost to the bottom of the hole for the bulb to sit on. Put the bulb in the hole with the pointed end facing upwards.
Fill the hole with soil and water well. You might like to top-dress (add a top layer) of fertilizer or mulch.

, Now go back to the area where your bulbs were growing originally and replant the bulbs using the same approach. Having such a crowd of bulbs in this patch may have taken a lot of the nutrients from the soil, so it’s especially important to refresh the ground with fertilizer in this spot.

, In the fall, give your transplanted bulbs a good feed with a water-soluble fertilizer. During the fall the roots are most actively growing, so the fall feeding will help your transplanted bulbs get established in their new home. All bulbs will appreciate an annual top dressing of fertilizer or mulch.

Plant daffodil bulbs in a deep pot with good drainage.,
Use bulb compost or regular potting compost.,
Keep the pot in a cool, dark spot for the first few months.,
Fertilize potted daffodils with bone meal.,
Replant fresh bulbs each year.,
Transplant daffodils from a pot to the ground.",How to Transplant Daffodils3," You can also move daffodil offsets to a container. Try to choose a deep pot to give their roots plenty of room (at least 8 inches). The pot should have drainage holes.

, Bulb compost or regular potting compost will work well for daffodils in pots. Fill the pot so that it is about two-thirds full, and plant the bulbs pointed end upwards. The bulbs should be close but not touching. Cover the bulbs with soil and water the pot.

, Move the container to a cool dark spot such as a shed or cellar for a few months rather than bringing it into a warm home. Continue to water it and bring it out into a warmer, lighter place after about three months.


It’s best not to put containers of daffodils in a warm location as this inhibits flowering.

, After flowering, top dress your container with a fertilizer such as bone meal (this is pretty stinky so you may not want to keep it in the house!).

, Daffodils should survive three years in a container but won’t be as good after the first year. For best results, plant the spent bulbs outside after the foliage dies back and replant your container with fresh bulbs for the following flowering season.

, Indoor planted daffodils and those previously planted in containers can be moved to the outside for planting in the ground. The best time to do this is after they flower and when the foliage has died back. This will typically be in the late summer or early autumn.


Follow the steps outlined in Method 1 to transplant your daffodil bulbs.

"
"
Plant in the early summer.,
Start with indoor pots.,
Transplant the seedlings at 2 inches.,
Put the seeds at least 6mm deep.,
Leave at least 20 inches between plants.,
Pair them with other late-summer foliage.",How to Plant Tritoma2," Being a plant native to South Africa, tritoma does the best in hot environments. Planting the seeds in May or June allows them just enough time to develop before the temperatures elevate. Then, they will begin to bloom in the hottest months of the summer., If you choose to grow your tritoma inside, then make sure to keep the temperature set in the 70-75 degree Fahrenheit range. Peat pots are a particularly good planting container as they will provide both structure and nutrients.If you don’t have a peat pot available, almost any container will do. It just needs to be clean and have a depth of at least 3 inches to give plenty of room for root growth.

, If you decide to grow indoors and then transplant outside, it will take about 7-8 weeks before the plants are ready to move. Make sure to transplant only after the final frost of the season to give the seedlings some time to get established. By this time your seedlings will stand around 2 inches tall.You can also tell that the seedlings are ready to move by looking at their leaves. They should have at least four full leaves.
To transplant, grasp the seedling by the leaves, as the stem is too fragile. Use a spoon to loosen up the soil around the base. Apply a bit of pressure and lift the seedling and its roots out of the soil., This depth will provide protection from the elements, but it is also just deep enough for the seeds to still make it to the surface. Rhizomes, sprouts, or divided bulbs can be placed just slightly deeper at 7 cm because they are a bit hardier., Since tritoma can grow to be rather tall, it will need plenty of air circulation around it without being overshadowed by other plants. Ideally, try to plant each tritoma at least 20 inches apart. If the plants seem to grow closer together you can always thin them out later, too.Providing plenty of room for air circulation will lessen the possibility of your tritoma getting “damping off,” a fungus that breaks down the plant at the soil line., To keep your planting areas looking alive and active, place your tritomas alongside other plants that flower in the late summer months. Marigolds, in particular, work well with tritomas as they are low to the ground and easy to care for. The colors are also complementary with the red of the tritomas playing off of the orange and yellows in the marigolds."
"
Watch for any pests.,
Protect in winter with a layer of mulch.,
Remove any old flower spikes.,
Divide the bulbs in the spring.,
Apply fertilizer in the spring.",How to Plant Tritoma3," Tritoma are generally very resistant to pests and insects in general. However, it is possible that spider mites or aphids may be attracted to them. Get rid of these insects by spraying your tritoma with a light coating of insecticidal soap. Some larger aphids you can also pick off by hand., In many cases the foliage of tritoma will provide sufficient warmth for the plant in the winter. But, it is good idea to add an extra layer of protection by layering straw mulch over the planting area. The mulch will limit the damage from frostbite while improving drainage, too., In the early spring, use garden shears to snip off any dead flower spikes. This practice, called “deadheading,” will allow your tritoma to spend its energy on new blooms, which will continue to appear well into the fall. For the foliage, remove any dead leaves that you see, but do so sparingly in the winter as this foliage provides extra warmth for the plant., Before the summer flowering begins, dig up the bulbs, break them apart, and replant them in new areas. Give these divided plants some extra water until they appear established, as evidenced by sprouts coming up. Although this is a good remedy for overcrowding, make sure to not divide the same bulbs up more than once per five year or you’ll compromise their health., To give your tritoma an extra boost of energy and nutrients, mix some general purpose fertilizer into the soil in the spring. You can do this with both established and new plants. To protect the seedlings, always wait until they are fully established above the soil before using any fertilizer.To maintain the quality of the soil you can add a bit of fertilizer to the area of planting once every month thereafter."

Buy or gather some raw, unsalted, hulled sunflower seeds.,
Place the seeds in a jar.,
Add water.,
Allow the jar to sit for about eight hours.,
Rinse and return them to the jar.,
Wait.,
Enjoy!",How to Sprout Sunflower Seeds1," Hulled sunflower seeds — those without shells — will sprout more quickly. If you can only gather unhulled sunflower seeds, collect these in a bowl and allow them to soak overnight. In the morning, toss the seeds then pour them into a strainer. Try to pick out hulls as you go. Do not worry if some hulls remain.;
, Place the sunflower seeds in a large, open-mouth jar such as a canning jar or something slightly larger.

, Fill the jar with water so that the seeds float on top.

, During this period, the seeds should begin to sprout. Wait until the seeds have nearly doubled in size and the sprout has begun to emerge. When sprouting sunflower seeds, always periodically check them so that you do not allow them to soak for too long.

, Make sure to cover the jar again.

, Let them sit in the jar, in a warm or room temperature location with no direct sunlight, for one to three days until they've finished sprouting. Rinse them and return them to the jar one or two times a day until they are done.You can also use a special sprouting bag instead of the original jar. Place the sprouting seeds into the sprouting bag and hang it over a sink or other area to allow draining. Continue to rinse every five hours or so.

, When they've started to sprout and look like little V's, they're ready to eat. Rinse the sprouts you plan to eat and store the remaining sprouts in your refrigerator to enjoy later.

, Wear gloves to ensure that you do not prick yourself when moving the prunings about.

, Spread the rose prunings around the soil of this area. This will deter your dog from entering the area, owing to the thorns. If you don't need to garden this patch in a hurry, the prunings will eventually rot down into the garden; if not, see ""Tips"".

Remove any dust and dirt.,
Dry the bulbs.,
Inspect the tulip bulbs.,
Pack the bulbs.,
Add alternating layers of bulbs and newspaper.,
Store the tulip bulbs.,
Check on stored tulip bulbs.,
Plant in fall before it freezes outside.

",How to Store Tulip Bulbs," Wipe the bulbs gently. If you are storing tulip bulbs that were dug up from the ground versus packaged bulbs, gently brush off any dirt, but do not wash the bulbs.;
, Place bulbs in a sunny area until they are completely dry. Make sure the tulip bulbs are completely dry before attempting to store them. Dampness can cause the bulbs to rot.

, Damaged tulip bulbs can usually be saved. After drying the bulbs completely, cover the damaged area(s) lightly with a little bit of sulfur to help prevent any rot from developing.

, Place a layer of bulbs in a paper bag or cardboard box. Cover the first layer of bulbs with newspaper.

, The layers of bulbs should not touch each other. You can add dry sand, vermiculite, or peat moss instead of newspaper in the paper bag or cardboard box to help keep tulip bulbs dry.

, Put the bag or box of tulip bulbs in a cool, dry place until early fall. Do not store the bulbs in a refrigerator because fruits and vegetable emit gases that can kill the tulip bulbs. Closets, garages and basements are cool and dry and are better choices for bulb storage.

, Inspect the bulbs at least once every month. Throw out any that have become soft to the touch.

Get your supplies.,
Make your sprouting area.,
Soak your seeds.,
Add the seeds to the soil.,
Place the second pie dish on top of the soil.,
Wait.,
Place them in the sun.,
Eat them when they're ready.",How to Sprout Sunflower Seeds2," You'll need black oil sunflower seeds, glass pie dishes (at least two), and some healthy soil from your local garden store (preferably organic).

, Take one of your glass pie dishes and fill it with soil until it is just below the crust lip.

, Take a 1/4 cup of seeds and soak them in a bowl of water, completely covered in water, for 8 hrs.

, Spread the seeds across the soil and then water them thoroughly.

, Place the bottom surface of the second pie plate on top of the soil, as if you were nesting the plates. Press down and drain the excess water.

, Store your sprouting seed (with the second pie dish still on top) in a warm, dark place. Wait about three days, but check on them every day. When the upper plate is lifted about an inch, remove it from the dark place.

, Remove the upper plate and place the sprouts in a sunny location.

, When they're ready to be eaten, cut the sprouts and rinse them to get rid of the shells. From the time you take them into the sun, it takes roughly another two days for them to be ready to eat. Shorter if it's very warm where you live. Try them in salads, sushi, soup, or sandwiches. Enjoy!

Consider sprouting or growing greens.,
Soak some paper towels.,
Place seeds in the towel.,
Place the paper towel in a plastic bag.,
Set in the sunlight.,
Plant when they are ready.",How to Sprout Sunflower Seeds3," Either method will work for germinating sunflowers for planting, but you can also use the traditional plant germinating method that follows. Sunflowers are notoriously difficult to get to grow straight in their final location and are a favorite snack for birds. Sprouting them before planting might improve your chances of keeping them alive.

, Mist several paper towels in water with a bit of plant food mixed in. The towels should be wet but not soaked and difficult to handle., Place a couple of seeds in the towel with space between them and fold the paper towel up so that they are covered.

, Give the paper towel a few more drops of water and place it in a resealable plastic bag (such as a Zip-loc bag). Seal it most of the way, with just a small, ~1"" gap at the center.

, Set the bag in the sunlight and give the seeds time to germinate.

, Plant when they have sprouted, making sure to place them in soil with a pH between 6.5 and 7. Sunflowers need full sunlight to grow. Consider planting them along a fence or your house, or behind some sturdy trees, to shield them from the wind.


Keep in mind that sunflowers planted in pots will not grow as big as sunflowers planted in the ground.
Sunflowers are draught-tolerant, but you should ensure they get plenty of water while they establish their roots. They can also survive in wet, humid weather, but you will need to make sure they are planted in well-draining soil, like a sand or loam mixture."
"
Remove any diseased plants right away.,
Improve your soil.,
Water your carnations when the top of the soil becomes dry.,
Water carnations in the morning.,
Spread mulch around your carnations.",How to Water Carnations1," If a carnation develops crown rot, cut the dead plant away. The plant must be removed from the garden and put in the trash immediately to help prevent the spread of the disease. This problem is not actually caused by too much water. It is usually caused by soil that drains too slowly.


Slow-draining soil keeps the crown of the plant too wet which sets up ideal conditions for the crown rot fungus to grow.;
, Plant carnations in fast-draining, gritty, loamy soil. If the soil in the garden is heavy clay, build a raised bed for the carnations and fill it with gritty loam.


If it your soil is sandy, mix in a 3-inch depth of sphagnum peat moss, well-aged cow manure, compost and leaf mold to help it retain moisture and improve nutrients. Mix these soil amendments into the soil with a tiller to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).

, Give them enough water to moisten the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm). The moisture depth can be measured by poking a thin, metal rod into the soil. It should slide into the wet soil easily but resist sliding into the dry soil. Push the rod into the ground, hold your thumb and finger on the rod at soil level when it becomes difficult to push, pull the rod out and measure the length of rod that slid into the ground easily.

, Water your plants in the morning so they can easily absorb the water during the heat of the day. Use a soaker hose or water them with a watering can to avoid getting the leaves wet. They generally need 1 to 1 ½ inches of water each week.

, Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of shredded bark mulch around the carnations to reduce moisture loss but keep the mulch off of the plant crowns and an inch or so away from the stems.

Choose a planting location for the clematis.,
Purchase building support for your clematis.,
Select the right clematis for your garden.",How to Train Clematis1," For optimal growth, clematis need six hours of sun each day so a sunny location is necessary. As for its roots, clematis prefer well-drained, moist soil with a pH that is neutral to slightly alkaline.Prep soil that is more on the acidic side by periodically “sweetening” it with wood ash or a little limestone.;
, Clematis are climbing plants that naturally grow upward instead of growing out like most traditional plants. In order to grow upward at its maximum height, they need support to facilitate their growth.Bird netting offers a nearly visible means of climbing support to clematis plants. Attach it to something in your garden with a staple or a fastener to prevent it from collapse over the years of the clematis plant’s growth.Consider installing garden structures, like arbors or pergolas, which offer beauty and regality to your garden while providing support for clematis to scale. Add some bird wire between the ground and the first rung of the arbor to help young clematis grab and climb up more easily.Allow them to climb on a rock wall in your yard by planting them near there. Purchase some wire to help them gain access to being able to scale the wall over time.A trellis is also a common choice to place in gardens and are often inexpensive, little hassle options to helping the climbing clematis climb.

, If you have the room, cultivars that grow to be 10-20 feet vines might be what you’re looking for. For smaller gardens or potted plants, a more compact variety of clematis might be your preference. Standard clematis flowers blossom with a measurement of 5-6 inches across.Clematis flowers come in smaller blossoms and larger blossoms in different colors like white, wine red, lavender, deep purple, and even yellow.Because the growth of the vine can take years to reach maturity, it is advised to purchase a clematis that is at least two years in age to shorten the wait. Look for a container-grown plant that’s in a quart or gallon-size pot and robust in growth."

Cut your flower stems at a sharp angle.,
Use a clean vase to store your carnations.,
Try adding a teaspoon of sugar to the water you put into your vase.,
Consider adding alcohol to your sugar and water mixture.,
Change the color of your carnations.",How to Water Carnations2," Try to cut the flowers at a sharp angle so that water and other nutrients can be more readily taken up by the plants. This allows the plants to last for longer periods of time.

, Using a clean vase to store cut flowers is likewise recommended because doing so will help eliminate potential pathogens and reduce the speed of decomposition. Refreshing the vase’s water every few days or so will also help preserve cut flowers. While fresh water can be used on its own to keep the flowers alive, some of the following solutions can be more helpful for preserving the life of one’s carnations.

, A teaspoon or two of sugar can be added to the water but 7-up or Sprite also works. The sugar in all three helps improve the longevity of cut flowers. Mix the sugar and water together and then add the carnations.


Another option is using 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar and 2 teaspoons sugar in the vase water to not only keep out germs but also feed the plants.

, Using sugar and several drops of any type of alcoholic spirit in the vase water will help to keep the flowers fresh. The alcohol prevents bacteria from growing in the vase because it is a disinfectant.


A fourth solution is using a liter of water and ¼ teaspoon of bleach to preserve cut flowers. Sugar can also be added if gardeners wish to do so. The presence of bleach will help keep the vase water clean.

, Carnations have the ability to change colors if the soak in water that is dyed a certain color. However, this process works best with white carnations, as they absorb colors more easily than other types of carnations. To do this, add a few drops of food coloring to the water in your vase. Mix the coloring into the water and place your carnations in the vase.


Colored carnations can be turned orange or purple by using yellow or blue dye.

Prepare a hole to plant the clematis.,
Mix top soil from the hole with compost and a good organic fertilizer.,
Prepare the clematis for planting.,
Remove the clematis plant from the pot.,
Examine the soil line of the plant and ground.,
Water the clematis thoroughly.",How to Train Clematis2," Use the pot of the plant’s size to determine the size of the hole you’re digging. The hole needs to be approximately 18 inches wide and 18 inches deep.Position the hole near the center of the climbing fence or wall to give the clematis something to grow up against.
If you notice that the ground has poor drainage, consider making a larger hole for the plant., Line the hole generously with some backfill of the mixture. Replenishing areas of the soil with fertilizer and compost moisture helps facilitate the growth of clematis by giving them cool soil to grow within., As with planting any plant, watering it before the actual planting is imperative. It’s especially crucial with clematis plants because they need a lot of water to grow and to keep cool. Prep it for planting by watering it deeply.

, Push up on the bottom of the pot and slide the clematis plant out sideways into your free hand. Avoid pulling on the training stake in the pot or the clematis’s vine to remove it from the pot.If you find yourself having a hard time with sliding the plant out, roll it gently one half turn on the ground while lightly pushing it down to loosen up the sides.Be gentle with the roots of the clematis. Most of them will be at the lower half of the flower pot. If you must, tease the roots away from the sides, but do so gently.

, Place the clematis in the hole, situating it at about two inches lower than the ground. It is important that the roots stay cool. Fill the remainder of the hole and the area on top of the pot’s soil line with the compost, fertilizer, soil mixture., If some vines are left exposed by settling soil, cover the areas with some more of the extra soil mixture. Mulch the clematis carefully after the filling and watering of the plant is completed.Mulch helps soil retain moisture which is important for clematis plants. Use mulch, stone, or pine bark to help soil keep its moisture.
Water new clematis plants regularly in their first growing season so that their growth is off to a successful start.As much as four watering cans per square meter may be required to water the plants appropriately."
"
Be sure that the clematis will have something to climb on.,
Grow clematis plants up the length of a brick wall with vine eyes.,
Display clematis in your garden by training them against screens and pergolas.,
Train clematis plants up along arches.",How to Train Clematis3," Clematis plants climb by wrapping their leaf stems around the base of something. Clematis can successfully climb onto base supports made of wire, thin branches, steel rods, wooden dowels, fishing line, or twine.Make sure that whatever surface you choose to use isn’t too wide for the leaf stems to twist around. The diameter should not be more than half an inch wide in diameter., Vine eyes are large metal screws with circular endings that are driven or screwed into brickwork or masonry to create support for a wall. Wire lattice is threaded between them and pulled tightly after the vine eyes are screwed in.Tie the stems of the growing plant to the wire support. This can be done by incorporating metal wire, string, and paper covered twist ties.Check on the ties regularly to make sure that they are not too tight around the delicate growing stems. Loosen them and adjust them as needed., Make sure that the site is not too affected by wind and rain so that a variety of different clematis plants can be grown. Prevent premature rotting in wood areas by treating the bottom of the structure on the ground with a wood preservative., For full coverage, use two clematis plants on either side to create full coverage.Consider using scented clematis plants in those locations to greet passerby with sweet-smelling fragrance."

Transplant bulbs when they are visible to avoid damage.,
Transplant bulbs in the fall to achieve the best results.,
Dig up bulbs gently to ensure their health.,
Know how deep your bulbs are to avoid damaging them.,
Separate your bulbs prior to transplantation.,
Plant your bulbs in sunny and well-drained soil to let them flourish.",How to Transplant Bulbs1," It’s always easiest to move bulbs when you know where they are, so gardeners usually try to transplant bulb plants when some of the plant is still visible above the ground.


After flowering, the plant will focus on drawing in nourishment to sustain it over the winter.
For this reason, you must avoid cutting green foliage as this deprives the plant of the ability to nourish itself and store energy from sunlight to see it through the winter.;
, It’s always best to transplant bulbs in the fall after the foliage has withered away and is yellow.


You can also move bulbs in the springtime but remember never to cut or damage any green shoots.
If you move them in the spring take especial care not to damage the growing roots at this time.

, The trick with digging up bulbs is to avoid damaging the main bulb and to preserve as much of the root structure as possible.


This can be pretty hard to do.
Gentle handling is always necessary when moving bulbs from place to place.

, When you plant a bulb, you should always do so at a depth of several times the height of the bulb. So when it comes to digging them up, that will give you an idea of how deep you need to dig to avoid damaging the bulb with your spade.


Three times the height of the bulb is the usual depth for planting.
Also, bulbs often wriggle deeper into the ground over time, which may add to the depth they were initially planted at.
For example, larger bulbs such as tulips or daffodils will usually be planted to a depth of about 8 inches (20.3 cm). It’s best to assume they are at 12 inches (30.5 cm) depth to be on the safe side.

, Bulb plants reproduce by dividing the original ‘parent’ bulb into several ‘daughter’ bulbs, known as ‘offsets’. This happens over a period of years.


If you observe that your bulb has formed a clump of smaller bulbs, gently separate these with your fingers.
The new bulbs can be planted separately and is a good way of increasing your bulb stock.
This will also help avoid damaging neighboring bulbs by pulling apart their roots.

, Bulbs are usually fairly easy plants to grow, but they will appreciate well-drained soil and a sunny site. Avoid planting bulbs any place where puddles form and don’t easily disperse after rainfall.


Try squeezing a handful of damp earth.
If it forms a sticky mass when squeezed, rather than crumbling, then your garden soil may be clay-heavy.
If this is the case, it’s a good idea to incorporate lots of organic matter or grit into the soil to improve drainage.
Do this well ahead of replanting the transplanted bulbs.
Regardless of soil type, bulbs will appreciate plenty of organic matter such as a well-rotted manure being incorporated at planting time.

"
"
Store your bulbs properly to prevent rot.,
Keep your bulbs in a cool, dry place to ensure their longevity.,
Plant your bulbs at a depth equivalent to 3 times its height to ensure good growth.,
Take additional steps for bulbs planted in containers.,
Water container-planted bulbs to keep them hydrated.",How to Transplant Bulbs2," It’s always best to replant bulbs immediately after digging them up. If this really isn’t possible, your can store them for short periods. The trick is to avoid letting them rot.


After lifting your bulbs, remove as much soil as is possible.
Trim any straggly roots and pick off any flaking layers from the bulb itself.
Discard any diseased or rotting bulbs.
Lay the bulbs on a tray or other flat surface and allow to dry out for a day or two.
Then, put the bulbs into a container of sawdust or into paper bags with some peat moss.
Some gardeners use net bags of the kind used to store oranges.
The trick is to allow dry air to circulate to prevent the bulbs from getting damp and rotting.
For the reason, it’s best not to overcrowd bulbs and prevent them touching each other as this can lead to rot spreading.

, Keep your stored bulbs in a cool dry place such as an unheated garden shed where temperatures don’t fall below freezing.


Spring flowering bulbs are best planted in the autumn; summer flowering ones in spring.
You will hear of some gardeners dusting bulbs with fungicide ahead of storing them. This is always a good idea but isn’t essential.

, Aim to plant your bulbs at a depth of about 3 times the bulb’s height. Bulbs should also be planted at least twice the width of the bulb apart.


This means a 2 inch (5.1 cm) bulb should be planted 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep and at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) from its neighbor.
It’s a good idea to add a handful of compost to the bottom of the hole for the bulb to sit on.
Put the bulb in the hole with the pointed end facing upwards and fill the hole in.
Water well and avoid treading down the earth with your foot as this can cause damage.
Bulbs will do well planted under grass but remember not to mow the area over the bulbs until the foliage has withered away, usually in the late summer.

, Bulbs will tolerate being replanted in a container. It’s a good idea to incorporate some grit into the compost at a ratio of 1 part grit to about 3 parts compost, to encourage the proper growth of contain-planed bulbs.


Container bulbs need to be planted at a depth of three times their size but they will tolerate more crowding than ground-planted bulbs – an inch of separation is fine.
Avoid allowing the bulbs to touch. Feed container-planted bulbs regularly during the growing season (spring-summer).

, Container-planted bulbs will need watering throughout the growing season – this usually means spring and summer. Once the foliage starts to die back, cut back on watering as this will help the plant go dormant.


Don’t let the container dry out completely, even when the bulbs are dormant over winter.

Cover the chrysanthemums in a layer of mulch in milder climates.,
Lift the chrysanthemums and overwinter them indoors in colder climates.",How to Root Chrysanthemum Cuttings," Spring is the best time to take cuttings from last year’s Chrysanthemums. You should have cut these back after flowering the previous fall so they will still be quite short.;
, Ahead of taking cuttings, move the outdoor plants into a cool indoor space such as an unheated (but frost-free) conservatory.


A temperature of about 45 °F (7 °C) is ideal. Do this in mid-winter, say around January.
Water the plants once you bring them inside – in about a month they will have enough growth to take cuttings from, provided you keep the soil moist and the temperature around 45–50 °F (7–10 °C).

, Chrysanthemum cuttings can just be snapped off the parent plant with your fingers, or using a sharp clean knife.


Take fresh healthy stems of about 3 inches (7.6 cm) in length from as far down the plant as possible. Try to keep the cuttings uniform in length.
Usually, only about a third of the cuttings will take, so it’s best to take three times as many cuttings as you want new plants.
Remove the lower leaves from each stem, leaving only the ones at the very top.

, Take a plug tray or individual pots filled with a cutting compost or a compost and perlite mix. If using a mix, take 4 parts regular compost to 1 of perlite. You might like to sprinkle some more perlite on top of the compost trays.

, Before planting, dip the end of each cutting in hormone rooting powder to a depth of about half an inch on the cut end. Shake very gently to remove excess.


Use a slim stick, pencil or barbecue stick to make a hole in the compost. Put the cutting in the hole to a depth of about an inch and firm very gently with your fingers.
Add a label with the name and date to the tray containing the cuttings and then water them.

, If you do this, insert some sticks into the soil to stop the bag from touching the cuttings.


Alternately, cut the spout off a clear plastic drinks bottle and invert it over the cutting to make a mini greenhouse.
You can also put them into a heated propagator unit – this heats the cuttings from below, which may help them to root.

, Keep the chrysanthemum cuttings in a well-lit place out of direct sunlight. A window ledge that doesn’t receive full sunlight is ideal. The temperature should be fairly cool but above freezing.


The cuttings should root in about 4 weeks. When you see roots appear underneath the plant, replant them into individual pots.

, Once the plants get established it’s recommended that you stake them using a slim stake such as a wooden barbecue or kebab stick. Gently tie the main stem to the stake using string or wire ties.

, If grown indoors or under glass, the cuttings will need some time to adjust to life outdoors by ‘hardening off’. This lets them acclimatize to the moving air and different humidity and temperatures of the outside without being shocked so much that their development is badly affected.


To harden plants off, move plants sown inside your home to a cooler space such as an unheated greenhouse. You can leave your plants outside during the day but bring them in at night.
Plants grown under glass, especially in a heated greenhouse, also need to be hardened off in the outdoors. They can go outside permanently once all danger of frost passes.

, A few weeks ahead of planting outside, prepare the chrysanthemum's new location, as follows:


Dig in some well-rotted manure or compost a few weeks before planting outside and apply a general fertilizer such as blood, fish and bone.
After planting you might consider a nitrogen-rich dressing such as dried chicken manure pellets applied to the surface of the ground.

, Once your cuttings get established and grow into young plants (usually by late spring) it’s good practice to pinch them to encourage new stems to form – this leads to bushy growth and more blooms.


Traditionally this is done on June 1st but anytime in early summer — once the plant has just over six leaf stems — is fine. Count the bottom six leaf stems on the main stem of the plant.
Remove the main stem about a quarter inch above the upper leaf stem leaving only 6 leaf stems on the plant.

, You can use the pinched off part of the plant as a cutting and try to root it. Just remove the lower leaves from the cut piece, shorten the stem to about 4 inches (10.2 cm) in length and repeat the steps in the sections above for rooting cuttings.

, After a few weeks you’ll see vigorous stems form below where you pinched the plant. You might like to disbud at this stage. This means removing any developing stems at the base of the main plant stem.


It’s best to leave three or maybe four healthy stems at the top of the plant whilst removing any growing further down the stem.

, When flowering ends, cut the chrysanthemum plant back to about 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the ground. This helps the plant to store more energy for winter.

, Some species of Chrysanthemum will survive outdoors over a mild winter, provided they have a good mulch and well drained soil.


Before the ground gets too cold in the fall, apply a 3 inch (7.6 cm) mulch of something like well rotted manure.
This can go around the base of the plant.

, If you expect a cold winter where temperatures drop below -5 degrees, or your soil drainage isn’t very good, you are advised to lift your Chrysanthemums over winter.


Dig up the chrysanthemums, remove any greenery and shake off the soil. Place in a tray of fairly dry compost.
Store the plants in a frost-free place such as an insulated shed or a cool conservatory attached to your home. The compost just be kept slightly moist but never wet.

, Don't worry if it doesn't have many leaves left. They will grow back, but until then it will be just fine.

,, If you can poke your finger into one of the drainage holes on the bottom and not feel moisture, water it with about 3/4 of a cup of water (they like mist, for the record). Also with your finger or a rod of some sort pull out one pistol or stamen from each bract; this increases color in your plant


This will end up making your plant look like a stick for a while, due to the pulling of the dead leaves, but this is perfectly natural. Then you can choose to put it in a dark place for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours of light (this is optional, it just adds color to the Bracts and helps with flower production - increasing bracts (colored leafs).







, Not in direct light at first, however. Ease it in.

If you live anywhere north of 40° N latitude (think Denver), only keep it out from around July 20 - Aug 18th.

Understand what deadheading is.,
Pinch off the dead flower with your fingertips.,
Try to avoid removing the entire stalk of the plant.,
Be aware that bearded Iris will sometimes flower twice.,
Consider leaving the seed heads on the plant if you like the way that they look.,
Leave the seed heads on the plant if you want to grow more Irises.",How to Take Care of Irises when Their Flowers Die1," Deadheading is when you remove dead flower heads from a plant. This process stops seeds from growing once the flowers have faded. Producing seeds takes up a plants energy that could otherwise be put towards producing new growth.


Deadheading also help to tidy up your garden and get rid of withered, faded flower petals. Dead iris flowers tend to turn brown very quickly and aren’t very attractive.;
, To deadhead an Iris flower, you can pinch off the spent flower using your fingertips. Alternatively, use a sharp blade to remove the flower. You need to cut off not just the dead flower petals but also the slightly swollen fat bud-like sheath the petals grow from.


This bulb-like part of the plant is where the seeds will form.

, Don’t remove the entire stalk of the plant in case there are other buds that have yet to emerge and bloom.


Some Iris flowers will fade after a day, but deadheading them can help the plant to form new blooms more quickly, so try not to cut away the whole plant.

, Bearded Iris may bloom at the beginning and end of summer. Wait until this second round of flowering has occurred before cutting your flowers back. Once you know the flowering season is over, you can use a sharp pair of garden cutters to remove the tough stem. However, do not cut away any green foliage that is still on the plant.


Removing the stem will help to prevent the plant from rotting, and will also help to clean up the look of your garden.
Once you have cut away the stem, place it in your compost.

, You’ll notice that there are some varieties of Iris that have pretty seed heads. Many gardeners leave the flowers on varieties such as Stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and Blackberry lily (Belamcanda) to enjoy the display of seed heads.


Just be aware that when you leave the seed heads on, the seeds may spread, causing other Irises to grow throughout your garden.

, Leaving the seed heads on will make it more likely that new Irises will grow in other parts of your garden. However, be aware that Irises grown from seeds may not look exactly like the original parent plant.


You could also collect the seeds and grow them yourself. To do this, soak the seeds in water for 48 hours. Plant the seeds once they have soaked.

Avoid cutting the foliage after the flowers die.,
Cut or pull away the foliage once fall comes around.,
Give your Iris fertilizer if the foliage is looking pale.,
Divide your irises every three to five years.,
Feed your Iris at the beginning of spring.,
Mulch around the plant, rather than directly over the rhizomes.,
Water your plants in dry weather.",How to Take Care of Irises when Their Flowers Die2," It’s very important to leave the green foliage on the plant after the flowering ends. This is because the plant draws energy into its roots through the foliage, and stores this energy to help it survive the winter.


Leave the foliage on the plant until it withers away of its own accord. It’s okay to trim off any brown tips but leave as much healthy green growth as possible.

, Once the foliage has withered in the fall, you can cut back the foliage to about six inches from the ground. If possible, wait to do this until after the first hard frosts.


Try to pull off the dead foliage, rather than cutting the plant if at all possible. Cutting the plant can make the it more susceptible to disease.

, Irises generally don’t need much fertilizer. However, if the foliage isn’t a green healthy color then consider giving your Irises some fertilizer after they finish blooming.


A granular fertilizer can be gently raked into the soil around the plant. Make sure it mixes into the top few inches of soil.

, Dividing your Iris rhizome will boost your plant’s health and performance. Wait until six weeks after the plant’s blooms die to divide your rhizome. To divide your Iris:


Dig up the rhizome and cut it into four to six pieces, each with a healthy bit of leaf and root attached. Replant each rhizome so that they are about 18 inches (45.7 cm) apart.

, When blooming is about to begin again, give your Iris some fertilizer to help it produce healthy blooms.


Choose a fertilizer that is low in nitrogen relative to potash (potassium) and phosphorus. Fertilizers that have high amounts of nitrogen can make Irises more prone to rot.

, Try to avoid putting mulch directly over your rhizomes, as this can cause them to rot. However, you can surround the plant with about two inches of mulch, so long as the rhizomes aren’t buried.


Try to avoid using manure when mulching your Irises.

, While Irises are pretty independent plants, they still may need some water in very dry weather. However, try to avoid over watering these plants, as they are very prone to rot.

Prune in early spring.,
Wear thick gardening gloves.,
Disinfect your pruning shears.",How to Prune Bougainvillea1," Bougainvillea can technically be pruned at any time of the year, but the best time to do so for the integrity of the plant is in very early spring, before the plant has begun to produce buds for new flowers. If you wait until the buds have formed, you'll cut off the new growth and limit flower production. If you prune too early, frost can kill the new growth that immediately emerges after pruning.Bougainvillea bloom in cycles, with months of vigorous blooming followed by rest periods. Pruning before the beginning of a new cycle allows the vine to produce vigorous new growth.
The exact month of the year during which bougainvillea should be pruned differs by region. The easiest way to tell whether it's time is to simply check the weather or the Farmer’s Almanac.When the last chance of frost has passed, but before the vine has begun to bud, it's time to prune.;
, Many bougainvillea species have thick, very sharp thorns that can hurt your hands. Also, some species are poisonous and can even give you a rash or inflame your skin. If you're planning a big pruning session, get prepped by donning a pair of thick gloves. You might also want to wear long sleeves in a thick material to protect your wrists and arms. Some bougainvillea branches have hardly any thorns, but others are completely covered in them., Wiping the pruning shears you're going to use with rubbing alcohol or another disinfectant will keep you from spreading disease. If you trim off a portion of bougainvillea that has been affected by disease, you don't want to spread it to another section by using the same dirty blades. Plan to wipe off the blades of your shears each time you cut off dead bougainvillea.

"
"
Cut away dead or diseased portions of the plant.,
Remove large, obstructive branches.,
Trim the bougainvillea throughout the growing season.,
Pinch tips as the flowers fade.,
Cut back new growth midway through the blooming cycle.",How to Prune Bougainvillea2," This is the first major step when it comes to pruning. To ensure the long-term health of the plant, you want to cut back anything that looks dead or discolored. That way, you can prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the plant. Cut the branches back to a node or flush with the main stem.


Remember to wipe your pruning shears with the disinfectant after pruning diseased branches before pruning healthy branches to prevent disease from spreading.
Remove the diseased branches from the area, so they don't contaminate the plant.

, Pruning should open up the plant and allow it to grow into a healthy shape. If certain branches seem to be threatening the health of the plant, cut them away. Step back to look at the bougainvillea and continue pruning to obtain the shape you desire.Bear in mind that with each cut you make, new branches will emerge. Pruning helps the plant grow thicker and bushier. If you see an area that looks stringy, make a strategic cut to help it branch out there.
Many bougainvillea are trained to grow up a trellis or along a fence. As you prune, you can gently wrap new shoots around the structure to which the plant is being trained, to encourage growth in that direction.
Bougainvillea shrubs can be pruned to achieve all sorts of shapes. If you're growing yours in a pot, you can even prune it to take on the shape of a small tree.

, Trimming different from pruning, in that you're not taking out entire branches, but instead performing smaller cuts designed to maintain the shape of the plant. Use pruning shears to trim the tips of the branches just after the last node. This will encourage a new branch to form there.


You can remove dead wood from the plant by trimming it at any time of year, but save the bigger pruning cuts for early spring, when the plant won't get damaged.

, Perform what is called pinch pruning in between regular prunings. Simply pinch off the tops of the blooms with your fingers once they have faded, then pinch back to the next nearest branch. This will encourage new growth and new blooms.

, You can encourage a flush of new blooms by cutting back the new growth by half at the midpoint of the blooming cycle. Make cuts just above nodes to encourage new branching to occur.Be sure not to wait too late in the season, though, since toward the end of the cycle it will be too late to encourage new blooms.
Don't cut into the old growth until early spring.

Check your dahlia's stems and leaves.,
Cut your plants back.,
Dig up your dahlia.,
Remove loose dirt gently.,
Dry your tubers.",How to Store Dahlias over Winter1," In order to properly overwinter your dahlias, you will have to dig them up at the right time. Check your dahlias regularly; when their stems and leaves have turned black you can dig them up.


This will generally occur a few weeks after the first frost.;
, Digging up the dahlias after the first frost allows the plant to use its stems to feed the tubers for the coming season. The absorption of nutrients must occur for the plant to have a good chance of surviving the winter.


Once the leaves and stems are fully black, cut them back to within a few inches of the ground, leaving only the primary stems behind.

, Dig a circular hole more than a foot from the stem of the plant to begin the digging process. Use a fork turner to lift the plant out of the soil, rather than pulling on the stem. Pulling on the stem could harm the tubers.

, Once free from the soil, remove any loose dirt and debris from the tubers but don’t use force; the plant’s tubers are extremely delicate. Try to avoid damaging or breaking the tubers when you dislodge the dirt.


You can also rinse the dirt off with water if you are concerned about breaking or damaging the tubers.

, Once the tubers are clean, hang them to dry in a covered area. Make sure to hang these tubers upside down to encourage proper drying.


You can hang the tubers to dry in a shed, garage, or other cool, dry space.

Pick out a pot that is larger than your plant.,
Fill your pot with soil that drains well.,
Make sure your pot has drainage holes.,
Give your Gardenia the humidity it needs.,
Consider keeping your Gardenia outdoors.,
Think about growing your Gardenias indoors.,
Help your plant to adjust to its new location.",How to Raise Gardenias in Pots1," When you plant your Gardenia in a pot, aim to put the plant into a pot that is roughly four inches larger than the pot you purchased it in. You should retain as much of the original soil as possible.


Getting a bigger pot will allow your Gardenia the space it needs to grow.;
, Gardenias do best in soil that drains, rather than soil that allows puddles to form. Some gardeners suggest a mix of peat moss, coarse sand and potting compost (choose a compost for acid-loving plants, which is also known as ericaceous compost).

, Choose a pot with very good drainage holes. Make sure the pot is big enough for the plant so the roots don’t clog up the drainage holes.


Don’t stand your pot in a trough or saucer as doing this can retain water, which makes the roots remain wet.

, Gardenias need humidity to survive. You can help provide a humid atmosphere by laying stones or pebbles under the plant pot. Spray the stones with water every morning; the water will slowly evaporate throughout the day, which will create humidity for your plant.Alternately, get a shallow tray that is wider than the pot. Put some stones or gravel in the tray and add water. The water should not reach the top of the stones and should not touch the plant pot. Stand the Gardenia pot on the stones. The bottom of the pot must not touch water.
Keep the water topped up as the moisture will evaporate providing some humidity for the plant above.

, Gardenias can be grown outdoors in US zones 8 through 11, where temperatures generally don’t drop below 10 or 15 degrees Fahrenheit (-12.2 to -9.4 degrees Celsius).In warmer zones it will be necessary to shade the plant from the main heat of the summer sun. Make sure you water the plant and attend to the humidity as described in the previous step.


Move the pot indoors in zone 7 (where temperatures reach 0 or 5 degrees Fahrenheit, or -17.8 to -15 degrees Celsius)., The area where you place your pot will depend on the temperature you keep your house at. If you keep your house at a room temperature above 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 degrees Celsius), you should place your Gardenia on a bright window ledge (though the plant should not be in direct sunlight).


If the house is below 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 degrees Celsius), Gardenias can tolerate some shade or darkness. They’ll stand temperatures that drop down to about 35 degrees F (1.6 degrees C) in the shade but won’t enjoy going below 20 degrees F (-6.6 degrees C).

, If you are moving your potted Gardenia from indoors to outdoors, or the other way around, let it acclimate slowly to its new position.


For example, when moving a plant outdoors, put it outside during the day but move it back indoors at night for two to three weeks before leaving it out all day and night.

Place the tubers into crates.,
Check for signs of decay regularly.,
Divide your dahlias.,
Replant your dahlias in a pot with fresh soil.",How to Store Dahlias over Winter2," When dry, place the tubers and stem into the crates and cover with a dry material. This dry material could include:


Sand.
Shredded newspaper.
Peat.

, Cover the plant and check every few weeks for signs of black or off-colored growth. This growth could indicate decay. A plant that is wilting and limpness is dehydrated.


If your plant is dehydrated, lightly mist the tubers with water until they are slightly moist.
If you find any decayed parts of the plant, remove these damaged parts to give the remainder of the plant a better chance for recovery.

, A few weeks before the last frost move the tubers to a new workstation. Divide any large tubers now to give the new cuts a better chance of resisting mildew, rot, and fungus.


Break the buds down until only one large bud remains in each section.

, Place each section of dahlia into a pot with fresh soil and fertilizer. Store the plant in a sheltered area out of direct sunlight. Once the leaves have formed and hardened off you can move the plant into direct sunlight or back to its original location before the winter.

Keep your local climate in mind when growing Gardenias.,
Look out for iron chlorosis.,
Watch out for signs that your plant has been overwatered.,
Recognize signs that your plant is receiving too much sun.",How to Raise Gardenias in Pots2," Only water your plant when the soil is dry below the surface. Water the soil and not the foliage. The soil should never be sodden and the water should always drain away easily.


Try to water with rainwater rather than tap water, if possible.

, Gardenias need regular fertilizing. Feed your plants every three weeks or monthly during the spring or summer growing period.


Try to use a fertilizer for acid-loving plants, which you can purchase at your local supply store.

, While it’s possible to bring Gardenias indoors for the cooler seasons, they still require a lot of light and humidity that’s difficult to achieve indoors. In favorable climates they will die back in cooler months but return and bloom again.


If you are really struggling to grow Gardenias the local climate may not be right for them, either indoors or out.

, Light green or yellow leaves with darker veins (especially on new growth) indicate iron chlorosis in Gardenia. Try treating this problem with an iron chlorosis spray like Miracid.

, Leaf drop, or yellowing leaves, indicates the plant has been given too much water.


If the plant has too little water you’ll see the leaves turn brown at the tips.

, If you see an outdoor Gardenia plant wilting, it may be getting too much midday sun. Move your plant to a shadier location during the summer midday heat.


Mist your plant several times a day until the plant recovers.

Plant your Gardenias in lighter containers if you plan to bring them inside during the winter.,
Take caution when living in cold climates.,
Continue feeding Gardenias over winter.",How to Raise Gardenias in Pots3," If you expect to have to bring Gardenias in over winter because you live in a cold climate, do yourself a favor by planting them in lighter container materials. You may otherwise find it too difficult to try to bring the heavy pots in for the winter.


Light materials include plastic (you can put the ugly plastic pot inside a more attractive pot).
You could also put your pot on a pot trolley to make heavier pots easier to move.

, In zones 6 and cooler it’s important to bring Gardenias outside only in warmer temperatures. The rest of the time they will need to be in heated spaces indoors.


Zone 6 temperatures can drop down to -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-23.3 degrees Celsius)., A general purpose fertilizer given over six weekly intervals is ideal. Reduce watering over winter but do not allow the plant to dry out completely.

Cut your perennial plants back twice a year.,
Keep your warm climate in mind.,
Avoid pruning after the first blooms appear.,
Prune very tall varieties of sunflowers in June or July.,
Know that your annual flowers will not bloom again.",How to Prune Sunflowers1," A good general rule for pruning perennial sunflowers is to cut them down to half their size in the late spring or early summer. Then, reduce their size again by a third in June or July.;
, Gardeners from warmer climates should prune Maximillian, swamp (Helianthus angustifolius), and willow leafed (Helianthus salicifolius) sunflowers to two-thirds of their original height in June.


This procedure will keep these potential giants at a more manageable size and eliminate the need to stake them.

, Most perennial sunflower species bloom between mid and late summer. Gardeners should keep an eye on their plants at such times and refrain from pruning them after their buds start forming.However, the rules are slightly different for late summer blooming varieties. Late summer blooming types should be pruned back when they reach between 1.5 to 2 feet (0.5 to 0.6 m) in height, because they will recover in a few weeks and bloom regardless of the cuts.

, Maximilian sunflowers (Helianthus maximiliani) and Mexican sunflowers (Tithonia diversifolia) should be trimmed in June or July. This will reduce the sunflowers’ size from their typical height of 9 feet (2.7 m) or greater to a much more manageable 4 feet (1.2 m).Maximilian sunflowers can also be left standing through the winter months as food for the birds. If you choose to leave your tall sunflowers for the birds, they can be cut to the ground in the early spring to prepare the plant for new growth.

, Annual sunflowers can be trimmed back to the ground when they start to dry out and turn brown. They will not bloom again so many gardeners choose to remove them from their gardens entirely.

"
Know which plants can potentially be saved.,
Accept the fact that certain bulbs cannot be reused.,
Trim off the flowering stalks.,
Place the plant in a cool but sunny windowsill.,
Dig up the bulbs once the plant goes dormant.,
Follow a separate process for amaryllises.,
Allow the bulbs to dry out, then store them in a cool, dry place.",How to Save and Replant Forced Seasonal Bulbs1," Hyacinths, crocuses, daffodils, snowdrops and scillas that are grown in soil or soil-like mediums can usually be replanted for later use in the garden. Keep in mind though that sometimes even the best efforts can’t save spent plants.


However, amaryllises are widely known for their ability to flower on a yearly basis.;
, You will not be able to replant certain forced seasonal bulbs, such as the following:


Plants that are grown in water should be thrown out because the process saps their strength and they are unlikely to bloom again.
Tulips are less likely than any other plant to return after being forced so they should be thrown out.
Gardeners in extremely cold areas may also have difficulty getting certain tropical daffodil species to re-bloom.

, Once the blossoms have died, gardeners can trim off the flowering stalks but they should leave the greenery alone if they want their seasonal bulbs to flower in the following year. The leaves are essential for helping the plants obtain the nutrients that they will need to survive dormancy and return in the spring.


On amaryllises, the cut flower stalk may emit a large amount of sap after being cut but this is perfectly normal and no cause for alarm.

, Gardeners will need to place the pot with the green foliage on a cool (about 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 15.5 to 18.3 degrees Celsius) sunny windowsill so it can more easily store up nutrients for later use.Applying 5-10-5 fertilizer to the bulb plants every two weeks to help the plant store the nutrients it will need for the winter.

, After the leaves begin to turn brown, the bulbs no longer need water or fertilizer because they have entered dormancy. Their soil should be allowed to dry out completely so that rot doesn’t take hold.


At this point, the leaves can be trimmed off if any remain. The plant can be stored in its container or the bulb can be dug up for storage purposes.

, Amaryllises are the exception to the aforementioned scenario. They should be given ample sunlight and kept watered for the entire winter. They are often placed outside for the warmer months of the year.


Amaryllises can either enter a forced dormancy around August for Christmas blooms or be left outdoors until the late autumn months when temperatures begin to drop. At such times, they should be allowed to dry out.
They will store best at temperatures of around 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.7 degrees Celsius), either in their pots or in the ground. After about two months in storage, these plants will send up shoots. When this occurs, they can be shifted to a warmer spot indoors (about 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit) for winter blooms.

, All other bulbs should be allowed to dry out. Take the time to gently dust the dirt off of the bulbs. Once cleaned, these dormant pants can be kept in paper bags in a cool, dry place.


These sacks can also be filled with dry sand, vermiculite, or sawdust to prevent the bulbs from drying out.
Gardeners will also need to label their bulbs, because otherwise they may get their plants mixed up while they’re in storage.

Sterilize all pruning equipment prior to use.,
Trim away unhealthy parts of the plant first.,
Prune your perennials so that they take on the desired shape.,
Water your plants after you prune them.",How to Prune Sunflowers2," Sterilizing your pruning equipment is particularly important if you have dealt with some diseased plant parts recently. This will prevent any lingering bacteria or germs from unintentionally being spread throughout the garden.


Prune sunflowers with sharp bypass hand pruners or hedge shears.

, Trim any sick, weak, damaged, crossing, or dead branches off of your plant before starting into any sort of heavy pruning operation.


Diseased parts should be kept out of the compost bin to prevent the ailment in question from being transmitted to any other plants. These bits of debris will instead need to be burned or bagged up and left for the local waste crews to collect.

, Once you have cut away all of the unhealthy branches, you can choose to prune your perennial sunflowers for shape.


Some people prefer to only prune away damaged parts of the plant so that their sunflowers can take on a more wild look.

, Water the sunflowers regularly after pruning to help them recover from the stress of being trimmed back. Give them enough water to thoroughly soak the soil every time the top inch of the soil becomes dry.

"
"
Replant the bulbs outdoors after the last hard frost.,
Select a sunny, well-drained spot for replanting.,
Be aware that the bulbs may not flower in the first year.",How to Save and Replant Forced Seasonal Bulbs2," The bulbs can be planted outdoors in the garden as soon as the soil thaws, if the leaves have died.


If the bulbs were forced late enough in the season that they still have green leaves in the spring, plant them outdoors right away after the last expected hard frost.
Plant the bulbs at a depth equal to three to four times the bulb’s width.

, When gardeners go to replant the seasonal bulbs, they should select a sunny, well-drained spot. They may also want to add some fertilizer to the soil to encourage the plants to bloom and then do the same in the fall of the year for the same reasons.

, Gardeners should be aware that forced bulb plants may not flower the year after they are replanted. These bulbs could need some time to recover from this process because, when gardeners force the blooms, doing so uses up a great deal of energy. Plants tend to need about two years to recover completely from being forced.


Again, amaryllises are the exception. If given adequate care, these plants will get larger with each passing year. Older specimens are known to produce many large flowers on an annual basis.

Decide whether it's necessary to prune your lilies.,
Deadhead any spent blooms from your lily throughout the growing season.,
Wait until the foliage has died and withered away before pruning.,
Replant your lily in a container (optional).,
Prune the foliage to ground level.,
Cut away any damaged or diseased foliage throughout the year.,
After pruning, mulch the ground to help the bulbs survive winter.",How to Prune Lilies1," The main reason to prune any variety of lily is for the appearance and to remove any diseased or damaged growth in the hope of preserving the rest of the plant.


Unlike shrubs, it isn't possible to limit the height of the lily plant by pruning. If you feel that your lilies grow too high for their location, your only solution is to replace them with a lower growing (dwarf) lily variety.

Don’t feel that you have to prune your lilies - it’s actually better not to do it at all. Remember that once you cut away the foliage, you won’t be able to spot where your lilies are planted because there will be no visible sign of the plant above ground.;
, It’s a good idea to remove any spent blooms from your lily throughout the growing season. Once flowers fade, the plant begins to make seeds; removing the spent blooms will stop the plant doing this.


This prevents the plant diverting its energies into seed production when you want it to focus on making more flowers. Once the flowers have begun to fade, cut them with a sharp clean blade or pinch them off.
Cutting flowers for vase arrangement also prevents the plant from forming seed heads. Cut the blooms with a clean sharp blade, leaving about a third of the stem on the plant. This leaves something behind to help the bulb store energy.

, Like all bulb plants, the lily uses its foliage to store energy from sunlight. This nourishes the bulb and helps it survive the dormant period to revive again and regrow the following year.


This will also encourage the bulb to divide, helping you propagate from your lily at a later point if you wish to do so. For this reason, it’s important not to prune the foliage too early, as it is drawing in this energy.
After the flowering stops, leave the foliage on the plant until it begins to wither and die away. This is a signal that the bulb has taken in what it needs. The foliage usually reaches this stage by late fall.

, If you find that the withering foliage looks unattractive at this part in the cycle, you may prefer to plant your lilies in containers so they can be moved to a less visible location while the plant is looking less appealing.


Remember that the lily plant still needs full sun (or partial shade in very hot areas).
Other gardeners shield the lily by planting other flowers around it. Salvia or baby’s breath are popular choices.

, After the foliage turns yellow and withers away (usually in the fall) you can cut it off to ground level. Use a pair of sharp, clean scissors, garden shears or secateurs.


Better still, wait until the foliage really has died away and is brown and withered. A sharp tug should remove what’s left – just be careful not to pull up the bulb when you do this!
You can compost the removed foliage if it seems healthy. Foliage showing any signs of disease should be burned or thrown out with domestic trash to prevent infection spreading to other garden plants.

, It’s a good idea to cut away any damaged or diseased foliage, at any point throughout the year. When cutting off damaged parts of the plant, try to preserve as much of the green, healthy foliage on the plant as possible.


If your lily leaves are mottled or spotted this could be a sign of mosaic virus. Unfortunately the only solution is to remove the entire plant and burn it to prevent the infection spreading in your garden.
If your bulb or roots experience any rotting, the whole plant should also be destroyed as it will not recover from this.

, If you are pruning just as the plant enters dormancy, it’s a good idea to apply a layer of mulch over the pruned lilies to help the bulbs survive winter.


A thick 3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10.2 cm) layer of mulching material such as leaf mold, well-rotted manure or sawdust will all help the bulb survive over winter.
Remember to this before the ground gets too cold.

Understand that ginger lilies are much more prone to spreading that other lily varieties.,
Cut back old or damaged stalks each spring.,
Protect the bulbs throughout the winter if you plan on cutting back their foliage.",How to Prune Lilies2," Ginger Lilies are hardy in zones 7-10 and need be pruned differently to other lilies. These plants spread very quickly, so pruning them back and deadheading is an important way of controlling the spread of this plant in your garden.


Cut off the old growth and dig up any new growth that emerges in the spring if you want to contain the spread.

, In spring, cut back any damaged stalks, along with the remainder of any stalks that flowered the previous year. Remove any brown or yellow growth.


Ginger lilies can be deadheaded to prevent the plant reseeding itself, but this does nothing to promote continuous flower production.
If you want to prevent the spread of new growth, you will have to dig up the plant from the bulb each spring.

, Ginger lilies use their foliage to protect themselves over the winter months. If you prefer to remove it for aesthetic reasons, it’s okay to cut foliage back in the fall to a few inches above the ground.


However, it's especially important to mulch the soil over the plant thickly before winter sets in, in order to replace the protection of the foliage.

Root forsythia after the bush has finished blooming and all of its flowers have fallen off.,
Grow forsythia in well-drained, acidic soil and lots of shade.,
Prepare your cuttings before you plant them to help them root properly.,
Try an alternative method for rooting clippings by bending a branch down from an existing bush, covering the first 6 inches (15.2 cm) of the branch with soil and mulch, and using a brick or rock to weigh it down.,
Make sure clippings have plenty of shade when rooting and aren’t exposed to lots of direct sunlight.",How to Root Forsythia,"


Most garden experts recommend rooting forsythia indoors between December and February. The plant is dormant during this time, so the plant will be in the hardwood stage and cuttings will be less perishable.
You can root forsythia year-round, but cuttings taken when the bush isn’t dormant will be more fragile and require more care and attention.;
, Prepping your soil to create an optimal growing environment will encourage the rooting process.


Choose a location where water drains off quickly. This will prevent new roots from rotting before they can grow strong.
Add mulch or topsoil to the soil to boost acidity.
Add straw or cedar shavings over the topsoil once your cutting is planted to insulate it and help encourage growth.
Use a growth hormone in the soil to help the cuttings take root. Some hormones can be applied directly to the end of the cutting instead of in the soil.
Use a planting box to start cuttings along in the winter months and to help control soil content.

,


Cut clippings about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long from the tip of the branch using sharp gardening shears.
Remove any leaves or leftover flowers.
Clippings with buds still on them will encourage root growth. The best branches to cut will have 4 to 6 buds on them.
Plant your cuttings deep enough so that only about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) of the cutting is left sticking out of the soil. Use a shovel or trowel to pack dirt around the rest of the cutting.

, The branch will root next to its mother plant and can be transplanted later.

,


Keep clippings watered regularly.
Keep weeds and other plants cleared so the rooting forsythia has plenty of room to grow.
If you’re rooting your forsythia indoors, make sure the planter box you choose has drainage holes in the bottom to keep the soil well-drained for the cuttings.

Be sure to remove dead flowers as well as any unhealthy leaves.Geraniums come in two varieties: ""true"" and ""common."" True geraniums are perennials, so pruning them is a good investment. Common geraniums are annuals, and they also do well with pruning, but since they won't last more than a season, it's not absolutely necessary to prune them.;
, After the growing season is finished, pruning back the geraniums will help them stay healthy and dormant during the colder months. Wait until the flowers have died and the geranium has gotten a little leggy, in late summer or early to mid-fall. This way the geraniums will conserve energy during the winter and spring back to life when the weather gets warm.


If you live in a temperate climate where the winters don't get so cold that the ground freezes, you can overwinter your geraniums outside.
In colder areas, where the ground freezes hard, you'll want to dig up your geraniums and keep them in pots indoors for the winter.

, The geraniums will have continued to grow over the winter, sprouting long, woody legs. It's not a very attractive look, and that's why geraniums should be pruned right at the beginning of the new growing season. This will encourage them to grow in a full, pretty shape as the weather gets warm.


If you overwintered your geraniums outside, prune in late March or early April, when the weather begins to warm up.
If you overwintered your geraniums inside, wait until the ground has thawed. You can gradually get them used to outdoor weather by putting them outside during sunny, warm days and bringing them back in at night. When the last frost has passed, you can either transplant them to the ground or keep them outside in pots.

, Take a look at the plant from all angles so you can identify problem areas. Look for areas where there aren't many leaves, dead areas, and lopsided areas. Determine where you'll need to prune in order to give your geranium a healthier and more attractive shape.


Pruning actually spurs new growth of stems and flowers, so trimming back a particular place won't necessarily leave a hole.
If a large part of the plant is dead, you'll need to do some drastic trimming. The plant should survive as long as the central stalk is still green. However, it might take a few weeks before new leaves and flowers emerge.

, This pruning method is an important way to encourage the plant to create new flowers. Taking off the dead blossoms allows the geranium to direct energy toward producing new ones. It also clears your view of the plant's stalks, so you can better see what you're working with. You can deadhead your geranium any time you see languishing blossoms; it's a quick way to maintain the health of the plant, and doesn't even require tools.


Grasp the flower stem just behind the dead blossom with your thumb and forefinger.
Pinch the stem and sever it with your thumbnail, then discard the dead flower.
Alternatively, you may want to wait until a whole flower cluster is spent, then remove the whole cluster further down the stem down at the next leafy area.

, The next step is to get rid of dead or dying leaves and stems. Trimming them back will keep the plant from wasting energy trying to keep them alive. Use a pair of hand clippers to trim dead or dying stems to the base of the plant. This is an important step to take in the spring in order to encourage good growth during the growing season, but you can trim back dead foliage any time of year.Don't bother trying to save foliage that seems on the verge of being dead, even if it's not quite there yet. It's better to trim it back and let the plant produce strong, new stems.

, In the spring, trimming back healthy flower stems will encourage the plant to produce more flowers. Follow a flower stem to where it's joined to the main stem, then use a pair of hand clippers to trim it against the base of the main stem. This will activate dormant buds and you should see new growth in no time.


If you don't want to make such a drastic cut, follow the flower stem back to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above the top of a node, which is a ring around the stem on a geranium. The new growth will sprout from the node.

, ""Leggy"" stalks refer to those that have grown long and tall without any leaves, or with just a few leaves. Trimming these back almost to the base of the plant will allow it to produce new growth low down, creating a fuller, bushier look. Use a pair of hand trimmers to cut the stems close to the base, 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above the lowest node. Keep the cuttings for propagation!


At the end of the growing season, trim back at least 1/3 of the plant in this way to prepare it for winter dormancy.

, Hold a cutting upright and find the lowest node. Trim to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) below the node. Be sure to keep track of which end is up, since cuttings won't grow if you plant them upside down.


Long cuttings can be trimmed into more than one piece. Just make sure each one is trimmed to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) below a node.
Cuttings from flowering branches usually will not root, because they don't have the correct hormones in them to create roots. The cuttings need to be from growing stems, not from flowering ones.

, The cutting won't be able to support all of the leaves of first, but keeping one will help the growth process along. Trim off the dead or dying leaves and try to keep one healthy leaf toward the top.


If the cutting doesn't have a leaf, you can still plant it.
If the cutting has one large, healthy leaf, use a scissors to make a slit in the leaf, leaving both halves attached. A cutting can't support the surface area of a large leaf.

, You shouldn’t plant cuttings in regular potting soil, as it will remain too wet and rot the roots. Choose one part coconut coir, peat moss, or vermiculite and mix it with one part perlite or sterile builders sand. You'll need a separate plastic or clay container for each cutting you want to plant., Root hormones will help your geranium cutting flourish. Dip the bottom 1/4 inch (.64 cm) of the stem into rooting hormone and dust off the excess powder. You can find root hormones at the local garden shop, or online., Use a chopstick or pen to make a hole in the potting soil, then insert the cutting bottom-side down. The tip of the cutting, including the leaf, should extend above the soil. Pat the soil lightly around the cutting.

, After a week or two, it will begin to form roots. A few weeks later, new growth will appear. At this point, repot the cutting in garden or potting soil, or plant it in the ground.

Pruning a healthy hibiscus bush will encourage growth and tell the plant to grow more branches, thus producing more flowers. You can also prune a damaged or dying tree to prevent future decay and to promote new, healthy growth.;
, Pruning must be timed to line up with the natural growth patterns of the hibiscus plant. You should never prune a hibiscus in the late fall or winter, as this will prevent new growth in the Spring. Exact times will vary depending on your location, but generally full/major prunes should be done in the early spring, with minor pruning done up till the beginning of fall around September.If you keep your hibiscus plants inside during the winter, wait until you move them outside to prune.

, To do damage-free pruning, you’ll need to get a very sharp knife, a pair of sharp gardening shears, a pair of sharp lopping shears, and a hand saw for anything too big to be cut with your smaller tools. Sterilize all tools before starting and between pruning each plant, to prevent the spread of disease. You can sterilize with rubbing alcohol, hand sterilizer, or horticultural disinfectant.


Your tools must absolutely be sharp; a dull knife, shears, or saw will cause more harm than good if you try to prune with them. Take the time to sharpen your tools, or buy new ones if yours are too old., Keeping in mind that the location you prune is the location of new growth, you always want to prune your hibiscus on branches facing outwards. You’ll make all cuts ¼-inch from the top of a node (the location of a leaf/twig) at an upwards 45 degree angle. The lower end of each cut should be near the center of the bush, while the higher end of the cut should be nearer to the outside of the bush. This helps water run off the cut surface instead of pooling, which reduces the risk of infection.

, Although the amount of the plant that you prune will vary from situation to situation, the general rule is that you should never cut more than ⅔ of any one branch off. Cutting off too much of the plant is no longer considered pruning, but simply damaging the hibiscus.

, There are several approaches you can use to prune hibiscus. One light approach is to ""pinch"" the plant by cutting off just the ends of the branches near the top, so as to stimulate a bit of growth without losing the bulk of the plant. This is the most mild form of pruning, and is the safest for beginners to accomplish. Pinching should be done primarily on young or small plants, as they don’t need much pruning early in their life to promote lots of new growth. Cut the tips of each branch off at the top-most node or higher.

, This is the next step up from ‘pinching’ your hibiscus, and involves cutting off larger sections of your plant, but only in certain locations so as to maintain the general size and shape of the bush. In selective pruning, you should find nodes that are ⅓ of the way from the top of the branch, and cut just above these. Do this for most or all of your branches to develop locations for new growth.

, Full pruning is the process of cutting back an entire hibiscus plant early in the season, so that you produce the loveliest crop of flowers available. Full prunes are bittersweet, as although they do cause your bush to produce the most flowers, they require cutting back nearly all of the hibiscus plant to start. Cut each branch on the hibiscus bush so that only 2-3 nodes remain per branch. Remember that you should never cut off more than ⅔ of any portion of a branch.

, As the name implies, corrective pruning is done when you need to fix an issue on the plant. Typically corrective pruning must be done on damaged or diseased portions of a hibiscus plant. Cut down as far as you must on damaged branches, until green wood is exposed after a cut. If you prune the branch but the wood is hard and white, it is dead and will not recover with new growth.

, A hard prune is done only in the most drastic of situations, when a hibiscus bush is nearly entirely dead or damaged. A hard prune involves cutting down all the branches to expose living growth, hopefully causing the plant to start growing again over time. A hard prune may not work if the plant is already dead, but by accomplishing it you’ll at least know what the final state of your hibiscus is.Only hard prune in spring, never at other times of year.

Know which clematis need to be pruned after blooming.,
Prune your clematis.,
Give your clematis a hard trim every so often.",How to Prune Clematis1," Spring blooming clematis blooms on the old wood, meaning that they form their buds the previous year. The time to prune them is straight after they have finished flowering so that they have time to grow vigorously during summer, and will have lots of ""new"" old wood to blossom from next spring. Varieties that should be pruned after they bloom include Alpina, Montana and Armandii .


Recurrent bloomers (like those that bloom in spring, summer and early autumn) should also be pruned after they bloom. Again, these flower from the old wood. These trims should be light.;
, For this sort of early blooming clematis, you only really need to give them a light trim. Use pruning shears or garden scissors to cut back and damaged or stray stems that you can find., The hard trim, which means that you cut back more of the plant, should only occur when you need to control their growth, with the understanding that you'll be curtailing the blossoming."
"
Know which clematis should be pruned before blooming.,
Prune your clematis in the early spring.,
Consider pruning this type of clematis as you would a late summer clematis.",How to Prune Clematis2," Clematis that bloom in very late spring and early summer should be pruned before they blossom. This type of clematis include most large-flower types. These sort of clematis produce so many buds that they need to be cut back so that most of the flowers have a chance to bloom. Types that fall under this category include Henryi and Nelly Moser., To prune this sort of clematis, you will have to locate the healthy buds. They should be about a third of the way down from the top of the plant. Once you have located the buds, use pruning or garden shears to cut the vine just above the buds, removing the top part of the plant and keeping the buds intact., The reason for doing this would be to delay heavy blooming until the later summer (in case you are going to be gone for the early summer and want to see your clematis bloom). See Method Three for how to prune in this way.

Understand that late blooming clematis should be cut back hard.,
Give your clematis a hard cut.",How to Prune Clematis3," Summer and fall blooming clematis only produce buds on new growth wood. The pruning can take place anytime from late autumn to early spring. These types of clematis include Polish Spirit and Duchess of Albany., A hard cut refers to a pruning method that essentially cuts the plant back to the ground. In the case of these late blooming clematis, you will cut these plants back nearly to the ground. Some of these clematis will have buds up on the stems, in which case cut just above the buds, but most will just grow back right out of the crown of the plant.Aim for cutting your clematis back to a height between 12 and 18 inches.

Master the basics of pruning.,
Figure out what kind of holly shrub you have.,
Look at the natural shape of your holly.,
Get the right shears and gloves.,
Wait for the right season.,
Identify any branches jutting out from the bush.,
Make the cut in the right place.,
Remove some branches completely.,
Clean pruning tools.,
Prune hedge shrubs yearly.,
Keep an eye out for symptoms of disease.,
Look for insect activity.",How to Prune Holly Shrubs," It's not rocket science, but pruning is a bit more complicated than it looks. There are different techniques of shaping and specific places on the shrub where you should make the cuts, so don't just start chopping. Before you get started, take a minute to review the fundamental terms and concepts pertaining to pruning.


Shearing is the act of maintenance where you simply trim the outermost twigs to control length. Thinning is where you cut and remove branches throughout the shrub.
Thinning is generally preferred over shearing, as exclusively shearing will encourage dense growth on the outer edges of the plant and keep sunlight from getting to inner branches. This can create a transparent or hollow look which is considered less desirable than a full, even growth.A terminal bud grows at the tip of a branch, and it sends hormones back down the rest of the shoot which inhibit the growth of other buds. This is why you want to prune: you want to clip off terminal buds in order to stem the flow of growth-inhibiting hormones and encourage growth of other, non-terminal buds.A lateral bud sprout along the side of the shoot. When cutting, you want to cut back to a lateral bud node, which is the place on the stem where the lateral bud attaches to the shoot.;
, There are many different kinds of holly, such as American, Chinese, Japanese, Inkberry, Yaupon, and Winterberry, and these different types all have different needs.You’ll need to identify what kind of plant you have before you pick up the shears.


If your holly plant loses its foliage every winter, it’s a deciduous holly. These holly plants require radical pruning every year.
If your holly plant never loses its foliage, it’s an evergreen. These types of holly require more attention in the first few years of life but not as much thinning or shaping as time goes on., There are different kinds of evergreen hollies, and you should look at their natural shape in order to determine specifically how to prune them. There are pyramidal, rounded, and indeterminate holly plants.


For rounded hollies, you should thin during the first few years and do formal shaping throughout its life. Pyramidal hollies require similar thinning regimens but little if any formal shaping throughout life. Indeterminate hollies need both throughout life., You can use any type of sturdy gardening gloves to protect your hands, but you should take a look at your holly branches before deciding on which shears you should use. This is because the size and circumference of the branches determine which kind of cutting implement you should use.


Pruning shears work well on twigs and branches measuring 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter or less. A quality pair of lopping shears can cut branches measuring up to 2 inches (5 cm).
Larger limbs and branches may require the use of a pruning saw.

, There are times that are better for pruning your holly plant, as they take advantage of the plant's natural dormant phases and help the plant heal more quickly. It's a fairly sturdy and resilient plant, though, so don’t worry too much if you have to prune in a sub-optimal season.


The best time to prune a deciduous holly is in spring as it produces optimal berry growth.
For evergreen hollies, prune in the dead of winter when they’re dormant.Tend to holly shrubs that are diseased or have broken wood as soon as you recognize that the shrub has health issues.

, Long offshoots need to be cut back entirely or simply shortened to keep the shrub's shape. In general, take your pruning cues from the holly's natural shape. Also keep upper branches shorter than lower ones in order to ensure that sunlight can reach the lower branches., Only cut directly above a lateral bud, rather than haphazardly in a mid-section of the branch or twig. Also, be sure to make angled cuts so that water can drain off the wounds.If you disregard this principle and leave stubs from the places where you’ve cut, the stubs will heal more slowly. It also leaves the plant more susceptible to insects and diseases.

, Cut branches off at the main branch or an intersecting branch in order to thin out the bush and create a more even distribution of branches throughout the shrub. Be sure to cut strategically: cutting far back into the shrub means that future growth on that site is unlikely, as older wood does not regenerate as easily as new wood.Pruning intersecting branches at their union will help you create a more organized framework of branches. This gives the shrub a nice, natural shape which needs minimal pruning later., Be sure to use denatured alcohol if pruning a dying or diseased holly shrub. This is necessary because pruning tools can spread disease among to other plants or to different, healthy parts of the same plant. Disinfecting your tools will help you avoid this contamination.Otherwise, clean tools with soap and water before putting them away.


In addition to rubbing alcohol, you can also use a solution made from pine oil cleaner, household bleach, or ammonium salts. Soak your tools in the solution for at least five minutes, and then rinse with water., While large holly shrubs rarely require pruning, shrubs used as hedges need to be trimmed yearly to keep a clean silhouette and shape.


Shear along the surface of leaf growth to make sure the cut is even. Perform regular trimming by cutting the outermost twigs to the nearest bud node.If your holly shrubs do not function as hedges or formal decorative pieces, allow them to grow naturally.

, When you spot any signs of disease or damage from weather, eliminate the affected portion by cutting it off several inches below the damaged portion.You should do this as soon as you notice problems, regardless of whether or not it's pruning season.


Several different types of root rot affect holly shrubs, so look out for yellow spots on the leaves, dark black roots, and stunting as common symptoms of these problems., Several types of pests such as scale, mites, and leaf miners harm holly shrubs and should be taken care of at the first sign of a problem. Again, disregard seasonal considerations and take care of it before the infestation gets worse.The most common signs of infestation are discoloration, trails, or speckling on the foliage.

Prune in late winter or early spring.,
Remove dead or dying branches.,
Cut away branches that rub together.",How to Prune Burning Bush1," Pruning done only for the health of the plant should be scheduled for the late winter or early spring, before new growth has had much chance for development.


Since burning bushes are primarily grown for their foliage, you don't need to worry too much about accidentally removing flower buds. The most vibrant foliage will grow on new branches, though, so it is still best to trim the bush before new growth has developed.
When you decide to prune a burning bush for the health of the plant alone, you only need to worry about removing branches that could encourage disease to spread through the plant and destroy it.
Even if you opt to prune the plant for shape, you should still prune it for health before worrying shape maintenance.;
, Use pruning shears to cut away any dead branches or branches that have been severely injured.Branches are most often injured by disease, insect infestation, animals, or bad weather.
Cut diseased branched down to their point of origin on the main stem. Doing so is the only way to make sure that the disease does not spread.
Injured branches can be cut back to their point of origin on the main stem, or you may wish to only cut away the injured portion of the branch. In the latter case, cut the injured branch down to a side branch and make the cut 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the bud.

, Look for any branches or branch stubs that are intertwined or rubbing against each other. Use pruning shears to remove these branches, as well.


Cut these branches down to their point of origin on the main stem. Problem branches like these will typically grow back again in the same direction, so it is best to remove them completely instead of trimming them down.

"
"
Know your azalea.,
Clip out dead stems in the spring.,
Trim the bush carefully after the flowers are gone.,
Don't prune beyond three weeks after the flowers have died.",How to Prune Azaleas1," Azaleas are available in two main classes: native azaleas and Asian azaleas. Native azaleas grow like vines, and they don't need pruning. If you have an Asian azalea shrub, it could be one of two main evergreen varieties:


Kurume hybrids are usually bright red and don't tend to grow very large - no more than 3 or 4 feet (0.9 or 1.2 m). They do well with some maintenance pruning, but they may never need much pruning at all.
Southern Indian hybrids grow very large and fast, and are most likely to need pruning - especially if you have one planted near your house.
Take note that when you're picking out azaleas to plant, choosing a Kurume instead of a Southern Indian will be your best bet if you don't want to worry as much about maintenance.;
, Even though both varieties of evergreen azalea should survive the winter, you'll probably see a few dead or diseased looking stems and branches in the shrub come spring. Use hand trimmers (or loppers, for thicker branches) to remove dead or damaged stems where they connect with healthy wood.


Try to make as clean and small of a cut as possible, so that the healthy wood isn't left with a large cut in it; this can be an entry point for fungus and disease.

, When spring comes and goes and the bright flowers begin to die, it's time to do your annual light pruning. Use hand trimmers to carefully trim back long stems. Make careful cuts in order to improve the shape of the bush. Trim back areas that seem too crowded, and don't overdo it in the thinner areas.


Don't take hedge clippers and shear the bush into shape. Make precise, carefully selected cuts instead. Otherwise, you're needlessly creating spots on the plant where no flowers will bloom.

, If you wait to long and prune in late summer or fall, you'll be taking off the maturing buds that will turn into next spring's flowers. If you forget to prune, it's best to just wait until the following spring, unless you don't mind having gaps in your blooms."
"
Schedule the initial pruning in late winter or early spring.,
Decide on a shape.,
Trim the branches down to that shape.,
Thin out some interior branches.,
Prune new growth back later in the season.",How to Prune Burning Bush2," When pruning a burning bush for shape, you will likely need to schedule two pruning sessions each year. The first one should be before new growth has developed, which means pruning the bush in late winter or early spring.


Burning bushes tend to get large and unruly as they mature, but you can usually keep them in check by pruning them down into a desired shape. This type of pruning will keep the bush looking nice for the season while preventing it from completely taking over the space it occupies.
When pruning a burning bush for shape, you must also do some pruning for health maintenance.

, You can choose to trim the burning bush down while maintaining its natural shape or you could trim it down into an ornamental hedge shape.Consider pruning the bush into a standard cube, box, or globe hedge shape.
Another option would be to trim out the lower branches, leaving only a rounded top behind. Doing so would make the burning bush look like a small tree.
If you have difficulty visualizing your ideal shape, find a photograph or sketch to work from. You could also make your own sketch to help guide you through the process.

, Once you have visualized the shape your burning bush should be, use hedge clippers to remove any branches that extend beyond that shape.


When shortening a branch or twig, cut it back to point that is 1/4 inch (6 mm) above a bud or side branch.
Unless you choose to completely remove the bottom half of the bush, you should make the top of the bush slightly thinner than the bottom. Doing so will permit sunlight to reach all the leaves of the shrub. A wide top can prevent sunlight from reaching the bottom in adequate amounts, though, causing the plant to become unhealthy., When you prune burning bushes into hedge shapes, you should also thin out some of the dense interior branches to improve the spread of air and sunlight through the plant.


Remove the oldest, tallest branches completely by cutting them back to their point of origin on the main stem.
If you want to redirect inward growing branches so that they grow outward and make the bush less dense, use pruning shears to cut those inward growing branches down to an outward facing bud or branch.

, To maintain the right shape, you should prune the burning bush again in the middle of summer.


Burning bushes are usually grown for their autumn foliage, so you don't need to worry about accidentally removing flower buds when you do a summer pruning.
To determine a more exact time for your summer pruning, wait until new growth reaches a length of 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm).
You should prune down new growth within 2 inches (5 cm) of your spring pruning.

"
"
Plan on pruning around early spring.,
Cut the bush down to ground level.Use hedge shears to cut all of the branches down until they rise no more than 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) above the ground.,
Feed and water the bush thoroughly throughout the season.",How to Prune Burning Bush3," Rejuvenation pruning is the most severe form of pruning. It is best to do this type of pruning in the late winter or early spring, too, since new growth will be forming shortly thereafter, making it easier for the plant to recover.


This type of pruning should only be done if the burning bush has become severely overgrown or sickly.
A healthy burning bush should be able to grow back vigorously after a severe pruning.
You may need to repeat this practice every year or every other year until all of the thick, overgrown trunks are gone. Once you are only left with thinner stems, you can let the bush grow to its desired height and maintain it with regular health or shape pruning.

,


When cutting the entire bush down, make sure that you leave at least 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) above the ground.
Make sure that the cuts are clean and sharp to improve the likelihood of the bush making a full recovery.

, Since this pruning method is so severe, you will need to pay extra attention to the bush during the first growing season after you prune. Water the plant regularly and apply an appropriate fertilizer.


Water the burning bush once a week during the first spring and summer. Give it water in the morning (before the full sun of afternoon hits) and make sure that the soil beneath it is thoroughly saturated.
Apply fertilizer once in the early spring, shortly after you prune the bush, and a second time in the late summer or early fall, roughly two months before you expect a first frost to strike. Select a fertilizer that is high in nitrogen and follow the label instructions to determine the proper application method.

Assess your azalea.,
Cut each branch to within a foot of the ground.,
Fertilize the azalea.",How to Prune Azaleas2," You probably don't need to do a drastic pruning unless you have a Southern Indian azalea that has gotten quite large. If your bush has started to obscure windows and take up room you'd like to use for other plantings, you can trim it back drastically without causing long-term harm. Decide how much you want to trim back your azalea, and have a shape in mind when you start making cuts.

, You can safely cut it back this much without worrying that the shrub will die. Use loppers or a hand saw if necessary to cut back the individual branches. Aim for a rounded shape on top.

, Use slow release fertilizer labeled 12-6-6 to keep the plant healthy while it restores itself. Keep it watered until the following spring. You won't have to wait an extra season to see more flowers; your drastically pruned azalea should produce plenty of leaves and flowers in the spring."

Keep an eye on your garden during the day.,
Look for small, shallow holes in your flower beds.,
Watch for missing flower bulbs.,
Look for bite marks on fruit and vegetables.,
Watch your bird feeder if you have one.,
Spread an unpleasant smell around your garden.,
Tamp down any loose, fresh dirt.,
Get a dog or cat.,
Avoid harming squirrels.,
Plant sunflowers away from areas that squirrels can climb.,
Surround the sunflower seedlings with chicken wire or other forms of wire mesh.,
Attach protective material to sunflower heads.,
Apply a hot seed spray to your sunflower.",How to Protect Sunflowers from Squirrels," The best way to know if your garden has a squirrel problem is to catch one or more of them in the act. Like humans, squirrels are daytime creatures. So when you’re home during the day, check your garden from time to time.;
, Squirrels are small enough that any holes they dig won’t be that big. If you spot holes with a similar diameter to a golf ball, you may have a squirrel problem.Squirrels will often dig up fresh seedlings. If you plant seeds in your garden, check the site(s) regularly for several days afterward.

, Squirrels will often dig up flower bulbs, both to eat and to use the holes to store nuts. They are especially fond of tulips and crocuses. They tend to prefer spring bulbs the most, especially during their autumn harvest for food.If you find that your shoots are disappearing, you likely have a rabbit problem. Rabbits almost always graze close to the ground. Unlike squirrels, they prefer tender young shoots. They will also leave a clean break when they eat a plant., Squirrels occasionally remove entire fruits or vegetables from gardens. More common, though, are bite marks on fruits that are beginning to ripen. Squirrels will take a few bites from one fruit and then move on to another. They tend to like corn and tomatoes., Squirrels will also eat seeds and other forms of bird food. If your bird feeder becomes damaged or the food level drops precipitously with no evidence of bird activity, you may have a squirrel problem.

, There are a variety of materials that can drive squirrels away while not harming your plants. Unlike with insects and weeds, you won’t have to use potentially toxic pesticides or herbicides to protect your garden.But no matter what animal repellent you use, be sure to reapply it regularly, especially after heavy rains.


Citrus peels can discourage squirrels from digging. Lemon and orange rinds work best.
Human hair can also work, as squirrels generally do not like the smell of humans.
Coffee grounds can also stop squirrels from digging.

, Squirrels don’t like digging in hard packed dirt. Loose dirt, on the other hand, can act as an invitation for them to dig around. After you finish working in your garden for the day, tamp down loose dirt as best you can with your hands or feet without harming your plants.

, Household pets, particularly large dogs, can help you drive squirrels away. Many dogs can be trained to chase squirrels from your garden. But you may not even have to take that step, since the smell of a dog or cat alone may be enough to convince squirrels not to attack your plants.


If you don’t want a dog or cat, you can purchase wolf urine to spray around your garden. The smell should keep most small animals away.

, Squirrels breed very quickly. Trapping or killing several of them is unlikely to put much of a dent in the local squirrel population.Squirrels are a protected species in many states. That means that trapping them alive without the appropriate game permits may leave you vulnerable to stiff legal penalties.Don’t poison squirrels. It is illegal to poison wildlife in many states. If you poison a squirrel, other animals (including your family pet) may feed on the dead squirrel and become sick., Squirrels are nimble creatures. If you plant your sunflowers near a wall or exterior shelf, you may give squirrels an extra route to the flowers.


Squirrels especially like to nest in small structures like garden sheds.Avoid planting sunflowers near these structures if possible.

, This versatile material can provide your plants with protection from squirrels, as well as many other different animals. You will need one bale of chicken wire, wire cutters, small plastic stakes (or PVC pipes), twine or plastic zip ties, and a pair of protective gloves.
Shove the stakes or pipes into the ground in a ring around where your seedlings are. Next, arrange the chicken wire so that it forms a fence around your seedlings, with the stakes or pipes as the fence posts.
Attach the wire to the stakes or pipes with the twine or zip ties.If your seedlings are planted in a raised flower bed with sides made from wood, you can stretch a single layer of chicken wire over the top to protect all of the plants in that bed. Use a staple gun to attach the wire to the sides of the bed. The flowers can grow through the wire even if you stretch it directly over the seedling.
You can also build a fence around the entire flower bed.If you don’t want to build a cage or fence yourself, most garden stores sell wire mesh cages designed to protect seedlings and young plants from predators.

, You can use brown paper bags or nylon mesh. Secure the bottom of the material with wire or string. Make sure the sunflower head is completely covered.


Not only can the covers keep squirrels away from sunflowers, but it can help your sunflower head still breathe and prevent mold from forming.
If you opt for the brown paper bag and it rains, you may need to replace the bag. You don't want the bag to rip or tear while on the sunflower head, because that can give squirrels access to the seeds.

, The spray can be purchased at a gardening center or home improvement store. These sprays are non-toxic and can keep the squirrels from eating the sunflower seeds.You can also sprinkle cayenne pepper directly onto the blooms.


If it rains, you will need to reapply the spray or pepper.
If you apply the spray or pepper to your sunflower heads, you may need to gently rinse the sunflower seeds once you remove them from the heads. Wait until the seeds are dry before removing them from the sunflower heads, and then rinse the seeds in water. This will eliminate all the hot spice flavoring from the sunflower seeds.

Begin your pruning once the trumpet vine enters active growth.,
Remove suckers.,
Root prune the vine.Root pruning is the practice of cutting away some of the roots in order to discourage overgrowth, like underground runners.",How to Prune a Trumpet Vine1," When the weather begins to warm and the dormancy of winter ends, the vine will start developing new buds. At this point in time, you should remove any stems that became damaged over the winter. Damaged stems include those that are broken open, dead, or growing fungus.;
, Suckers are vines that run underground, causing new vines to sprout haphazardly. Vines produced by underground suckers can even sprout up to a yard (one meter) away from the original vine. Cutting the vines away at the surface will only cause them to grow back stronger, so you need to dig underneath your original vine and cut away sucker growth from the base of the vine.

, Dig up some of the ground beneath the trumpet vine at the base of the plant. Use a sharp knife to cleanly cut away up to 1/3 of the roots, choosing roots that are smaller, newer, and further away from the base of the plant to avoid causing harm to the vine.

"
"
Pinch back new shoots.,
Pluck away dead flowers.",How to Prune a Trumpet Vine2," Pluck the out buds developing at the tip of the vine branches. By removing buds from the tip of the branch, you redirect the vine's energy, sending it outward rather than upward. As a result, you will have a fuller vine rather than a thin, scraggly one.

, As flowers begin to die or look ragged, pick them out instead of letting them drop. Generally, plucking out the flowers before they have the chance to come to seed and die will encourage floral growth to last longer into the season.

"
"
Wait until the vine finishes flowering.,
Remove woody stems.,
Cut to shape the vine.,
Trim down top branches.,
Leave at least three to four buds.The buds should be on stems that are facing in the direction you want your vine to grow in.,
Only remove about 1/3 of the wood.,
Trim the base of the vine.",How to Prune a Trumpet Vine3," Once all the flowers have dropped for the season, the trumpet vine begins to enter dormancy, making it the perfect time to trim it down. Trimming the branches in the autumn also prevents seed pods from dropping and starting new vines.

, Use sharp pruning shears to cut away old stems that have become spindly or weak. These stems make your trumpet vine look more ragged and do not produce as much vibrant growth as newer stems. As such, woody stems should be removed first.

, Since many trumpet vines are trained to climb a vertical surface, like a trellis, you will likely want to trim away lateral shoots that would produce outward branches. On the other hand, if you want the trumpet vine to crawl over the ground or another flat surface, prune shoots at the top of the vine to encourage outward, rather than upward, growth.

, Even if you want the vine to climb upward, leaving the top branches alone will only cause the plant to direct all its energy to upward growth, creating a scraggly appearance. Cut the top stems down to 10 inches (25.4 cm) to encourage new, fuller growth. Focus on the heaviest sections of growth, creating a uniform appearance throughout the length of the vine.

, For instance, if you want an outward or horizontal covering, the remaining buds should be lateral buds that face outward. Likewise, if you want the vine to climb upward, the vines should be at the tip of the branches.

, If you remove much more than that, you run the risk of shocking the vine rather than encouraging it. A shocked vine will produce very little new growth.

, If new suckers have developed over the summer, dig them up and cut them away before they have the chance to take root.

Think about trying asexual propagation.,
Cut back the daffodils.,
Remove the bulbs from the ground.",How to Propagate Daffodils1," Asexual propagation means duplicating the exact plant that grew the year before.


When choosing buds to use for this method remember to choose those that performed the best in your area, so that only those characteristics will be carried forward to the next year.
To begin, wait until the plant has finished its flowering cycle and the leaves of the plant begin to die back and turn yellow. This must be done in the summer to allow enough time for new growth before planting in the fall.;
, Cut the leaves of the daffodil plant back to the ground, leaving a few inches behind. Remove any mulch, rocks, or landscaping materials that you do not want worked into the soil from the area.

, Dig around the area and lift the daffodils with a turning fork.


Remove the bulbs from the bed and lay them aside. On the bulbs should be small offsets that are growing from bulblets or small bulbs on the stem, shoots, and scales.
These bulblets will produce new plants and can be immediately be returned to the soil, they will grow slowly and produce new flowers one to two years after being planted -- so plant them with large parent bulbs for continuous growth.
You will then have to encourage growth. This can be done with three different methods.

"
"
Understand that you will need to encourage growth.,
Cut bulbs into sections.,
Try coring the bulb.,
Consider making three deep cuts in the bulb.",How to Propagate Daffodils2," To encourage more bulblet growth, you need to treat the large bulb, or mother bulb with a method to encourage growth.


To do this you’ll need to mimic the natural trauma the plant might experience to encourage it to regrow it’s main bulbs.

, The first method is simple: take the bulb and place it on a cutting board.


Sterilize a large knife and cut each bulb into sections like a pie — 6 to 8 sections per a bulb will suffice.
Dust the cuts with an antifungal powder and store in moist sand in a cool dark location until the cool fall months arrive.

, The second method is to core or scoop out the center of the bulb (much like scooping out a pumpkin). Once scooped or cored, powder with fungicide and place in a cool location as before.

, Lastly, you can score the bulb by making 3 deep v-shaped cuts across the top of the bulb, much like the first step but this time you don’t cut through the bulb. Again, dust the bulb and place in a cool location.

"
"
Check your bulbs often.,
Inspect your bulbs before planting them back in the ground.,
Re-plant the bulbs.",How to Propagate Daffodils3," During the dormant period while your plants are in a cool location, check them at least every 2 weeks.


Remove any part of the bulb that is black or off colored. Check for foul smells and remove any diseased or damaged pieces.
If the bulbs are dry to the touch mist them with a spray bottle and place them back into the moist soil.

, After the cool months arrive, take out the bulbs and give them a final inspection.


Throw away any shriveled, black, mushy, or bad smelling bulbs.
Also you’ll want to toss any bulbs that didn’t produce bulblets while in storage.

, Place the bulbs back into the ground and cover them. They should bloom in the spring and when dug up the next year will have 20-30 bulblets growing from the sides.

"
"
Know that sexual propagation exists.,
Consider trying sexual propagation.,
Save the seed and plant it in a protected area such as a greenhouse or indoors.",How to Propagate Daffodils4," Propagating daffodils is largely a process of trial and error, therefore it's best to start with a large number of bulbs and to try all types of propagation before choosing a single method.


The first and simplest is sexual propagation, so called because it requires two plants to work.

, Despite it’s name, sexual propagation requires very little active involvement in the actual propagation.


You simply need to rely on bees, pollen, and the wind to do it’s job and collect seeds from the daffodil plants after blooms die back and a large seed pod appears.

, The seed will generate a young bulb which can be transferred to another location to produce a daffodil.


This method is best for those who, for whatever reason, were unable to work the soil to dig up the remaining bulbs. This process — while simple — is timely and will be unnecessary if the bulbs can be retrieved.

Keep well watered and well drained.",How to Propagate Frangipanis," The cuttings should be about 30 centimeter (11.8 in) / 12"" in length. Always take cuttings from branches that are not flowering.;
, This will allow the cut end to dry out and form a callous. Make sure that the cuttings stay dry; keep them away from any possibility of rain.

, Root the cuttings in the pot of sand.

, Keep in a warm place to grow.

Water the cutting to make sure that the compost is moist.,
Place in a warm spot.,
Water lightly as the roots develop, mainly when there is sign of wilt in the cuttings.",How to Propagate Geraniums from Cuttings," Early spring and later summer are the best times, but any time in spring, summer and early autumn (fall) will result in healthy cuttings. Early cuttings will flower that summer, while later cuttings will provide larger plants ready to flower the following summer.;
, Select shoots that look healthy and are not flowering. (It is possible to use flowering shoots if you have no choice but it's best to avoid them.)

, Using a clean scalpel or sharp knife (secateurs can crush the shoots), cut off the shoot at a length of about 3-4 inches or 7.5-10cm. If the plant is a miniature, the length should be half that. Cut just above the leaf joint (node).

, Remove the lower leaves and scales at the base of the leaf stalks. Leave at least two leaves at the top.

, Root hormone powders are not needed for pelargoniums, and indeed may be detrimental to their growth. Some advise dipping the cutting in honey––that's up to you.

, Fill each container with cutting compost or peat-based seed compost. If you can't find these, make a mixture of equal parts of peat and sharp sand.


Container sizes: It is recommended that you use a container about 7.5cm/3 inches for individual cuttings, or a 12.5cm (5 inch) for up to five cuttings.

, Near the edges is best for drainage purposes.

,, The watering should be very light and avoid covering the cuttings with water, to avoid the growth of botrytis.

, The cuttings need a warm place for rooting. Preferably use a heating mat or propagator but a warm, sunny windowsill will do the trick, provided they're shaded from direct sunlight (choose the side of the house without direct sun hitting it), or a shaded window. If the cuttings have bottom heat, cold air won't be such an issue for them.

, On the whole, keep the compost dry. Do your best to avoid getting water on the actual cuttings. You may see roots appearing within three days for some varieties, longer for others and longer if the air is cool. New top growth will appear once the roots form and if you tug the cutting gently, it will stay in place (thanks to its new roots).


If you planted several cuttings to a pot, transfer to individual containers once they have developed roots.
Rooting should start between a week to a month after taking the cuttings.

Some people find propagating bougainvillea to be a great way of supplementing their income.

",How to Propagate Bougainvillea," Cut back an older bougainvillea as you would in normal care of this tropical to semi-tropical plant.;
, Certain parts will not grow or take root, so you clean them up.


Discard any green, more recent growth. This will not root.
Remove 50% of any leaves remaining on the piece to root.
Cut the older woody sections into 2-4” pieces.

, Nodes are where roots are most likely to form, so you should cut and treat the nodes to speed growth/propagation.


Cut the bottom of each piece where a node is, and cut on an angle so that it is at least slightly pointed.
Nodes show up as bumps or lumps on the old wood.
These are the areas in which natural plant growth hormones are at their highest concentration.
Wet with water the bottom of each piece, and dip lightly in a rooting hormone, also known as a rooting acid.
Plant hormone is acidic which is why some suppliers call it a rooting acid.
Growth hormone for plants may be liquid or a powder, and most often contain and antifungal ingredient to deter rotting at the base where roots are to start.

, Wet thoroughly the rooting soil (any decent soil will do) before inserting at an angle the small, prepared cuttings.


Avoid planting them upright at a ninety degree angle. A forty five degree angle will assist in more of the cutting actually rooting.

, Keep the soil moist to muddy for the duration of the rooting process and keep in 60-70% shade.

, Sprouting on the cutting will happen over time, perhaps eight to ten weeks.

, Be careful not to disturb until the roots are ready. Leaves will start to appear, but that does not mean the roots are ready to go.


Avoid removing cuttings when the first leaves appear. Growth in leaves simply means the rooting process is near to happening, not that they have already rooted.
Avoid pulling up cuttings to check on root growth, and this is disturbing to root growth and often, the cutting will die.
Leave the cuttings alone once they are set in the soil. Most people inhibit rooting by constantly checking to see what is going on.

, Remove the cuttings after three months, and after shoots with four to six leaves have grown.


Seeing significant roots means it is time to put into separate small plastic pots, and to begin moving them slowly from mostly shady towards the sun.

, You need to do this step by step to keep the plants happy.


Leave them in each area with more sun for one week. This is called ""hardening off"" in tropical areas.
Following the move into full sun, wait one week and then plan on how or where you are going to plant them.
Once in a pot or ground, provide extra water for a period of one month so that a taproot can grow more deeply.

, The plants are now their own plants, and are adapting.


Reduce extra water after one month so they can acclimate to the new ""home"".
Once fully established, it takes a bit of stress (roots getting bound, fluctuations in available water) to precipitate flowering.
Flowering is NOT the vibrant color we notice, it is the insignificant white flower at the end of these brilliantly colored stems that are actually the flower.

,,


Locate a healthy, mature leaf that is growing close to the base of the plant. Use a sharp, clean knife to make a clean cut with minimal damage to the host plant.
Cut off the leaf stem with your knife. The cutting needs to be about 1-1.5 inches (2.54 cm to 3.5cm), so if it exceeds that length, cut it down as much as necessary.

,,


Make a small hole in the damp potting mix.
Plant the leaf in firmly and only cover the stem that has been covered with rooting hormone.

,, However, make sure that this light is not direct. If you have fluorescent lights, you can also use those rather than putting it outside.

, Allow the soil to dry out slightly.


Use tepid (not hot!) water as African violets don't like cold water.

, However, in many cases you should see shoots appearing within two weeks.


During this time, uncover the plant every now and then to make sure it is not drying out. If it appears dry at any point, add just enough water to get the soil damp. Let the water drain off, and then put it back in the bag.
If you notice at any point that the interior of the bag has become wet with humidity, take the bag off long enough for the plant to dry.

If desired, clip the stem to a shorter length if it is longer than six inches, but leave at least a half-foot of length. Place the flower(s) well away from direct sunlight once you do so that they do not lose their color.This method works well for any flower that is partially dry and not prone to wilting. It also works particularly well for bouquets.;
, If you are bunching several flowers together into one bouquet, use a zip-tie, rubber band, string, or twine to tie the stems together.Be careful not to bunch too many flowers into one bouquet, since this may crush some or all of them. Tie your knot at the base of the stems so the flowers aren’t crowded together at the top.


The bigger the flower’s head, the better it is to dry them individually., Tie one end of a length of string, twine, or even dental floss to the base of the stem(s). Tie the other end to a hanger. With your flowers hanging upside-down, place the hangers in a room with little or no sunlight or moisture.Make sure that their placement receives plenty of air circulation to reduce the chance of mold or mildew growing on your flowers.Individual flowers be hung or laid on top of a drying rack or window-screen.In lieu of a hanger, you can also knot the string to form a loop to hang your flowers from a door or cabinet knob.

, Give your flowers anywhere from one to three weeks to dry thoroughly. Expect thicker stems and flowers to need the most time.Check the petals and the base of the stem for signs of moisture. Once they are dry, cut the string or twine from the hanger and mist them with unscented hairspray to preserve their shape.

Clean your flowers.",How to Preserve Dead Flowers2," Either purchase a covered, microwave-safe container exclusively for this specific purpose, or use one that you do not plan on using for food ever again. Make sure that it is large enough to hold your flower(s).Trim your stems if necessary so that they fit in the container.


This method is better suited for drying flowers individually. It also preserves color and shape very well, so if you would like to keep your rose, tulip, or chrysanthemum looking more or less as is, this method is perfect.

, Coat the bottom of the container with silica gel. Pour enough to create a bed that is an inch or two thick. For larger flower heads, pour more as needed. Set the flower in the gel with the blossoms facing up. Gently coat the flower itself with more gel. Don’t pour too much at once, since this may damage the petals., Leaving the container uncovered, set your flower in the microwave. Run your microwave for two to five minutes at a low heat level. Open the door and check how moist the flower is. Continue to cook the flower at short intervals and inspect the flower in between until it has dried.The type of microwave and the type of flower will effect how long this will take. For each new type of flower you attempt to dry in the microwave, set aside one as a crash-test dummy to experiment with time and heat levels before nuking the rest.
If you are nervous about over-drying your flower at first, set a small bowl or cup of water in the microwave while cooking the flower to slow down the rate of drying., Once the microwave has dried your flower, seal the container with its cover. Set the container in an out-of-the way place. Unseal the container, but keep it covered. Gently edge the cover along the container’s top to create a gap that is only a quarter of a centimeter wide. Leave it just like that for the next 24 hours., After the flower has sat overnight in the silica gel, remove the flower from the container. Use a fine brush to wipe the gel off. Once the gel has been removed, spray the flower with an acrylic spray."

Choose a drying agent.,
Place your flower in the drying agent.,

Bury the flower.,
Wait for the flower to dry.",How to Preserve Dead Flowers3," Go the cheapest route and use fine, dry sand that has been washed and sifted to remove salt, soil, and other coarse material. Or speed up sand’s slow-acting properties by mixing it with borax. Or make the drying process that much faster by eliminating the sand and using a borax/cornmeal mixture.Sand/borax mixture: 1 part sand to 2 parts borax, with 1 tablespoon of salt added to every quart.
Borax/cornmeal mixture: 1 part borax to 1 part cornmeal for fastest results, or 1 part borax to 3 parts cornmeal to reduce the risk of the borax burning your petals.

, Pick a container that is large enough to fit your flower. Fill the bottom with the drying agent so that it is a half-inch to an inch deep. Set the flower on top of the mixture with the blossoms facing up. If you are drying more than one, allow plenty of room in between each flower so they do not touch., Spread the drying agent in the container over the stem and flowers. Grab a handful and very gently pour it over the petals so some of it ends up between them, reducing the risk of them being crushed when you cover them momentarily. Be careful not to pour too much at once, which may damage the petals., Add another half-inch to an inch of drying agent to the container. Be careful not to pour the drying agent directly on top of the flower, since the weight might crush it. Spread the drying agent until the flower is completely covered. If you are drying multiple flowers at once, and if your container is deep enough, you can repeat the whole process and lay more flowers on top of this layer., Seal the container once you have buried the flower. Depending on how thick your flower it is, allow anywhere from four days to two weeks for it to dry. Unseal the container every four or five days. Use a fine paint brush to wipe away the drying agent and uncover the flower. Feel the petals and and the base of the stems for signs of moisture. Rebury the flower and reseal the container if you find any.If you don’t feel any moisture, remove the flower by its stem and gently shake the remaining sand or borax from its petals, using your brush as needed if some crystals are too stubborn to shake loose.
If the weight of the drying agent has crushed your petals, use steam to refresh and reshape them.

Choose a large, thick book.Pick one that is long and wide enough to cover your flower’s head.,
Create a folder for your flower.,
Place your flower inside.,
Stack and wait.",How to Preserve Dead Flowers4," The more pages it has (and thus weight), the better. However, if all you have are fairly slim books, don’t worry. Just pull several off the shelf, or find a heavy object that can rest on top of the book without sliding off.


This method works best for extremely delicate flowers that may lose their petals in all other methods.

, Use a sheet or two of paper towels or some other material that absorbs moisture. Fold it in half. Make sure that each half will cover the flower’s head.This step isn’t strictly necessary, but it will protect your book from moisture damage and staining, as well as reduce the risk of ink bleeding off the page and staining your flower.

, First, set your flower on one half of the folder that you have made. Fold the other half over so that it lightly covers your flower. Open your book at least halfway through, preferably closer to the end. Place your folder on the open page and close the book over it.

, Set additional books or heavy objects on top of the book with the flower for extra weight. Give your flower roughly a month to dry and press. After that, crack your book open, and you should have a beautifully pressed flower inside!"

Decide when you will sow your wildflower seeds.,
Prepare the land where you will sow your wildflower seeds.,
Discover which wildflowers are best for your area and know their classification.,
Choose a sunny location that has good drainage.,
Plant your wildflower garden or meadow near a water source to help keep your wild garden from dying during brief dry spells or even longer droughts.

,
Fertilize sparingly.,
Check with gardening experts, with your county extension office's agricultural service, or consult the recommended coverage guidelines on your box or package of seeds to determine how much seed you will need for the area you have to cover.

,
Sow your wildflower seed using the split-and-sand method.,
Ensure your newly-planted wildflower garden or meadow stays moist for the first 4 to 6 weeks or until the plants are well-established.,
Mow at a high setting once in the late fall.",How to Plant Wildflowers,"

Autumn is the time nature sows its seeds. An advantage to fall sowing is the chance for early bloom. However, early blooming also adds the risk of encountering a late spring freeze. Wait until after a killing frost to sow seeds in the fall so they will not sprout until spring.



 


You can plant wildflowers in summer if you live in a mild climate and there is sufficient rainfall. Otherwise, summer heat and lack of rain (if you live in drought-prone areas) will not allow the seeds to sprout.






Some horticulturists and gardeners consider spring the best time to sow wildflower seed. Wait until the possibility of frost is over before sowing the seeds. Sow your seeds as soon as you finish preparing the soil to give the wildflowers an advantage over weeds.





;
,

You can use any soil to plant wildflowers unless the soil is sterile. If grass and weeds are growing there now, wildflowers will also flourish.






Clear the ground as much as possible. Smother the other plants with wet newspaper, which can be plowed right into the soil. Dig out small areas by hand or use a rototiller for large areas. Till only deep enough to remove old roots. Deep tilling is not advised.






Grass and weeds will compete with wildflowers, yet you want more flowers than grass or weeds. You could leave a little grass in the area to add to the natural prairie or wild meadow look.







,


Most wildflowers are annuals. They bloom quickly and heavily, drop their seeds, and die when the weather either gets too cold or dry to live, based on your locale. Many are ""self-sowing"" and more plants will grow the next year because of the seeds that were dropped as the plants die. Poppies, cornflowers and cosmos are examples of wildflower annuals.
Perennials establish a root system and come back each year. Perennials can last decades and spread more each year. Many are slower to sprout and bloom than are annuals. Purple coneflowers, daisies and coreopsis are examples of perennial wildflowers.
Biennials will sprout one season but not bloom until the next year. They are then killed by frost but since they self-seed, more plants will sprout in the spring. Black-eyed Susans and sweet Williams are examples of biennials.

, Natural features such as boulders or a nearby woodland can enhance the look of your wildflower meadow or garden.

,, Wildflowers grow naturally without much pampering. If you do fertilize, use one with low nitrogen.

,,

Divide your seed in half.






Mix one half of the seed with about 10 parts of light sand or vermiculite to 1 part seed.






Choose a windless day to sow your wildflower seed. Otherwise, it could be difficult to control where your wildflower seeds settle.






Sow the seed over your prepared site. The light color of the sand or vermiculite will show you where the seed has fallen. Repeat the process with the second half filling in missed spots.






Press the seed into the soil by walking over it, placing an old piece of plywood down and jumping on it, or by using a lawn roller. The seed must be pressed into the soil so that it won't easily blow away. Do not cover your seed with more soil as that may prevent wildflower seed from easily sprouting.







, Wetting the seed also keeps it from blowing away. Wildflowers grow naturally without a lot of care, but you need to water them periodically when conditions are especially dry.

, Mowing removes dead flower heads and helps spread seed. See where plants have sprouted in the spring and fill in bare places with new seed.

Wait for the seeds to sprout.,
Transplant your seedlings.",How to Propagate Clematis1," It is true that germinating seeds is typically straight-forward, but clematis are particularly high maintenance and require loads of attention and care in order to propagate from seed. Amazingly, it takes between 12-36 months for clematis seeds to germinate. Hybrid seeds take much longer than cultivars, meaning that you’ll likely be waiting nearly three years for your hybrid seeds to sprout. Keep this in mind going into your clematis project, and you’ll likely have quite a bit of time to wait before finally planting your clematis.


You’ll need to give your seeds attention on an almost daily basis in order for them to sprout eventually.
You’ll have a better chance of your clematis sprouting if you plant multiple seeds at once.;
, In addition to their long germination period, clematis seeds also require strict growing conditions. It is vital that all of your materials are sterilized and prepared for the sole purpose of planting your clematis. You’ll need seed trays, horticultural disinfectant, sterilized seedling planting mix, clean glass or a plastic bag, and water for moistening the soil. Use your disinfectant to clean your seed trays and glass, otherwise you run the risk of infecting your fragile seeds with disease.

, If you’re not purchasing your seeds from the store, you’ll have to identify and collect viable seeds from an existing clematis. To do so, wait until the seed heads (the fluffy/furry part of the flower) turns brown and the seeds are exposed, as this means that the seeds have fully ripened and dried out. Gently remove them from the seed head, and store them in a dry, cool area.


Don’t store seeds in a plastic bag, as moisture can build up inside and cause the seeds to rot. Instead, put them in a paper bag or compartment.
Keep in mind that the seeds from a hybrid clematis will not form flowers that look like the parents.

, After you’ve sterilized your seed trays, fill them with the sterilized seedling potting mix. This typically has very little soil and is mainly a mixture of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite, making it easy for the seeds to sprout. Fill the seed trays about ¾ of the way full with the mixture, and thoroughly wet it with water.

, Place each of your seeds individually in each seed tray, on top of the potting mixture. When all your seeds have been placed, cover them up with about ⅛-inch of potting mixture or sand. Water the seeds heavily so the soil is damp but not soaking, and then place your glass over the seeds. The glass will help keep the humidity and temperature high, which is preferable for germinating clematis seeds.


Instead of glass, you can also cover the soil with plastic wrap or a plastic bag. This will also effectively raise the humidity and temperature.

, The seeds will do best when placed in a shady location with a temperature between 60–70 °F (16–21 °C). When winter comes around, you should allow the seeds to go through a natural freeze/frost cycle, which will trigger them to sprout. Place them in a shaded area outdoors during the winter to promote this cycle., As the months progress, you’ll need to take careful care of your seeds so that they germinate, rather than drying out or rotting. Make sure that the potting mixture you planted them in is always moist, and remove the glass or plastic bag for a few hours each day to prevent too much moisture from building up and causing the seeds to rot.

, As aforementioned, the specific amount of time it will take for your seeds to sprout will vary greatly on the type of clematis you’ve planted. There are two sets of leaves you should be paying attention for on your seedling: the first set, and the true set. The first set, also called the ‘seed leaves’, is the first pair of leaves that grow from the seed. Once you see the first set of leaves, remove the plastic or glass covering from the soil. The second set of leaves are called the ‘true leaves’, and are the signal that your seeds are ready to be planted outdoors.

, When the true leaves appear, you’ll need to transplant your seedlings. You can choose to relocate them to a larger pot, or to plant them outdoors. Either way, carefully move them to their new location, being sure not to damage their delicate roots. If you choose to move them outdoors, you’ll need to harden them off by placing them in their pots outside for a few hours every day. Doing this for 1-2 weeks will help to prepare the clematis for the environmental conditions outdoors."

Maintain your cuttings.",How to Propagate Clematis2," As with germinating clematis’ from seeds, propagating clematis from cuttings requires quite a bit of preparation and the proper materials. You’ll need a very sharp knife or pair of gardening shears, horticultural disinfectant, 6-inch planters, disinfected potting mixture, fungicide mix, rooting hormone powder, plastic bags, and straws/stakes of some sort to create mini ‘greenhouses’. Begin by using your disinfectant to clean your knife/shears, planting pots, and the stakes/straws you are using.

, Use your knife or gardening shears to make a single clean cut through an existing clematis plant. Cut a vine/branch that is at least 3-feet long, severing the plant just above a set of leaves and below the next node up on the stem. If you can, try to take your cutting from the center of the vine rather than the base or the tip, as this has the highest likelihood of sprouting. Continue to separate your cutting out into smaller sections for planting, by cutting just above a leaf node.

, If you want your cuttings to sprout, it is imperative that you very carefully follow the directions for using your fungicide and rooting hormone mixtures. Start by dunking each of your cuttings in the fungicide mixture, following the directions that came with the mix. Then, dip the ends of each cutting in the rooting hormone mix, being careful to get just the right amount. Adding too much of the rooting hormones can prevent growth, which is not what you want. Finish by cutting one leaf off each stem; this will reduce moisture loss.

, Fill each of your pots with your sterile soil mixture so that they are about ¾ of the way full. Bury the tips of each of the cuttings so that the joint of the leaves are level with the topsoil. Give them a light watering so the soil is damp, and label the pot if applicable.

, Clematis cuttings will thrive in a slightly humid environment, which you can easily create with a few household materials. Stick 3-4 straight straws or bamboo stakes into each container, and place a plastic bag over the top. Make sure that the bag is not touching the plant at all, and give the soil a good watering. Once a day, flip the bag inside out to let excess moisture out and to prevent rotting.

, It will take 6-8 weeks for your cuttings to start growing, and in the meantime they should be placed under the best growing conditions possible. Relocate the potted plants to a place that has plenty of ambient sunlight, but is mainly shaded, with a temperature between 60–70 °F (16–21 °C).


Too much direct sunlight can overheat the young plants, especially under their plastic bags.

, Although your cuttings may sprout in 6-8 weeks, they likely won’t be ready to be planted outdoors for about a year. During this time, water them regularly so that the soil is kept moist at all times, and continue removing and replacing your plastic bag ‘greenhouse’ to keep the humidity up."

, Using the other hand, insert the stake into the potting soil or ground soil and ease the top of the stake under the flower head, and along the length of the stem.

, This can be done either in pots or in garden beds. It is a good idea to tie the stem to the stakes with fishing wire to keep them in place.

, Pour water close to the base of the plant and avoid getting too much water on the leaves and stems., Many diseases from earlier plants can be transferred to new plant material, and can linger on old plant debris or roots.

, Wash all tools thoroughly after each use to prevent the spread of fungal disease.

, Over-watered soil allows bacteria to form and leads to fungal disease and powdery mildew.

, Use new seeds that have not previously been placed in the planting area.

, Place plants apart from one another so that they are able to take airflow. More air will allow for less moisture buildup.

, Varieties of vegetable plants that are close in species will spread disease more easily from one plant to another.

, Remove any weeds that come in close contact with your plants since they can also carry fungal disease.

While all poppies have colorful, papery petals and a slightly wild, weedy appearance, they also have striking differences when it comes to caring for them.Choose a variety that works best in your growing region and the conditions in your garden.California poppies grow best in USDA zones 9 - 11, the dry western regions of the US. They are easy to care for and do well in infertile soil.

Purple poppy mallow is another variety that grows best in infertile soil, but this one grows best in zones 4 through 8.

Corn poppies, on the other hand, need rich, fertile, wet soil to grow well.

Celandine poppies are woodland flowers that grow best in the east, zones 4 through 8.
Go to http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/, type your zip code in, and press the red “find” button to figure out what zone you’re in.;
, Poppies do not transplant well, so you'll need to buy your own seeds rather than purchasing sprouted seedlings. Common poppy seeds are available in every garden store, but if you want unique varieties, check online for more options. Purchase poppy seeds from a reputable source so they'll be likely to germinate and grow healthy.

, Most poppy varieties grow best in full sun, and can really be planted anywhere without too much shade. You can plant them along the borders of your yard, in a window box or in a chosen spot in your garden. Make sure the soil quality in the spot you choose matches the needs of your poppy.


If you have a variety that does well in infertile soil, you're in luck - you don't have to add anything to your soil to get it ready. Many poppies grow perfectly well in rocky terrain that doesn't support other types of flowers as well.
For varieties that require rich soil, till the soil and mix in rich compost or bone meal to add the nutrients your poppies need to thrive.

, Poppy seeds require a period of stratification in order to germinate. That means they need to be exposed to cold or frost before they'll sprout. It's usually a safe bet to sow poppy seeds in very early spring, while there's still a good chance of frost. If you're in an area with mild winters, sow the seeds in the fall, so they get plenty of exposure to cooler temperatures before the weather warms up in the spring. After 14 to 28 days, the seeds will begin their germination, sending up shoots.

, Poppies are sown on the surface, rather than buried in holes. To prepare the soil, simply loosen its surface a bit with a garden rake. There's no need to till it to a depth of more than an inch or so, if that. In fact, doing so may make it more difficult for your poppies to grow.

, Sprinkle them over the freshly loosened dirt. In nature, poppies drop their seeds, which are small enough to easily be scattered across the ground by the wind. In this spirit, scatter the seeds and let them fall where they may, rather than trying to plant the poppies in rows. It will be difficult to keep the seeds confined to the spot where you drop them.

, Keep the area moist by sprinkling water over the soil. Don't soak it, though, or you may drown the delicate seeds. The seedlings will sprout when the weather warms in the spring., Thinning helps the plants to get bigger and produce more flowers. To thin it is a good idea to cut the plant tops off that you are thinning with scissors so not to disturb the remaining poppies roots. When you see them sprout, you can thin out the poppies to allow each plant a bit of room to grow. Different varieties will come with different instructions as to how much spacing they need. This step isn't totally necessary, but it can give you more control over the final appearance of your flower bed.

, They do well in poor soil that other plants may not be able to survive in.

, The blooms will fall off and the pods will remain. You can harvest these to plant next season. Some varieties even produce edible seeds you can use to make treats such as poppy seed muffins.

, Most poppies don’t need much water once they have grown in a bit. In fact, over watering can create leggy, unattractive growth.Water your poppies moderately and regularly when they’re in bloom or are almost in bloom.
After the flowering period, only water your poppies when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch."

You may be able to find them at your local garden center.;
, Cover the seeds with 1 1/16’’ (26.9 mm) of soil. Put the container in your fridge for between one and two months. After this preparation period, which is called stratification, the seeds will be ready for planting.The seeds should be kept at a temperature of between 30 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (between -1 and -4 Celsius).
Every week, check the container to make sure the soil is slightly damp but not too moist. If the soil is dry, you should spray a bit of water into the container.
You can put one packet of seeds into the container. At the stratification stage, the seeding density is not a major concern, as long as all of the seeds are exposed to a cold and damp environment.

, Use small, four inch (10 centimeter) pots with potting soil or peat pots. Mist the pots with a plant sprayer. Place two seeds down into each of the small pots. Gently press them down, and then mist the pots with a sprayer., Place your small pots in a germination tray or a shallow container. You can place a plastic bag over the tray but remember to leave one side open for ventilation. Keep the tray at a temperature of between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (16 and 21 Celsius) to allow for germination. You should see the seedlings begin to emerge after two or three weeks, at which point you can remove the plastic bag., Place your tray of seedlings in a warm spot in the house, such as in front of a south facing window. If you have a grow light, you can use it for this purpose. Try to make sure the seedlings get 10 to 12 hours of sunlight per day. When they reach a height of between three and four inches (7 and 10 centimeters), you can go ahead and plant the seedlings.Remember to make sure you are past the last frost date in your region.
You can find out the last frost date by visiting either a gardening or a weather website and searching by zipcode. Alternately, you can call the weather service of your local environment agency.

, When they reach 3-4 inches (7 and 10 centimeters) in height, you can plant your seedlings outside. Find a nice place to plant your seedlings in the garden, along a pathway or in a container. If you plant the seedlings in your garden, remember that they will need a sunny spot and a bit of room to grow. You should space them between 4 and 6 feet (1.2 and 1.8 meters) apart from one another.If you choose a pot, find a 75 liter (20 gallon) container with lots of drainage holes and a quick draining medium at the bottom such as stones.Fill the container with rich, loose soil., The night blooming jasmine is native to tropical America and the West Indies. It will not tolerate harsh, cold climates. If you live in a warmer climate, you can go ahead and plant it outdoors.If you get a lot of frost in your region, you might want to bring it indoors during the winter months.It will tolerate United States Department of Agriculture zones 8b, 9a, 9b, 10a, 10b, or 11., The night blooming jasmine enjoys full sun to partial shade. It will bloom very well when exposed to full sun, but can also tolerate some shade.It requires at least four hours of sunlight., The night blooming jasmine will do fine in a range of soil types. However, the soil should be rich in nutrients and drain well, since you don’t want the roots to become waterlogged.The soil should be a neutral pH of between 6.6 and 7.5.Use a soil pH test kit from your home garden center. Dig a four inch (10 centimeter) hole. Pour some distilled water in the hole. Insert the test probe, which is included in your kit, into the hole. After one minute, you will get a pH reading.If the soil pH is not amenable to planting night blooming jasmine, you should plant it in a different part of your garden or someplace with a better soil pH.
It will do well in a sandy soil., Dig a hole in your garden, which should be large enough to contain the night blooming jasmine seedling. Holding the night blooming jasmine by the root ball, gently place it in the hole. Cover the planting with soil.Place night blooming jasmine at least three feet away from walkways and buildings.

, When the top of the soil looks dry, give the plants a good watering.During the first year of the plant’s life, water thoroughly and regularly.Water the night blooming jasmine when the soil looks dry.The frequency of watering will depend on your local climate.
You should water more frequently during the spring and summer months.If you are watering the jasmine in a pot, you should stop watering when you see the water draining from the bottom., Dissolve a half teaspoon of 15-15-15 fertilizer in a gallon of water. Pour the mixture over the base of the plant.If the plant is suffering, you can also feed it with a fish emulsion fertilizer during the winter months. Use a half teaspoon (2.46 milliliters) of fish emulsion with a quart of water. Use one cup (236 millilitres) for each foot of the plant.
15-15-15 fertilizer contains a balanced mix of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium., To encourage new growth and contain their growth, prune night blooming jasmine in the late fall or early spring. Trim the plants back to around three feet (91 centimeters) in height.In order to avoid spreading any disease, it is wise to clean your pruning tools in a bleach solution. You can use a mix of one-part bleach to six parts water.

, In the fall, you should bring the pot of night blooming jasmine onto your porch. As soon as you see the temperatures begin to drop anywhere close to 0 Celsius (32 Fahrenheit), you may want to bring the night blooming jasmine indoors. As long as you place it near a sunny window and keep the temperature between 70 and 80 Fahrenheit (21–26 Celsius), it should continue to bloom."

Cut herbaceous peonies to ground level in autumn.",How to Plant Peonies," Peonies thrive best when planted in autumn, before the first hard frost. Peonies may be planted in the spring, but these plants tend to grow more slowly, and may not bloom for a year or two., If this is not available, peonies can still grow in areas with less sunlight, but their growth and bloom will be reduced.Peonies grow best in USDA Hardiness Zones 3 through 8, corresponding to minimum winter temperatures of -40 to +15ºF (-40 to -9.4ºC).If you are in Zone 8 or higher, peonies may benefit from afternoon shade, with full sunlight in the morning.

, Plan to keep each clump of peony tubers three feet (0.9 m.) apart. They are often used in flower beds, but keep them at away from trees and bushes, as woody root systems can compete with peonies for nutrients.Keeping peonies spaced apart and clearing weeds to allow for air circulation is important for avoiding fungal infections.Tree peony varieties will do better with four ft. (1.2 m) of space between them.If you are not sure what type of peony you have, see the planting peonies section below.

, Peonies may develop problems if planted in areas where other peonies were previously grown. It is possible this is due to reduced soil nutrients, in which case the advice in the planting section below may compensate for this effect. There may be some risk of a surviving fungal infection as well, however, so plant at your own risk.

, This is mostly a concern for tree peonies, which grow into small shrubs that can snap in the wind. However, if you are an area with unusually strong winds, plant any variety of peony in the shelter of a wall or fence. A large tree can also provide shelter, but should be located at least 10 ft. (3 m.) away so the roots do not compete with the peony.

, Peonies come in two varieties: herbaceous peonies and tree peonies. Herbaceous peonies are typically sold as root clumps, and grow into herb-like, green-stemmed flowers. Tree peonies usually have wooden stems attached to the root clump, and grow into woody-stemmed shrubs. Tree peonies also have a ridged bulge on the root with a different bark texture, where one variety of tree peony has been grafted onto another to combine the best qualities of each.You may follow these instructions for either variety, but be prepared to plant them at different depths:


Herbaceous peonies grow when the top bud is planted at a depth of 2 inches (5 cm).
Tree peonies grow best when the graft is planted at a depth of 4–6 inches (10–15 cm), with at least a tip of the top stem above the soil., Peonies do not need to be planted this deep, but unless your flowerbed is already full of rich soil to this depth, a hole this deep is recommended so you can prepare rich, fertile soil for the deep peony roots that will develop after planting. A wide hole at least 18 in. (46 cm) across is recommended for the same reason.If your soil is rich, well-draining, and at least 18 in. (46 cm) deep, skip to the step ""Plant the peony clump,"" below.

, Add 2–4 inches (5–10 centimeters) of dark compost, well-aged manure, or pine bark to the bottom of the hole. If your soil is slow-draining or poor in nutrients, make a 50/50 mix of this organic material and your garden soil, and keep it to one side to fill the hole later.


To test soil drainage, dig a one ft (0.3 meters) hole and fill it with water. Wait until it drains, then fill the hole a second time. Measure how much it has drained after one hour, or measure after fifteen minutes and multiply by four to find the hourly drainage. Well-draining soil suitable for peonies should drain between 1 and 6 inches (2.5–15 cm) per hour., To speed up the peony growth, you may add ¼ cup (60 mL) balanced (10-10-10) fertilizer to the bottom of the hole. Some gardeners also mix in ½ cup (120 mL) bone meal or superphosphate for additional nutrients.


If pH testing reveals that your soil is acidic (below 6.0 pH), add a couple handfuls of lime to balance this out., Now that the extra-rich soil for the peonies' future roots has been prepared, fill most of the hole with well-draining, organic soil, leaving a few inches (several centimeters) of space at the top. The compost or other material you used to fill the bottom of the hole can be mixed with an equal amount of ordinary garden soil, then used for this purpose. Press the soil with your shovel as you fill it, tamping it down firmly., (5 cm) from the surface. Place the clump of peony tubers in the hole, with the small buds or ""eyes"" pointed upward, and the long roots pointed downward. The buds should be no more than 2 in. (5 cm) from the surface, or the plant may fail to emerge. Continue adding soil around the peony until the soil is level, tamping down gently to remove air pockets that can dry the plant out.Early-blooming varieties, especially in warm climates, may grow better if planted only 1 in. (2.5 cm) deep, so they can emerge early in the growing season., (10–15 cm) below the surface. Tree peonies, with wooden stems attached to the root clumps, are sold with a stem grafted onto the roots. Find the ridged bulge on the rootstock where the stem and roots have been joined together, and plant the peonies so this bulge is 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) below the soil surface.

, Give the newly planted tubers a thorough watering to help the soil settle around them. Until the first frost, or until the plants emerge if planting in spring, keep the soil moist, but not soggy.

, Two to four in. (5–10 cm) of mulch, or a plastic mulch covering, can protect the peonies from winter frosts. However, this mulch should be removed after the last frost in spring, or the peonies may fail to break through this additional barrier.You do not need to water while the plants are dormant during winter.

, Peonies are hardy, drought-tolerant plants, and only need about an inch (2.5 cm) of water a week during the summer. Increase the watering only if the peonies are dry and withered.

, Fertilizer is optional, but you may apply a low nitrogen fertilizer, such as a 5-10-10 mix, or organic compost material, no more than once every few years.Apply this in a circle around the peonies, but not directly at the base of the plant.


Different peony-growing guides give considerably varied information on fertilization. A conservative instruction is given here, because peonies will grow fine without fertilizer and can develop weak stems weak stems and fewer flowers if fertilizer is overused. If the stems become too weak to hold up the flowers, consider a gardener's tripod with a metal ring for supporting the stems.

, Ants are commonly found eating nectar from peony flowers, but this rarely causes harm to the plant. Peonies are resistant to most pests, but if you see an infection of other insects or fungus developing, seek advice from a local gardener or botanist who knows about pests in your regions.

, Cut off dead flowers as soon as they fade. If you leave them on the plant, seeds will develop, which takes considerable nutrients out of the plant. Immediate deadheading will allow for stronger growth.

, If your peonies have grown into a shrub with woody stems, they are tree peonies. Remove the leaves in autumn, as cold weather and frosts begin. Leave the bare, wooden stems in place, as new flowers will grow from these next year.If the bare stems have holes bored into them, this may be a sign of pests. Contact a gardener or botanist in your area, familiar with local pest control.

, Peonies are long-lasting perennials, so the roots will survive for many years but the flowers will grow, bloom, and die each spring. When the green stems of herbaceous peonies become brown and dead at the end of spring, cut the plant back to ground level. You may wait until the first heavy frost to do this.


Warning: do not dispose of your dead peonies in the compost heap, as they may carry fungal infections that can spread to other plants this way. Burn them or throw them away instead."

Determine when to plant perennials.,
Evaluate where to plant perennials.,
Remove grass and weeds from the planting area.,
Prepare the soil for planting.",How to Plant Perennials1," In most regions, the ideal time to plant perennials is mid- to late-spring so plants have the opportunity to become established before the heat of summer. Do not plant perennials while there is a chance of hard frosts or temperatures dip below 25 degrees F (-3.89 degrees C).


Plant perennials in the summer, but do not allow the plants to dry out. If you choose to plant perennials in the summer, water the plants daily for 2 to 3 weeks.
Plant perennials in the fall before the first frost. Perennials planted after the first frost typically do not survive because their root systems do not have time to get established before the ground freezes.
Research a specific perennial to determine when its ideal planting time is. The best time to plant perennials varies depending on the species. Consult a gardening guide or ask a professional at a local garden center about the best time to plant a specific perennial plant.





;
, Perennials can be grown in almost any location in the yard or garden. For visual impact, consider planting perennials along a fence, around a tree or in a grouping in the middle of a yard.


Determine how much sunlight the area receives. This will be an important factor in selecting the perennials to be grown in the location. If the planting site is in full sun (6 or more hours of direct sunlight), select sun-loving perennials. If the planting site is shaded, select perennials that thrive in shaded conditions. Because perennials vary in growing condition requirements, it is possible to find perennials for almost any location.







,


Remove grass from the planting area as applicable. The most effective way to remove grass is to dig it up using a spade or shovel. After removing the grass, consider spraying the area with an herbicide that will kill any remaining grass. Till the garden area once the grass has died.






Eliminate all weeds prior to planting because they can compromise the root systems of perennials. Local garden experts can recommend products for controlling weeds common in your area. Alternatively, hand pick weeds from the area to be planted, or cover the ground with layers of newspaper or black plastic for several weeks to smother the weeds.

, The most important step in planting healthy perennials is preparing the soil. Most perennials prefer rich, deep, well-drained soil.


Evaluate your garden soil to determine how to amend it for perennials. If your soil has high concentrations of clay, add peat, compost and sand. If your soil has high concentrations of sand, add compost to add nutrients and create a richer soil. Organic matter like manure, compost, perlite and peat moss are beneficial to most types of garden soils.






Dig the planting area to a minimum depth of about 8 inches (20.3 cm) using a spade or pitchfork.






Spread organic matter directly on top of the existing soil and work it into the ground using a shovel or pitchfork. Insert the shovel or pitchfork into the ground, pull out the shovel filled with dirt and flip the shovel over, dumping garden soil on top of the organic matter. Repeat throughout the garden area until the organic matter is thoroughly mixed into the garden soil.

Buy perennials at local nurseries, garden centers or through online distributors or mail-order catalogs.,
Choose perennials that will thrive in the prepared planting bed.,
Select perennials rated for your U.S.D.A.,
Consider the mature size of each perennial.,
Select healthy plants.",How to Plant Perennials2," Local nurseries typically sell plants raised in your geographic area, which means the plants are hardy and acclimated to the regional temperatures. Online distributors and mail-order catalogs may ship dormant roots instead live plants because they survive better through the shipping process. The dormant roots will take longer to grow, but should produce healthy plants.

, Most container-bound perennials at garden centers come with tags indicating growing conditions required for healthy plants. Examine the tags to ensure the perennials you purchase will grow well in the planting bed you prepared.


Consider the height of each plant. Keep in mind that taller plants may block the view (and light) of shorter plants.






Consider the bloom color of the perennials. Bright colored plants can brighten up shady spots, while dark colored plants may add depth and texture to a full sun garden. Some gardeners select color palettes for their gardens. If you choose a color palette, ensure the bloom color of the perennial complements your palette.







, Plant Hardiness zone. The zones indicate which plants are suited for winter conditions in your geographic area. This is especially important when selecting perennials as they overwinter and come back year after year. If you select a plant not appropriate for your hardiness zone, it may die during the winter months. Plant hardiness zone maps are available online.

, Perennials will grow larger each year. When selecting perennials, take into account the size of the mature plant, which is not the same as the container-bound plant purchased at a local garden center.

, Examine each perennial before purchasing.


Choose perennials that look fresh and vigorous. Avoid leggy or floppy plants.
Inspect the plant for indication of insect damage or disease, such as broken stems, bent leaves or withered leaves. If a perennial is infested with a foliage disease, it could spread into your garden and damage other plants.

"
"
Remove the perennial from the growing container.,
Dig a hole for the perennial.,
Place the perennial in the hole.,
Water the perennial thoroughly.",How to Plant Perennials3," Hold the container upside-down and shake it lightly to loosen the perennial's roots. Gently pull the plant from the container.


Examine the root ball. If many roots are visible, the plant is likely rootbound. To force new growth in a rootbound plant, slice off the bottom 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) of roots using a sharp knife. With your fingers, break up the root ball by separating the roots along the side of the root ball. If you don't break up a rootbound plant, the roots may continue a circular growth pattern and stunt the plant's growth.







, Using a shovel or garden trowel, dig a hole that is slightly wider and the same depth as the perennial container. If the perennial is planted too deep, the plant will experience stress and may not thrive.

, Using a garden trowel or your hands, fill in around the plant with soil. Gently tap down the soil around the plant using your hands. The root ball should be even with or slightly below the surface of the garden soil.

, Water immediately after planting. Examine the plant each day for about 2 weeks while the roots become established. Make sure the soil around the plant is moist and that the perennial isn't wilting. Most perennials need daily watering during the first week, and every other day during the second week. Perennials planted during the summer may require more frequent watering.

"
"
Water regularly.,
Mulch around the perennial.,
Fertilize the perennial.,
Stake tall perennials.,
Remove spent blooms to encourage repeat blooming.,
Cut back perennials to promote new growth.,
Divide perennials every 2 to 3 years.",How to Plant Perennials4," Because there are so many different species of perennials, watering requirements vary based on the specific plant. Keep the soil around the perennials moist, but not soggy. To prevent fungal diseases, water in the morning or early afternoon.

, Mulch will hold moisture in the soil and prevent weeds from growing. Apply 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) of mulch around the plants. Do not allow the mulch to actually touch the stem or branches of the plant or it may reduce air circulation necessary for healthy growth.

, If the soil is rich and amended with organic matter, fertilizing may not be necessary. Otherwise, fertilize with either a slow release granular or liquid fertilizer as needed. Do not over fertilize perennials, which can cause root injury or kill the plants.

, Some taller perennials, such as delphiniums, peonies, phlox and hollyhocks, may require staking. To support the stems, place wooden stakes in the ground and tie stems to the stakes with twine.

, Regularly deadhead faded flowers to keep the plants looking healthy and promote new blooms.

, Perennials may start to look scruffy or leggy after blooming. Most late spring and early summer perennials benefit from clipping after blooming.

, Perennials will continue to grow larger each year, but their continued growth may cause crowding in a garden. To keep the plants healthy, dig perennials out of the ground and split them into smaller chunks. The best times to divide perennials is in the early spring or fall.

Pick out a lavender plant.,
Choose a sunny spot in your yard.,
Check the soil for drainage.,
Test the pH level of the soil.,
Dig a hole large enough for the roots.,
Place fertilizer in the hole.,
Prepare the lavender plant.,
Place it in the hole.,
Water lavender deeply but infrequently.,
Fertilize lavender in early spring.,
Prune lavender.,
Harvest the flowers.",How to Plant Lavender," It's a good idea to pick out a plant sold by a local nursery, since it will provide varieties that do well in your climate. There are many different species of lavender that each have slightly different needs, so if you order a plant online you might not end up with one that will do well in your region.


If your local nursery doesn't sell lavender, do a little online research to find out which varieties work well in your area. The most important factor will be the climate. If it gets cold or very wet where you live, you'll want a hardier species like Mustead or Hidcote. If you live in a place with very mild winters and hot, dry summers, you'll have more options available to you.;
, Lavender is native to Mediterranean countries. To help it thrive in your yard, you'll need to recreate a similar hot, dry, seaside environment. Choose the sunniest spot in your yard for lavender, as it needs at least eight hours of sun every day to grow healthy.


Look for a spot that's sheltered, but not shaded. Lavender can blow over in high winds, so it's a good idea to plant it near a wall or other large plants that don't loom too high, but are large enough to block the wind.

, Lavender won't grow well in damp, soggy soil. It needs dry, sandy soil that drains very quickly so the roots won't rot. Check the soil's drainage by digging a hole and filling it with water. If the water drains quickly, the soil should be fine. If it stands in the hole and drains slowly, you'll need to amend the soil or find another spot.You can improve soil drainage by tilling the soil to a depth of about six inches and mixing in some builder's sand. This helps mimic the beachy natural conditions in which lavender plants thrive.
You could also choose to grow lavender in a pot or a raised bed, which allows you to control the soil's properties more carefully and tailor them to the lavender's needs.

, Purchase a pH soil tester from a garden center or nursery to check wither the soil is alkaline enough for lavender. The ideal pH level for lavender is between 6.5 and 7.5. You may need to add lime to the soil to increase its alkalinity.A little lime goes a long way. Add just 2 or 3 ounces per cubic foot of soil.
If you're using potting soil, check the label and buy soil with the correct pH.

, Lavender appreciates slightly closed quarters, so dig a hole just large enough to contain the roots, and no larger. If you're planting lavender in a pot, you want to use a pot that's not much larger than the lavender's root ball. If you're planting more than one plant, leave one to two feet between each hole, since the plants will grow quite large., Sprinkle about half a cup of composted manure or bone meal into the hole to fertilize the lavender. This will help it get off to a good start. Mix it in with the soil at the bottom of the hole, then cover with a light layer of soil.


If drainage is a concern, you can also mix in a handful of pebbles so the water drains through more easily.

, Prune off any dead or decaying parts of the plant so that it gets good air circulation and the plant's energy will be directed toward new healthy growth. Shake excess soil from the roots and remove any that are torn or damaged.

, Place the lavender in the hole so that the roots are nestled against the bottom and sides. They should not be directly touching the composted material; rather, make sure there's a layer of soil over the compost before you place the lavender in the hole. Fill in the hole with soil and pat it around the roots.

, Wait until the soil is dry before you water lavender. When you do water, water for several minutes to make sure the roots get completely soaked. If you live in an area where it rains frequently during the summer, skip waterings when the ground is wet., Lavender doesn't need to be fertilized more than once a year. In early spring, work some bone meal mixed with compost into the surface of the soil around the lavender, then give it a deep watering.Over fertilizing lavender will cause the plant to grow poorly, rather than having the effect you want.

, All year round, check the plant for dead or dying shoots and remove them promptly with a pair of sanitized pruning shears. Prune the entire plant back by 1/3 in early spring, before the new growth emerges, to tidy the shape of the plant.


Pruning encourages healthy new growth to emerge. The lavender shrub will get bigger and thicker as it ages, producing more flowers every season. The first season may not yield more than a bunch or two. By year three, you should have several bunches per season.

, When the lavender flowers just begin to open, usually in early summer, gather the lavender into a bunch (one bunch is about a handful of stems) and cut the stems. The plant will produce another flush of flowers before the end of the growing season.


When you harvest flowers, avoid cutting into the woody part from which the shoots emerge. Cutting this part will damage the plant.
Lavender stems may be kept in a vase filled with fresh water. They also keep their color well when they're dried. To dry lavender, tie a bunch using a rubber band and hang it upside down in a dark, dry place for about a week.
The lavender flowers may be used in baking and savory recipes, for crafts, or to make essential oil.

Pick out a spot that is sunny and sheltered from the wind.,
Consider using a heavy container.,
Know that you might find a bit of a mess wherever you plant your sunflower seeds.,
Keep the frost in mind when planting your sunflowers.,
Prepare the area where you plan to plant your sunflowers.,
Consider planting your sunflowers from seeds.,
Plant your seeds.,
Consider planting two seeds at once.",How to Plant Turing Sunflowers1," Tall varieties of sunflowers require lots of sun and a sheltered position. Tall flower heads can bend over in moderate winds, which can cause their stems to break.;
, You can also use fairly deep, large containers and planters but they might need weighing down to prevent the tall plant from tipping them over. Heavy-based pots are better, such as ones made of stone or terracotta.

, Birds love sunflower seeds. You may find birds will peck and scatter the seed heads, which can make a big mess underneath the sunflowers.


The scattering of seeds also means that some of your sunflowers may self-sow, which means sunflowers might start growing in the general vicinity of the original sunflower.

, It’s best to wait until the frosts are over if you want to plant your sunflowers outdoors.


Alternately, you can start your sunflowers off in a pot indoors in the early spring and then move them outdoors in late spring once all risk of frost is over.

, Weed the area where you plan to plant your sunflower. You can help improve soil fertility by mixing some compost into the soil.

, To plant this tall variety of sunflowers, start planting in the spring. You can easily buy packets of seeds in gardening stores or online and they are some of the cheapest flower seeds to buy.


You may have less luck using seeds you have gathered yourself from previous year’s sunflower harvest as these aren’t always fertile.

, Plant the seeds about one inch deep into the compost you have mixed into your soil. Leave about 20 inches (50.8 cm) of space between seeds, then water the area well. Keep the soil moist until the sunflowers have sprouted.


Sprouting can take two to three weeks.

, Some gardeners like to plant two seeds together as not all of them will sprout. If both seedlings emerge, you can remove and discard the one that looks less strong, or transplant the seedling to another position at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) away.

Wait until spring to start the planting process.,
Make sure the soil of the area isn’t too sandy or dry.,
Weed and clear the area.,
Lay down compost or manure.,
Plant the seeds on a warm day.,
Dig about 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) into the soil.,
Sow them in the ground a few inches apart from each other.,
Cover the seeds with ¼ inch of soil.",How to Plant Marigolds1," You don’t want to plant marigold seeds too early. Wait until early spring is over, and the danger of a spring frost has passed. During mid or late spring, you can begin readying the soil for planting your marigolds., Marigolds grow best in loamy, well-drained soil that water can travel through relatively easily. Sandy soil that traps water can stunt the growth of the plant.To test whether the garden soil is optimal for planting, dig a 12x12 inch hole that is about 18 inches (46 cm) deep. Fill it with water and let it drain, and then do it again and time how long it takes the water to drain. The water level in well-drained soil goes down about one inch per hour., Before planting marigolds outside, you will want to weed the site you will be planting on. Also make sure to clear away any rocks or debris. This makes the site more hospitable to the marigold plants so that they can grow without interference.When you are weeding, grip the weed as close to the soil as you can. You want to try to remove the entire root section of the weed as well as the part above the ground, or else the weed will grow back.

, Before you plant marigolds, mix some organic compost or well-aged manure into the garden soil. This will improve the health of the marigolds by giving them the nutrients they need to thrive., You want to make sure that the soil is warm on the day that you are planting the marigold seeds. Cool or cold soil can affect the growing process., Use a trowel or shovel to dig into the soil 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm). Turn the soil over to break it up and to make it airy. Do this for the entire area in which you will be planting the seeds.As you are turning over the soil, make sure to break up any clumps and remove any rocks or pebbles you find.

, After you have prepared the soil, drop the marigold seeds in the soil a few inches apart from each other. You don’t want to plant them too close to each other or they could interfere with each other's growth., Use ¼ inch of soil to cover the marigold seeds. This will ensure that the seeds aren’t too exposed and will be able to grow. Do not use too much soil to cover the seeds; this will make it difficult for the fragile seedlings to poke out of the ground."

Give your tall sunflowers some support.,
Water your sunflowers.,
Protect your sunflowers from pests.,
Fertilize your plants.",How to Plant Turing Sunflowers2," Once the sunflower gets to be about waist height, you might want to give the plant some support using a tall, sturdy garden stake or cane. Drive this into the ground fairly deeply and then loosely tie the sunflower stalk to the cane.


You may want to tie the plant in another place further up the stem as it grows.

, Remember to give your sunflower some water during dry periods. Make sure not to over-water your plant because sunflowers do not generally like having soggy feet.

, Slugs and snails may attack the young plants so you might consider covering them with a clear plastic bottle with the funnel end cut off to make a homemade cloche. Remember to remove this once the plant starts to outgrow it.


Alternately, consider using pellets or traps.

, Sunflowers are hungry plants. You can really help the plant’s growth by giving it a weekly feed with a liquid fertilizer. Avoid using slow release or granular fertilizers as these will release nutrients too slowly to benefit the fast-growing plant.


You may find that the sunflowers won’t grow as well the following year because the nutrients in that area have been depleted. Mix in plenty of manure at the end of the growing season to help stimulate regrowth.

"
"
Consider leaving the dead sunflowers for the birds to eat.,
Cut the old stalks back.,
Get rid of seeds to prevent self-seeding.",How to Plant Turing Sunflowers3," You should get a good display of sunflowers by the late summer. After that, the flower heads will fade and the petals wither. If you are a generous wildlife gardener, it’s beneficial to birds to leave the plants where they are so the birds can enjoy eating the seeds.


Alternately you can cut the flowerheads and put them on a bird table.

, Sunflowers, especially giant varieties, leave a woody stalk behind. Cut this stalk to about knee height with a small hand saw. Then either pull it out of the ground or dig it out. You can compost the stems.

, Sunflowers may self-seed. If you don’t want volunteer (self-sown) sunflowers in your garden the following year, sweep up any seeds you see.


To stop them from scattering, you may like to lay a sheet under the plants to catch any dropped seeds as you remove the flowerheads and the rest of the plant. Or you can hoe the area when the young seedlings emerge to kill them off.

Become familiar with who Alan Turing was.,
Learn how Turing sunflowers came about.,
Consider participating in the experiment.",How to Plant Turing Sunflowers4," Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician credited with being a very significant figure in the birth of modern computing and artificial intelligence. He made an enormous contribution to code breaking during World War II and his work on breaking the code of the German naval ‘Enigma’ code machines is generally agreed to have helped shorten the conflict by several years., To mark the centenary of Turing’s birth in 2012, a mass-participation science project was proposed by the University of Manchester, where Turing studied. Individuals, groups and schools were encouraged to plant sunflowers to help prove Turing’s theories about the presence of Fibonacci numbers in sunflowers. This would also help commemorate this brilliant scientist as well as prove his work in a 2012 experiment examining 3000 sunflower heads.


Turing's Sunflowers aren’t a special variety. For the science experiment it was proposed that taller varieties were used. These include sunflowers varieties such as Russian Giant, Giant Single and Giant Yellow. All these varieties grow to around 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) in height.

, Once the sunflowers are mature, you might like to participate in the science project by examining the seeds.


has a good explanation of what you need to do to identify what’s known as the Fibonacci phyllotaxis in sunflowers.

Wait until the start of spring to plant marigolds indoors.,
Use a soilless potting mix for indoor containers.,
Sow the seeds a couple inches apart.,
Mix in a slow-acting granular fertilizer.,
Keep the temperature around 70 degrees.,
Place the plant in direct light once germination begins.,
Water the marigolds occasionally.",How to Plant Marigolds2," If you are growing marigolds indoors, you can start growing six to eight weeks before the last frost date. Because you are growing the flowers indoors, you do not need to worry about the soil being too cold for the plants, which is why you can start growing them earlier.


If you are growing marigolds in a pot outdoors, you should wait until after the last frost to begin the process.

, Use a pot filled with soilless potting mix. Soilless potting mix is made up of materials like peat and bark. You can find it at gardening stores or stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s.Make sure the pot you are using has drainage holes in the bottom. This will allow water to pass through the pot naturally as it does in the ground.
You may want to put a board or plate underneath the pot to catch any excess water or soil that comes out of the drainage holes., Marigolds grown in containers can be planted closer together, but you want to make sure to give the seeds a couple inches of space in between them. Cover the seeds with ¼ inch of soil., Use about a teaspoon per plant of slow-acting granular fertilizer. This will give your marigolds the nutrients that they need to grow, and are active over a long period of time, about 8-12 weeks., 70 degrees is a good temperature to aim for in your home. Check your thermostat and make sure that your marigolds are being kept around this temperature. If needed, you can buy a heating pad to put under the pot to keep it at this temperature. Also make sure that you start growing your marigolds away from direct light until germination., Your marigold plant should start sprouting within 5-7 days. Once the plant has started sprouting, you will want to place it in direct light for at least 6-8 hours everyday. Either place the pot by a window if you live in a sunny climate, or put the pot under a grow lamp.If you are growing marigolds in a pot outdoors, keep them in direct sunlight.

, Marigolds do not generally require a lot of water, so water every few days. You want to let the soil partially dry out between watering. Too much dampness in the soil can over stimulate marigolds and isn’t good for the plant.Water at the roots, and avoid getting the blooms, leaves and stems wet.

"
"
Try to transplant seedlings, not full plants.,
Make sure the soils are consistent temperatures.,
Prepare the soil.,
Transplant the marigolds.,
Space the marigolds 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) apart.",How to Plant Marigolds3," Whether you are transplanting a flower from one outdoor spot to another or from a pot to a garden, it’s best for the plants to transplant them when they are seedlings, and only about 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) tall. You can transplant them when they are fully bloomed, but if you can, you should transplant young plants or seedling. , If the soils are drastically different temperatures, the transplant can be a shock to your plant and it may suffer. Try to make sure that the soil in the pot and the soil you are transplanting to are similar temperatures.When you are picking a spot to transplant, find one that receives a lot of sun.

, Just as you would do when planting seeds, dig about 6 inches (15 cm) into the soil, then turn it over and sift through it. Break up large clumps and remove any stones or rocks., Make a hole the size of the marigold root ball in the soil you are transplanting to. Gently remove the marigold plant, keeping some of the planting material around the roots of the plant. Place the plant in the small hole, and pat more soil around the plant.

, If you are planting more than one marigold, make sure that they are spaced at least 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) apart. If you are planting a larger marigold variety, space about a foot apart."
"
Water marigolds at the base of the plant semi-regularly.,
Use fertilizer about once a month.,
Snip off dead blossoms.,
Stake them in windy environments.",How to Plant Marigolds4," The amount you need to water marigold plants depends on your climate, but you will want to try for around once a week. Be sure not to over water marigolds because it can weaken the plant. Aim to keep the soil moist as opposed to wet.Also be sure to water at the base instead of over the top of the plant. This could lead to mildew.In times of drought, water marigolds more consistently.

, Soil that is too rich is not good for marigold plants. However, you should try to pat general purpose fertilizer around the marigold plants about once a month., If you notice that your marigold plant has dead blooms or branches, snip them off with gardening shears. This will help the plant to bloom more freely, and will promote healthy growth for the rest of the plant., If the place you live in experiences a lot of wind, stake your plants. Take a thin stake or stick that is slightly shorter than your marigold plant and use plastic ties to loop the plant to the stake.

Consider buying container-grown pansies from seed or bedding plants.,
Consider the flower's color and size.,
Combine your pansies with other flowers, if desired.,
Be sure to use a pot with holes in the bottom.,
Sprinkle your seeds on moist compost.,

In most cases, plant in the summer for spring-flowering plants.,
Water your pansy plants regularly.,
Use fertilizer, too.,
Keep your pansies away from slugs, snails, and mildew.,
Cut the plant down as necessary.,
Extend your plant's lifespan by cutting it down when the weather heats up.",How to Plant Pansies in Containers and Pots," Pansies are easy to grow from seed and seed growing is usually the most economical way to obtain pansy plants.


However, pansies can be purchased from a nursery such as bedding plants or plug plants. They are usually available in spring and fall. If you purchase pansies in the fall, they will need to be planted 6 weeks ahead of the first frosts. This gives the plant time to get established in the ground so it can resist the colder weather.

When choosing plants, it’s best to select ones with buds rather than open flower heads as these will deliver more flowers over their lifetime than ones purchased when they are already blooming.

;
, Most gardeners select pansies based on the flower color but you should also consider the flower size. The smallest pansies tend to have flower ‘faces’ about an inch across; the largest grow flowers up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) across.


You’ll also find ruffled, smooth, and trailing varieties. Trailing varieties work well in containers such as hanging baskets.

, Pansies work well in containers and pots; some varieties will trail more (suspend slightly, hanging lower) than others. In generally, pansies are clump-forming rather than spreading so they won’t provide much ground cover. Because of this, sometimes it's a good idea to combine them with other flowers.


Pansies work well with other spring-flowering plants such as daffodil or grape hyacinths. They make a good edging plant set against taller growing plants, too.
Some gardeners swear by the rule ""a thriller, a filler and a spiller"" for container planting. One showy plant to catch the eye and thrill it, a plant to fill out space and provide an attractive backdrop, and a trailing plant to spill over the edge and create an interesting organic shape. Certain varieties will be your spiller, while others make better fillers.

, Pansies favor free-draining soil so it’s best to select a pot or container with drainage holes. Use a light, free-draining compost.


Pansies won’t mind a shallow container as their roots are fairly shallow. They can tolerate a little crowding but aim to plant them no closer than about 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart.

, Then, cover with a thin layer of compost or vermiculite. They will germinate best at a cool room temperature of around 60F (16C).


You can select the best seedlings and move them to pots once large enough to handle without being damaged. This is usually about the point when they have 5 leaves.
Alternately, you may like to sow directly into individual pots.

, Pansies favor a sunny spot, but if you live in a hot climate, consider a spot with partial shade as they dislike too much heat. Pansies prefer cool temperatures and won’t enjoy the heat of a house, so don’t bring them inside.


Seedlings can be planted out in the fall, in which case you'll need to protect them from the severest of weather. For example, you may like to consider cloche protection during significant snowfall. Some gardeners cover pansies with evergreen branches from their Christmas tree to protect from the worst of the weather, too. Others mulch with something like straw or pine needles to keep the worst of the snow off.

, Check the packet you bought the seed from for specific instructions, but most pansies should be planted in summer. If you prefer to wait until spring to plant them out, a greenhouse or cold frame may be best for them over the winter. They can then be planted out in the early spring, perhaps around March.


Pansies can also be sown in mid-winter, say around January or February, for summer flowers. It’s best to do this if you live in an area where the summers aren’t too hot.

, Pansies grown in containers and pots will need regular watering; usually container plants require more regular watering than ground-planted ones as they dry out faster. Pansies prefer not to sit in permanently wet soil so as a general guide, only water them once the soil is dry to the touch.


Mulching will benefit pansy plants by helping retain water in the soil and also protect the roots in cold weather. Consider adding a 2-inch layer of well-rotted manure or something similar around the base of the plant to mulch it. It’s best to do this in spring or summer.

, In addition to mulch, you should feed your pansy plants about once a month to ensure maximum plant health and repeat flowering. A water-soluble nitrogen fertilizer can be added to the watering can on a monthly basis.


However, don’t overdo it or your pansies may grow too leggy. Stick to once a month for a while and adjust as necessary.

, Young pansy plants should always be protected from slugs and snails, in addition to other plant diseases. Leaf spotting can sometimes be contained by spraying but it’s hard to cure plant diseases completely.


Pansy plants can be susceptible to disease. Try removing any yellow or withered growth and disposing of it (don’t compost diseased plant matter). If plants are affected by mildew, it’s often best to dig the whole plant out to prevent it spreading.

, Removing spent flowers and any seed pods that develop is a good way to ensure repeat flowering. If your pansies become ""leggy,"" i.e. they grow long and straggly, you can cut them right back and let them regrow to a more compact shape.


To do this, cut back the stems to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) height. The best way to take a cut is to snip each stem just above the leaf set nearest to this length.

, Pansies often die away in the summer heat, but they can sometimes be persuaded to live on through the hotter months if well taken care of. If this is done successfully they will flower again in the fall right into winter. To try to extend the pansies’ lifespan in this way, cut the plants right back once the weather starts to heat up in late June or early July.


Cut the stems above the nearest leaf set. You should cut back to a height of about 2 inches (5.1 cm). If you are able to move your container, move it out of the direct sun into a cooler spot.
Remember to keep watering the plant throughout the summer and it may reward you by flowering again in the fall.

Choose garden mums for a hardy flower.,
Choose florist mums for a greater variety.,
Pick an area in full sun.,
Choose an area with good air circulation.",How to Plant Mums1," Hardy mums can last for several years if you plant them at the correct time of year and care for them properly. They’ll put down deep roots that help them survive the winter and come back the following year and flower again. , Florist mums are less hardy than garden mums, and they are usually potted or planted in a garden bed with the intention of removing them once their blossoms are gone. They come in an amazing variety of colors and shapes, but unfortunately they won't live over the winter, no matter how well you take care of them. Florist mums include the following varieties: Pompom mums, one of the most common varieties, which are shaped like little balls.
Anemone mums, which have either one or two rows of petals around a center.
Daisy mums, which have a row of petals around a center, like daisies do.
Spider mums, which are less common, have long, droopy petals.

, Mums will bloom pretty much anywhere, but they do best in an area in full sunlight. This means the area where you plant your mums should get 5 to 6 hours of direct sun per day.Mums bloom based on the changes in sunlight as nights get longer and days get shorter, so try to avoid planting them near artificial light sources like street lights.

, Mums are actually pretty adverse to wet conditions, so choose an area to plant them that has good air circulation and is generally dry. This usually means a higher area of your yard."
"
Plant in the early spring.,
Dig a hole.,
Add compost or peat to the hole.,
Place the mums in the ground.",How to Plant Mums2," This should be after the threat of freezing is over but before the weather gets too warm. Your mum plant’s roots should have at least 6 weeks to establish themselves before either very cold or very hot weather. , The size of hole will depend on whether you’re planting plants or seeds. If you’re planting a mum plant, the hole should be at least twice as big as the rootball of the plant. If you’re planting seeds, you'll need a few holes about the size of a pencil, which you can easily make with your fingers.If you're transplanting mums from a plastic pot to the soil, the hole you dig should be the same depth as the pot they came in. So if the pot is six inches tall, plant your mums in a hole six inches deep.
Space the holes about 18 to 24 inches (45 to 50 cm) apart to make sure the flowers have room to grow without getting tangled up. The number of holes you need will depend on how plants or packets of seeds you buy, and how much space you have. You'll be placing 5 to 6 seeds per hole.

, This aerates the soil a little bit and makes it easier for the roots of your mums to breathe. You should add compost or peat to your hole whether you're transplanting plants or planting seeds., If you're transplanting a plant, gently remove it from its container by flipping the container over and gently tapping the bottom until the plant slides out. Place the plant carefully in the hole - make sure it's not titled to one side or the other. If you're planting seeds, sprinkle five or six seeds into the hole. Once the plants or seeds are in the hole, fill it the rest of the way with soil and pat it down with your hand."
"
Place soil in a new pot.,
Remove the mum from its plastic container.,
Break up the root ball.,
Place the mum in the pot and fill with soil.,
Leave the mum in an area with plenty of sun.",How to Plant Mums3," You should add enough soil to make a layer about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. If you use any more than that, the plant will sit on top of the soil and be taller than the pot. Any less and there won’t be anything for the plant’s roots to attach to., Don’t pull your mum out of the container by the stems. Instead, place your hand over the top of the plant, with the stems between your index finger and thumb, and flip the plant upside down. Then gently tap the bottom of the container until the plant falls out., The roots on the bottom of the plant will probably be growing in a circular direction. If you leave them this way, they'll eventually choke each other and your plant will die. Break up those roots by running your hand gently down the side of the rootball and loosening up the roots and dirt., Once you’ve filled the pot with soil to the edge, gently tap the container on the table to even out the soil.You can also plant mum seeds in a pot. Once you've filled the pot with soil, sprinkle a handful of mum seeds in a pot and then fill it the rest of the way with soil.

, This can be in a very sunny window, or on your front porch if it gets a lot of sun."
"
Keep the soil moist.,
Fertilize the mums.,
Pinch back the plants before they bloom.,
Remove dead blooms.",How to Plant Mums4," You should check the soil for its moisture level every day if the weather is still relatively warm (up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit/27 degrees celsius during the day) and every other day when it’s cool. It should feel moist and cool to the touch, but not soaking wet. If your soil is dry or a light brown color, it needs water! This is true whether your mums are planted in the ground or in a pot.If your plants or soil get really dry, make a few small holes in the soil with a pencil and then fill them with water.

, If you planted mums in the spring, they should be fertilized once a month until they bloom in the fall. You don't have to worry about fertilizing florist mums planted in the fall - they're hearty enough to survive without fertilizer.You should use a 5-10-10 fertilizer for mums. The 5-10-10 ratio refers to the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the fertilizer, and 5-10-10 ration means there should be twice as much phosphorus and potassium as nitrogen in the fertilizer. All fertilizer brands will show on their labels what the ratio is.

, This just means pinching off the top of the mum plant while it’s still green and growing. You should pinch the top ½ inch (1 cm) or so off when the plants are 6 inches (15 cm) and 12 inches (30 cm) tall. It actually encourages more blooms when the plants finally flower in the fall.If you want to get a more precise edge when you're taking off the top of the mum, you can use garden shears to cut the plants back.

, Once your mums bloom, you’ll find that some blooms fade quicker than others. Remove them by gently pinching the bloom at the base of the stem and pulling it off. This encourages the plant to grow more blooms and keeps your plant looking fresh."

Check the position of your bottlebrush.,
Consider growing new bottlebrush plants.,
Continue to feed well and water regularly.",How to Help a Bottlebrush Flower More," It may not be getting enough sun and bottlebrush plants need full sun for the entire day to encourage flowering. Alternatively, it may be getting a bit old, or be a little sickly for some reason. Consider shifting the plant if this would not disturb it too much.;
, If you can't shift the old bottlebrush for fear of killing it off or damaging it, it is easiest to plant new plants in an area that has full sun.

, Sometimes the plant may respond well to additional nourishment.

Understand the difference between annuals and perennials.,
Protect your carnations from frost.,
Use the ‘stopping’ technique.,
’Dead head’ your plant.,
Avoid using manure or nitrogen-rich products.",How to Help Carnations Make a Comeback1," The flowers can also be referred to as border carnations (annuals) and perpetual flowering carnations (perennials). Annuals are plants that only live for one year, while perennials live for several years.


Perpetual Flowering Carnations offer the largest flower size but are less frequently scented than other varieties. This article will focus on Perpetual Flowering Carnations and how to maintain their flowering year after year.;
, Perpetual flowering carnations need to be protected from frost in order to remain alive and in flower. Most gardeners use a greenhouse or polytunnel, which is also called a hoop greenhouse. To learn how to build a hoop greenhouse, click here. It’s important that the temperature does not fall below 45 °F (7 °C), so an unheated space may not work if you live in a cold climate.


In milder climates you may get by with a polytunnel strung with lights, which may offer enough heat to keep plants alive. You can also bring Carnations inside as house plants.

, Many gardeners like to use a practice called ‘stopping’ to encourage bushy plant growth. To do this, remove the growing tip from the young plant and the bud at the tip of each side shoot. This encourages side blooms to bloom as well, rather than one just tall flowerhead.


The height you snap the plant stem off at is the height at which it should start to bush from, meaning you can influence the height of your plant.
Stopping will delay the flowering but you will get more flowers from your plant. You can assume good-quality nursery plants have been stopped already but if you grow from seed, do this when the plant stem has about a half dozen leaf pairs or is about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in height.

, It’s a good idea to pinch off dead flower heads as the blooms wither. This will prevent the plant from forming seed heads, which discourage new flower production. Seed heads take a lot of your plant’s energy to form, which means it will have less energy to produce blooms.

, Carnations won’t bloom as well if there is a high nitrogen presence in the soil so avoid incorporating manure or high nitrogen fertilizers. When planting them outside, try to prepare the soil several weeks in advance. To do this:


Add some lime to the soil to improve the alkalinity, and a fertilizer that isn’t too high in nitrogen. Try to fertilize weekly during the growing season.

"
"
Try dividing your carnations to rejuvenate and propagate your plant.,
Consider trying to take cutting of your plant if you’d rather not divide it.,
Try layering to propagate your carnations.",How to Help Carnations Make a Comeback2," Carnation plants can be rejuvenated by splitting their root masses into separate plants. To do this, dig up an older carnation plant and use your hands to separate it into two. Replant the divided parts and give them a good watering.


You should not let the plant dry out until it is established.

, Carnations grow well from cuttings. You may find that a cutting is a good way to replace plants once they are past their prime, which is usually when they reach two to three years of age. It’s important to only propagate from healthy ‘parent’ plants. To make a cutting:


Cut a non-flowering piece of one of your plant’s shoots. Try to do this first thing in the morning if you can. This cutting should be about four inches long.






Cut below a leaf node using a very sharp, clean blade. The shoot should be recent growth from the same year. Remove the lower leaves.






Dip the cut into a rooting hormone and then plant it halfway down a planter that has been filled with coarse sand.






Water, then place a clear plastic bag around the plant.






Place this in a bright spot out of direct sunlight, such as a window ledge that does not get full sun. Maintain moisture until the plants are established and you can see growth.







, Carnations can also be propagated by a method called ‘layering’. To do this, prepare the soil around the plant you wish to propagate as you would for planting a cutting (mixing in sand to compost or peat, then watering the area).Next:


Find a healthy side shoot and strip off the lowest leaves. Halfway along the length make a vertical slit in the stem with a sharp knife.






Bend the stem over and plant the cut midsection into the ground. A good tip is to use a bit of wire or a hairpin to anchor it in the soil. It will eventually root from the cut bit of the stem.






Keep the soil moist for about six weeks, then you can cut it from the parent. Leave it for another month before relocating it.







"
"
Consider helping your plant grow with a stake.,
Make sure to give your plants enough water.,
Protect your carnations from pests.",How to Help Carnations Make a Comeback3," Young carnations may need staking to provide support, especially in windy areas and if they have large flowers that will cause them to bend under the weight. Stake plants early on in their lives to help them grow straight stems. To do this:


Drive a sturdy garden cane into the soil and loosely tie the plant to it with string. Don’t tie it too tightly.

, Keep plants watered during dry periods. Carnations will prefer soil to be moist but not wet. If foliage is yellow it indicates over watering, so you should ease off. Try to keep the foliage dry.


Avoid splashing water onto the plant when watering and don’t mulch the plant as this can impede the air circulation around the plant.
Carnations prefer a well drained soil and are prone to root and collar rot in wetter conditions.

, Carnations will sometimes be affected by bugs. Keep an eye out for signs of infestation—a regular bug spray will usually keep these under control.


Thrips are the biggest cause for concern; white markings on petals usually indicate you have a problem. Use a bug spray to get rid of these pests.

Reseed the bare spots.",How to Grow Wildflowers," Wildflowers need good drainage, low soil nutrients, and high sun exposure. Pick an area of your yard that doesn’t flood with rain and gets plenty of sun throughout the day. Your plot should not be someplace you’ve recently fertilized, as wildflowers prefer impoverished soil.Your spot should also have easy access to a garden hose, as you’ll need to water it regularly.;
, Wait until after the danger of frost is past. In most areas, this will be in April or May. The relatively warm soil will let your seeds begin germinating immediately after planting., Wait until after the first frost has occurred. You want soil that’s cold enough to keep your seeds dormant, so they wait until spring to germinate. This planting will usually occur in October or November. Fall plantings are appropriate for areas without overly cold winters., There are many different types of wildflower seed blends. Go to a local flower nursery or nature preserve and do research online to find out more about your choices and which plants grow well in your area. You’ll need to begin by factoring in your particular region and the sun exposure of your plot. Next, consider whether you want abundant color or a butterfly garden.


Many wildflower gardens combine flowers with native grasses. If you choose to add a native grass to your seeding, ensure that it’s not an aggressive type that will choke out your flowers., In order to know how much seed to buy, you need to calculate the square area of your plot. This will tell you how many seed packets you need to cover your area. Once you have your number, divide that by the amount of square area one packet can cover.For rectangular plots, measure the length and width of your space and multiply the two numbers. For example, if you have a plot with a length of 15 feet (4.6 m). (4.572 m) and a width of 10 feet (3 m). (3.048 m), your calculation will be: 15 feet (4.6 m). x 10 ft. = 150 sq. ft. (13.93 sq. m)
For circular plots, measure half the length of the circle (the radius) and multiply that number by itself and by 3.14 (pi). For example, if you have a plot with a radius of 15 ft., your calculation will be: 15 feet (4.6 m). (4.572 m) x 15 feet (4.6 m). x 3.14 = 706.5 sq. ft. (65.55 sq. m)

, Remove all weeds, grass, and debris from your plot. If your area isn’t too densely covered in weeds or grass, you may be able to simply weed and rake the spot.


You can also try smothering the weeds and vegetation by covering them with a black plastic sheet or tarp, a piece of plywood, or heavy leaves. Once the vegetation has died, it may be easier to remove., For spots with tough soil or dense vegetation, tilling the soil will be easier than raking. Rototill only deep enough to remove the old roots of grasses and weeds, generally no more than 2 inches (5.08 cm).If you have extremely stubborn weeds, you may need to use a chemical herbicide. Begin rototilling 6 weeks before you want to plant, and then allow the weeds to grow. 3 weeks ahead of planting, spray the weeds with herbicide. This will provide you with 3 weeks during which the weeds will die and the chemical will wash out of the soil. Remove the weeds by raking at the end of the process., Once your area is fully cleared, rotate the soil with a rake. Next, firm up and smooth out any loose soil. A firm seedbed free of clumps will both retain water better and prevent your seeds from being planted too deeply to germinate., Your soil should be moist enough to remain firm and provide a good seedbed for your plants. If your soil is overly loose, it likely needs a bit of extra watering before you start seeding.

, Separate your plot into two halves. Seed the first half with one half of your seed, and seed the second half on a second pass. This will help you lay down an even amount of seed throughout your area. You may want to mix the seeds with sand or sawdust to give the mixture some bulk and help you evenly lay down the seeds. Use a ratio of one part seed to ten parts sand or sawdust.You can either use a seed or fertilizer spreader with an automatic crank or hand seed the plot. For larger areas, the spreader may be a better option.
If you want instant wildflowers and you’re not worried about your budget, you can lay down pre-sown sod of wildflowers and grasses. Wildflower sod is more expensive than seed, but it can be easily planted on top of bare soil., The optimal depth for wildflower seeds is ¼ to ½ inches (0.6-1.27 cm) deep. Lightly drag your rake in straight lines through the soil in order to get the seeds to this depth., After the seeds are placed, re-firm the soil by pressing it down with your hands or feet. This will reestablish your seedbed and keep your seeds at their proper depth. You don’t want the soil to sink more than ½ inch (1.27 cm) when walking over it., Monitor the area to prevent birds and other animals from eating your seeds. You don’t want the local creatures to eat your lovely garden before it has a chance to grow! If you have problems keeping the critters away, you may want to lay down some netting or fencing., Your soil should remain moist during the germination process. If your area is receiving regular rain, you won’t need to water. If you’re experiencing a dry spell, keep your seeds happy by watering just enough to moisten the ground for six weeks. Once the seeds germinate and you begin to see plant growth, avoid over-watering the plot. You still want to keep your soil from getting dry, but oversaturating the soil with water will prevent your seedlings from getting enough oxygen., Once your wildflowers begin to grow and sprout leaves, they’ll need less moisture. Keep checking the soil for dryness and the plants for signs of stress. Unless you’re in a particularly hot or dry spell, you shouldn’t have to water more than once every week or so., Weeds will be a continual problem in any garden, and wildflower gardens are no different. However, especially during your garden’s first year, it’s better to leave weeds in the plot. You don’t want to dislodge new seedlings by interrupting their root structure.Because wildflower gardens have a less manicured appearance than bed gardens, weeds generally won’t cause as much of an aesthetic problem.

, Once your flowers begin to bloom, you can extend their blooming cycle by gently clipping off dead flowers and stems. This should allow another bloom to replace the dead one., Once your blooming season is over, your garden will begin to dry out. This won’t be the prettiest sight, but resist the urge to mow. You’ll need to wait a few weeks to give the wildflowers time to fully dry out and then release their seeds back into the garden., Once the plants have had time to reseed, you can mow the area. You should be to do this by late fall. This will get your garden ready for next year’s growth.


After you’ve mowed, remove the excess dead plants. You don’t want decomposing vegetation to overly enrich the soil.When mowing, be sure to leave clippings in place, as these may still have seeds to release., After you’ve mowed, you’ll be able to identify spots in the garden where no wildflowers fully germinated or grew. Take the opportunity to lay seed in those areas. Follow the steps in part one and two regarding planting in order to reseed properly."

,
Harvest leaves and/or flowers as wished.",How to Grow Violets," Violets need to be grown in a semi-shaded position but are fairly tolerant provided they do not dry out. They need to be protected from the hot afternoon sun in hot climates but if you live in a cool climate, you can grow them in full sun.;
, Soil pH should be around 6.0 - 7.5; add lime to lessen acidic soils. The soil should be well-drained. Enrich it with well-decayed compost and/or manure. If you have clay soils, add plenty of grit, decayed vegetable refuse and manure; light and gravelly soils should be improved through the addition of a liberal amount of cow manure and loam or clay mixed in. If grown in the open, the violets prefer a moderately heavy rich soil.

, If you already have some violet plants growing, or know someone who has established violets, use these for propagation. Simply break off a small section that has roots, pot it up for a few weeks until established and then plant out. Spring or autumn is perhaps the best time to do this, but you will probably find that it works well just about any time. This should be done every 2 years once you have an established violet garden, to achieve best growing results. If you have seeds, note that seed is best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. The seed requires a period of cold stratification and the germination of stored seed can be erratic. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer.

, Plant either in rows or in a more creative pattern that suits your garden space.

, Violets need a moist soil and should not be allowed to dry out.

,, The flowers are usually produced in abundance in late winter and early spring.

Remove the rhizomes in the fall.",How to Grow Tuberose," Tuberose bulbs are best planted in early spring after the last frost, but this requires a warm climate with a growing season at least 4 months long, and a USDA hardiness zone of 8, 9, or 10.If you have a shorter growing season, start the tuberose indoors in early spring and transfer once night temperatures outdoors are above 60ºF (15.5ºC).


If you live in zone 7 or below, you will need to bring tuberose indoors for the winter.
Zones 8-10 correspond to a minimum winter temperature between 10ºF (-12.2ºC) and 35ºF (1.7ºC). Zone 7 has a minimum winter temperature of 0ºF (-17.8ºC).;
, Tuberose needs well draining, highly nutritious soil. To improve your garden soil, mix in organic material such as peat moss, compost, or old, decomposing manure. Pile this mixture up 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) above the original soil surface to raise it above pooling water.Tuberose prefers a soil pH between 6.5 to 7, but are fairly adaptable and should do fine in environments with pH as low as 5.5.You may use a large, well draining pot instead of a raised bed.

, Plant in a location that gets full sun for about 6-8 hours during the day. Tuberose is native to hot climates, and will only need to be moved to bright partial shade if it shows signs of withering or drying before the end of the growing season.

, If you have purchased a cluster of bulbs, plant the entire cluster.Place bulbs or clusters of bulbs about 6-8 inches (15-20cm) apart to allow for growth.

, Give the tuberose bulb a thorough watering to settle the soil around the plant.


Move on to next section to learn how to care for the bulbs and growing plants. Growth should be visible within a few weeks.

, Keep the soil fairly dry, but water before it dries out fully. Within a few weeks, green tips should emerge, and root systems will develop that allow the plant to handle more water., As tuberose grows, provide roughly 1–1.5 in. (2.5–3.75 cm) of water once a week.Tuberose prefers this to more frequent watering in smaller amounts.


Reduce watering if rain occurs, so the tuberose only receives a total of approximately 1–1.5 in. (2.5–3.75 cm) of water each week.
Take care not to over water, as tuberose rots easily (the reason you really need well-draining soil).

, An 8-8-8 fertilizer, with equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is recommended for tuberose. Apply solid fertilizer around the soil of the plant once every 6 weeks, or apply liquid fertilizer according to packaging instructions., The flowers typically emerge about 90-120 days after planting, usually in the late summer or early autumn.Removal of the flowers for house display will not harm the plant, so enjoy bringing the scent into your home.


If the weather is turning cold and the plant has not yet flowers, transplant the tuberose to a large pot, and bring it to a warm location indoors. Remember, the pot must be well-draining, with a hole in the base and something beneath it to catch the water.
Keep in mind that the tuberose flowers are very fragrant. They will be at their peak of fragrance during the evening hours.

, The flowers will start to weigh the branches down when they start to bloom, so you may want to add some form of support. Place a trellis in the ground next to the plant or use a cage to help support the plant from all sides., Even if you don't bring flowers indoors, remove the withered flowers to encourage new growth. Do not remove any leaves until they are completely yellow.

, Once the foliage is yellow or brown, the plant is done growing for the year. Move on to the next section if you expect a cold winter, or simply leave it in the ground if you are located in USDA hardiness zones 8 or higher, and expect a typical winter.


Do not apply any fertilizer while the plant is not growing.

, If you are located in a USDA hardiness zone numbered 8 or higher, the tuberose will probably be fine if left in the ground year round. In zone 7, you may be able to insulate the soil with a thick layer of mulch, and remove it in spring.In any other zone, move the tuberose bulbs indoors.


Zone 8 corresponds with a minimum winter temperature of 10ºF (-12.2ºC). Zone 7 has a minimum winter temperature of 0ºF (-17.8ºC).

, The tuberose may survive one light frost, but it's best not to risk it. The first frost may come in autumn or winter, depending on your climate.

, Remove yellow leaves and cut the stem down to 4–6 inches (10–15cm) above the soil.Use a clean knife, preferably sterilized with rubbing alcohol to minimize chance of infection.

, Dig out a large clump of soil with the bulb inside, then brush off the soil to reveal the bulb. Dig slowly and carefully to avoid breaking the roots.

, Lay the bulbs on a screen in the sun for 24 hours to dry them out.If there is no sun, leave them in a dry area for several days instead. Do not attempt to speed this up by heating them.

, Use a cardboard box, tray, or any other container that can hold peat moss, sawdust, or vermiculite. Cover the tuberose with the material and store at about 50ºF (10ºC)., In most cases, the tuberose can be left alone the entire winter. However, if you notice the bulbs shriveling, lightly moisten the packing material once or twice during the winter. On the other hand, if roots appear, move to a dry location., Tuberose can be planted in the spring after being kept overwinter, and the new bulbs around the original will flower as normal.After several years of growth, a cluster may be too large for adequate flower growth. Separate the smaller bulbs and plant separately, but be aware that some newly separated bulbs may not grow in the first year., Get a one gallon pot that has drainage holes on the bottom of it. Fill the pot halfway full with moist potting soil. Then, set the rhizomes on top of soil and add enough soil until the rhizomes are about three inches below the rim of the pot. Add about two more inches of soil after that to top it off., Water the soil until water runs out of the bottom of the pot. After that, you will only need to water it when the top ½ inch of soil is dry Check it once every few days to see when it needs to be watered.

It is also a good idea to fill the tray that goes under the pot with gravel and pour water over it. Then, place the pot on top of the gravel. This will help to ensure that the plant gets plenty of humidity.

, It is important to place the tuberose somewhere that it will get sun exposure all day long and where it will warm.Try to keep your home at a constant temperature of 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Check around your house to find the ideal location., Dilute ½ teaspoon of soluble fertilizer—preferably a 5-10-10 mixture—in one gallon of water. Then, irrigate the plant with this solution every two weeks once the plant is actively growing., In the fall, you will need to remove the rhizomes from the pot. Break the smaller rhizomes off the larger ones, and then throw out the large one. Store the small ones in a cool, dark spot until spring, so that you can plant them again."

Make sure the plant gets enough water.",How to Grow Wisteria," When you're growing a plant from a seed, it can help to germinate the seed first, because this will increase the chances of it taking root in the ground.


Place the seeds in a small bowl and fill it with warm water. Let the seeds sit in the water for 24 hours.After 24 hours, drain the water. On each seed, use your nail to gently pick away a small portion of the seed covering.
Note that wisteria should be planted outdoors in the spring or fall, so make sure you start the germination process about six weeks before you want to transplant it outside.;
, Fill a seed starter most of the way with potting soil and place one or two wisteria seeds on top of the soil in each pod. Make sure the seeds are on their sides. Cover them with one-quarter inch of potting soil.Place the seed trays in a warm, bright room. Add some water to the soil, and keep it moist for the duration of the sprouting time.

, Keep the seeds warm and moist while they germinate, and give them lots of natural light. The seeds should sprout within 10 to 30 days.


Before you can transplant the sprouts, make sure they are at least four to five inches tall, and have a couple leaves on each stalk., A cutting is a root, leaf, shoot, or bud that gets trimmed off an established plant to propagate a new plant of the same kind. To do this, you will need an established wisteria plant to take the cutting from.If you don’t have an established plant to work with, ask friends or neighbors if they have a wisteria you can use.

, For wisteria, you want to cut off a new shoot that still has soft green wood and that hasn’t yet developed bark. Make sure the shoot has a few sets of leaves on it (a couple on the top and a couple on the bottom).With a pair of sharp scissors or gardening snips, cut the shoot near the base. Make sure the cutting you take is about six inches long.
You will have the highest chances of success if you do this at the end of spring or beginning of summer.

, Snip off any leaves that are at the bottom of the cutting, leaving ones at the top intact. Then, snip off the bottom of the cutting at a 45-degree angle so there's only one-half inch (127 mm) of stem below the bottom leaf node that you cut. This will give the new roots somewhere to grow from and allow them to establish.For the best results, dip the end of the cutting into a rooting hormone before planting it., Place some rocks in the bottom of a small gardening pot to help with drainage. Fill the pot with potting soil that’s specifically designed for good drainage—look for a soil with a high perlite or coarse sand concentration. Add some water so the soil is moist. Make a two-inch (5 cm) deep hole in the soil with your finger and place the cutting in so the leaves are sticking up.Replace the soil and cover the bottom of the cutting where the roots will grow.

, This will keep the soil moist and warm, and this will help the wisteria to take root. You can either wrap the entire pot in a plastic bag, or cover the top with a plastic bag or plastic wrap.Place the pot in an area where the plant will receive lots of indirect sunlight.

, When the soil becomes dry to the touch, add water so it’s always moist. After about four to eight weeks, the cutting should take root.Since it’s best to plant wisteria in spring or fall, don’t plant the wisteria as soon as it begins to take root. Wait until fall to transplant it outside, or continue growing the new plant inside in pots until the following spring.

, There are a few considerations when planting wisteria, including what the plant needs to survive and where it won’t cause damage. For instance:


The plant can grow quite large, so while it will grow nicely as a vine up a gazebo or pergola, this may not be a wise choice unless you're comfortable getting on a stepladder to prune the tree.
Similarly, because wisteria is a climbing vine, avoid planting it near your house or any buildings, as eventually the plant can grow underneath siding, or ruin shutters and frames.Because wisteria grows so quickly and so heartily, plant it away from other plants, otherwise the wisteria might choke them out.Wisteria needs lots of sunlight to grow and bloom, so choose an area where the plant will get full sun exposure. The soil type doesn’t matter so much, but wisteria does need good drainage., The hole should be the depth of the roots and two to three times wider than the width of the roots.


If you're planting more than one wisteria, make sure the holes are at least 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) apart., When the hole is ready, carefully remove the seedling from the starter pod by tipping it upside down with one hand and cupping the plant with the other.


When the roots slide out of the pod, gently place the plant roots down into the hole.
Add enough soil and compost to cover the roots, then water the plant. Allow the water to drain, then fill up the hole with soil and compost.Use your hands to press down the soil around the plant, and give it some more water., Mulch will help keep the soil around the plant moist, which is good for wisteria.


Each spring, add a layer of compost and a layer of mulch on top of the soil where the wisteria is., Wisteria is a heavy plant, and without the proper support, it will collapse under its own weight in the wind. You will need to provide support in the form of stakes if you didn’t plant your wisteria near to a wall or structure that will support it.


When the wisteria plant has established itself, insert a wooden stake six to 12 inches into the ground about one-half inch away from the stalk.
Using twine, attach the wisteria stalk to the stake every eight inches., This is especially important in the first year. Wisteria needs the equivalent of one inch of water each week, so if you aren't getting enough precipitation, you will need to water as well.


Even if you are getting enough rain, you should still give the wisteria a soaking once a week."

Don't cut back the foliage after flowering.,
Remove any withered, brown foliage.,
In the fall, give your bulbs a good feed with a water-soluble fertilizer.,
Provide narcissus bulbs with a layer of organic mulch.",How to Keep Narcissus Bulbs After Flowering1," It’s very important not to cut back the daffodil foliage after flowering.


This is because the plant uses its leaves to make energy from the sunlight, which it needs in order to survive the winter and flower again in the spring.
Foliage should not be cut for at least two or three months after flowering.;
, Instead of cutting back the foliage immediately after flowering, wait until it withers and dies away by itself. Then, once the withered foliage is brown and shriveled, you can remove it by pulling or cutting.

, It is important to feed the bulbs at this time of year specifically, as this is when the roots are most actively growing.

, It’s also a good idea to give your bulbs an annual top dressing of organic mulch.


Do this before the ground gets cold, ideally in the summer or fall.
Three to four inches of well-rotted manure or leaf mold will work well.

Fertilize container-planted narcissus with bone meal.,
Allow the flowers to fade and avoid watering.,
Care for the narcissus through the fall and winter.,
Consider planting the spent narcissus bulbs outdoors.",How to Keep Narcissus Bulbs After Flowering2," Daffodils that have been planted in containers need a bit more attention than ground-planted ones. After flowering ends, top dress your container with a fertilizer such as bone meal.


Bone meal can be quite stinky, so you may prefer to keep the container outside for a day or two afterwards.

, If you intend to keep your bulbs in the same container until the following year, give the flowers time to fade completely - usually about two months. At this point, the foliage should have begun to die away.


Once the flowers are gone, turn the container on its side for about 3 months and avoid watering it.

, Turn the container right-way up again in the fall and give it a good watering. This watering is necessary for the bulbs to flower again the next spring.


Daffodils prefer an acidic soil, so to counter the alkaline effects of tap water you can add a little Ironite (a mineral supplement) to the water. Alternately water them with rainwater.






If you live in an area with severe winters, bring your containers inside in the winter as the narcissus bulbs will not fare as well in pots during freezing conditions.

, Daffodils will survive for up to 3 years in a container, but the flowers will never be as good after the first year.


For best results, plant the spent bulbs outside after the foliage dies back and replant your container with fresh bulbs and fresh compost for the following flowering season.
The method for transplanting spent narcissus bulbs from a container to the ground is outlined in the section below.

"

Move narcissus outdoors in the summer.,
Find a sunny patch in the garden with good drainage.,
Add some organic material to the soil.,
To plant each bulb, dig a hole three times as deep as the bulb is wide.,
Fill the hole with soil and water well.",How to Keep Narcissus Bulbs After Flowering3," Indoor or container-planted daffodils can be moved outside for planting in the ground after flowering. The best time to do this is after they flower and when the foliage has died back. This will typically be in the summer.

, As sunny patch is necessary, as the daffodils require sunlight to grow. Well-draining soil is necessary because narcissus bulbs rot easily in wet ground. Also remember to weed the area where you’ll be planting.

, Incorporate plenty of compost or organic matter (such as well-rotted horse manure) into the soil before planting. If you aren't sure how much to use, cover your soil with the organic matter to a depth of 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm), then dig it into the ground to a spade’s depth.

, That’s approximately 6 inches (15.2 cm) of depth for a 2 inch (5.1 cm) bulb. It’s good to add a trowel full of compost to the bottom of the hole for the bulb to sit on. Put the bulb in the hole with the pointed end facing upwards.

, You might like to top-dress with a layer of fertilizer or mulch. Narcissus bulbs that have been relocated to the ground should flower again the following spring.

Divide and transplant narcissus bulbs every 7 to 10 years.,
Wait until the growing season is over before you begin transplanting.,
Use a garden spade to dig up the bulbs.,
Gently separate the narcissus bulbs with your hands.,
Replant the separated bulbs as quickly as possible.",How to Keep Narcissus Bulbs After Flowering4," After a few years, daffodils can multiply into thick clumps and get a bit too crowded. This occurs when the original, single bulb multiplies into a clump of several conjoined bulbs by producing offspring known as ‘offsets’.


This can result in fewer and smaller blooms, so it’s a good idea to thin and spread this clump out by transplanting and dividing the narcissus bulbs.
Dividing the bulbs also means that you can spread your daffodils over a larger area. You will need to do this every 7-10 years to get the best out of your daffodil patch.

, The best time to transplant your daffodils is in the early summer, when the growing season has ended and the flowers' foliage withers away and turns yellow or brown.


If you leave it much later in the year, you may not be able to find your daffodils as the plant will be dormant and any visible signs of life will be hidden below the ground.






As a result, it's important to take action while there’s still some of the plant visible above ground.

, As you dig, you'll need to be very careful in order to avoid damaging the bulbs. You’ll also need to dig quite a distance from the plant in order to avoid slicing through it accidentally.


Bulbs are usually planted pretty deep, and over time daffodil bulbs can wriggle even lower into the soil, so expect to dig pretty deep – maybe a spade’s depth.

, Once you locate the bulb, gently part it from the earth as carefully as possible, trying not to damage any roots. Gently separate the bulb clumps by twisting and pulling them apart with your fingers.


Keep as many of the divided bulbs (also known as offsets) as you want to replant. Be aware that the very smallest offsets may not flower within a year.






Discard any bulbs that are damaged, mushy or show any signs of rot.

, It’s best to replant the bulbs as quickly as possibly, however they should survive for a few weeks above ground if the delay is unavoidable.


Store any bulbs you aren't planting immediately in a cool, dry place. One ideal way to store them is in a paper bag in a dark corner of a garden shed.

Place the next layer of bulbs in between each bulb from the lower layer.,
Cover with soil.",How to Grow Tulips in Pots," Avoid giant variations, like Dutch hybrids, unless you have an abnormally large container. For a standard foot-high pot, go with a variety that grows 12 to 14 inches (30 to 35 cm) tall. For smaller pots, consider a variety that grows no taller than 10 inches (25 cm) high.;
, Bulbs need to be kept cold and dormant for several months in order to grow during warmer spring months. Pot the bulbs shortly after you obtain them, if possible.

, Tulips do not grow well when the bulbs are drenched, so your pot must have drainage holes in the bottom to drain excess water.

, Doing so will help keep water away from the bulbs.

, You should fill the pot about halfway with soil, and the soil should be loosely packed. Use potting soil instead of dirt from your garden, since potting soil has less bacteria in it and contains more nutrients to help your flowers grow. A blend especially designed for tulips will work best.

, This step is optional, but it provides another means of drainage and may help prevent your bulbs from getting waterlogged.

, Keep the pointed end up. You do not need to worry too much about how close together the bulbs are since each bulb only produces one stalk, but for aesthetic purposes, you may wish to place the bulbs anywhere from 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm) apart from one another.

, You should leave approximately one inch between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.

, Once the dormant period has passed, place your potted bulbs in a warm, sunny spot. Tulips do best with full sun, so place them near a window or in a sunny location on your balcony or patio.

, The soil should be moist but never drenched. Fully saturated soil may cause your bulbs to rot.

, Also remove the leaves as they start to die off, but allow the rest of the plant to die back before removing. This allows the bulb to collect and store energy for next year's flower.

, A combination of tulips that grow to varying heights works especially well.

, Anything shallower than that will not provide adequate depth for multiple layers.

, The layer should be 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) deep.

, Use a potting soil designed for bulb plants for best results.

, The pointed end should face upward. Leave at least a bulb-sized gap in between the bulbs.

, Cover most of the bulbs, but leave enough uncovered to see where each bulb is located. Pack the soil down firmly.

, Each bulb of the top layer should rest between the necks of the bulbs from the lower layer.

, Leave an inch of space in between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.

Look for a sunny, boggy spot to plant your hibiscus.,
Prepare the soil where you will be planting your hibiscus.,
Dig a hole for your hibiscus plant.,
Consider growing a swamp hibiscus from seed.,
Put your seeds in the ground.,
Grow your hibiscus from a cutting if you do not want to purchase the plant or seed.",How to Grow Swamp Hibiscus1," Swamp Hibiscus is a tall perennial that favors a sunny spot with lots of water. Unlike many plants, it prefers a boggy spot where water collects. If you have a marshy patch in your garden that gets plenty of sun, consider planting your swamp hibiscus there. Swamp Hibiscus prefers a mildly acidic soil but this isn’t critical. The main thing is to provide the plant with plenty of boggy soil.In hotter areas this plant will tolerate partial shade for some of the day but generally favors sunny spots.
This plant will also do well next to a pond or stream.;
, Incorporate some well-rotted manure or other organic matter such as compost into the ground ahead of planting. Mix up the soil and organic matter to provide the plant with the nutrient it will need to grow.


Swamp Hibiscus can grow up to nine feet in height, so long as the soil is rich.

, Dig a hole twice the size of the pot that the hibiscus came in. Put the plant in the hole and fill the hole with soil. Water the plant and soil around the hole to help settle the soil and remove air bubbles.


Continue to water the plant so that the soil remains soggy.

, Swamp Hibiscus can be grown from seed if you do not want to purchase a potted plant to put in your garden. If you are harvesting seed yourself, do so in the late spring when the pods are hard and dry. You’ll need to break them open to collect the seed. Seeds need to be scraped with sandpaper or a nail file to get them to germinate.


Alternately, try making a tiny cut with a sharp knife or prick with a pin. Soak the seeds in warm water for an hour, then dry them on a paper towel. Plant them as soon as the last frosts are over.

, You can plant the seeds directly into the ground, or you can start their growth in a pot. Plant the seeds a quarter of an inch down in the soil and cover them up. Mist the surface with water.


If you are using a pot, cover the pot with a clear plastic bag or plastic wrap and put it in a sunny place such as a south-facing windowsill. Germination, or when the sprouts begin to show, takes about two weeks. Keep the soil moist until germination and continue to water it every day for a few months until it is established. Because swamp hibiscus is a rapid growing plant, your will generally get blooms within the first year.

, To take a cutting, select a healthy stem about a quarter inch wide and cut off the top 6 inches (15.2 cm). Remove the lower leaves and dip the cut end into rooting hormone. Fill a pot with a good cutting compost. Make a hole that is at least two inches deep and plant the cut in the hole. Keep the soil moist and put the plant in an area that is bright but does not get direct sunlight.


You can also use a sand and compost mix.
Roots should set after a few months, at which point the new plant can be planted outside.

Prune your ‘leggy’ swamp hibiscus.,
Remove withered flower heads.,
Cut the plant back at the end of the flowering season.,
Put a stake next to your plant if the hibiscus is leaning too much.,
Feed your plant during the growing season.,
Reduce the amount that you water your plant as the plant gets more established.,
Apply mulch to the area when the growing season is over.,
Divide your swamp hibiscus every decade or so.",How to Grow Swamp Hibiscus2," Swamp Hibiscus can grow a bit too leggy and look straggly. Pruning and pinching can promote bushier growth and flower production. Once the plant gets to be about two feet in height, pinch off the growing tips so that the plant height is cut in half to about one foot.


When flowering starts, you should pinch off the dead flowers. This will be covered in the next step.

, Each flower of the swamp hibiscus will generally only last for one day. Try to remove dead flower heads every few days to help your plant produce the most flowers it possibly can. Doing this will keep seeds from forming, rather than flowers.


If you want to collect hibiscus seeds later in the year, leave a small number of dead flower heads on the plant so that the seed pods can eventually form. They will need to mature and turn brown on the plant before the seeds can be harvested.

, Cutting the plant back will help the plant to continue flowering into the fall. Right at the end of winter, cut the whole plant right back to the ground. The remaining stalks will be woody. Next year’s growth will emerge on fresh shoots so it is fine to remove the old ones around December.


Make sure to use a sharp blade to cut the plant back. Pruning shears work well.

, You can stake the plant if it is leaning too much. To do this, use a sturdy garden cane. Drive the stake deep into the soil and loosely tie the plant to it using string or garden ties.Don’t tie the plant too tightly against it and try to allow for some movement on a windy day. Swamp Hibiscus can also get support from a tree, post or fence.

, A swamp hibiscus generally does most of its growing in the spring, summer, and fall. You can use a general all-purpose garden fertilizer.


Try to use a water-soluble fertilizer along with your regular watering schedule.

, More established plants won’t need as much watering as younger plants do. However, you should still check your plant regularly; if you notice that the soil is getting dry, water your plant right away.


It is particularly important to keep an eye on the soil in dry seasons. Swamp hibiscuses do not do well without boggy soil.

, At the end of the growing season, apply mulch to the area so that it covers the base of the plant. This will help to protect the plant in the winter and stop weeds from growing.


Well-rotted manure or leaf mold are suitable mulches.

, Many gardeners like to divide these plants at the roots every decade or so. This is a good way to get more plants and share with neighbours. Divide plants in the late winter when the plant is dormant. The new root crown should be planted about three inches below the soil surface.

If you pick them out yourself, look for bulbs that are firm to the touch and do not have defects such as mold, bruises or cuts. The bulbs should be light brown in color and covered in a papery, onion-like skin.
In terms of quantity, each bulb will produce between one and four stems and blossoms, so plan accordingly.
Choose bulbs based on the variety name for a more uniform look and growing pattern. Tulip bulbs labeled by color -- for example ""yellow tulips"" -- are often an assortment of species of tulips in that color.
Plan on planting the tulip bulbs within a week of buying, as the bulbs are not designed to stay above ground for long.;
, Tulip bulbs should be planted in late fall, before the first winter frost. The bulbs will then lie dormant throughout the winter months, before growing and blossoming come springtime. The precise planting time will depend on your local climate.


Chill the bulbs before planting them if you live in an area where winter temperatures rarely get below freezing. Put the bulbs in a closed brown paper bag and place the bag in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 weeks. You can also purchase tulip bulbs that are ""pre-cooled."" Be sure to purchase from a reputable supplier who has kept the bulbs chilled in storage.
Plant the bulbs without chilling them first if your area has cold winters with freezing temperatures. Hold off planting until soil temperatures measured at a depth of 6 inches (15 cm), fall below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12 C).

, Choose an area that receives the right amount of sun for the tulip variety you are growing. Bulbs need to be planted between 4 and 6 inches apart, so choose an appropriately sized plot.


Most tulips do best with full sun, or at least 6 hours of sun each day. Some varieties will also grow in partial or full shade.
Many people choose to plant tulips along fences, walls, walkways and buildings, as they provide a pleasant burst of color and it is easy to control their growing pattern.
If you wish to plant tulips in a pot, see this article for more detailed instructions..

, Till the soil to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) and amend it by adding sand or stones, if necessary.


Tulips need good drainage -- wet soil can cause fungus, disease and even rotting. It can also suffocate the bulbs due to its low oxygen content. Therefore, it is recommended that you plant tulips in raised beds in very wet areas.
Make the soil as light and airy as possible by adding compost and coarse sand. Also be sure to remove any weeds.

, Plant the tulip bulbs 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) deep, measuring from the base of the bulb. Remember -- the larger the bulb, the deeper the hole.


Standard tulip planting depth is 6 inches (15 cm); but if you live in an area with a mild winter, planting the bulbs to a depth of 8 inches (20 cm) helps to keep them cooler.
Place the bulb into the hole, pointed end facing up. Fill the hole with soil and push down on the surface to firm it up.
Space tulip bulbs 5 inches (12 cm) apart. To create a tulip bed, use use 5 bulbs for 1 square foot (90 square cm) of area. Plant all tulips in the bed to the same depth to ensure they all bloom together.

, If mice and other rodents are a problem in your area, place a deterrent such as holly leaves, kitty litter or gravel into the planting hole. If your rodent problem is very severe, you may need to place the bulbs in a wire cage for protection.

, Do not water again until the plant leaves start growing. Although tulip bulbs usually dislike excess moisture, this initial watering is necessary to trigger growth.

, In areas with mild winters, lay the mulch as soon as you are done planting. If you live in an area with cold winters, wait 3 to 4 weeks after planting before mulching to allow the roots to grow a little before the ground freezes.

, Leave the tulips to their own devices over the winter months -- no need to water or fertilize them. Come springtime, the tulips will bloom in a show-stopping display of color.


Tulips are naturally a perennial plant, meaning that they come back year after year. However, in most of Northern America, climate and soil conditions prevent tulip bulbs from re-flowering, so they are grown as an annual.
If you do live in a location that allows tulips to be grown as a perennial (ideally somewhere with dry summers and cold winters), read the following instructions.

, Once the tulips start growing, you can start watering them to prevent the soil from drying out. Do not soak the soil, however, as this could damage the bulb.


Continue watering the plants even after they finish flowering. The tulips are still growing next year's bulbs underground. Allow the leaves and greenery to stay on the plant until they wither and die off on their own.
Stop watering the bulbs after all the leaves are gone and let the ground dry out. The plant is no longer nourishing the bulbs, and tulips need a dry period during the summer months.

, Deadhead the tulips after the first three weeks of bloom, before the petals fall off. Falling petals that get caught in the foliage of tulips cause the plant to mold and die off before it has time to nourish the new bulbs growing underground.

, If you intend to grow tulips as a perennial, they should be fertilized upon planting in the fall (and every fall thereafter) with a low-nitrogen fertilizer such as well-rotted cow manure or a special bulb fertilizer.


If you forget to fertilize in the fall, you can also fertilize in late winter/early spring, once the first green shoots appear. Use a high nitrogen, fast-release fertilizer for best results., To make cut tulips last longer in a vase, cut the stems diagonally, then wrap the upper two thirds of the flower in a newspaper funnel.


Leave the tulips to sit in cool water for an hour or two, then remove the newspaper and re-cut the stems.The tulips should stay fresh for a week.

Rocket series: this produces three-foot tall plants with flowers in red, pink, yellow, purple and white.
Sonnet series: One and a half-foot tall plants in red, yellow, pink, purple and white.
Liberty series: Two-foot tall plants in red, yellow, pink, purple, white, and several more variations.;
, Snapdragons are easiest to grow from seed indoors in early spring. Prepare seedling pots with seed substrate (rather than regular potting soil). Scatter the seeds on the surface of the substrate and press lightly. Keep them in a warm, sunny window. Make sure to keep the substrate evenly moist.


If you don't want to bother starting the seeds indoors, you can plant them outdoors in late fall. Press them into the prepared garden bed. With some luck, they'll come up in early spring.
If you wish, you can completely skip this step and simply buy snapdragon seedlings from the nursery.

, Spend the six to eight weeks before the last frost keeping the seedlings well-watered and warm. When the seeds germinate and the seedlings sprout and grow leaves, the seedlings are strong enough to transplant outdoors.


Keep them at a steady temperature between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
The seedlings will take 10 to 14 days to sprout.

, Pinching off the tip of the stems encourages more flowers to grow. You can do this with store-bought seedlings, too. Just make sure the seedlings have six leaves before pinching; otherwise, the plants may not yet be strong enough to withstand pinching.

, Snapdragons grow best in the cool temperatures of early spring, so you'll need to prepare the planting bed before the last frost of the year. They need full sun, and grow well in most types of neutral soil with a pH between 6.2 and 7. Amend the soil with organic matter, such as composted leaves, so the snapdragons will produce long-lasting flowers.To work organic matter into the soil, till the soil to a depth of six inches, apply six inches of organic matter, and mix.
Make sure the soil drains well. Adding organic matter will help with drainage. Water poured into the planting bed should soak in right away. If it stands in a puddle, mix in more organic matter.

, Snapdragons can withstand a frost or two, so the timing doesn't have to be exact. Space them six or so inches apart, depending on the variety you're planting. Water the planting bed well upon planting.

, Overwatering will cause mold to grow on the plant, so wait until the soil feels a little dry before watering your snapdragons. When you water, water near the crown of the plants, rather than watering from overhead.The pressure from overhead watering can damage the flowers, so it's best to water closer to the roots.
Water in the morning, rather than at night, so the water has time to be fully absorbed before nightfall. If water sits around the plants overnight, they could begin to rot.

, When you see flowers that have already bloomed begin to wilt, pinch them off the snapdragon stems. This will encourage more flowers to bloom and keep the plants healthy.

, Use an organic mulch to cover the area around the snapdragons' roots. This will keep the root systems cool as the weather begins to get hot, and should help your snapdragons last longer before they begin to die off in the summer heat.

, As the plants mature, seed pods will form near the base of the stalks. Attach a brown lunch bag over the pods and let them naturally drop into the bags. You can dry out the seeds and plant them next year.


As an alternative, you can let the seeds drop into the soil instead of catching and saving them. If you live in the right environment, snapdragons will self-seed.If you don't want to worry about the seeds, consider cutting the snapdragons at the height of their bloom, before they fade in the summer heat.

Lightly cover the seeds with soil.,
Keep the seeds watered.,
Sow additional seeds in the early to mid fall.These plants tend to wither in the hot summer months, but since they are quick to flower from seed, you can sow additional seeds in the fall and see more flowers emerge before the winter freeze.

",How to Grow Stock Flowers1," The plants prefer full sun, but a garden bed with partial sun can work in a pinch. Do not prepare a garden bed in heavy shade., Begin in early April and sow seeds every two weeks through April and May. By sowing your seeds in rounds like this, you can enjoy the color and scent of these flowers longer than you would with a single early sowing.

, Ideally, the soil should be amended from the last season. If not, however, you can still amend it now by chopping it up with a rake or garden fork and adding a slow-release granular fertilizer, as well as a well-rotted compost.


If you have dense, compact soil, you may also wish to consider mixing in a little garden sand. Coarse garden sand improves the soil's ability to drain.

, As you rake it up, you should remove any weeds and large stones. Smaller pebbles should not cause any damage, but large stones can present obstacles for developing roots, and weeds can compete with your stock flowers for valuable nutrition.

,, The rows should be about 7 to 12 inches (18 to 30 cm) apart.

, Thinly sprinkle the seeds over the sandy line, keeping them on the line or as close to the line as possible. By sowing the seeds in organized lines, you will have an easier time sowing additional rows of seeds later in the season.

, You can either sprinkle it over by hand or by using a rake. You only need to use about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) of light soil.

, Use a garden hose or watering can to apply a fine mist or gentle spray of water to the seeds to moisten the soil without washing the seeds away.

Look for a container depth similar to a one gallon container, which will give the lilies enough room to establish a solid root system. Look for numerous drainage holes in the bottom to keep the water moist but not overly damp.Placing a few inches of small stones in the base of your planter will keep it from tipping over and aid in drainage.;
, Lilies do well alongside other plants, especially if these companions are of the low-lying variety and do not block out the light. Ground cover plants will retain moisture in the soil and actually keep the lily’s bulbs well hydrated. Make sure to keep a minimum of 2 inches (5 cm) between each lily bulb and other plants.Before you plant the bulbs, make sure that the soil in the bed properly drains. Look at the area after a rainfall and see if you notice any super dry areas or spots with standing water., Aim for your lilies to get at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. It is fine if the area is shady in the morning and then transitions to full sunlight by noon. If your lilies are starved for sunlight, they might fall towards the ground or die out.Some say that lilies grow best when the soil at their base is shady and their stems and flowers reach into the sunlight., This will gives your bulbs a bit of time to get established before they are tested by the extreme temperatures of winter or summer. If you plant in the spring, it is possible that your lilies will produce blooms almost right away.If you’ve purchased frozen bulbs from a nursery, set them out for a few hours before planting. This will allow them to thaw out, making temperature shock less likely.Lily seeds can be grown indoors at any time of the year, as long as you use a lighting system. But, they will require that you keep the temperature between 65-70 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 21 degrees Celsius) during the growing period., Get a trowel to break up the soil at least 12-15 inches (30.5 to 38 cm) in the planting area. Another method is to dig into the soil with your hands, while breaking up any large chunks. Then, sift your hands through the area to make sure that it is broken apart enough. If you are working in a garden space, pull out any weeds or other plants so that each bulb has at least two inches or protected surface area., If the hole is too shallow, then the bulb may gradually become exposed on the surface and rot. The extra inches of soil protect the bulbs from lower temperatures, too. Each hole should be spaced at least two inches (5 cm) apart, although more room is even better. If you have a large number of bulbs to place, before you begin digging, take out a piece of paper and create a rough sketch of where you want to place each one. Lilies often look great when you group them into bundles of three to five., Pull out any rocks or hard clumps from the walls or bottoms of the holes. These obstacles can block the lilies from fully growing. Generally speaking, the soil surrounding the hole should be loosely packed, as this will make it easier for the bulbs to take root.

, Hold the bulb steady and lower it slowly into the soil. The pointy end of the bulb should be facing upwards. Once the bulb is down, fill the areas surrounding it with extra loose soil. Add dirt until the hole and bulb are fully covered and even with the ground., Choose a high-potassium fertilizer and apply it directly after planting. Liquid fertilizers are quite easy to use and come premixed or with instructions on how you can attach the container directly to your garden hose. Make sure to apply the fertilizer equally and repeat this process every two weeks until six weeks post-flowering.Be aware that other people choose to add no fertilizer at all and have good results, too. It really depends on the quality of your soil., Once you’ve fertilized, protect the bulbs even more by adding a few inches of mulch on top of the soil. This mulch will fight against freezing and, if it is cedar, scare away some bugs, too., Before you water, touch your fingers to the soil and gauge how wet it feels. If the soil is dry, water until the soil feels wet to the touch without water pooling on the surface. If the soil is moist, then it is okay as is. Sopping wet soil is a sign of overwatering or too much rain exposure.Too much water can contribute to bulb rot and make your plant more vulnerable to predators, such as slugs.

, Some stargazer lilies can grow upwards of four feet tall. This is a sign of good plant health, but it can also lead to drooping and breaking. To protect your lilies from storms and the like, attach each plant to an individual bamboo stake. Use raffia for the ties.For a less expensive natural look, create stakes out of sticks gathered in your yard.

, Creating an ideal natural environment for your lilies can help to keep them healthy. But, you will also need to be on the watch for animals chewing on your plants or insects, such as snails, taking up residence. Adding wire fence protection and picking off any bugs that you see will help.If you spot aphids on the stems or flowers, spray them off with water., If you spot aged flowers on your lilies, go through and cut them off at the stem with a pair of sharp gardening shears. This will keep your plants from using energy on blooms that are clearly dying. Leave the leaves alone and they will turn brown and fall off on their own. On established plants, in the late fall, trim the stalk (also called the stem) down to just above the ground.Since stargazer lilies are perennial, you can expect them to resurface and regrow each year. You may even notice the blooms growing in size each season., It may be tempting to trim off a few of the flowers for an arrangement. This is a great idea, but cut the blooms off in the morning when they are the most fresh. To keep the pollen from staining your clothes, make a few snips at the flower’s center to remove the stamens.Most lily arrangements will last up to two weeks when placed in a container with regular water changes."
"
Keep the soil moist.,
Remove weeds as soon as you see them.,
Deadhead the flowers throughout the season.,
Apply insecticides and pesticides only as necessary.",How to Grow Stock Flowers2," The flowers can tolerate slightly dry conditions, but once the soil becomes dry to a depth of 2 inches (5 cm), the flowers likely need another watering. During dry periods, the soil should be lightly watered once or twice a week. If you get rain at least once a week, however, additional watering may not be necessary.


Avoid drenching stock flowers. Sopping wet soil leads to soggy roots, and soggy roots lead to unhappy and unhealthy stocks.

, Weeds compete for nutrients, and too many weeds can cause your stock flowers to wither. Yank the weeds up, removing them in their entirety, roots and all. Doing so rids the plant bed of weeds more effectively than merely snipping them off at surface level does.


Alternatively, you can apply a light layer of mulch around flowers to help suffocate below-ground weeds before they have the chance to sprout., As the weather warms, the blossoms will begin to wilt. Snip the flowers off just below the head to prevent them from going to seed. Deadheading the flowers also encourages more blossoms to grow before the plant dies off in the heat of the summer.

, Moths are occasionally attracted to stock flowers, but otherwise, the plants are not especially prone to pest problems.

;
, The plant thrives in either location. Just be sure to have well-drained soil.

, The butterfly iris is fine with full sun or part-shade, so it can be located in most areas of the garden.

, However, the butterfly iris is able to tolerate both lots of rain and dryness.

,, The case will appear long and like a cylinder. Removing the pods encourages more flowering. It also prevents spread of the iris if you don't want it to grow beyond its current location.

Avoid petunia diseases.",How to Grow Petunias," Although there are hundreds of named petunias, they tend to fall into four basic categories, which are determined by flower size and growth habit. Some of these types of petunias work better being grown in a container, while some are better suited to the garden.Grandiflora have the largest flowers and are the most commonly-used type of petunia. Some have single blooms while others are doubles and are available in both upright and cascading varieties.
Multiflora petunias have smaller flowers but have masses of blooms and provide big splashes of color.
Milliflora grow close to the ground and have small flowers. They are easy to control and thus work well as an edging plant.
Ground cover petunias spread and trail along the ground, from window boxes, and cover large areas quickly. This type will need more frequent watering.;
, After you've chosen the type of petunia you want, you'll need to pick the petunias themselves. There are some things that you should look for in terms of the best bedding plants.


Choose plants with healthy leaves and visible fresh growth. Contrary to popular belief, plants with the most flowers on them are not the ones you should pick. Instead, pick plants that have a few flowers and lots of bushy growth.
Pick petunia plants for bedding that are compact (not tall and leggy) because these will thrive better.

, All types of petunias need at least five to six hours of full sunlight per day, although they can tolerate some shade. The soil needs to be well-drained, although it doesn't have to be particularly nutrient-rich.


Petunias work well in containers, as well as planted in the garden. However, if you're going to plant them in a container you will want to make sure that you use a soil-less mix (a soil-less mix is composed of things like peat moss, composted pine bark, or coir, as well as inorganic components like sand)., Make sure to dig the soil so that it is nice and loose (allowing for better drainage). You want to both condition the soil and fertilize it to make it ready for petunias. If you're planting in the garden, condition the soil with organic matter like baled peat moss, leaf compost, or well-rotted manure. You'll need to spread this organic matter about two to three inches (5.1-7.6 cm) thick.


Incorporate the organic matter into the soil by using a garden fork to about the depth of eight to ten inches. This can help break up heavy clay soil, allowing for better water drainage or increase the ability of sandy soil to hold nutrients and moisture.
Fertilize your soil by using a balanced fertilizer (like 8-8-8, 10-10-10, or 12-12-12) into your garden's soil. You'll want to do this at the rate of about two pounds per hundred square feet. When the season changes (early to mid-July) you'll want to give liquid fertilizer that's meant specially for flowering plants a try, at about every three weeks (although, weekly for spreading petunias).
Now, if you're using a window box, or container, you'll need to mix timed-release fertilizer into the soil.

, Most petunia varieties require at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) between plants in full sunlight. If you have to use a shadier location, then go for several inches closer together (around 10 in or 25.4 cm). There are some exceptions to this rule to keep in mind.


Milliflora petunias can be placed closer together than the other types with as little as four to six inches (10.2-15.2 cm) between them.
Spreading (or “wave”) petunias, on the other hand, should really be spaced as much as one and a half feet (0.45 m) apart.

, You want to begin bedding the plants in early spring to help acclimatize them to the outdoors. If you're planting them in the ground you should make sure to wait until after the danger of frost as past (or you can cover them at night to protect them from frost).You want the soil temperature to be about 60 degrees F (15.5 degrees C). Colder than that and the petunia won't flourish.
If it is really hot, make sure to provide some shade for the petunias. Although they love and thrive on lots of sun, too much can have an adverse effect on them.

, Petunias aren't exactly easy to grow from seedlings, but it can definitely be done and it usually means that you can cultivate more petunias for cheaper! Start your seedlings 10 to 12 weeks before you plan to plant them (early spring, is recommended, such as March in the northern climates).


Try to get pelleted seeds, because these are easier to handle, especially for inexperienced gardeners. Petunia seeds can be difficult to handle, because of their size, so make sure you take that into consideration.

, Petunia seeds require specific conditions in which to sprout. They need somewhere warm and bright (about 70 to 85 degrees F or 21.1 to 29.4 degrees C) indoors, because they cannot yet handle being outside yet.


Spread the tiny seeds on top of fresh damp potting soil or sphagnum moss. Make sure that you spread them sparingly, so they don't crowd one another out as they are trying to grow.
Press them into the potting material gently or water with a fine mist to wash them into the potting soil.
Cover with clear plastic wrap and store in a bright warm spot away from direct sunlight until they begin to sprout (which usually happens seven to ten days after planting).

, When the seedlings begin to sprout you will want to remove the plastic film. Move to bright, cool spot after sprouting. This usually takes place about seven to ten days after you plant the petunia seeds.


Move them to a brighter, cooler spot after they have sprouted. The best temperatures are 64 degree F (17.8 degrees C) days, with the temperature at night ranging from 55-65 degrees F (12.8-18.3 degrees C).
Water your petunias gently every few days.

, You will want the petunias to be at least four to six inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) beneath the light fixture. Make sure that you put a timer on the lights so that they are lit between 16 and 18 hours each day.


Raise the lights as the seedlings grow, so that there is always that four to six inch space between the petunias and the lights.
You don't particularly need to get an expensive light fixture that is especial to growing plants. Ordinary fluorescent light tubes work just fine.
Make sure that the plants are directly beneath the lights (unlike before they sprouted when you want the seeds away from direct sunlight).

, You'll know it's time to transplant the seedlings when they have three true leaves each. Then it's time to put them in their own individual peat pots or packs that hold several plants each.


Feed them diluted liquid fertilizer until frost danger is past and you can plant outdoors.
Be sure to plant in moderately fertile well-drained soil.

, You'll do this by putting the young petunias outside on days that are sunny and warm. When it cools down for the night, bring them back inside, so that they stay warm.


After doing this for several days you can plant them outdoors permanently. It’s best to transplant on cloudy days because the hot sun can make transplant shock worse

, Depending on the type of petunia you'll need to do some deadheading and some pinching to encourage new growths and flowering side shoots. This will encourage more flowers.


For grandifloras and multifloras, when they reach about six inches (15.2 cm) tall, pinch them back so that you encourage the rapid formation of their flowering side shoots.
Avoid pinching millifloras or ""spreading"" petunias.
Maintain constant blooming of your petunias during the season by pinching off faded blooms (deadheading). Remove the entire flower structure, including the stem, down to the next “node” (or bump) of leaves.
Multifloras won't need deadheading. Trim the plant by a third if it becomes too scraggly and isn't blooming well to encourage new growth and vigor.

, You want to make sure that your petunia is healthy without over-fertilizing it. If the foliage of the petunia is looking healthy and vigorous, but the petunia isn't blooming, or isn't blooming well, you need to reduce the amount of fertilizer.


A good idea is to fertilize your plants monthly, because this will ensure good growth without over-fertilizing.
Double-flowered cultivars, however, should have a biweekly dose of fertilizer.

, Most petunia types are fairly easy-going when it comes to water. So a thorough watering about once a week should be good enough, unless the weather is incredibly dry. You want to soak to about a depth of six to eight inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) each time to you water.


Spreading types of petunias do need to be watered more frequently (more than once a week).
Petunias in containers also need more watering depending on their size and the volume of the soil that they contain. Often petunias in containers need to be watered as much as once as day.
A good rule of thumb is to allow at least one inch of soil on the top to dry before you water them again.

, You will see signs of aphids and caterpillars, pests that can destroy your petunias. You will want to get rid of them so that the petunias will keep thriving.


If you see that you have aphids make sure to get rid of them by spraying the petunias with a strong blast of water. Keep doing this until the aphids are gone.
Watch for small black droppings and holes in leaves and buds which may indicate caterpillars are after your petunias. Treat with environmentally friendly insecticide.

, Sometimes the new flowers will wilt before they actually bloom. When this happens it's because you aren't watering them evenly. Allow the soil to dry out and water thoroughly.Make sure that you're watering at the base of the plant and not on the plant itself.

, There isn't a whole lot that you can do about diseases like soft rot and mold. However, if you live in a rainy area, you might try planting the rain-resistant multiflora, rather than one of the other petunia kinds.


It's super important that you don't over-water. This can lead to problems with soft rot and mold.

If you're in a place where the temperature dips to freezing temperatures during the winter, you're better off keeping it in the pot as a houseplant. Poinsettia are native to Mexico, and they need a warm climate to thrive., If you bought the poinsettia during the winter as a decoration, keep the plant in the pot until spring, even if you live in a place with mild winters. it needs to stay potted until the weather gets warm enough to transplant it. Water it occasionally until spring.


At the beginning of spring, in March or April, cut the poinsettia back to about 8 inches. This will encourage it to begin a new growing cycle and get it ready for transplanting.
Keep it watered and fertilize it once a month or so until early summer, when it's time for transplanting.

, Look for a place where the poinsettia will get morning sun as well as light or partial shade during the heat of the afternoon. Till the soil and loosen it to a depth of 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm). Enrich the soil by adding organic compost if necessary. Poinsettias prefer rich, well-drained soil.

, Dig a hole as wide as the poinsettia's root ball and plant the poinsettia. Pat soil gently around the base of the stem. Mulch the area around the base of the plant with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) of organic mulch. This keeps the soil cool and helps it retain moisture.

, You can apply a 12-12-12 or 20-20-20 compound at the start of the growing season or fertilize the plant with compost. If your soil is not very rich, you may need to fertilize the plants once a month.

, Water the plant at the base whenever the soil around the plant feels dry to the touch. Avoid overhead watering, which could cause fungal disease to form on the leaves of the plant., Pinch small growing shoots from poinsettias occasionally throughout the growing season to encourage the plants to flower. You can discard the shoots or use them to propagate new plants. Cut back old growth in late fall or early winter to encourage strong new growth the following spring., You can take 8 inch (20 cm) cuttings from the soft growing tips of poinsettia stems or 18 inch (45 cm) cuttings from the woody stems of the plant to create new poinsettia.


Dip the ends of each cutting into a rooting hormone, then insert it into a pot filled with potting soil or a vermiculite mix.
Keep the soil in the pot moist, but not wet, for several weeks while the cuttings make roots.

, Add fresh mulch around the base of the plant to keep the soil warm for the winter months. Poinsettia can winter over in areas where soil temperatures do not fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius). Dig the plants up and bring them indoors if you live in a climate where winters are cold and soil temperatures fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius).

, Choose a pot that's only slightly larger than the original pot, and repot the poinsettia with a rich potting mix that is high in organic matter.This will give the poinsettia a good head  start for the growing season.

, Place your potted poinsettia plant near windows that receive bright, but indirect, morning sun. Choose windows that are not drafty to avoid exposing the plants to cold air. Poinsettias need to be kept at a temperature of around 65 degrees and do not handle extreme temperature changes well.


If the summer temperature is warm enough and never drops below 65 degrees at night, you may keep the poinsettia outside during the growing season. Place the plant in an area that gets partial shade., Water indoor poinsettias throughout the spring and the growing season whenever the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Add water to the pots slowly, and wait for the soil to absorb the water before adding more. Stop watering when saturation slows, and before excess water pools on the soil's surface.

, Potted poinsettia need to be fertilized often with a well rounded liquid fertilizer. A 12-12-12 or 20-20-20 compound is best. Repeat fertilization every month. Stop fertilizing in the fall when it is time for the plants to flower.

, Pinch small growing shoots from poinsettias occasionally throughout the growing season to keep the poinsettia compact and bushy.You can discard the shoots or use them to propagate new plants. Cut back old growth in late fall or early winter to encourage strong new growth the following spring.

, In the fall, it's time to bring the poinsettia back inside so it doesn't freeze. You must also create a cycle of long uninterrupted nights and short sunny days during the fall and winter to encourage the leaves to change from green to red. Do this for 9 to 10 weeks until flower bracts begin to form on the plant.


Move the poinsettias to an area where they receive total darkness for 14 to 16 hours a day in late September or early October. A cool closet is the best location, but if one is not available, you can also put the plants into a large box for their uninterrupted dark hours. Any light exposure during this time will delay the color change.
Keep the plants in total darkness at the time when temperatures are coolest. The best hours are from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. Poinsettias flower best when nighttime temperatures are 55 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (12 to 16 Celsius).
Bring the plants out of darkness every morning and put them near a sunny window where temperatures stay around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius).

, By December, the poinsettia should be ready to display as a holiday decoration again. Place the plant in a sunny window and leave it exposed to normal household light through the winter flowering season.

, When the small yellow flowers at the center of the leaves wilt, in February or March, it's time for the plant's dormancy period.


Prune the plants heavily to 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) tall. This is a good time to take cuttings for plant propagation.
Cut back on watering for a couple of months until it is time to start new growth in the spring. Allow the top several inches of soil to dry out before watering them.

Prune your phlox.,
Remove the dead flower clusters from the plants when flowering is done.,
Divide the plants every 3 to 5 years to propagate them and prevent over-crowding.",How to Grow Phlox," All species of phlox produce flowers in a wide range of colors including white, pink, red, lavender and blue. Different varieties serve different needs in the garden. Do some research to decide which one is right for your growing zone.Purchase potted phlox plants sold locally at garden centers or farmer's markets for transplanting any time during the growing season. Your local garden center or nursery can advise you on which species grow best in your area.


Garden and meadow phlox are perfect for garden borders, since they grow quite wide and tall.Low-growing phlox varieties are perfect to use as groundcover in shady areas, especially as many are mildew-resistant.
You can also buy bare-root plants from a mail order company, but bare root plants are best planted in the spring.;
, Phlox are hardy, low maintenance flowers that do well in most locations. Most varieties of phlox prefer full sun, but some are tolerant of partial or filtered shade. Find a location that works for the variety you have chosen.


Phlox grown in the shade often produce fewer flowers. They are also at increased risk for contracting a disease, so if you choose to plant phlox in the shade, look for a variety that is mildew-resistant.

, Phlox need plenty of moisture to do well, but they shouldn't be waterlogged. To make sure your soil drains well, take a look at it after a heavy rain. If you see standing water and puddles there, the soil doesn't have good drainage. If the area is wet, but not soaking, it should be fine for growing phlox.

, Phlox like rich soil, so it's necessary to work in some compost to ensure they grow healthy and strong. Till the soil to a depth of 12 inches (30 cm) and amend it with organic compost or peat moss., Dig holes 6 to 24 inches (15 to 60 cm) apart depending on the species you are growing. Space shorter phlox varieties 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) apart. Space taller species 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) apart. The holes should be twice as wide as the plants' root balls.Set the phlox plants into the holes and pat soil around their bases. Water the phlox after planting.

, Keep them well watered throughout the growing season; if the soil gets dry, the phlox will suffer. Water from the base of the plant, rather than from the top. Avoid getting their leaves wet to decrease the chances that mold and mildew will form on the plants.

, Use well-rounded plant fertilizer like 10-10-10, which contains 10 percent nitrogen, 10 percent phosphate and 10 percent potash. Repeat a second application of the fertilizer when the plants are flowering. In subsequent years, add compost around the plants each spring.

, Do it when when the days start getting hotter. The mulch helps to keep the soil moist and cool and helps with weed control. Add fresh mulch to your phlox at least once a year.

, For tall-growing varieties, cut off all but 5 to 7 stems on each plant. This increases air circulation to the stems, increasing blooms and reducing chances of disease. Pinch off the growing tips of the remaining stems to slow down the growth and encourage the plants to fill out.


Start when they are around 6 inches (15 cm) tall if you are growing a tall species of phlox. Shorter phlox species that you are not growing as ground cover can also be pruned when they are 4 to 6 inches tall (10 to 15 cm).

, Some varieties of phlox will bloom a second time if you deadhead the plants when the flowers die.

, Dig the entire plant out of the ground so you can see its root structure. Cut sections off the outer-edge of the plant clusters that have plant growth and buds. If the inner section of the cluster has become woody, trim off and discard the woody parts. Replant a piece of the original back in the original hole. Move the other pieces to new areas for planting.

Add the seeds to the egg carton.,
Water the seeds.,
Transplant the seedlings into a larger container.,
Transplant the seedlings outdoors.,
Move the perennials to their permanent home the next spring.",How to Grow Perennials From Seed," If you are new to growing perennials from seed, you may want to start with an easy, low-maintenance variety. Examples of perennials that are easy to grow include catmint, armeria, black-eyed Susan, purple coneflower, and yarrow.;
, You will need a shallow container with holes in the bottom for drainage; a well-suited choice is an egg carton. After poking some small holes in the bottom (a pencil works well for this), fill each section with a potting mix designed for seed starting.

, Place 3 or 4 seeds directly on top of the soil in each section of the egg carton. Consult the seed packet to determine whether the seeds should be covered with additional soil. If they need to be covered, add a very thin layer of vermiculite over them.

, Sprinkle water over the soil with your finger tips, moistening the soil thoroughly. Be careful not to let the seeds wash away. Place plastic wrap loosely over the entire egg carton to keep the moisture in. Position the egg carton in a relatively warm part of your home; consult the seed packet for specific temperature requirements.

, When the seedlings germinate, take the plastic wrap off the carton and position it in the sunniest spot in your home. As soon as the plants have a few leaves each, transplant them gently into a larger container (the plastic cell packs in which seedlings are sold work well for this). Use regular potting mix in the larger container, and keep the mix moist and in bright sun.

, After the last frost has passed, you can plant your perennial seedlings outside. In their first growing season, the plants will do best if they are planted in a nursery bed, cold frame, or green house. Keep the plants watered and weeded throughout the growing season, and cover them with mulch in the fall and winter.

, Once the plants show green growth the following spring, dig them up and move them to their permanent position in your garden. Take extra care to water adequately and prevent weed growth around the plant for a few weeks until it is firmly established.

Be aware of possible pest and disease problems.",How to Grow Oleander," Oleander plants can survive temperatures that occasionally dip below the freezing point, but they thrive in climates that remain above freezing year-round. If you have harsh winters, you may not be able to grow an oleander bush outdoors.


Oleanders will only tolerate temperatures as low as 15 degrees Fahrenheit (-9.4 degrees Celsius). At that point, however, the foliage will be damaged.Even if the top of a plant becomes damaged, it can still grow back as long as the roots remained unharmed.
If you live in a cooler climate, you will need to plant oleanders in a heated greenhouse or in movable containers. Each container must be at least two to three times as wide and deep as the root ball of the bush you plan on keeping. Keep the container outside during the warmer weather and take it inside during the winter.;
, Plant a healthy oleander bush in the spring or fall. Do not wait until summer (its primary growing season) or winter (its dormant season).


Typically speaking, the ideal time to plant an oleander is August or September, just after the blooming period ends. If you plant the bush any later than that, the blooming period might be shortened.
Oleanders planted in spring may not produce many blossoms during its first year, but the foliage should remain healthy and new blooms should appear during the following growth season.

, The vast majority of oleander varieties thrive in full sunlight but can also tolerate light shade. For best results, look for an area in your garden that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight on a regular daily basis.


When grown in partial shade, oleanders tend to take on a lanky, open shape instead of a full, bushy one.
Note that in especially hot, dry climates, a location that receives partial shade may actually be better than one that receives full sun.
Also note that oleander bushes are good to use as ""walls"" against wind and can protect more sensitive plants, but damage caused during severe winds can ruin open blossoms and closed buds for the season.

, Oleander can tolerate most soil conditions, but if you are working with spent soil that is especially deprived of nutrients, you should mix a few handfuls of compost into the top 1 foot (0.30 m) (30.5 cm) of the soil to improve it.


The best soil for oleanders will be well-drained. These plants are quite adaptable, though, and can usually survive well enough in both dry soils and marshy soils.
Additionally, soil content does not often make much difference. Balanced, nutritional soils are always best, but oleanders can still survive well in soils with high pH readings, high salt content, and similar problems.
While not necessary, you could also add peat moss to sandy soils if you want to increase the soil's ability to hold water.

, Select a mature oleander bush for transplanting. It should have thick branches and dark green leaves. Overall, the plant should appear notably dense.Avoid plants labeled as ""double white,"" ""single red,"" and so on. Instead, opt for plants that specifically name which variety is being offered.
Inspect the plant before making your purchase. Make sure that there are no aphids, mealy bugs, or other insects.
Gravitate toward plants that are not ""pot bound."" The root systems should not be overgrown and peeking out of the growing media.

, The hole should be about as deep as the root ball but must be two to three times wider.Burying the plant too deeply can cause the base of its main stem to remain underground, which can cause moisture damage.
Failing too make the hole wide enough can make it difficult to fill the hole in with enough soil.

, Gently tip the container onto its side. Apply pressure to the sides of the container using one hand while carefully lifting out the entire plant, root and all, with your other hand. Once removed, set the plant upright in the center of the hole you dug.


If using a balled or burlapped plant, carefully cut any string or material surrounding the root before placing it in the hole.
Avoid damaging the root as you free the football or transplant the bush.

, Loosely fill roughly half of the space around the root ball with garden soil.


Backfill the soil into the hole gently. Do not pack it into the hole with your hands since doing so could cause damage to the root system.

, Pour enough water onto the soil you've added enough to cause the soil to sink further into the hole.


Wait a few moments after applying the water. You need to let it remove all the air pockets and thoroughly settle the soil.

, Fill up the rest of the empty space with additional garden soil.


As before, backfill the soil in loosely rather than packing it in with your hands.

, Apply more water. This time, you should add enough water to get the soil thoroughly damp.


Wait a few minutes and watch the water on top of the soil. It should eventually sink into the soil, leaving no puddles behind. The top of the soil should still seem damp to the touch, though.

, If you are planting multiple oleander bushes, you should space each oleander bush 6 to 12 feet (1.8 to 3.7 m) apart from any others.


For each additional oleander plant, follow the same instructions regarding how large to make the hole and how to fill the hole in.

, During its active growing season, oleanders need 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week. You may not need to water the plants often during a wet summer, but you should water them during a dry summer.


Even though established oleanders can resist drought conditions, they thrive when they receive an occasional deep watering.
If the leaves begin to yellow, however, the plant is receiving too much water. Remove any leaves that have completely yellowed and allow the oleander to remain dry for a longer period of time.

, While harsh fertilizers are usually unnecessary, you can fertilize the oleander by spreading compost out from the base of the main stem to the space under the outermost branches.


You could use a mild fertilizer with balanced amounts of phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen in the spring if the soil is especially nutrient-deprived, but only do so within the first few years. After the plant establishes itself, switch to a light compost instead of an actual fertilizer.

, Apply a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of mulch each spring. In the late fall, remove this layer and replace it with another 2-inch (5-cm) layer.


Mulch added in the spring protects the plant against weeds and allows the roots to remain moist.
Mulch added in the fall can help insulate the root system and protect the plant against cold weather.
Use an organic mulch, like wood chips or grass clippings.

, Once a flower cluster dies, cut it off to encourage a longer bloom period overall. After flowers are spent, you should also cut off the stem tips to encourage better branching.


Do not wait too late into the fall to do this, however. New growth needs several weeks to harden itself before the frost comes.

, In the summer, oleanders bloom on new growth, so it is best to do most of your heavy pruning in the early spring before the plant enters its active growing period.


You must remove wood that has been damaged by the cold, pests, or disease. Also remove overgrown and intertwined wood.
During the spring, you should also remove suckers from the bottom of the plant since they can drain the plant's resources and reduce its flowering ability.
Trim down the plant to its desired size, cutting it back to a place just above a node on the stem. The leaf node is a section where three leaves come out from the branch. Making the cut here will force new branches to form at the node, and you will get three new branches when the plant grows back.
Avoid pruning more than one-third of the plant when possible. Oleanders can recover if you prune more, but severely heavy pruning can weaken it some.
Usually, oleanders grow rapidly, extending themselves by another 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) (30.5 to 61 cm) per year. If left unattended, oleanders can reach heights between 8 and 12 feet (2.4 and 3.7 m), and they can grow as wide as they are tall. Some oleander plants have even been known to reach 20 feet (6.1 m) (6.1 m). Dwarf varieties, however, usually stay between 3 and 5 feet (0.9 and 1.5 m) tall.

, Oleanders rarely face problems with pests and disease, but they are not completely immune. Treat the plant only after you spot a problem, though.


The most common disease faced by the oleander plant is botryosphaeria dieback, and it is most likely to happened if the plant has undergone stress from a drought or freeze. The branches and shoots will die and become a blackish brown. Completely remove the infected branches and dispose of them away from the rest of your garden.
Oleander caterpillars are the most common pest. They feed in groups and can demolish young shoots. These pests are about 2 inches (5 cm) long with orange-red bodies and black tufts of hair. Quickly apply a pesticide as soon as you spot multiple caterpillars on your plant.
Aphids, mealybugs, and scales can also cause problems, but are rare. Apply an appropriate pesticide as needed.

, The pandorea can be grown in full sun to part shade but is frost tender so the plant won't survive freezing temperatures. If you get frosts, best to plant it indoors but allow plenty of room.

, The vine will need something to support it, so add trellis, wire, or climbing posts for it.

, The soil should be free-draining. When preparing, add well broken-down compost to the soil.

, After planting, place plenty of mulch around the plant to keep in the moisture.

, Until the plant is established, it requires regular watering.

Pick off aphids and other pests.,
Cut off dead or faded flowers.,
Harvest the flowers and leaves throughout the growing season.,
Use the nasturtiums in salads and as garnishes.,
Save the seeds for next year.",How to Grow Nasturtiums," The variety will depend on what you expect from the nasturtium, as well as the space you have available:


Indian Cress - this is a vigorous trailing grower, good for a large garden; it's also known as the common garden nasturtium. The flowers come in shades of orange, yellow and red and it should flower all summer. This is an ideal plant to train up a trellis or fence.
Dwarf nasturtium - a small bush variety, better for a smaller garden space. It has a wide range of flower shades and is easy to control in the garden.
Peach Melba - has yellow flowers with orange-red centers, a popular addition to salads.
Salmon Baby - has a unique orange-pink hue that looks great in the garden.;
, Nasturtiums are commonly started indoors so they'll begin to flower as soon as possible in the spring, after the last frost has passed. If you want to start your seeds indoors, plan to do so four to six weeks before the last spring frost. To start the seeds indoors,


Plant each seed in a peat pot, which can be transplanted directly to the ground to avoid disturbing the roots. Use seed substrate, rather than potting soil.
Keep the seeds in a bright window, and keep the peat moist.
Plant the seedlings after the last frost of the spring has passed.

, Nasturtiums like full sun, but they need to be shielded from midday summer heat. Since they're so low maintenance, Nasturtiums are excellent for growing in spots that need covering up or for those stark, unloved parts of the garden.


Nasturtiums don't mind growing in a container; they'll flower just as profusely in a container as in the ground.
Hanging baskets are also an ideal choice.

, Nasturtiums like loose, well-drained soil that retains moisture. They prefer soil that is not rich, so don't use fertilizer. If there is too much fertilizer in the soil, nasturtiums focus on producing more leaves rather than flowers.Avoid any area with heavy, wet clay soil.

, If you're direct sowing seeds, plant them 10 inches apart and about ½ inch deep. If you're transplanting seedlings, keep them in their peat seed starters and plant them directly in the ground. This will prevent root damage. Keep the planting bed evenly moist.


You can nick the seeds or soak them in warm water overnight to help them germinate more quickly.Direct sown seeds should sprout in seven to ten days.

, There's an old saying that goes, ""be nasty to nasturtiums."" They like poor soil and not too much water, and giving them fertilizer and lots of fresh water will cause them to die. That said, nasturtiums do need water when the soil dries out. They should be watered deeply a few times a week.


Press your finger into the soil to see if it's time to water. If the soil feels dusty and dry, it's time. If it feels moist just below the surface, wait a day or two.
Water around the roots, rather than from above. Water in the morning so the plants dry out completely before nightfall. Too much moisture around nightfall could cause the plants to grow mold.

, Nasturtiums look a little like common weeds before they begin to flower. You may want to mark the planting site with a label to prevent accidentally pulling up the seedlings. Once you're sure what's a flower and what's a weed, keep the the garden bed weed-free so the nasturtiums don't have to compete for water and nutrients., Nasturtiums are very prone to getting attacked by aphids, cucumber beetles and other common garden pests. Picking the bugs off one by one and dropping them into a pail of soapy water is a great organic solution. You can also spray the flowers with water or wipe them with soapy water to deter pests.

, This will encourage new, healthy growth. Deadhead the plants often in order to keep your plants flowering as long as possible through the season.

, Both nasturtium flowers and leaves are edible. Use a pair of scissors to snip off what you need. Try not to take too much from one plant. Nasturtiums have a strong taste, and a little goes a long way., Nasturtium petals and leaves have a strong, peppery taste that pairs wonderfully with all sorts of dishes. Try nasturtium as part of the following items:


Eat the leaves and petals as part of a mixed green salad. Pair them with sweeter greens, like spinach, to offset the peppery taste.
Mix chopped leaves or petals into potato or egg salad.
Add leaves or petals to vegetarian sandwiches.
Use whole flowers as a garnish for salads, pastas and even sweet desserts, like cupcakes.

, Toward the end of the growing season, nasturtiums will produce seeds that will mature and drop. Brush off the dirt and store the seeds in a paper bag in a cool, dark place over the winter. In the spring, you can plant them in the garden again."

Water your pansies thoroughly once every week in the morning.,
Fertilize your pansies regularly.,
Protect your pansies from the winter frost.,
Groom your pansies.",How to Grow Pansies," Pansies can flower all year round, depending on the climate of where you live or Hardiness Zone. Each country defines its own Hardiness Zones, which details each region's ability to grow certain plants. If you're planting seeds, the goal is to avoid blooming pansies in hot temperatures such as in July or August in most climates. So in most climates, the best time to plant pansy seeds is during the fall or after the frost in late winter. This way, you avoid the hot temperatures of the summer and the freezing temperatures of the winter and can catch a fall or early spring bloom. If you're planting matured pansies, transfer them to your outdoor garden in the spring or autumn.


If you live in a mild climate with mild winters, you can expect to see your pansies blooming all throughout the winter.
The most accurate way to find the best time to plant pansies is to look up your area's hardiness zone which can usually be found on your city or country's website and look to see if they provide any plant survival data or suggested planting dates.
Pansies are able to survive in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 through 8.;
, Whether you're planting your pansies in pots or in the ground in your garden, a spot with full sun or partial sun is best. Too much shade can reduce the number of flowers that bloom and the size of your pansies. It can also cause your pansies to look spindly or grow too tall from seeking out sunlight.


Look for a location that allows for 6 to 12 hours of sunlight a day.Pansies grow best in a cool environment. If you live in a place where summers can get quite hot, keep your pansies in partial shade. This means a tree or bush is nearby to create shade at certain times during the day, especially around noon when the sun is the brightest.
Don't plant pansies in the same location 3 years in a row. This space will have begun to build up fungus diseases in the soil that could feed on your plants. Leaving the space empty for a year will force the fungus to die out.

, Pansies do best in soil temperatures between 45° F (8° C) and 65° F (18° C). However, planting or growing pansies in soil temperatures under 45° F (8° C) can stunt the growth of your pansies so if you plan to grow your pansy seeds in the fall, ensure you protect your pansies in the winter or consider growing your pansies after the frost.


Measure soil temperature by placing a soil thermometer at the depth you plan to seed or plant your pansy. Take the soil's temperature twice throughout the day to get a better measurement. You should take one measurement in the morning and another in the early evening to get an overall temperature measurement. If you're planting in a field or garden, you should take temperatures at several locations in the soil where you plan to plant your pansies.Greenhouses and coldframes can help regulate soil temperatures. They're especially helpful if you're planting pansy seeds when temperatures are not ideal.
Pansies can be grown indoors at room temperature as long as they receive direct sunlight from a window. They should be watered frequently and planted in a well-draining pot.

, Pansies thrive in soil that is well-drained and rich in nutrients. If you're preparing a new flower bed or renewing an old one, it's important to add organic materials like compost, peat moss, or animal manure to improve the soil which adds moisture to the soil and reduces the risk of diseases in your pansies.To prepare your flower bed:


Dig up and discard old flowers or vegetation from the soil. This prevents diseases and insects from being carried over by the old plants.
Add compost to your soil. Your compost or organic material should make up 25 percent of your total soil. This means if you have 12 inches (30 cm) of soil, you need at least 3 inches (8 cm) of compost material.Mix together your soil and compost. Use a spade to mix the two materials together. This helps loosen the soil especially if you're not adding any new soil and also helps to aerate the ground for better drainage.
Make sure your soil is free of lumps, stones, and other coarse materials.
Water your flower bed.

, If you're planting your pansies indoors or in containers, be sure to use pots or containers that are 9 to 12 inches (24 to 30 cm) deep. They should have a hole or multiple holes at the bottom for water to drain out.


Place a plate or pan underneath your pot to catch the drained water if you're planting your pansies indoors or on a surface that can't become wet.
Prepare your soil the same way you would prepare a flower bed by adding soil and compost together. Or you can fill it with potting soil or rich, sandy loam soil.
Always water your soil before you plant or seed pansies.
These containers can be permanent or temporary homes for your pansies.

, The general practice for planting seeds is to grow them in seed trays. Planting seeds outdoors can be harsh but it is not impossible. However, the success rate of seeds sprouting in seed trays indoors is much higher.


When you plant in seed trays, it's important you have enough pots to transfer each seedling into. The seedlings will outgrow the seed tray in a couple of weeks and you'll either have to transfer them to pots or to an outdoor location.

, If you're creating a bedding out of pansies, be sure to keep each plant about 6 to 12 inches (14 to 20 cm) apart in all directions.Having wider spacings between each plant allows for more air circulation in the soil which prevents spider mites and diseases that can destroy your flower bed.


Pansies can grow up to 8 inches tall (20 cm) and spread as far as 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) across.
If you're planting seeds on a bed, it's best to plant pansies in rows. This makes it easier for you to identify individual seedlings in case you would like to move them to another location . It can also help you weed between plants more efficiently.
You can choose to plant your pansy seeds and grow your seedlings in a temporary location that is cooler than the permanent location. This improves the likelihood of your pansies sprouting and creates a good foundation of healthy pansy plants.

, Whether you're planting a seed or a mature pansy plant indoors or outdoors, it's important to water your soil first. It is also important to water after planting to fuse the soil with your seed or pansy plant.

, Flatten the soil and water it to secure the seed within the soil. Extra steps are also recommended in order to ensure moisture is retained in your flower bed before your seedlings sprout:


Cover your seedbed or flower pot with white plastic film (a cut open white garbage bag is a good alternative), aluminum foil, or moist burlap. This keeps the moisture in and sunlight out. Do this until you see your seeds sprouting which takes about 5 to 8 days.
Shade your sprouted pansies with a canopy. Place it a foot or so above the bed. If you have potted pansies, place them away from sunlight until the sprouts develop their first leaves. A good location in your home to place your seeded pots is in a cool basement or closet. Once you see leaves sprouting, your pansies will be ready to handle direct sunlight.
If you've been growing your seeds in a seed tray, it's time to transfer them to their own individual pots or outdoors once you see leaves sprouting. You can also choose to thin out seedlings before your replant them.

, If it's too dry, your seeds could die before they sprout. But if your seeds are too wet, rot can start to form. It's important to keep a balanced level of moisture in your seedbed. Your soil should not look dry and should feel wet to the touch. However, the soil should not be overflowing with water and you should not be able to squeeze water from the soil when you press into it with your fingers.


If you've been covering your seedbed the first few days after seeding, you should not need to water your pansies. What you used to cover it should have trapped any moisture from your pansies. However, check the quality of your soil daily and water if needed.

, Once your seedlings have developed 6 to 8 leaves, or the weather is just right, plant them in their permanent locations.


Plant your seedlings 6 to 12 inches (14 to 20 cm) apart.
Separate and spread the roots of your seedlings before replanting them. This is especially important if you've bought seedlings from a store or gardening centre, as their roots can become quite compacted in their pots.
Water your seedlings after planting to regain lost moisture and fuse the soils together.

, If you're not growing pansies from seeds, plant your pansies in their permanent locations in the fall or spring.


Separate and spread the roots of your seedlings before replanting them. This is especially important if you've bought seedlings from a store or gardening centre, as bought seedlings are quite compacted in their pots.
Water your seedlings after planting to regain lost moisture and fuse the soils together.

, During the summer and spring season, it's recommended you water your pansies with about 1 inch of water every week. This means, for every square foot of soil in your flower bed, you'll need to give it 0.6 gallons (2 litres) of water.


For some gardeners, it is more economical or reasonable to ration the weekly amount of water needed for your pansies. Some months may be extremely dry and water is needed daily to ensure your pansies are well hydrated. However, deep infrequent watering encourages a deeper rooting system which develops healthier and stronger pansies. Shallow and frequent watering causes water to evaporate quicker which causes pansies to develop a shallow rooting system.During the fall or rainy season, rain would do most of the watering for you. So only water after dry periods or when you're fertilizing your pansies.
Don't water your pansies in the afternoon or evening. Morning temperatures are usually low and watering in the morning prepares your pansies for the heat of the day. The water will usually dry before nightfall, preventing fungal diseases from developing overnight.

, Fertilizing gives nutrients to your pansies and ensures bigger and healthier plants. Some gardeners choose to fertilize their plants every month during the growing season or blooming season. It's most important to try to find a fertilizer without nitrates or one with low levels of nitrogen. Fertilizers with high levels of nitrates and nitrogen tend to cause plants to rot more easily.


The most important time to fertilize your pansies is after you have transplanted them to their permanent location.
Organic fertilizers have a slower release rate which releases nutrients over several months.
Always follow the directions provided by your fertilizer when applying it to your pansies.
Always water your pansies before applying any type of fertilizer.

, Apply pine boughs, straw mulch, a lattice frame, or white landscaping fabric over your pansies to counteract temperature variations during the winter. Repeated freezing and thawing of plants can be dangerous.


When the ground reaches killing frost temperatures (32 °F or 0 °C), plants can start to die or become damaged. If you live in a climate with mild winters, you might be lucky enough to see your pansies live through the winter and even bloom throughout it.
Mulch helps to retain heat and moisture in the soil for your pansies. Extra framework around your pansies can also protect it from snow or strong winds that could potentially uproot the plant.

, It's important you snip or remove any dying flowers or leaves regularly. This allows your pansies to grow back stronger and bigger. Removing dead flowers will also extend the plant's blooming period.


In the winter, pansies will wilt and shrink to protect themselves from the cold. This is normal and you do not need to groom wilted-looking parts of the plant.

Marigolds are annual plants in most zones, meaning they will die in the winter and will not return the next growing season.


Marigolds are hardy, self-seeding flowers. If you live in Zone 8 or higher, your marigolds may not die off during the winter and will probably return with fuller vigour the following spring.;
, Although marigolds are a very hardy plant, they can die in cold weather. Plant marigolds after the last frost. American (African) marigolds should be planted immediately after the last frost because they are slow to mature.If possible, plant your marigolds on a cloudy day or in the morning; this will help prevent further transplant shock to the plants from the heat.

, Seeds will take a few weeks to germinate but cost much less. Seedlings or plants bought from a gardening store will give you immediate satisfaction but are more expensive.


While it's not necessary, you can start the seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before you want to plant them outside. Marigolds can also be directly seeded into the ground outdoors when the soil temperatures reach 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit ( Late May to Mid June) as well. Short varieties such as the French Marigolds germinate quickly and flower very fast within few weeks after planting.
If you use seedlings or plants, you can plant them as soon as the last frost is gone.

, Marigolds grow well both in flowerbeds and in pots and other containers, but they need space to spread out. Fully grown marigold plants in beds should be spaced 2 to 3 feet apart so that they can get enough sunlight.Marigolds perform best in full sunlight, although they can handle up to 20% shade. Do not plant them in a fully shaded area, as they will not thrive.Marigolds are tolerant of dry, sandy soil, but they do not grow well in overly damp soil. Make sure your beds or containers have adequate drainage; you can add a layer of gravel to the bottom and cover it with soil before planting to enhance draining., There are four main groups of marigold species, and each of them produce variations in color and size. This varies greatly on the cultivar or variety you grow. You can always get size info on the package of seeds itself or looking it up on the web.African marigolds Tagetes erecta come in two basic varieties: “large-flowered” and “tall.” Large-flowered African marigolds are fairly short, at between 12-14” tall, but as the name suggests have very large blossoms (up to 3.5” inches in diameter). Tall African marigolds have small flowers but can grow up to 3’ tall. Both almost always produce orange or yellow flowers. African marigolds may also be referred to as “American” marigolds.
French marigolds Tagetes patula come in two basic varieties: “large-flowered” and “dwarf.” Large-flowered French marigolds are between 12-16” tall with large (up to 2”) flower blossoms. Dwarf French marigolds rarely grow higher than 12” and produce small flowers. French marigolds come in varieties of yellow, gold, and orange.
Triploid marigolds are a hybrid of French and African marigolds and are also sometimes known as “mule” marigolds because they cannot reproduce. They grow fairly tall and produce large (up to 2”) flowers.
Single marigolds are also known as signet marigolds Tagetes tenuifolia. They are quite different in appearance from other marigold varieties because their flowers have very simple, almost daisy-like flowers rather than the thick, bushy blossoms of most other marigold types also these varieties are more wild looking.

, Seed packets can range in price anywhere from 10 cents to a dollar or more per pack, depending on the breed. You can purchase seeds from garden supply centers, superstores, and online retailers.


French marigolds start from seed much faster than African marigolds. Hybrid varieties will not usually start from seed.If you have leftover seeds, you can save them for the following growing season. Seal them in an air-tight container such as a mason jar in a cool, dry place., It’s best to use a divided seed container so that you can easily separate the roots of your seedlings once they’ve begun to grow. You can purchase these at most gardening stores.


You can also use an egg carton filled with potting mix to start your seeds.

, It is preferable to use a nutrient-enriched soil or mix when starting seeds, rather than straight topsoil, as it will give the seeds an extra nutritional boost and make it easy for young roots to take hold.

, Refer to the package directions for the appropriate planting depth, as this will vary by marigold breed. Avoid sowing more than 2 seeds in the same division of your seed planter; sowing too many seeds in the same spot will force them to fight for sunlight and oxygen and will prevent rapid growth.

, Watering newly sown seeds with a watering can could simply wash the seeds away. Use a spray bottle filled with clean water to mist the soil until it’s damp., Use a spoon or other small tool to dig the seedling out of the planter, being careful not to damage the roots. Remove any dead or browning seedlings.

, Transplant marigolds into your garden beds or containers when they’re about 6” tall and look fairly sturdy. Handle the plants with care so as not to damage the roots., Use a hand aerating tool, a hoe, or even your hands to break up large clods of soil and make sure it is aerated so that oxygen can reach the roots of your plants.


Remove any sticks, stones, or debris from the soil. These will hinder root growth.

, The root ball of the marigold plant should be able to fit into the hole while the leaves remain above ground.

, Cover the root ball with soil and pat firmly in place. Use a watering can to water the plant at the base, watering until the soil is moist but not flooded.

, Spreading a 1-2” layer of mulch, pine bark, or other organic material on your beds between marigold plants will help prevent weeds from growing. It will also help the soil retain moisture, meaning you don’t have to water as often., Most fertilizers available for home use contain three basic nutrients essential for plant growth: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.


The three numbers on packaged fertilizer reflect the concentrations of each nutrient. Marigolds thrive on a 20-10-20 (20% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus, and 20% potassium) fertilizer.Don’t over-fertilize the soil or it will actually damage your marigolds. Fertilizing once every two weeks is plenty. It's also a good idea to dilute your fertilizer more than the package recommends.
In place of fertilizer, you can use compost instead.

, Pouring water over the marigold blossoms and leaves may damage or even rot them. Instead, use a watering can to water your flowers at the base of the plants.


Try to avoid using a garden hose to water your plants. The force of the water may wash away the top layer of soil.

, “Deadheading” is a cultivating process in which you snip off dead blossoms from flowering plants. While not strictly necessary, deadheading your marigolds will help prompt the plant to produce new flowers.


To keep marigolds compact, pinch off new, unwanted growth., Although marigolds are very hardy, they may sometimes have pest problems. A mild solution of insecticidal soap, which is sold at most gardening supply stores and even supermarkets, will help keep pests at bay without presenting a toxic hazard.


Some marigold species are edible. If you use marigolds in any edible preparation, wash them thoroughly first to remove any insecticidal soap residue. Do not eat marigolds that have had chemical pesticides sprayed on them.

, Most marigold species grow quite close to the ground, but if you’ve chosen a taller variety such as the African marigold, you may need to provide a stake to support the stalk. Use stakes about 2’ high and tie the plant to the stake with a soft, stretchy fabric. (Old nylon stockings work very well for this!)"

Scar the seeds.,
Place the seeds into a glass of warm water.,
Continue changing the water daily even after the seeds sprout.,
Pick the right pot.,
Anchor the seeds.,
Fill your pot with dense soil.,
Gently press the seeds into the top of the soil.,
Lower the pot into shallow water.",How to Grow Lotus Flower1," File the pointed tip of the seed down to one layer using a standard metal file. If you do not scar the seed, it will not grow and may rot.;
, The water should not be chlorinated and must be changed every day until the lotus seeds sprout. After the first day of soaking, the seeds should swell to nearly twice their original size.


Seeds that float are almost always infertile. File any floating seeds down until you see a hint of the white meat on the inside of the seed. If these seeds do not swell like the others, discard them to avoid letting them cloud up the water.

, You must be more delicate than before to avoid disturbing the growth, however. Growth should start after four or five days of soaking, but you will need to wait a few more days until the seedling is at least 6 in. (15.24 cm) long before transferring.

, A 3 to 5 gallon (11 to 19 liter) container should provide a young lotus plant with enough room to grow. A black plastic bucket works best because of its ability to retain heat and warm the seedlings. You also need to choose a bucket that does not have any drainage holes. The plant can actually gravitate toward the drainage holes and begin growing outside of them, causing the plant to under-perform.

, Lotus seeds without an anchor may find their way out of the soil and end up floating on the surface of the water. Gently wrap a small amount of modeling clay around each seed, but do not cover the sprout.

, The ideal soil is about two parts clay and one part river sand. Fill the pot with about 6 in. (15.24 cm) of this potting medium.

, The seeds should rest near the top of the soil, but you should brush a light layer of soil over the seeds after you press them in.

, The water should be a maximum of 18 in. (45.72 cm) deep and at a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 degrees Celsius).

Watch the blooming cycle.,
Clear away dead vines in winter.",How to Grow Morning Glories," Buy packaged seeds, or collect the seed pods from a friend's morning glory plant. As morning glory flowers die, they leave behind round seed pods at the base of the flower stem. The pods are ready to pick when they turn papery and brown, and contain dark brown or black seeds.Morning glories cross-pollinate, meaning that plants grown from seed will not necessarily look much like the parent once they grow.;
, If planting outdoors, wait until the last frost has passed and the soil has begun to warm. If you'd like to start the morning glories indoors, plan on starting 4–6 weeks before the last frost.Depending on your local conditions you may be able to plant in late summer if you tend to have mild winters. If it gets cold in September, you probably shouldn't plant.
If storing seeds over the winter, keep them in a dry, dark location.

, Some morning glory seeds are too hard to germinate quickly without help. Most growers either nick the seed with a nail file, or soak the seed overnight in room temperature water, in order to increase the odds of success.Often, you'll have so many seeds on hand that you can skip this step and accept that not all seeds will germinate.


Some gardeners argue that soaking can cause rotting or infection, and that shallow planting in moist soil will produce similar results with less risk., Morning glories react poorly to transplanting due to their delicate root systems, so it's best to pick one location and stick to it. If planting in an outdoor container, choose one at least 2 ft (0.6m) wide and 3 ft (0.45m) high for best results.If starting the plant indoors, use a 3 inch (7.6cm) peat pot that can be buried in your garden when you want to move the plant outdoors.Morning glories can be directly seeded outside successfully.

, Adult morning glories are very tolerant of poor soil conditions, but the seeds need a well-draining growing medium. To achieve this, mix 1 part perlite with 3 parts soil, or mix 1 part salt-free sand with 2 parts soil.Do not mix sand with clay-heavy soil.
There's no need to grow these in extra-rich, fertile soil. Rich soil can even lead to fewer flowers in some morning glories, notably ""Heavenly Blue"" and other Ipomoea tricolor varieties., Plant each seed in a ½ inch (1.25cm) hole and cover lightly with soil.If planting them directly in a garden plot, spacing depends on the variety's size and on personal preference. Consider planting the seeds 2 inch (5cm) apart, then culling to 6–12 inches (15–30cm) apart once the seedlings reach 3 inches (7.5cm) high.At this height, the seedlings are well-established and less vulnerable to pests., Morning glories love sunshine, and will only tolerate very light shade. They should receive as much direct sun as possible, especially while the seedlings are young.


Keep indoor plants near a south-facing window (or a north-facing window if you live in the Southern Hemisphere).
The ideal soil temperature for germination is about 68–86ºF (20–30ºC)., Young morning glories may fail to sprout or die if the soil dries out. Keep the soil moist, but not soggy, and wait for germination within 5–21 days (but usually within a week).The seedlings are less vulnerable once the first true leaves appear.(The first leaves to appear are called cotyledons, and look noticeably different than the true leaves.)

, If you started your plants indoors, move them outdoors once the seedlings are well-established and the last frost is past. Morning glories are hardier than most plants, but it's still a good idea to start by moving the container to partial shade. Move the plant to a slightly sunnier location every few days, or back to darker shade if you see wilting or sun scorch.


Keep the soil moist during this acclimation period.

, Once the seedlings are about 6 inches (15cm) tall, provide a stake or trellis for the vine to climb.


Alternatively, plant seedlings in a hanging basket and allow the vines to cascade over the edge.

, Adult plants are very tolerant of dry soil, and may not even require watering at all in wet or cool climates. During hot weather, water once or twice a week.Over-watering can lead to excessive vine growth with few flowers., Give them access to a trellis or arbor for shade, or let them grow on a dead tree or post. They cannot climb flat surfaces, so hang plastic netting in front of a wall or solid fence if you'd like the vines to grow there.Give the vines plenty of space; some varieties can grow 15 feet (4.6m) in a single season.


Since most morning glory vines die every year, allowing your morning glory to climb living trees is acceptable as the vines will not harm the tree. (Don't try this in areas with mild winters, which morning glories can survive.)

, Fertilize when your morning glory is first planted, then no more than once a month during the growing season. If you fertilize too often, you will encourage foliage instead of blooms., Since morning glories have few problems with disease, you should find it easy to keep your morning glory plant healthy. Insect problems are also rare, but it's worth the occasional check for aphids and other insects.Your local nursery can help you address the problem if it occurs, usually with an organic pesticide.

, Morning glories are prolific and long-lasting bloomers, although they sometimes take a month or two to get started. Each individual flower opens in the morning and dies off before the end of the day. This makes morning glories one of the most interesting and beautiful flowers to decorate your garden.


Air temperature will alter the color of the bloom and the length of time it stays open., Morning glories can survive a mild frost, but in most climates they will die in early winter. Morning glories are aggressive re-seeders, which is good and bad news from the gardener. You won't need to buy any more seeds for next season, but you might discover that your whole garden starts growing vines. Clear away the dead vines promptly to prevent this. New seeds will usually grow from the same spot, but you may gather seeds to plant by hand just in case.


In warm climates where morning glories grow as perennials, you can grow new plants from short cuttings instead.

Float the tuber in a large bowl.,
Select the right container.,
Fill your container with dirt.,
Place the pot in a shallow pond or tank.,
Set the tuber on top of the soil.,
After a few days, place the pot into your pond.,
Place a rock on top of the tuber to weigh it down.",How to Grow Lotus Flower2," Fill the bowl with warm water until it is nearly full and rest the tuber on the surface of the water. The tuber should float. Place the bowl near a warm window and change the water every three to seven days.


Do not expose the tuber to direct sunlight or freezing temperatures.
Plant the lotus within a few weeks after the tuber sprouts.

, The right size container will depend on the type of lotus you chose. Bowl lotuses are very small and can fit comfortably inside a 2-gallon (7.57-liter) container, but a large lotus may need a 50-gallon (189.27-liter) container.


Make sure that your container does not have holes. Your lotus may begin growing out of the holes, creating a mess and causing it to perform poorly.

, The best dirt is about 60 percent clay and 40 percent river sand, but most dense soils will work sufficiently well. Leave about 1 to 4 in. (2.54 to 10.16 cm) of empty space in between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.

, For now, the surface level of the water should only be about as high as the pot, if not a little higher.

, Place it in a horizontal position with the back part next to the wall of the container and the growing point toward the center. The growing points should stick straight up.


Gently press the tuber into the soil just enough to anchor it, but do not bury it too deep.
The surface of the water should only be slightly higher than the top of the growing tip.

, Your plant will be ready for deeper water once the growing tips show leaves. Smaller types of lotus only need 1 to 6 in. (2.54 to 15.24 cm) of water covering the top of the soil, but larger varieties may need up to 3 feet (0.9 m). (1 m) of water.

, If you do not weigh the tuber down, it will float to the surface of the water.

Repot the tuber every year.",How to Grow Lotus Flower3," The plant only grows at temperatures that high or higher.

, Lotus plants thrive in full sun, but if your pond is not located in full sun, you should at least give the plant as much sunlight as possible by removing any foliage from other plants that may block out the sun.


After temperatures rise about 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), you should consider adding some shade to prevent the delicate leaves from burning.

, Snip away yellow leaves, but only cut the stems off above the surface of the water.

, Pond tablets are specially made for use with aquatic plants. Small varieties only need about 2 tablets, but large varieties may need 4 tablets.


If growing your lotus from seed, do not fertilize during the first year of growth.
Begin fertilizing after a lotus tuber sprouts six leaves.
Add fertilizer every three to four weeks.
Stop fertilizing in the middle of July. If you do not stop, the plant will not be able to prepare for dormancy.

, Aphids and caterpillars are known to be attracted to lotus leaves, so you may need to apply a small amount of powdered pesticide to the leaves in order to kill these pests. Do not apply liquid pesticides, however, since liquid pesticides are more likely to burn the leaves.

, Move the pot into the deepest part of the bond to protect the top of the tuber from ice that develops on the surface of the water. You can also remove the pot and sit it in a garage or basement until the weather warms up again.

., Only repot in the early spring, when new growth has just begun developing. Use a soil made of clay and river sand, and transfer it to a container that is the same size as its original container, planting it at the same depth.

, Lobelia can be grown in a container or in the garden. Use either very good quality potting soil or good quality soil with compost added for garden planting.

, If planting in containers or window boxes, you'll have the freedom to move these around if needed.

, Plant the seedlings in sunny well drained spots after the last frosts have gone or in a frost-free environment. Space plants 10 - 12 cm (4-5 in.) apart. In a container, Lobelia can be grown more closely together.

, A liquid feed is the best option for fertilizing lobelia.

Fill the pot with a loose potting mix.,
Test the pH of the soil.,
Dig a hole that is as deep as the plug.,
Remove the plug.,
Place the plug plant inside the hole.,
Place the pot onto a saucer.",How to Grow Lisianthus1," In order to transplant a plug cleanly into a new location, the plant should be well held together by its own roots. Otherwise, the transplanting process could get messy and may end up damaging the sensitive plant.;
, The best size will depend on the variety you choose.Florida lisianthus and forever lisianthus need a pot that is 4 to 6 in. (10 to 15 cm) deep.
Lisa lisianthus need a pot that is 3 to 6 in. (7 to 15 cm) deep.
Sapphire lisianthus need a pot that is 3 to 4 in. (7 to 10 cm) deep.

, Lisianthus roots can rot if allowed to sit in excess water, so good drainage is important. If the container you chose does not have holes in the bottom, drill one or two holes into the bottom using a power drill.

, A commercially available potting mix should be fine, and both soil and soilless mixes can work.

, These plants demand a soil pH between 6.5 and 7.0m and serious problems can arise if the pH dips below 6.5. If your potting medium has a low pH, mix in some limestone to bring the pH back up.

, Center the hole in the middle of the pot.

, Gently squeeze on the sides of the plastic to loosen the plant from the plug container. You should be able to remove the plant, soil and all, without any breakage.

, Pack the soil in the pot around the lisianthus plant to keep the new seedling in place.

, A saucer prevents excess water and soil from spilling out onto your counter or windowsill.

"
Continue to monitor the pH of the soil.,
Keep the plant warm, but not too warm.,
Place the pot in partial sun.,
Keep the soil moist.,
Feed your lisianthus plant with a fertilizer high in potassium.,
Use growth regulator.,
Watch out for fungus gnats and other pests.,
Watch out for fungal diseases.",How to Grow Lisianthus2," The soil should always be at a pH between 6.5 and 7.2, and if it dips below this range, you should remedy the problem by mixing in a little limestone.

, Optimal daytime temperature is between 68 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 24 degrees Celsius). Optimal nighttime temperature is between 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 18 degrees Celsius).

, These plants need plenty of sunlight for flower buds to form, but too much sun will cause the temperature to rise too high and could damage the foliage.


Place the plant in a sunny window and allow it to get as much direct sun as possible before it flowers.
On cloudy days, you may need to supplement natural light by placing the pot beneath fluorescent or HID grow lights for 8 to 12 hours. This is especially true if the plant has not yet flowered.
After the plant flowers, move it to a slightly shady area to protect the petals. Keeping it near a window where it can receive indirect or filtered sunlight should work.

, Water it every few days, allowing the soil to dry out in between waterings. Use your finger to gauge the dryness of the soil at a depth of 2 in. (5 cm). Once it is dry this deep, give the plant a light sprinkling of water using a watering can, but do not soak it.


Avoid letting the soil dry out once the plants are in soil. As soon as the surface of the soil looks dry, sprinkle it with water.

, Potassium generally improves the flower and overall strength of the plant. The fertilizer should also be fairly high in nitrogen to promote healthy foliage growth. Avoid fertilizers that are too heavy in phosphorus, however. Look for formulas such as 15-0-15 or 20-10-20, where the numbers correspond to the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the fertilizer, respectively.


Add the fertilizer once every two weeks before the plant flowers. After the plant flowers, reduce feedings to once every three or four weeks.
Fertilizers rich in calcium are also good for a lisianthus plant.

, Lisianthus plants that grow too tall can end up depriving themselves of valuable nutrients, leading to less flowering and earlier death. Apply a b-Nine spray two weeks after transplanting the plug into its pot. Avoid applying it too frequently afterward, since excess growth regulator can also lead to a decrease in flower production.

, Fungus gnats are the most common threat to lisianthus flowers, and they can cause a lot of damage to the roots of the plant. Aphids, leaf miners, thrips, and whiteflies are also big problem pests. If you spot any of these pests on your plant, treat the infested area with a mild pesticide.


You may also want to consider applying a mild pesticide to your plant preemptively, before any pests show up.

, Gray mold, stem rot, and pythium root rot are among the most frequent diseases contracted. Proper drainage should prevent most of these fungi from attacking your plant, but if your lisianthus does get a fungus, treat it with a fungicide.

One of the most adaptable irises — very easy to grow and maintain. Do especially well in temperate climates.Louisiana Iris: Native to the hot, humid southeastern United States. In spite of this, grows well in a wide variety of conditions. However, they will not bloom well if they receive less than an inch of water or so during hot growing season months.Beardless Iris: Native to Central and Southern Europe. Do well with at least half a day of full sun. Can even survive constant sun though this is not necessarily preferable.;
, Most Irises are best planted in late summer (early fall at the latest). This gives the iris a chance to establish its roots while there is still enough sunlight to fuel its growth so that it can survive the winter. For most Iris varieties, July and August are the best months for planting.Note, however, that in areas with long summers and mild winters, you can get away with planting irises as late as September or even October — in these cases, there's usually still enough sunlight to help the plant grow its roots before winter.

, Most irises thrive if given generous amounts of sunlight. You won't necessarily want your iris to be in constant sun (though they can still do well in these situations), but they can usually stand more sun than similarly-sized flowers. Try planting your irises in a flowerbed that receives the shade of a tree late in the day or on the side of your house that the sun hits in the afternoon for a good amount of light.

, Irises prefer soils that are neutral to slightly acidic — a pH of about 6.8-7.0 is best. In addition, irises require soil with a good amount of aeration and drainage.This is important for preventing root rot, which irises can be susceptible to if over-watered.


For heavy, clay-rich soils with bad drainage, try adding humus or organic matter to improve the permeability of the soil.
Planting on a slope or in a raised flower bed can help with drainage — in these cases, water will naturally run away from the iris.

, One common mistake first-timers make when planting irises is to plant them too deep. Unlike most plants, irises do best when their rhizome — the brown, root-like structure at their base resembling a potato — is slightly exposed to the air. The plant's roots should be arranged so that they spread downward beneath the rhizome.


Note that in very hot climates, covering the rhizomes with a thin layer of dirt (no more than an inch or so) can help protect them from drying out.

, More so than other flowers, irises have a tendency to grow together when they're planted near one another. When this happens, the plants can compete for the same soil, water and nutrients, hampering each others' growth. To prevent this, try to plant your irises' rhizomes at least one to two feet apart.Even with this preventative measure, after a few years, your irises may grow together anyway. If this happens, don't worry — you can fix this by simply digging up some of the rhizomes and replanting them farther away to ""thin out"" your flowers.

, Depending on where you live and what time of the year it is, conditions outdoors may not be suitable for growing new plants. Rather than plant your irises in the soil outside when they're not likely to do well, instead, get them started in a pot. This allows you to carefully control the amount of time that the plants are exposed to the weather outside until it improves and you can transfer them to the garden. If conditions are very bad, like, for instance, if there's heavy frost, you can even keep the plants indoors 24/7.


For most irises, a 12-inch pot will work well. Exceptionally small irises can do well in 6-to-8-inch pots.Regardless of the size of pot you use, make sure it has good drainage — at least one big hole on the bottom (or several smaller ones) for the water to drain out of.

, After you plant your irises, give them a thorough watering. If conditions are dry, water every 7 to 10 days or as needed during the morning or evening.Assuming you planted your irises in the late summer or early fall, you may stop watering your plants as soon as the weather cools and it begins raining.


One common mistake to avoid with your irises is over-watering. If the rhizome or roots are held in contact with moisture without being given a chance to drain, root rot can set in. This fungal condition can be potentially fatal for the iris and easily spreads to nearby plants, so prevention is key., Over time, your plant will require less and less watering on your part. Once the weather takes a turn for the cooler in the fall, you can stop watering until the next summer growing season. In general, your iris should require less watering with each subsequent summer — for climates with mild summers, it's possible


The exception here is for areas with very hot, dry summers. In these cases, some watering may be necessary every summer to keep the iris from drying out. Though irises are quite durable, they can't survive in extreme conditions without help.

, As the iris grows, you'll want to periodically check to make sure that the rhizome hasn't become covered with dirt, organic matter, or other debris. If it has, gently brush it off without moving the plant itself or disturbing its roots. In addition, make sure that the soil still has good aeration and drainage — if it doesn't, add humus or organic matter as needed.

, Unlike high-maintenance garden plants, iris leaves don't require pruning or trimming for good growth. In fact, leaving the leaves undisturbed even after the growing season allows the iris to gain more nutrients from photosynthesis for next year's growth.In general, the only sort of trimming you should need to do for iris leaves is to remove brown, dead leaf tissue that has already died — this provides no benefit to the plant.


Note that, before winter, you may also want to cut the flower stalk to its base. If the flower dies during winter and falls at the base of the plant, it can cause rot to spread to the rhizome as it decays.

, As the plant's roots establish themselves throughout the late summer and early fall, you may want to put some thought to how you plan to protect your irises once the weather grows cold, especially if you live in an area with exceptionally cold winters. Snowfall can naturally protect the soil from the cracking and heaving that can occur during very cold weather and dislodge the rhizomes.If your area doesn't reliably get snowfall, you may want to spread a loose mulch (like evergreen bough) across the ground to protect the soil. Don't apply a thick layer of mulch — this can actually trap moisture in the soil and cause rot.
Destroy any irises exposed to heavy frost — left to rot, these plants can become havens for borer eggs., As the weather begins to warm, you can allow any snow to melt naturally and/or remove any protective mulches you used in the winter. As new plants begin to sprout up, keep a keen eye out for any weeds near your irises and pull them out as early as possible. Use environmentally-friendly herbicides or weed killers to keep grasses and weed away from the bases of your irises.


In addition, you'll want to be wary of any encroaching pests, especially slugs. There are many, many ways to bait slugs, from commercial products to improvised home solutions. One very easy way to do this is to make a beer trap — fill a wide-mouthed jar halfway up with beer and bury it up to the rim of the jar in the soil. Slugs, attracted to the beer, will fall in and drown., Irises can benefit from the occasional light application of fertilizer starting the growing season after you plant it. Don't use a fertilizer high in nitrogen — this can cause excessive foliage growth (and, eventually, rot). Water after dispensing the fertilizer to avoid fertilizer ""burn"". Below is a selection of fertilizers that are acceptable to use with irises:General purpose ""5-10-10"" fertilizer
General purpose ""5-10-5"" fertilizer
Bone meal
Superphosphate

, As the iris grows more mature, the amount of time you'll need to spend maintaining it should decrease drastically. Still, even when your plant has been established for years, it's a good idea to give it a check up every few weeks just to ensure that there are no problems with it. As long as the plant is receiving good sun during the growing season, occasional rainwater, and nutrients from the soil, it should be just fine. Irises are perennials, so they'll gradually spread from the roots over many growing seasons.


Every three to five years, you’ll want to divide the irises in crowded flower beds and replant them to avoid competition for water and soil."

Guard from frost.",How to Grow Kangaroo Paw," Always provide soil that drains well. Use a location that is in full sun.;
, Ensure that the crown is no deeper in the soil than it was in the pot from the nursery.

, Although kangaroo paw is drought tolerant once it is established, watering is important after planting and when the flowering stems are elongating during spring. When watering, avoid watering the foliage; focus on the soil.

, While the kangaroo paw does not need fertiliser, giving it some will boost the flower production. Apply in spring and in autumn, using a fertiliser that has controlled release.

, When pruning, prune close to ground level. Do this after flowering has finished for the season.

, Although able to tolerate temperature extremes well, kangaroo paw flowers will not emerge if subjected to more than a very light frost.

Purchase hollyhock seeds in your choice of variety and color.,
Increase your chance of first-year bloom.,
Sow the seeds in trays full of sandy soil.,
Transplant the hollyhock seedlings into individual 4 to 6 inch (10 to 15 cm) pots if you started seeds in fall.,
Plant the hollyhocks outdoors in the spring, after all signs of frost have passed and soil temperatures are at least 50 °F (10 °C).,
Choose the right location.,
Enrich the soil with organic compost if needed.,
Space hollyhock plants 12 to 24 inches (30 to 61 cm) apart.

,
Mulch the soil around the plants with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) of organic matter.,
Water hollyhocks regularly.,
Stake the flowers or tie them up with twine if they become top heavy or are having trouble standing.,
Continue to water the plants after they are done blooming.,
Harvest the seed pods when they turn brown and are completely dry.,
Plant or store the hollyhock seeds.,
Cut the plants down to ground level and cover them with a layer of mulch for winter protection.",How to Grow Hollyhocks," Hollyhocks come in an assortment of shades of white, yellow, pink, maroon and red flowers, which grow on 6 to 9 foot (1.8 to 2.7 m) (1.8 to 2.7 m) stalks.


Hollyhocks will reseed themselves for subsequent growing years. You can also harvest seeds from plants in the fall.;
, Start hollyhock seeds indoors in the fall. Germinate the seeds in October or November and allow them to grow for a while and experience a winter. This may trick the flowers into blooming the following spring.

, Hollyhock seeds are large, have a high germination rate and come few to a package, so it is best to plant each seed individually. Put each seed 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.5 to 1 cm) below the soil.


Place the trays near a window where they receive sunlight.
Water the soil as needed to keep it moist. Hollyhock seeds usually germinate in 1 to 2 weeks.

, Keep the pots in a sunny spot and allow the hollyhocks to grow indoors through the fall and winter.

, Alternatively, you can sow the hollyhock seeds directly in the ground at this time if you did not start plants indoors.

, Although hollyhocks can be grown in a number of climates and environments, your plants will thrive if your garden provides them what they need most.


Find an area that receives full sunlight. Hollyhocks can tolerate partial shade as long as they get at least 6 hours of sun daily, but the flowers may be smaller and the colors not as vibrant.
Pick a sheltered spot. Because hollyhocks grow so tall, they tower above many garden flowers, making them more vulnerable to winds and precipitation. Plant them near a wall, tucked into a corner of fencing, or in a garden with other flowers of similar height for best results.

, Hollyhocks do best when grown in rich moist soil.

,, The mulch helps to keep the soil moist, provides a weed barrier, and creates an environment for seeds to burrow into in the fall for spring germination.

, Water them daily while the plants are getting established, then water twice a week for the rest of the growing season whenever rain supply is inadequate.

, Tie the flowers loosely to allow for good air circulation.

, Seed pods on the stalks are still nourishing and growing seeds for next year's flowers.

, Pick the pods and separate the seeds from the thin, dry husk. Or, leave the pods on the plants and they will dry and open, dropping seeds for propagation.

, You have three options:


Plant seeds the same area of the garden if your hollyhocks did well in that spot, or just let them fall off the plant to the ground. Fall-planted seeds will winter over and germinate in the spring.
Sow the seeds immediately in seed trays for indoor growing if you want to start another cycle of indoor hollyhocks in hopes of first spring blooming.
You could also store the seeds in the refrigerator for outdoor planting next year.

, Some growers prefer to leave several inches of the plant intact and cover the stump with coal ash. The ash keeps moisture away from the stem and discourages snails and slugs.

Consider using ice plants as a ground cover.,
Edge your garden with ice plants.,
Plant ice plants in window boxes.,
Consider your climate when planting ice plants.",How to Grow Ice Plants1," Ice plants grow to a height of 3 to 6 inches and width of 1 to 2 feet, which makes them suitable for use as a ground-cover plant. They thrive in the dry, gravelly soil of desert landscapes and rock gardens.


They can be planted in a landscape with any other plants that thrive in dry, gravelly soil like cactus and agave.;
, Their short height also makes them useful as an edger plant or plant that grows along the edge of a landscaped area.

, There are trailing types of ice plants with stems that grow to a height of only 1 to 2 inches then hang down, growing to a length of 9 to 18 inches. They are ideal for window boxes and containers on the patio or deck.


“Starburst” (Delosperma floribundum “Starburst”) is a popular trailing cultivar. Its flowers have a white center with purple petals.“Basutoland” (Delosperma nubigenum “Basutoland”) is a yellow-flowering trailing ice plant.

, Ice plants are hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 6 to 10 and can withstand average winter lows down to −10 °F (−23 °C)."
"
Make sure your soil drains well.,
Watch out for signs of rot.,
Pick out a location where your ice plant will get at least six hours of sunlight each day.Eight to ten hours of sunlight is even better.,
Give ice plants space.",How to Grow Ice Plants2," The garden soil must be gravelly, loamy, sandy-loam or sandy. Loam is soil that is loose and crumbly. Ice plants will not thrive in clay soil due to the fact that clay soil does not drain quickly.If your soil is clay, build a raised bed and fill it with sandy-loam soil for the ice plants or grow them in containers. Use sandy-loam soil or a potting mix formulated for cacti when growing ice plants in containers or raised beds. Sandy-loam soil is readily available in 10 or 20 pound bags at most garden centers.

, If the soil does not drain quickly enough, the ice plant’s roots will rot, the leaves will turn yellow and drop and the entire plant will eventually die. If the leaves begin to turn yellow, carefully dig up the ice plant and check the roots.


If most of them are brown or black and mushy, the plant will not recover and should be thrown away.
If most of them are white, firm and healthy-looking, trim off the bad roots with sharp scissors and replant it. Let the soil dry out before watering the ice plant again. Root rot is the only disease ice plants are susceptible to but it is a very common cause of death in these plants.

, Plant them in a sunny garden or, if they are planted in containers, set them on a sunny patio or deck.


When ice plants do not get enough sunlight the leaves will become pale and they will bloom very little, if they bloom at all.

, Space plants 16 to 24 inches apart in the garden or in a window box to give the ice plants enough room to reach their mature width.A 10- to 12-inch diameter round or square container will comfortably hold one ice plant.

"
"
Water the ice plants generously immediately after planting them.,
Give your ice plant about 1 inch of water each week.,
Choose your watering device.,
Cut back on your watering regimen after the first couple of months.,
Do not give ice plants supplemental water during the winter.They will not use it and cold, wet soil will cause their roots to rot.

,
Give ice plants fertilizer in the spring when they begin to grow again.,
Use 4 ounces of fertilizer per 25 square feet of garden space.",How to Grow Ice Plants3," This helps to remove air pockets and get the soil to settle around the roots.


If there are pockets of air around the roots, they will dry out and die.

, Do this for the first few months after you have planted them., Ice plants can be watered with a watering can, a soaker hose or the sprinkler. If they are watered with a soaker hose or sprinkler, set a 1-inch deep tuna or cat food can right next to the ice plants. Shut off the sprinkler or soaker hose when the can is full of water.

, These are extremely drought-tolerant plants that do not need supplemental water to survive after the first few months.They will begin to look a little rough, however, during extended periods of drought. The leaves will turn yellow or brown and shrivel. Giving them 1 to 2 inches of water every three to four weeks during an extended dry spell will keep them looking good.

,, Use a balanced garden plant fertilizer with a ratio of 8-8-8 or 10-10-10.This means 8 parts nitrogen, to 8 parts phosphorous, to 8 parts potassium (or potash).

, Sprinkle the fertilizer on the soil around the plants but be careful not to get any on the ice plants. It could burn the leaves and stems.


If fertilizer does get on the plants, wash it off immediately with clear water. Water the ice plants right after spreading the fertilizer to help wash it into the soil.

Look for signs of mealybugs or aphids.,
Use the garden hose to conquer these pests.,
Try using insecticidal soap.,
Create an insecticidal soap mixture.,
Spray the ice plants in the morning or evening until the insecticidal soap is dripping from the leaves.,
Wait one to two hours, then wash the soap off the ice plants with plain water.",How to Grow Ice Plants4," Ice plants are rarely bothered by pests but aphids and mealybugs do occasionally attack them. Both of these insects are generally less than 1/8-inch long. They suck juices from the ice plants and excrete a clear, sticky liquid called honeydew on the leaves. Severe infestations cause slowed plant growth, yellow leaves that eventually drop and can eventually kill the plants.


Aphids are commonly green or red but they can be nearly any color. They have soft bodies, move slowly and rarely have wings.
Mealybugs are flat, immobile insects that are most often off-white, gray or light tan. They are called mealybugs because they have a waxy coating on their backs that looks mealy.

, Both of these insects can be controlled by simply spraying them off the ice plants with a garden hose. Aphids are usually blown onto the plants by the wind and mealybugs are carried by ants. They are crushed by the water from the hose or knocked off the plant and cannot get back on by themselves.


Attach a nozzle to the garden hose and spray the ice plants with the nozzle set at medium pressure. If the water pressure is too strong, it could damage the plants.
The water will also wash off the honeydew these pests create.
Spray the ice plants every few days if the insects return.

, If the infestation is severe and spraying them with the garden hose is not keeping them under control, spray the plants with insecticidal soap.Insecticidal soap works by smothering aphids and mealybugs when they are sprayed.


Commercially formulated insecticidal soap works well as it is more refined but mild dish soap mixed with water will also work.

, Commercially formulated insecticidal soap is available in concentrated and ready-to-use formulas. Concentrated forms should be mixed with water at a rate of 5 tablespoons per gallon.


Mix it thoroughly and pour it into a spray bottle.
Use the same amount of mild dish soap in water, if you prefer, but do not use dishwasher soap, laundry soap or dish soap that is highly concentrated. Those types of soaps will damage the leaves of the ice plants.

, Make sure the stems, undersides of the leaves and tops of the leaves are coated. Do not spray them in the afternoon when the sunlight is strongest or when temperatures rise above 85 °F (29 °C).


The heat and strong sunlight will make the soap dry too quickly and could cause damage to the leaves.

, The soap will only kill aphids and mealybugs that are already on the ice plants and, if left on the plants, it could damage the leaves.


Repeat the treatment once each week if these insects continue to attack the ice plants.

Find a good place to plant the impatiens.,
Plan to plant your impatiens when the soil warms up.,
Prepare the soil for planting.,
Dig holes and plant the impatiens.,
Keep them moist at all times.,
Fertilize impatiens.",How to Grow Impatiens," In springtime, most gardening centers and nurseries carry flats of of impatiens seedlings in a variety of colors, making it easy to pick up a few trays of your favorites. Buy impatiens in one color or mix and match so you can create a colorful pattern in your garden.


There are three common varieties of impatiens that each come in slightly different colors and have different petal sizes. The Tom Thumb varieties have large, bold-colored flowers; the Super Elfin varieties have pastel colored-flowers; and the Swirl varieties have orange and red colors with swirled patterns on the petals.It's quite easy to plant impatiens seedlings, but you can also choose to start them from seed if you'd like. You'll need to sow the seeds in seed starting mix in January to get them ready for spring planting. Press the seeds lightly into the mix and keep the the seed trays moist and around 70 °F (21 °C).;
, Impatiens wither quickly when they don't get enough water. Whether you purchase seedlings or start your impatiens from seed, you'll need to make sure they stay moist until you're ready to set them out in pots or plant them in the ground.


If you keep your potted seedlings outside, do not put them in direct sunlight, as this could dry out the small pots quickly.

, Impatiens do equally well in pots, planters and garden beds. They like shady spots, so choose an area that has partial shade throughout the day. Make sure the soil is moist but well-drained, since impatiens can get mildew if they spend time in standing water.


Impatiens grow best in USDA hardiness zones 10 and 11.This includes parts of the southern and southwestern United States.
To determine whether an area drains well, take a look at the spot after a heavy rain. If you see standing water and puddles, you'll need to add peat or another mix into the soil to help it drain better. You may also want to try re-directing rainwater flowing into the area. If the water gets absorbed, it should be a fine spot for planting.

, Impatiens should not be set into the ground or planted in pots until after the last frost, when the soil has become warm and there's no chance the flowers will freeze. Planting them too early will result in wilting, and they may die before the warm season gets underway.

, Impatiens like soil that is rich and moist. You can prepare the soil by tilling it to a depth of 12 inches, then mixing in some compost or a light application of fertilizer. If you're planting impatiens in pots, buy nutrient-rich potting soil., Dig holes as deep as the impatiens' root balls and set them into the ground or pot. The holes may be spaced 8 to 12 inches apart, depending on your preference. Lightly press soil around the bases of the stems. Water the impatiens thoroughly after planting.


Impatiens can be planted close together to make nice borders in a flower bed. You can set a few in a container spaced 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) apart.
Instead of a container, you may choose to set your impatiens in hanging baskets. Your impatiens will soon grow together and cover any bare soil that is in between them.

, Impatiens will wilt quickly if their soil is allowed to dry out. Water them around the roots in the morning every few days. Avoid watering impatiens in the evening and keeping them wet overnight, since they are prone to getting mildewed when conditions are overly wet.


Planters dry out faster than the ground, so you may have to water flowers in pots more often.

, You may either use a slow-release fertilizer according to package instructions or apply a liquid fertilizer every few weeks."

Purchase field-grown hosta plants.,
Choose an area in the yard that receives partial sun.,
Prepare the soil.,
Space hosta plants in the garden 10 to 24 inches (25 to 60 cm).,
Mulch the soil around the hosta plants to help it retain moisture and keep down weeds.,
Water hosta plants regularly.,
Divide your hosta plants to create new plants if they start to overcrowd.",How to Grow Hostas," You can buy these from a local nursery or garden center, or buy them from a mail supply plant company that offers greater variety.


You can grow hostas from seeds, but the germination rate is very low. Additionally, most plants produced from non-hybridized seeds are small, spindly and are not as attractive as hybrid plants.;
, Hostas are shade tolerant, not shade loving. They will survive in full shade but do best in areas where they receive morning sun and are shaded during the hot afternoon.

, Till the soil to loosen it to a depth of 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm). Amend the soil with compost, humus or sand if needed. Hostas prefer loose, well-drained soil.

, Spacing varies depending on the variety of the hosta you plant and the size you expect it to grow.


Varieties of hostas that grow fast produce shorter plants. These have a wide-spreading shallow root network and work well as ground cover. Place these plants closer together and allow them to fill in and prevent weed growth.
Varieties that grow at least 12 inches tall (30 cm) and have more horizontal than vertical growth can be spaced closer together and used as border or edging plants. These types of hostas are also commonly used around the base of trees.

, After hosta plants are established, they don't need much weeding.


Use cocoa mulch or pine straw to mulch around hostas. These products have the added benefit of also repelling slugs, the biggest pest problem that affects hostas. Avoid using shredded leaves or other plant matter as mulch, because those products attract slugs.
Keep the layer of mulch to 2 inches (5 cm) thick or less. Over-mulching around hostas encourages voles (field mice) that tunnel through the mulch and eat the hosta leaves.

, These large-leaved plants have a high water transpiration rate, so they require plenty of water. Although they can withstand drought, hostas do best if given 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water weekly. For best results water the plants every 2 to 4 days.

, You can divide hostas at any time; but if you live in an area with harsh winters, it is best to divide and transplant your hostas in the spring so they are well established before the first frost.


Dig the hosta plant out of the ground and lay it on the surface of the soil.
Use a sharp shovel or knife to cut the plant into 2 or 3 pieces. Make sure there is at least one stem growth point (or eye)on each new plant.
Put one piece of the plant back in the original hole and transplant the other pieces to new spots.

Start from seed or seedlings in spring or early summer.,
Transfer the seedlings to larger pots or the garden.,
Feed when you can see the buds forming.,
Water freely during the warmer and hot months.,
Cut off dead flowers and dry foliage regularly.,
Sprinkle the plants with water in warmer climates.,
Propagate by division.,
Increase the bloom.,
Don't forget to use them as cut flower.",How to Grow Gerbera Daisies," If you purchase seeds, sow these into small seedling containers. Leave on a sunny windowsill to germinate. Turn every few days to encourage straight growth.;
, It is important to bring the seedlings outside gradually, to get them used to being outdoors. Try growing them on the porch first, to let them ease into the temperature changes.


If the seedlings are going into a pot, plant into pots approximately 13 cm/ 5"" in diameter. Keep out of direct sunlight but provide plenty of light as gerbera loves sun.Garden: Plant in well-drained soil that has been dug over. Position the gerbera daisy plants in a cool, well ventilated and bright part of the garden. Avoid direct sunlight, however, as it will get sunburned.Burke's Backyard, however, says that gerberas thrive in full sun, so you may need to experiment with different types and those grown to your local conditions are likely to be fine.It is also important to have a warm climate; if you are growing them in a colder climate, protect them from cold blasts and frosts.Be sure to keep the crown 1-2cm/1"" above the soil level to prevent disease.

,


The flowers will form a few months after sowing; feeding (fertilising) will encourage bigger flowers.Slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer, such as 15-5-15 are preferred for gerberas, at the rate recommended on the package for the size of your bed/container.
Water the plants immediately after fertilizing, rinsing the foliage with the water. The leaves are easily burned while coming in contact with a fertilizer.

, Water sparingly during winter and cold spells.

, With a pair of clean, sharp secateurs, clean up your gerberas at a regular interval. This reduces the chance of diseases, and makes your plants look more beautiful.

, Gerberas need a regular morning bathing to survive better in a hot weather.

, Gardeners who live in areas where gerberas are hardy -- can propagate them through division. In spring, or at the beginning of the rainy season (if you have a rainy season), dig up the existing plants and pry apart their root crowns with your fingers. Snip off any dead roots or shriveled foliage, leaving some good roots and at least one growth bud on each division. Use pruning shears which have been cleaned with rubbing alcohol to make any necessary cuts, cleaning the blades of those shears again between each plant. When replanting the divisions, position each one with its root crown slightly higher than the surrounding soil.

, Gerberas can be induced to produce more flowers by


Providing more space to each plant, so that they don't have to compete for food, water and air
Keeping the potting soil continuously moist (not soggy) during the summer days
Deadheading the spent blooms regularly
Providing adequate sunlight for at least 6 hours a day
Morning misting with water daily during hot weather days.

, Gerberas have excellent vase life and look very pretty when different colours are arranged together in a vase. You can also prepare a bouquet yourself with them and gift your near and dear ones.

",How to Grow Hibiscus Outdoors1," Plant your hibiscus in a pot that is at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in diameter, or twice the size of the root ball. The container should have drainage holes.;
, Choose a soil that is loamy and well draining. A mixture of 2 parts potting soil, 1 part river sand and 1 part peat moss works well, as hibiscus prefer to be well-drained and aerated.

,,, Frequency will depend upon placement of your plant and how much sunlight it receives. Some experts recommend a drip-feed watering system to regulate the moisture.

, Use a 7-2-7 fertilizer, as hibiscus plants prefer a lower amount of phosphorous and only slightly acidic soil. Fertilize once every 2 weeks. Container plants require extra fertilization due to a smaller absorption area.

, Remove all yellowed leaves, and trim back any leggy or sagging branches with pruning shears.

Fertilize with liquid fertilizer such as 20-20-20 or 15-30-15.",How to Grow Geraniums," Whether you are planting your geraniums in the ground or in a pot, geraniums are generally one of the easier plants to take care of. They can be planted in spots that get full sun, partial sun, or light shade. Generally, geraniums are happiest with five or six hours of sunlight a day, though this number can be a bit more or a bit less. It is best to plant geraniums in soil that drains well. Geraniums don’t really like getting their feet too wet and soggy soil could lead to a sick plant.If you live in an area that is really hot a lot of the year, try to find a spot that gets afternoon shade and has relatively moist soil.;
, Buy a pot that is large enough for your plant, depending on the variety of geranium you bought. If you have a smaller plant, you may be fine with a 6 or 8 inch (15.2 or 20.3 cm) pot, while larger varieties will need a 10 inch (25.4 cm) pot.

, The National Gardening Association recommends planting geraniums in Spring, after the last hard frost. Depending on the type of geranium, the plant may bloom in midsummer, late summer, or fall, though sometimes the flowers have a mind of their own and they’ll burst into bloom in spring. Regardless, be prepared for their beauty to pop up anytime but winter.

, Geraniums flourish in soil that has been tilled and is loose. Use a tiller or rake to ensure that the soil is loose a good 12 to 15 inches (30.5 to 38.1 cm) down. After loosening the soil, mix in 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) of compost to give the soil as much nutrients as possible.

, Depending on the type of geranium, you will want to separate each plant by 6 inches (15.2 cm) to 2 feet (0.6 m) in distance. If you have picked up a larger variety of geranium, you will want to give each plant a good 2 feet (0.6 m) of space to grow.

, Each hole should be roughly double the diameter of the plastic pot that the geranium is contained in. For example, if you bought a geranium that came in a 6-inch plastic pot, you should make a hole that is 1 foot (0.3 m) in diameter.


If you choose to grow your geraniums from seeds, sow them directly into the ground. If you do choose to use seeds, know that your plants will take longer to grow and blossom. If you are sowing seeds in a pot, start your pot off indoors while the seeds take root. Once the seeds begin to sprout, you can move the pot outside.

, Gently take the geranium out of its container, making sure to not break any of its roots. Place the plant in the hole so that the plant’s root ball (the bundle of roots that have been squished together in the plastic container) is level with the surface of the soil. Fill the rest of the hole up with soil and pat the soil down around the plant so that the geranium can stand up on its own. Water your plant immediately.


Try to avoid putting soil on the stem of the plant, as a buried stem could lead to a rotting plant.

, Geraniums are considered relatively drought resistant, but that doesn’t mean you should never water them. To tell if your plants need to be watered, check the soil. Use your fingernail to scratch just below the surface of the soil--if it is dry or barely moist, you should water your flowers.For geraniums in pots, make sure that you give them enough water. Water the plants until the water runs out the bottom (hence why you need holes in the bottom of your pot.)

, Each spring, you should add a new layer of compost around your geraniums. Place 2 inches (5.1 cm) of mulch on top of this layer of composted soil. The mulch will help to keep the soil moist, and will also reduce the number of weeds brave enough to grow around your geraniums., After the flower has bloomed, remove the dead flowers and parts of the plant so that it can regrow healthy and strong. Remove leaves and stalks that have died (they will be brown in color) so that your plant does not grow any fungus (which appears on dead parts of plants.)

, Once your plants have grown large (and most likely extended their boundaries a good deal,) you should separate the plants. Divide the plants in late spring. To do this, lift the plants (and their roots) out of the ground, separate the plants by the clumps they have grown around their stems, and replant them.

, Follow the directions on the fertilizer to know how much and how often to fertilize. Try to keep from getting fertilizer on the plant leaves.

",How to Grow Gazania," The seed should be planted in winter, the seedlings in spring. If planting seeds, use a peat and sand mix and expect the seeds to germinate in around two to three weeks.;
, Gazanias need a warm growing climate that stays above 8ºC during the night. If you can't guarantee this, they'll need to be planted in a greenhouse.

, The sunnier the better.

, This plant cannot be water-logged.

, Follow with deep but infrequent watering. The soil should be allowed to partially dry out between watering. Once this plant is established, it is fairly drought tolerant.

Choose a good quality soil.",How to Grow Geraniums in Pots1," Geranium roots will rot if they sit in water for an extended period of time, so adequate drainage is essential.;
, Many varieties can fill a 10-inch (25.4-cm) pot, but some smaller varieties can thrive in a 6- to 8-inch (15- to 20-cm) pot. These flowers do well when the roots don't have the option of spreading too far, but they must still have adequate room to develop.

, If you plan on moving the plant around, avoid heavier clay pots and stick to plastic.

, Dirty pots may contain bacteria or insect eggs that are too small for the naked eye to see. These hidden dangers could prevent your flowers from reaching their full potential.

, Using cuttings from mother plants or purchasing seedlings at a garden store are the easiest methods of starting a potted geranium, but you can also use seed.

, A cheap soil may retain too much moisture, which will lead to root rot once you plant your geraniums. These flowers thrive best in soil that drains well, especially if it contains traces of organic material.

Start geraniums from seed indoors.,
Fill the pot with soil.,
Spot the top of the soil with seeds.,
Cover the seeds with soil.",How to Grow Geraniums in Pots2," Early to mid-April is usually standard. Once the seeds start to sprout, you can move them outdoors. Just make sure that the last frost of the season has already passed.

, Allow the soil to remain fairly loose, as tightly packed soil can suffocate the plant.

, Space seeds a few inches apart from one another. This space is necessary to ensure that the flowers will have room to grow without suffocating another's roots.

, Only apply a light layer of soil, as too much soil may prevent the seeds from germinating.

Plant seedlings or cuttings after the last frost passes.,
Fill your chosen pot with soil.,
Dig a shallow hole in the soil.,
Pack the soil around the geranium to hold it in place.",How to Grow Geraniums in Pots3," They can be kept either indoors or outdoors.

, Leave the soil loose so the plant's roots have room to breathe.

, It should be just large enough to rest the seedling's root system in. The general rule of thumb is that the seedling should be as deep in your soil as it was in the original container. Do not plant the seedling any deeper, since stems can actually begin to rot and decay if covered by soil.

, Do so carefully to avoid breaking or tearing the stem of the plant, since a damaged stem weakens the integrity of the plan and provides an opening for diseases to enter in.

Fertilize your geraniums once a month using a liquid fertilizer.,
Remove dying flowers regularly.,
Remove brown leaves and faded stalks to minimize the risk of fungal disease.",How to Grow Geraniums in Pots4," Geraniums require six to eight hours of direct sunlight to thrive, but some varieties prefer a bit of shade in the afternoon.

, Test the soil by poking your finger into the top inch. If the soil is dry all the way through the top inch, provide the flowers with enough water to dampen the soil without soaking it.

, An abundance of fertilizer will cause your geraniums to produce many strong, healthy leaves, but it will also prevent blooms from developing and may lead to a plant with minimal flowering.


You can also use a slow-release, granular fertilizer. Only apply this fertilizer once, during the spring.

, You can usually tell when a flower is dying because the color fades and the blossom begins to wilt. The removal of dead flower heads will encourage the plant to continue blooming.

, Decomposed leaves and stalks are likely to cause ""Botrytis"" or other fungi to form.

The Kleim’s Hardy Gardenia is one of the only gardenia varieties that can withstand relatively cold temperatures.Other varieties that are more suited for colder weather include Chuck Hayes and Frost Proof.;
, Gardenias need a home that receives full to partial sunlight. They like the warmth of the sun for proper growth. Strive to give your gardenia direct morning sun rather than direct afternoon sun.


If you are putting your gardenia in an indoor pot, you will want to keep it near a south-facing window so that it can get bright, indirect sunlight for most of the day.

, Gardenias grow best when they are planted in rich soil that is moist but well-drained. Gardenias do best in soils with acidic pH levels. Try to maintain a pH of 5 or 6. You may want to have your soil tested and then add nutrients according to the results. In particular, if your soil is too basic you will want to add sulfur., While you can still plant your gardenias outside windows so that you can enjoy their lovely smell, you do not want to plant them right up against your house or walkways. The soil near concrete changes in alkalinity and gardenias will struggle when planted in soil with too high of a pH level.

, Gardenias like soil that is rich in nutrients. Work fertilizer, peat moss or manure into the soil to enhance the growth of your plant.

, Plant your gardenias either in the fall or spring. If you are planting more than one gardenia, you must leave three to six feet of space in between each plant. The hole you make should be twice as wide as the plant’s root ball and only as deep as its length.If you are planting your gardenia in a pot, follow the same instructions--the pot will have to be large enough that you can make a hole that is twice as wide as the root ball.

, Cover the root ball with soil so that it is halfway covered, then water the hole. Adding water before you fully cover the gardenia removes any air bubbles and settles the soil. After the water has settled, cover the root ball the rest of the way and pat the soil down around the gardenia. Water the soil and plant again.

, In particular, pine mulch works well because it adds to the acidic nature of the soil. Keep the soil surrounding the plant moist until its roots are well established. The mulch should be two inches thick, but shouldn’t touch the base of the plant.

, Try to avoid getting the leaves and blooms soaking wet, as wet leaves are more prone to fungal growth. Water the plant more during extremely dry periods. Gardenias need less water when they are not blooming. Gardenias thrive best when given distilled room-temperature water rather than cold water.Check the topsoil of your potted gardenias before watering. If it is still damp, hold off on watering. Many gardenia experts recommend placing your gardenia on a pebble filled tray. You can then pour water on the pebbles, which will in turn provide humidity and moisture for your gardenia., Gardenias should be fertilized every three weeks. You should use an acid-based fertilizer as gardenias prefer acidic soil and fertilizer. Established plants need fertilizer each March and October.Choose from fertilizers such as 6-6-6, 10-10-10, 20-20-20 or 16-4-8. You may find it easier to use a water soluble fertilizer with your gardenias.

, You should only prune your plant when it is not producing blooms. You should never cut all of the leaves off the plant. You should also ‘deadhead’ your plant after it is done pruning. This means removing the dead flowers to help your plant produce more blooms.

, In particularly, you should check your gardenias for whiteflies and mealybugs. Other gardenia pests include aphids, spider mites, and thrips. If you notice that your plants have a pest problem, use a horticultural oil to get rid of them.


Over-watering your plants and planting them too close to one another are both causes of pest problems. Avoid doing both of these things.

If propagating, take stem (softwood) cuttings during the summer.
Heliotrope can also be grown from seed. Purchase from specialist nursery suppliers, or check online.;
, If planting in the garden or as a border plant, choose a spot that gets lots of bright light. However, avoid anywhere with too much heat. During winter, heliotrope needs cool temperatures.


Heliotrope will tolerate sun to partial shade.
Alternatively, choose a container for the plant. This is ideal if you live with snowed-in winters, as heliotrope usually won't survive the very cold temperatures.
Heliotrope grows well in window boxes; the scent will drift in through your open window.

, The soil needs to retain moisture constantly without being water logged.


Heliotrope can tolerate soils that range from mildly acidic to mildly alkaline.

, The plant needs plentiful water during the warmer months when it's growing and blooming––do not let it dry out between waterings. Water sparingly during winter.

, Apply an all-purpose fertilizer in spring if growing in a garden bed. If grown in a container, apply a liquid feed monthly during spring and summer.

, Heliotrope can become a little scraggly if left to its own devices. Prune the plant in spring to remove dead flower heads and to keep the plant compact."

,
Place one corm in each hole with the pointed side, or growth point, facing up and scar side facing down.

,
Fill the holes back up with soil.",How to Grow Gladiolus1," You can buy them from mail order companies, but it's best to purchase hand-picked corms to ensure they are of the highest quality.


Look for plump corms with thick centers for best the quality bloom. Avoid flat corms.
Base the size of the corms that you purchase on the size of the glads you want to grow. Choose corms with diameters of 1/2 to 3/4 inches (1.25 to 2 cm) to grow flowers from 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m). Corms with diameters of 1 inch (2.5 cm) or greater grow larger flowers.;
,, Glads prefer full sun but will tolerate partial shade.

,, Gladiolus grown in soil without adequate drainage are more prone to disease.

Add organic compost, decomposed manure, ground bark or peat moss to the soil if drainage is a problem.






Raise the level of the gladiola garden 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) to elevate the plants from standing water if puddles still remain on the soil surface 4 to 5 hours after a heavy rain.







, Plant additional glads at 2-week intervals to extend their blooming season. Stop planting in mid-June to ensure the plants have ample flowering time.

,,, Thoroughly water the entire area.

Stake the individual plants as they grow taller.,
Cut the flower spikes when 1 to 3 florets are open.,
Remove leaves from the bottom 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of the stems and put them in warm water.

,
Leave the flowers in a dark, cool area for several hours before exposing them to light and arranging and displaying them.

",How to Grow Gladiolus2," Glads often loose ground to weeds.

,, Use one that contains carbaryl or malathion when the gladiolas are around 6 inches (15 cm) tall to protect them from thrips.


Thrips are tiny insects not visible to the naked eye. They cause streaky white leaves and discolored, misshapen, unhealthy flowers. Thrip control must be preventative because once signs of damage are visible, it is too late to save the flowers.

, You can also use stakes and twine to create cluster staking if you are growing several glads close together. Staking and tying these tall flowers helps to minimize storm and wind damage.

, The remaining flowers will continue to open in water.


Harvest the flowers during early morning or evening hours when they are at their freshest.
Cut the flowers with a sharp knife at a diagonal angle. Take care to leave at least 4 to 6 leaves on the plant to mature and nourish the corm that is still growing beneath the soil.

Stake the plants when they begin to grow tall.,
Water the freesias throughout the growing season.,
Wait until the foliage is yellow to remove it.,
Dry the bulbs or let them rest.,
Cut freesias at the height of their bloom.,
Provide clean water and flower food.,
Keep the vase bacteria-free.",How to Grow Freesias," Freesias grow from bulbs that must be planted at a particular time of year to thrive. The season when you plant your freesias depends on what growing zone you live in. Check out a growing zone finder to determine when to plant freesias in your particular region.Freesias are hardy in growing zones 9 and 10, meaning they'll survive the winter in these warmer areas. If you live in one of these zones, you should plan to plant your freesia bulbs in the early fall to give them time to sprout roots and get established.
If you live in a cooler growing zone, such as zones 1-9, the freesias will die over the winter if you plant them in the fall. It's best to wait until spring, just after the last chance of frost has passed. That way the fragile buds will grow and thrive.;
, Freesia bulbs, also called corms, look similar to green onions. Buy them from a nursery the same day or just a few days before you plan to put them in the ground. If you live in a cooler growing zone, wait until spring to purchase your freesia bulbs.


Purchase bulbs that have been prepared by going through a dormancy period and that are now ready to grow. Talk to your local flower store or nursery to help you find the right bulbs.

, Choose a spot that gets full sun. Freesias won't bloom if they're planted in the shade. They need full sun to thrive and have a long blooming season. Choose a planting spot that gets full sun for at least eight hours every day.The soil should be relatively fertile, but it's not usually necessary to amend the soil to change its pH. That said, freesias do need soil that drains well. They need a lot of water, and if it sits around their bulbs and roots it will cause them to rot.


When you have a spot picked out, check to see how it drains by digging a hole and filling it with water. If the water stands in the hole and drains very slowly, you'll need to choose another spot or add material to the soil to help it drain better.
If you've chosen a planting spot that doesn't drain well, till the soil to a depth of 12 inches and work in compost, peat, or other organic matter to raise the soil by three inches., Dig holes one to two inches deep, three to four inches apart. Place the freesia bulbs in the holes with the pointed ends up. Cover the bulbs with soil and pat it gently, then water the planting bed thoroughly. The sprouts will emerge in two to three weeks.

, If you'd like to plant freesias in a pot, choose a pot with adequate draining holes and fill it with a standard potting mix. Plant the bulbs two inches apart and two inches deep. Keep the container indoors after planting, and move it into full sun once the plants begin to sprout., When you see the first sprouts emerge, you can help them get off to a good start by feeding them a potash-rich fertilizer, such as comfrey pellets.Scatter the pellets near the base of the sprouts and gently press them into the soil. This step isn't strictly necessary, but it can be helpful if the soil where you live isn't very rich.

, When they reach a height of six to eight inches, freesias need support so they don't fall over. Provide small stakes next to each plant, and gently lean the freesias against them. Check the stakes from time to time to ensure they're providing enough support.


If you have a large bed of freesias, you can support them by suspending a plastic mesh 1-2 feet (50 to 75 cm) above the ground. Place stakes on the corners of the bed, and attach the mesh at the corners. The plants will grow up the mesh.

, Since the freesias are planted in full sun, their soil will dry out quickly. Keep it damp, but not soggy throughout the growing season. After about 120 days, the freesias will bloom. Continue watering them well until the blooms begin to fade, at which point you can taper off the watering until they die and fall off.


Water freesias in the morning, so the planting bed has time to dry out before nightfall. If water sits around the plants all night, mold could begin to grow.
Water around the base of freesias, rather than spraying it over the leaves and blooms, so that the plants don't get cooked in strong sun.

, Once the flowers have gone, let the leaves continue to grow. Wait until they're yellow before removing them. They continue providing energy to the plant until they die. The stored energy will help your freesias come back strong the following year.After the first frost, ""lift"" the freesias by cutting back the leaves and stems to one inch above the ground.
This step isn't necessary if you live in a hot growing region and the freesia's leaves never yellow and die.

, If you don't live in growing zones 9 or 10, you'll need to dig up the bulbs and let them dry out over the winter, then replant them again in the spring. If you don't protect them from the cold, the bulbs won't survive the winter. Dig up the bulbs and place them in a cool, dry space for the winter, then plant them after the last frost has gone.


In the warmer climates of growing zones 9 and 10, you can leave the bulbs in the ground. They'll come up again in the spring, having survived the winter.

, Freesia plants will continue to thrive after cutting, so there's no harm done if you want to bring some inside to enjoy in your home. Use a clean pair of pruning shears or a sharp knife and make a diagonal cut toward the base of the stem, leaving a few inches of stem intact.


Don't use scissors to cut freesias, since they pinch the stem instead of making a clean cut. A clean cut will ensure the cut freesias last a long time, and it does less damage to the plant.
Potted freesias may also be cut. Avoid bringing the entire pot inside, though, since freesias will die without adequate sunlight.

, Freesias can last up to three weeks indoors if you feed them flower food. Fill a vase with clean water and empty a packet of flower food from the nursery inside. Alternatively, you can add a teaspoon of sugar syrup to provide food for the flowers. Add more food each time you change the water, which should be done every few days.

, Another way to ensure your flowers last a long time is to use a very clean vase with no residue from previous bouquets. Any little bit of bacteria can cause the flowers to rot more quickly. In addition to using a clean vase and changing the water every few days, try adding a teaspoon of bleach to the water when you change it. The bleach kills bacteria and keeps the flowers perky far longer than when you don't use it.

Take a cutting from a healthy fuchsia plant.,
Trim away extra leaves.,
Dip the cutting in rooting hormone.,
Fill a small pot with potting mix.,
Place the cuttings in indirect sunlight.,
Keep the soil moistened.,
Transplant fuchsias to a larger pot as they grow.",How to Grow Fuchsia1," Choose a stem that has a growing tip with at least two pairs of leaves under it. Snip the stem off just above the set of leaves that are third from the top. The cutting should be about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) long., Use a sharp knife to remove the extra leaves sticking out from the leaf node, as well as the stem below the leaf node.

, Apply hormone powder to the cut portion of the stem by quickly dipping the end into the powder. Rooting hormone encourages the development of roots.

, A well-drained and nutritional mix, like one made with compost and vermiculite, works well. Use a 2.25-inch (7.5-cm) pot for one cutting or 3-inch (7.6-cm) pot for three to four cuttings.

, The cuttings need plenty of light to thrive, but direct sun can cause more harm than good. A good place to let them sit would be beneath a sunny window with sheer curtains.

, Use a spray bottle and apply enough water to keep the surface of the growing medium moist, but do not soak it. If the plants sit in water, the stem may rot.

, Once the plant has several stems growing off it, the roots should be sturdy enough to transplant. Carefully pry the plant—stems, roots, and soil—from its current container. Transfer each plant individually into separate pots that are at least 3.5 inches (9 cm). Make sure that the pots have been previously filled with the same growing medium.


Note that instead of planting the fuchsia cutting into a smaller pot and later transplanting it into a larger, ""middle stage"" pot, you can also plant the cutting directly into this middle stage pot. You will need to be more vigilant about proper lighting and watering conditions in order to ensure that the cutting takes root, though.
Continue keeping the soil moist, and provide the same type of sun you provided while in the beginning stages.

"
"
Transplant fuchsias once a sturdy root ball develops.,
Choose a location that receives a decent amount of morning sun.,
Prepare the soil.Dig a hole that is 6 inches (15.24 cm) deeper than the depth of the fuchsia's current container and just a little bit wider.,
Place the fuchsia into the hole.",How to Grow Fuchsia2," Several stems, each with multiple sets of leaves, should have developed. Gently tug at the base of the center stem to determine if it feels sturdy. If so, tip the pot on its side, slip a short trowel into soil next to the side, and slide the pot away to reveal the soil beneath. If you can see white, even roots that fill the entire pot, the plant is ready to be moved to the garden. If not, you should wait a few more days or weeks.

, An east facing spot works best. Depending on the variety, you may need a location that receives shade by the afternoon. Varieties with lighter blossoms or double blossoms tend to need more shade, but bright red, single blossoms can stand a little more sunlight.

, In the hole, add compost and garden-grade manure, both of which are available at garden and farm supply stores. These elements improve the quality of the soil. Fill 1/4 to 1/2 of the hole with these elements.

, Slide it out of it current container and place it, root side down, into the hole. Pack more compost and manure into the gap around the newly planted root ball.

Keep the plant moist.,
Apply fertilizer.,
Remove dying blooms and seed pods.As blooms start to wither, you should pluck them off the plant.,
Watch out for pests and diseases.These plants are not prone to many pests, but aphids are drawn to them occasionally.,
Do a more intense pruning after the danger of frost passes.,
Lay mulch over the plants during winter.",How to Grow Fuchsia3," Normal rain conditions during spring and fall months usually provide more than enough water, but you may need to supplement water during the summer, especially if you live in a dry climate. The soil the plants sit in should never become dry, so you will need to check on a daily basis. Do not over-water, however. Fuchsia that sits in water for prolonged periods can cause the roots to rot and the leaves to drop off.


Water in the evening or in the morning to keep the soil appropriately moist. Do not water during the heat of mid-day.

, The plants need weekly fertilization for the first six weeks after being transplanted to the garden. Weekly fertilization is also good during the summer and early autumn. Fertilizer the plant after watering and use a water soluble, balanced fertilizer made of equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

, You should also pluck off blooms when you notice seed pods developing. If the plant senses that enough seeds have developed, it will stop producing blooms for the season. To prolong the blooming season, frequent pruning is necessary.

, Aphids can be removed with a simple pesticide. Gray mold and rust are the two main diseases that attack fuchsias but can usually be avoided as long as the plants do not get too moist. If the plant does develop either disease, a fungicide should be able to treat it.

, For those in the northern hemisphere, that means around March 15 to April 1. Cut the side branches to the edge of the container and snip away weak stems.

, A little mulch will protect the soil from freezing over. You only need a thin layer to keep the soil warm enough for the dormant fuchsia plants.

Harvest the seeds.",How to Grow Foxglove," Foxglove seed is readily available in seed packets on most flower seed stands. If you decide to start foxglove from seed, you'll need to be ready to plant it in early summer. If you're planting seedlings, you may plant in spring or fall.If you're starting from seed, use 4-inch seed trays with seed compost. Lightly press the seeds into the compost. Do not cover the seeds with more compost once they are sown, since they require light to germinate.Plan to plant the seedlings when they are a few inches tall.;
, Foxglove prefer full sun or light shade.Find a place that isn't too windy and gets plenty of sun for most of the day. They should be protected from wind as they are easily buffeted about and can change their growth shape if assaulted by wind too frequently.If your climate is very hot, semi-shade is acceptable.

, Foxglove like soil that is deep, moist, and acidic. Look for a spot that drains well, rather than holding too much water. If you see puddles in an area after a heavy rain, it probably doesn't drain well enough to be a good home for foxglove.

, Use a garden rake or hoe to loosen the soil and rake in compost to a depth of about a foot. This will make sure the soil is suitably rich and ready for the foxglove to take root.


You can use fertilizer instead of compost, but be sure to use a light application. Too much fertilizer will harm the foxglove., They should be twice as wide as the root balls of the seedlings, and deep enough so that you can fit the entire rootball underground.

, Set the root balls into the holes and lightly pat soil around the bases of the stems. Water the area thoroughly.

, This will help nourish the foxglove and so they produce big, healthy blossoms. Cover the compost with a 2-inch layer of mulch to prevent weeds from taking over.

, This is especially important if there hasn't been much rainfall, or if you live in an area that gets very hot.

, If you have a plant that grows several feet tall, you may want to stake it to keep it from breaking. Use a wooden stake and some twine to gently tie the plant upright. This is especially important if you live in a windy area.

, The central stalk requires the most water and energy, so removing it will allow nutrients to flow to smaller stalks, making the plant look more even. Cut the spike at its base.

, It's easy to harvest the seeds of foxglove so you can plant them the following spring. Allow the flowers to wither and remove seeds from the tall central stalk. Store them in a cool, dry place and sow them in the spring.


If you removed the central stalk to promote side shoots, you won't be able to harvest seeds.

Divide overgrown gaura.",How to Grow Gaura," Plan on starting the seeds indoors five to nine weeks before the date you intend to transfer the seedlings to your outdoor garden.For annual varieties, sow the seeds five to six weeks before the anticipated last frost.
For perennial varieties, sow the seeds eight to nine weeks before the anticipated last frost.
Make sure that the spot you choose indoors can maintain a temperature between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 and 24 degrees Celsius).;
, Fill each compartment of a plastic starter tray to the top with sterile potting soil.


Consider using specially blended ""seed starting"" soil for even better results.

, Use your fingers to gently press one seed into each compartment of soil.


The seeds should be barely covered with only a loose layer of soil. Do not plant the seeds too deep. The soil covering the seeds should be no deeper than the thickness of the seed itself., Place the seed tray in a warm, sunny location and water as often as needed to keep the surface of the soil moist.


The soil must remain moist but it should not be drenched. Avoid letting puddles form on the surface of the soil.
Once the seeds germinate, you can cut back on the watering schedule. Seedlings only need enough water to keep the soil moist at a depth between 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm).

, Prepare to transplant gaura seedlings to an outdoor location after the threat of frost has passed in the spring.


If you choose to purchase an established gaura seedling or plant from a garden nursery instead of growing one from seed, the same transplanting guidelines still apply.
Note that many perennial varieties of gaura can be planted after the threat of frost passes in the spring or at the very beginning of autumn, before frost becomes an issue. Annual varieties must be planted in the spring, however.

, Gaura does best when planted in areas receiving full sun, but it can also tolerate spots that receive partial sun and light shade.

, You must choose a spot with well-draining soil. If your garden is filled with heavy soil, you must amend it before transplanting the gaura seedlings.Gaura shrubs develop a long taproot, so you will need to amend the soil to a depth between 1 and 2 feet (30.5 and 61 cm).

Spread 6 inches (15.24 cm) of light organic matter—peat moss, compost, or sand—over the top of the planting area.
Use a shovel to dig the additive down into the soil to the appropriate depth. Make sure that the soil and organic material are evenly mixed. The soil should look notably looser when finished.


Also note that the soil does not need to be especially nutrient-dense, but it should be fairly neutral with a pH between 5.5 and 7.2.

, Use a shovel or a trowel to dig a planting hole for the seedling. The planting hole for each seedling should be twice as wide as the seedling's current container.


The depth of the planting hole should only be about as deep as the current container, though. Avoid planting seedlings too deep. The top of the root mass should be just beneath the surface of the soil.

, Before you remove the seedling from its current container, give the soil a thorough watering.


Watering the soil makes it more compact and easier to move.

, Carefully remove the seedling from its container and center it in the planting hole.


Hold the plant securely at the base of the main stem, just above the surface of the soil and the root mass.
Slowly invert the container until it is tipped diagonally downward.
Squeeze the sides of the container with your other hand or tap on the container with the handle of your trowel or shovel. This should loosen the plant and free it from its container.
Grab the bottom or side of the removed mass. Carefully place the plant right-side up in the planting hole. Continue to hold it steady above the root mass with one hand.

, Use your free hand to fill the rest of the planting hole with soil. Once the plant is stable, let go of it and use both hands to gently pat the soil down.


The soil around the plant should be fairly loose but still packed well enough to hold the plant in place.
Give the entire planting site a thorough watering to help settle the soil.

, Gaura does well when planted in nearby clusters or planted around other perennial shrubs.


Small varieties should be spaced 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) apart.
Large varieties should be spaced 20 to 36 inches (50 to 90 cm) apart.
Planting the gaura close together can prevent the roots and stems from becoming too leggy.

, Gaura are fairly drought-resistant, but you may still need to water them during periods of severe drought since the plant thrives best in moderately moist soil.


You should keep the plant regularly watered during the first growing season. Make sure that it receives a minimum of 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water weekly during this time. Thorough watering during the first season will help the plant establish itself more effectively.
From the second season on, you don't need to be quite as strict about your watering schedule. Only worry about watering the plant when you have gone more than a week without any rain or when the leaves of the gaura shrub seem to be weakening.

, If desired, you can apply an all-purpose general plant fertilizer to the soil at the beginning of spring, before new growth begins.


Look for a fertilizer that contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
Follow the label instructions to determine the best amount and application method.
Note that fertilizer can give the gaura a helpful boost, but these plants are usually hardy enough on their own and may thrive well enough even without the addition of fertilizer.

, Pluck the flowers as they wilt and die or cut away any spent flower spikes after the petals have dropped naturally. Doing so can prolong the plant's blooming period.

, If you live in an area that regularly receives frost over the winter, you should spread 2 inches (5 cm) of wood chip mulch around the base of the plant and over the surrounding soil before the first frost strikes in autumn or winter.


The mulch provides insulation and protects the root of the plant from reaching fatally low temperatures. Gaura plants will usually survive if the above-ground portion freezes, but they can weaken and die easily if the roots freeze.

, Starting in the second year of growth, you should cut the gaura plant back by half its size.If the plant has suffered damage from a winter frost, you can cut it back even more severely until it is only 8 to 10 inches (20 to 30 cm) tall.
The plant grows back quickly and should fully establish itself by the middle of the growing season.
Cutting the plant back will encourage the shrub to become bushy and full. If you do not cut the plant back, it can grow tall and wiry.
Cut the plant back in mid to late spring, preferably after the threat of frost has passed for the season. Cutting the plant back too early can weaken it, and cutting it back any later can delay the blooming period.

, Gaura rarely has any problems with insects or diseases, but there are a few diseases that have been known to strike the plant down.


Root rot is the most common and occurs when gaura is grown in heavy soils with poor drainage.Rust, cercospora leaf spot, septoria leaf spot, downy mildew, and powdery mildew are the next most common diseases. If any of these form on your plant, treat the plant with an appropriate fungicide.

, If you want to fill your garden with more gaura, the easiest way is to let the shrub do the work through the process of self-seeding or self-sowingLeave a few spent flower spikes on the plant instead of plucking them off. These flower spikes should produce seed, and the seed should spread without any interference on your part.

, If the gaura shrub gets too large, you can dig out and divide the root into separate clusters. The clusters you remove can be used to propagate other gaura shrubs.


Do this in the spring for best results.
Treat divided gaura clusters like seedlings when you transplant them.
To divide the overgrown plant:

Thoroughly water the plant the day before you plan to divide it.
Dig out the taproot, keeping as much of it intact and undamaged as possible.
If you cannot untangle the roots with your fingers, use a sterile knife to divide the joined rhizomes. Separate the plant so that each cluster has three to five healthy shoots coming from it.
Replant the established gaura and its divided clusters as soon as possible.

Pick off any Japanese beetles and caterpillars by hand and drown them in a bucket of soapy water.",How to Grow Hibiscus," Though these plants will also grow in the light shade of very tall trees, they will grow more slowly and bloom less.;
, Set your plant in its container outdoors in a bright, sunny area during the summer and move it to a bright location indoors in the fall, where it will be exposed to at least a few hours of direct sunlight each day., While tropical hibiscus are indoors during the fall and winter, temperatures should be kept at 70 to 75 °F (21 to 24 °C) during the day and 55 to 65 °F (13 to 18 °C) at night.

, Mix a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost, well-aged cow manure, leaf mold or decomposed pine bark mulch into the top 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) of soilwith a rototiller to avoid creating pockets of organic matter that will interfere with water absorption.

, Hibiscus require soil with a neutral to slightly alkaline pH of 7 to 7.2. If it is acidic with a pH of 6.8 or lower, sprinkle lime over the soil and till it in to bring the pH up.The amount of lime needed to raise the soil pH will depend on the texture of the soil. Loamy soil requires 1 pound of dolomitic lime to raise the pH of 25 square feet of soil from 6.5 to 7. Sandy soil requires less lime while clay soil requires more., The wind can damage the leaves and break tender branches., The potting soil should be made of 1 part topsoil, 1 part sphagnum peat moss and 1 part coarse sand, perlite or vermiculite.The pH should be around 7 to 7.2. Check the label on the potting soil package to make sure it is within this range.


If the potting soil is acidic with a pH of 6 to 6.5, add 1/2 cup dolomitic lime per 2 gallons (7.6 L) of soil to raise the pH.
Do not use garden soil for planting hibiscus in containers. It will not drain properly and could contain fungal spores or bacteria that will infect the hibiscus.

, However, be sure to keep the mulch a few inches away from the stems. Wet mulch pushed right up against the hibiscus stems will encourage bacterial blight and stem cankers.

, Do this for the first year the hibiscus has been planted or potted, until it becomes well established.Use a soaker hose or water the hibiscus by hand with a watering can to help prevent fungal and bacterial diseases that thrive on wet leaves. Give it 1 inch (2.5 cm) or 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water each time.


Measure how much water is given with a soaker hose by setting a 1-inch deep can next to the hibiscus before turning on the hose. When the can is full, the hibiscus has received 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water.
From the second year on, water the plant when the top 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of soil becomes dry. Give it 2 inches (5.1 cm) or 6 gallons (22.7 L) of water each time.

, Pour the water evenly over the soil until it drains freely from the bottom of the pot.


As the hibiscus will grow much slowly, if at all, during the winter, water it in the winter only when the potting soil is almost completely dry.Keeping the soil too wet in the winter may result in root rot.
Hibiscus will drop their flower buds if they are watered too much or too little.

, Use a slow-release fertilizer that will last for six months so the nutrients are available from mid-spring to early fall while the hibiscus is actively growing.Hibiscus planted in the garden should be given fertilizer formulated for garden plants while container-grown hibiscus should be given fertilizer formulated for houseplants. Garden fertilizer is too strong for container-grown plants and will burn their roots.

, Recommended amounts vary, depending on how the fertilizer is formulated, so follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.


When hibiscus are not getting enough nitrogen, the leaves will turn yellow. You can sprinkle about 1/4 cup of granular 10-10-10 fertilizer over the soil and water it in to give the hibiscus a quick boost. Too much fertilizer will burn the roots and cause the edges of the leaves to turn dry and brown.

, They will not use it because they will be going through a dormant period and it could damage their roots.

, The entire shrub can be pruned back by up to one-third with hand pruners right after it blooms. This will encourage new branch growth and more flowers, as hibiscus bloom on new branch growth.Make the pruning cuts about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above a leaf. New branches will grow from just below where the old branch is cut.
Remove the fading flowers before they go to seed to encourage another flush of flowers.

, Hibiscus are susceptible to a number of diseases, including bacterial blight, leaf spots, and rust. Bacterial blights and leaf spots are spread by environmental factors like wind, splashing water, and insects. These diseases will cause yellow-edged tan or brown lesions on the leaves and flowers.Rust, a fungal disease that causes an orange powdery substance to form on the leaves, is also spread the same way., This is a gray mold that is similar to bacterial blight but is caused by a fungus.It will appear as soft brown spots on the flowers, stems and leaves and causes mature flowers to rot quickly. Gray mold can also develop on the brown spots.


Another disease hibiscus is susceptible to is stem cankers, which are caused by fungi that infect hibiscus stems through wounds.The cankers are usually brown but may be gray at the center.

, Pruning cuts should be made into healthy tissue about 1 inch beyond the infected area.

, You can disinfect your pruners by soaking them in disinfectant for a few minutes between cuts. Do not prune hibiscus with the pruners that are still wet with disinfectant as it causes damage to plant tissue., Rather than discard a shrub with root rot, you can try to help it recover by pulling the mulch off the soil with a rake and carefully digging the soil away from the base of the shrub with a shovel. Make sure the soil dries out completely before watering it again.


Root rot occurs when the soil drains slowly and remains very wet for extended periods of time.Hibiscus with root rot wilt and appear drought stressed because the roots are no longer able to supply the stems and leaves with moisture. The leaves often become dull green, yellow, red or burgundy. Hibiscus commonly die from this disease.

, Doing this, along with watering the diseased plant properly and giving it fertilizer each spring, will help it live longer. Make sure you disinfect your pruners between cuts of the branches.


Verticillium wilt has symptoms similar to root rot but they will appear on only one side of the shrub first.The hibiscus may live for a few weeks or a few years but it will eventually die from this disease.

, The organism that causes Verticillium wilt lives in the soil even after the infected plant is removed. So, re plant and replace with a plant like:


Rose-of-Sharon (Hibiscus syriacus), which is a Verticillium-resistant hibiscus.It grows well in Zones 5 to 9 where it can reach a height of 8 to 12 feet.
New Jersey tea shrubs (Ceanothus americanus)are also a good option for re-planting in Verticillium-contaminated areas.They produce showy, white flowers in late spring and early summer that attract hummingbirds and butterflies. New Jersey tea shrubs grow well in Zones 4 to 8, where they can reach a height of 3 to 4 feet.

, All of these pests pierce the hibiscus leaves and suck out the plant’s juices. A healthy hibiscus can easily handle mild infestations of any of these pests with minimal damage.Aphids are often green or red but they can be almost any color. They are small, soft-bodied insects that move slowly and are often found on hibiscus stems and the undersides of leaves.Mites are tiny spider-type pests that are barely visible to the naked eye. They are often detected when their fine webbing is noticeable between the hibiscus’ leaves and stems. The leaves also develop a bronzy-looking blush and tiny dots.Mealybugsand scale insects are flat, round or oval pests that move slowly to a permanent place on the hibiscus when they are young and then attach themselves and lose their legs. Mealybugs are usually off-white and have a waxy coating that makes them look mealy. Scale insects are smooth and commonly tan, off-white or brown.
Whiteflies look like tiny white moths that fly up in a cloud when the hibiscus leaves are disturbed., Besides being unnecessary, these treatments will kill beneficial insects like lady bird beetles, which are natural predators of these pests.Lady beetles will usually bring an infestation under control when given an opportunity.


While lady bird beetles can be purchased and released into the garden, this is rarely effective. The lady bird beetles move on to other gardens very quickly. They ordinarily arrive naturally soon after the pests.

, Disposing of them prevents the spread of more pests to other plants.

, The water will crush the pests and knock them off the shrub. It also makes the environment less than ideal for spider mites, which thrive in dry conditions.

, This will kill them and reduce the risk of spreading these pests to other plants.

, Japanese beetlesand caterpillarseat hibiscus leaves. Japanese beetles are medium-sized, oval, shiny green beetles. Caterpillars that attack hibiscus can be nearly any color or size. When you remove these pests by hand, drop them into a bucket of soapy water to drown them.


Wear gloves when removing caterpillars as some species will inflict a painful sting. Caterpillars are fairly easy to find at any time of the day.
Japanese beetles are easiest to remove early in the morning while they are sluggish.

Find a partially shady area for the monkshood.,
Add organic matter to the soil.,
Sow Monkshood seeds directly in the garden in late fall and early winter.,
Look for the seedlings to sprout in the spring.,
Plant seedlings or plant divisions in the spring after the last expected hard frost or in the fall a month or so before the first expected frost.",How to Grow Deadly Monkshood1," The spot should also be exposed to four to six hours of direct sunlight each day.


Monkshood will grow in a sunny area with six to eight hours of direct sunlight but thrives in partial shade.;
, Monkshood is not especially particular about what type of soil it grows in as long as it drains quickly. Prior to planting the monkshood, spread a 3- to 6-inch depth of organic matter like well-aged cow manure, compost, composted shredded bark mulch and leaf mold over the soil.Mix the organic matter into the soil thoroughly to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).

, Plant the seeds 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) deep and 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.Keep the soil moist but not soggy. Monkshood seedlings do not like to have soggy feet.

, Thin the seedlings to 1 or 1 ½ feet apart. It can take up to three years for the plants to bloom when they are grown from seed.

, They usually will not bloom the first year after being transplanted into the garden. Plant them 1 to 1 ½ feet apart.

"
"
Water your plant when the ground gets dry.,
Spread a two- to three-inch depth of organic mulch around the monkshood plant.,
Determine if you need to add fertilizer.,
Deadhead flowers as they die.",How to Grow Deadly Monkshood2," Water monkshood plants as often as necessary to keep the soil moist throughout the growing season.This will most likely be once a week, depending on the climate you live in.

, This will help to help keep the soil cool and moist.

, When organic matter has been added to the soil, there is no need to give monkshood any fertilizer.


If organic matter is not added to the soil prior to planting, give your monkshood all-purpose 10-10-10 fertilizer in the spring as soon as they begin to grow. Sprinkle the fertilizer around the plants, not on them, and water it into the soil.

, Deadheading means removing the dead flower stalks as the flowers fade or after they are killed off by a hard frost.


When you deadhead flowers, it allows the plant to put its energy towards growing new blooms.

Add more water.",How to Grow Flowers from Seed," There are a variety of inexpensive options available. Germinating flats are cheap and specifically created for the purpose of germinating seeds. Plastic drinking cups and recycled egg cartons are other inexpensive options, however. Small flower pots will also work.;
, The best containers are four or more inches deep. This allows the root system to develop.

, If using an old plastic pot or tray, soak it in a solution containing one part bleach and nine parts water, and rinse thoroughly. If using a new container, sterilization may not be necessary.

, Most plastic pots and germination trays already have holes in the bottom for water to drain through. If using a plastic cup, egg carton, or another container without any holes, punch a small hole or two in the bottom of the container before filling it with soil.

, Typically, this means starting them 4 to 8 weeks before the expected last frost. Doing so gives your seedlings plenty of time to develop prior to the transfer, making them strong enough to withstand winds, insects, and other pests.

, Peat moss pellets work well with germination trays, but a good soil might be necessary if using a larger container. Purchase a pre-packaged soil from a garden center to ensure a high-quality ""sterile"" mix. Many stores even sell special ""seed starting"" blends.

, Do not pack the soil down. Instead, allow it to remain loose.

, Add enough water to get a spongy wet consistency, but do not completely saturate the soil.

, Some flowers require you to cover the seeds with up to an inch of soil, while other small seeds may only need to be sprinkled on the surface of the soil. Do not pack soil on top of the seeds, however, since doing so will smother them and make it difficult for sprouts to break through.

, Space them 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) apart to prevent them from interfering with each other if more than one seed grows.

, Only add a small sprinkle of water to moisten the seeds and the new soil. Do not drown your seeds.

, If using a germination tray, it likely came with a clear plastic cover. Otherwise, use clear plastic wrap. The cover prevents your seeds from drying out, but it must be clear to allow adequate sunlight through.

, The location should also be well-ventilated, however. If you want to prevent the air from getting too stagnant, run an electric fan in the same room near the seeds, but do not point it directly at the container. Only run the fan for a few minutes at a time.

, Typically, you should place the seeds near a window but not in direct sunlight.

, Some seedlings need up to 16 hours of light a day in order to develop. If so, shine a fluorescent light a few inches above the tallest leaves during the hours when no sunlight is available.

, Relocate the seedlings to a location with better sunlight.

, This prevents the seedlings from bending in any one direction to reach the light.

, Use a spray bottle if possible. Gentle watering prevents damage to delicate, developing root systems.

, If you press your finger into the soil and feel moisture, you may want to wait before watering again. Keep the soil moist but not soaked.

, Use a mild fertilizer. If possible, purchase one designed for young shoots.

, Expose them to direct sunlight and outdoor air for a few days in their current containers. Keep them moist and protect them from the wind. Bring the plants in at night, especially if the nights are still cold.

, Refill the hole to the same depth as your pot or container using loose soil. The purpose of digging out the soil and refilling it is to ensure that the soil remains loose enough for your flower's roots to adapt.

, You don't want to completely saturate the hole, but you should add enough water so the soil is a bit spongy.

, Tap on the bottom and sides lightly until you can remove the soil from its container without forcing it.

, The root structure should be solid enough that the plant retains the shape of the container it was in.

, Make sure that your plant is firmly seated, but do not pack the soil tightly.

, Do not soak the flower, but make sure that it is moist.

Decide which daylilies you want to grow.,
Plant daylilies in the spring.,
Choose a spot for growing your daylilies.,
Prepare the soil.,
Soak bare root plants overnight in a water-soluble general fertilizer solution.,
Space the daylilies 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) apart when planting.,
Water daylilies to keep the soil moist.,
Feed daylilies once or twice a year using a well-balanced general plant fertilizer.,
Mulch the garden around the plants to help the soil retain moisture and control weeds.,
Pinch off the seed pods that form in the fall after flowering.,
Divide your daylily plants if they begin to overcrowd.",How to Grow Daylilies," In addition to flower color and size, daylilies foliage varies significantly among the varieties. Purchase plants that provide good balance, contrast and variety for your landscape.


Ask an employee at your local garden center to recommend daylily varieties. Although daylilies are adaptable, certain varieties do better in certain climates.;
, Spring planting is ideal in areas with cold winters. This gives lilies the entire growing season to establish their roots before the winter freeze. If you live in a warmer climate with a longer growing season, you can be more flexible on planting times.


Experienced gardeners who know how to protect plants throughout winter sometimes plant daylilies in the fall. Fall planting in areas with harsh winters increases the chance that you will lose plants due to frost and freezing.

, Pick an area that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight daily. Most varieties of daylilies prefer full sun but will also do well in partial shade.

, Till the soil to a depth of at least 1 foot (30 cm). Add organic compost if the soil contains too much clay or rock. You can also add sand to clay with a high soil content. Daylilies can be grown in sandy soil as long as they are fed and watered regularly.

, If you purchased potted plants, give them a thorough watering with this solution the night before you plant.

, Some varieties require more space than others. For a closed border or bed, some varieties can be spaced as close as 12 inches (30 cm) apart.

, Although these plants can withstand droughts, they will make fewer and smaller flowers if they are allowed to dry out. Consistent watering is especially important in the spring when the buds are forming and throughout the summer blooming season. Deep water at the base of the plants, soaking the top 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm) of soil. Overhead watering may cause spots on the flowers.

, Give the first application in the spring when the plants are 2 to 4 weeks old. Depending on your soil conditions, a you can give a second application towards the end of the summer.

, You can also control weeds by hoeing the soil surface regularly.

, Plants allowed to produce seeds typically produce fewer flowers the following year.

, Given the space, daylilies spread and can be divided every 3 to 4 years. Dig up the roots of the plant cluster and break them apart with your hands. Put some of the plant back in the original hole. The rest you can plant in a different bed or pot, or swap with your friends and neighbors.

Disbud the dahlias to produce a single, large bloom.",How to Grow Dahlias," Dahlia is a large plant family, and you’ll need to decide which size of plant will best suit your growing space. Unlike other popular flowers, dahlias come in three main categories: large (including the popular “Dinnerplate” variety), medium, and small. Dahlia flowers also vary in color and size, although the size is usually proportionate to the overall size of the dahlia plant.Large dahlias can grow from 3–4 feet (1–1.2 meters) tall.
Medium dahlias (also known as border dahlias) will reach between 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 meters) in height.
Small dahlias will only reach between 10–20 inches (25–50 cm) in height.;
, You should be able to find dahlia tubers for sale at any reputable plant nursery or garden center. Due to the variety and diversity among types of dahlias, be sure to ask the sales staff for assistance. They’ll be able to help you determine which tubers will produce which size and color of blossoms.


If you live in a remote location and do not have access to a nearby plant nursery, you can purchase the dahlia tubers online instead. Check the websites for major online plant retailers including Eden Brothers, Dahlia Barn, Dahlias.com, or Harris Seeds.

, Dahlias thrive in warm, sunny climates, and are hearty in planting zones 8 and 9.If you live in the United States, this means that dahlias will not survive the winter if you live north of Kansas and east of western Idaho. If you live in zones 1–6, you will need to plant your dahlias indoors.

Dahlias don’t do well in long, hot summers, so if you live in zone 10, you may need to cover outdoor dahlias or bring them indoors in summer.If you live in zone 7, dahlias may be able to survive an outdoor winter if you pack mulch around the base of the flowers.

, Wait to plant dahlias until your region no longer has a threat of frost. If you have a thermometer that can be used to measure ground temperature, that can guide your planting time. Do not plant the dahlias if the ground temperature is below 60°F (16°C), or the dahlias may not grow.If you plant the dahlias early (e.g. in March or April) and another frost comes, the tubers will die.

, Dahlias thrive in full sun, and should be planted in a location where they will be in direct sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours a day. Dahlias also need to be protected from the wind, so plant them in a protected area. Their large flowers can become heavy when mature, and can snap off in a stiff breeze., Soil that drains well will not form puddles, and will allow the tubers to absorb what liquid they need without drowning.If you already have a garden or a section of your yard with well-drained soil, plant your dahlias there.

If you’re concerned that the soil may not drain well, add sand to your soil to improve your garden’s drainage. Do this at the same time that you’re adding the compost or manure.
If your soil is clay heavy, work peat moss or compost into the soil to loosen it. This can make it easier to plant dahlias.

, Use a spade to work manure or another fertilizer into your garden a couple of weeks prior to growing dahlias. It’s necessary to prepare your soil to grow dahlias before planting the tubers. Adding fully rotted compost or another fertilizer type to the soil will encourage the plants to grow well and bloom quickly., Each hole should be about 4 inches (10.16 cm) deep.When digging the holes, leave enough space between the plants that growing dahlias will not choke one another or steal nutrients from one another.


For smaller varieties, leave 2 feet (0.61 m) between holes. For medium or giant dahlias, leave 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) between holes., Dahlias need plenty of fertilizer to grow successfully, and adding organic material to the soil ahead of time will help ensure that the plants grow well. Scoop a small handful of compost and bone meal into each of the holes, and add a small scoop of dry fertilizer.You can purchase ground bone meal at a local plant nursery or gardening center. If you do not already own compost and fertilizer, you can purchase them from a large gardening center or from a landscaping outlet.

, Drop a single tuber in each hole, and then fill with soil. You can expect to see the tubers growing in 2 or 3 weeks.Be sure the growing point of the tuber faces upward before you cover it with soil.


After each dahlia has been planted, water the soil lightly.

, Do not water the dahlia tubers before you can see growth, or you’ll likely drown the plant. Wait until you can see sprouts above the soil, and then water the dahlias only in the morning. This will prevent the water from evaporating if you live in a hot zone.It’s not necessary to water the dahlias every day. Keep an eye on the plants and, when they begin to look a little wilted, water them generously.

, Fertilizers can help your dahlias grow quickly and well. They’ll thrive if given a low-nitrogen liquid fertilizer, which is the type most commonly used for vegetable gardens. You can fertilize the dahlias once they begin to sprout. Continue by fertilizing the plants about once each month until August.You can purchase low-nitrogen liquid fertilizer at a local garden center or plant nursery. It may even be available at a supermarket. Look for a 5-10-10 or 10-20-20 mixture.

, Tall dahlias may not be strong enough to support the weight of their own stems and flowers. Prevent these plants from falling over by tying them to stakes shortly after they begin to grow. You can use a thin piece of regular string or twine to fasten the stem to the stake.You can use a plain wooden stake or dowel to secure the dahlias. If you’d rather have a more decorative garden, purchase a cylindrical tomato cage and let the dahlia use it as a support.

, Once a dahlia plant begins to develop several bunches of bushy leaves, pinch off all of the flower buds, except for the bud at the very top of the plant. This is known as the terminal bud and will produce a very large flower if the other buds are removed.If you’re not concerned with producing large, impressive flowers (of the type that would be entered in a flower competition), you don’t need to disbud the plant. Simply let the buds grow where they will.

Store in paper envelops.",How to Grow Four O' Clock Flowers," Plan on planting the seeds during the early spring, after the danger of frost has passed for the season.Depending on where you live, this can be between early April and mid May.
Since four o'clock flowers grow quickly, there is no need to start them early indoors. It is recommended that you wait until the weather warms up so that you can sow them directly outdoors.;
, The evening before you plan to plant, place the seeds in a small saucer and cover them with water. Allow the seeds to soak in the water overnight.


The shells of these seeds are very thick, so they might not germinate well if they are not thoroughly soaked.
When ready, the seeds should be somewhat swollen but still firm.
Note that if you are planting the seeds during a rainy season, when the soil is thoroughly drenched, you may omit this step and plant the dry seeds directly in the soil.

, Four o'clock flowers do best when planted in direct sunlight or in light/partial shade.For optimal growth, choose a spot that receives 4 to 6 hours of sunlight on a regular daily basis.
Too much shade can cause the plants to grow lanky and may hinder flower production.

, Use a small trowel or garden fork to dig up the soil in the planting area. Loosen the soil roughly 1 or 2 feet (0.3 or 0.6 m) deep.


You should not need to amend the soil. Even though these flowers thrive in rich, well-draining soil, they generally do well in all soil conditions, even when the soil is of fairly poor quality.

, Press each seed into the soil with your fingers, placing it no more than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep.Make sure that a loose layer of soil covers the seed to protect it from weather and wildlife, especially birds. This soil should be no greater than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep.

, Usually, you should only plant one seed per one foot (30 cm) of space.


You will eventually need to thin out your seedlings so that the plants are 2 feet (0.61 m) apart. For that reason, you may also opt to sow the seeds 2 feet (0.61 m) apart, saving yourself the extra effort later on.

, Gently water the seeds with a watering can or the mist setting of a garden hose. Make sure that the soil is thoroughly moist, but not soggy.


Note that the seeds will usually sprout within 7 to 14 days, depending on how warm the temperatures are. Warmer temperatures tend to mean quicker germination.
It is crucial that the soil remain moderately moist while the seeds germinate. Never flood the soil, however, since doing so can wash the seeds away.

, Place the thick-shelled seeds in a saucer or cup. Fill this dish with just enough water to cover the seeds and let the seeds soak overnight.


Since the shells of these seeds are so thick, they germinate much better when they are softened with plenty of water.
The seeds should still be firm after you soak them, but they will feel a little softer and appear more swollen.

, You should use a 1 to 5 gallon (3.8 to 19 L) pot or other planting container.


Ideally, the container should have four or five drainage holes. If you are keeping the container indoors, set it on top of a saucer to prevent excess water from creating a mess as it drains.

, Instead of using soil from your garden, fill the planting container with medium to high quality commercial potting mix.


Any all-purpose, standard commercial potting mix should suffice. These flowers do not require special soil.

, Soak the soil with water before you plant the seeds. The soil should be thoroughly moist, but not soggy.


Allow any excess water to drain before you sow the seeds.
You will need to make sure that the soil is moderately moist throughout the germination process. This stage will usually take one or two weeks.

, Gently press each seed 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) into the soil. Space them apart at even intervals.


Four seeds should fit into a 1-gallon (4-L) container comfortably. If you are using a 5-gallon (20-L) container, you can sow a dozen or so seeds without crowding them out too much.

, Set the container in a sunny location where it can receive around 6 hours of sunlight daily.


If the weather is warm enough, you can place the container outdoors on a porch, balcony, or patio.
If the plants do not receive enough sunlight, they might look lengthy. Bloom production might also suffer.

, Once the seedlings have established themselves, then the plants out so that there are 2 feet (0.61 m) between them.If you are growing the plants in containers or otherwise want the plants to remain short and stunted, it is possible to leave only 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) between each seedling.
Wait until the stems of the seedlings have already developed two sets of leaves before thinning them out. Keep the healthiest, strongest looking plants and remove the weakest.

, Four o'clock flowers are somewhat drought-resistant, but the should not be allowed to remain dry for more than a day or two.


Try to give the plants at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water weekly, either by rainfall or hand watering with a hose or watering can.
Note that flowers grown in a container will require more regular waterings than those grown outdoors.

, Choose a water-soluble, all-purpose floral fertilizer and apply it before a rainfall or when you water the plants.


Choose a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer, which contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This type of fertilizer will promote an overall even state of health for the plant.

, Four o'clock flowers rarely have problems with insects and diseases, so pre-treatment for such conditions is highly discouraged.


If problems do develop, treat the plants with an appropriate pesticide or fungicide. The product can either be organic or chemical.

, Each bush should grow a large tuber below ground. If you live in mild climates, you should be able to leave this tuber in the ground without causing damage to the plant. If you live in notably cold climates, however, you should dig it up in the late fall.


Store the tubers in between layers of newspaper in cardboard boxes or wooden crates. You can also store the tubers in peat moss or sand. Do not use plastic containers or other closed boxes, since these can encourage the tubers to rot.
Place the tubers in a garage, shed, or similar environment. They should remain dry and dark throughout the winter.
Replant the tubers in the spring. Dig a hole large enough for the tuber in the same location it once grew. Place the tuber back in the ground, cover with soil, and care for the plant as before.

, If you do not want to dig up the tuber, you can usually protect it over the winter by covering the planting area with 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) of organic mulch.


Organic mulch can include leaves, grass clippings, wood chips, and newspaper.
The mulch provides insulation and keeps the soil a little warmer.
Note that in notably cold climates, mulch may not be enough to protect the tuber over the winter.
If you are growing the plants in containers, it is also recommended that you spread mulch on top of the container during the spring or summer to help reduce the amount of water evaporation that takes place. This can help prevent the soil from drying out too severely.

, Seeds form when a flower on the bush dries up and falls off the stem.


After the flower drops, you should see black pea-sized seeds left in its place.
Each four o'clock plant should produce a large quantity of seeds.

, Pluck the seeds off by hand or wait until they drop off the stem on their own. If they drop to the ground, pick them up as soon as you see them.


If the seeds are left alone once they drop, more four o'clock flower plants can grow in that spot.
Another way to collect the seeds is to gently shake the seed-bearing stems, encouraging the seeds to break off and drop to the ground all at once.

, Spread the seeds out on a clean, dry paper towel and leave them in a dry location for five days.


The seeds can rot if they are stored while still moist, so this pre-drying step is very important.
Dry the seeds indoors to prevent birds and other animals from taking them.

, Place the dried seeds in paper envelops. Mark the envelop, then gently seal it and store the seeds in a dry location.


You can use paper bags, as well. Paper allows air to circulate.
Do not use an airtight container, though, like a plastic container. Storing the seeds in this type of container can cause mildew to form or may encourage the seeds to rot.

Purchase a rabbit foot fern as a houseplant.,
Plant the rabbit foot fern in an appropriate container.,
Grow the fern in a porous soil that drains well.,
Grow the rabbit foot fern in indirect light.,
Water the plant sparingly.,
Grow the fern in a moderately humid environment.,
Maintain a temperature of 60 to 75 degrees F (16 to 24 degrees C).,
Fertilize the rabbit foot fern monthly.,
Examine the fern regularly for pests.,
Propagate the rabbit foot fern by dividing rhizomes or planting spores.",How to Grow a Rabbit Foot Fern," Because rabbit foot ferns do not grow from seeds, but rather are propagated by dividing rhizomes or collecting spores, you must purchase an existing plant. Rabbit foot ferns are available at garden centers and through online distributors.;
, Because the rhizomes hang over the side of the container and can grow up to 2 feet (0.61 m) (.6 m) long, the rabbit foot fern is ideal for a hanging basket. The container should be either plastic or clay, and 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) in diameter. Plastic containers tend to allow for a more even distribution of water than clay pots, but clay pots are sturdier and may last longer.

, The soil should contain 2 parts peat moss, 1 part loam and 1 part sand or perlite, which is a volcanic glass with a high water content. The soil should have a neutral pH of 6.6 to 7.5.

, During the winter months, a north-facing window is an ideal location for the fern. During the spring and summer months, when the sun is higher on the horizon, choose an east-facing window with filtered light. Avoid south- and west-facing windows where the direct sunlight may scald the fern's fronds.

, Allow the soil in the container to dry out slightly between waterings. Over-watering will cause the fronds to yellow, and may result in root rot. Do not allow the plant to sit in water.


Mist the fuzzy rhizomes regularly. The rhizomes take up moisture. Mist them every few days, or as needed, to prevent them from drying out.

, Ferns thrive in moderate humidity. If your heat is on in your home during winter months, consider using a room humidifier where your rabbit foot fern is located. If you don't have a room humidifier, place the fern's container on a tray of wet pebbles to increase the humidity around the plant.

, The rabbit foot fern will thrive indoors in comfortable house temperatures. If the temperature drops below 60 degrees F (16 degrees C), check the plant before watering and only water when the soil is dry to the touch. If the temperature rises above 75 degrees F (24 degrees C), you may need to water the plant more often.

, Any liquid houseplant fertilizer can be used to feed the fern, but use only about half the recommended amount. Too much fertilizer may scorch the fronds. Do not fertilize newly potted plants for at least 4 to 6 months, or until the plant is showing signs of active growth.

, Thrips, mites and fungus gnats are often found on the foliage of houseplants like the rabbit foot fern. These pests like wet soil, so keep pests away by not over-watering. To remove pests, brush them off with a wet towel or a cotton swab dipped in alcohol. Most houseplant pesticides are not safe for use on ferns.

,


Divide the rhizomes to create more rabbit foot fern plants. Carefully separate the rhizomes using a sharp knife, keeping the roots and stems attached. Place the rhizomes in a moist potting soil mixture and water as needed. The rhizomes hold a lot of water, so do not overwater the newly planted fern or it will rot.
Propagate new rabbit foot fern plants with spores. Examine the underside of the leaves for spores. Remove a leaf with dark spores and place it in a paper bag. When the leaf dries, the spores will fall off. Plant the spores in a peat-based mixture. Water, cover with plastic, and keep at a temperature between 65 and 70 degrees F (18.3 and 21.1 C). When the fronds are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) high, remove the plastic and transplant the fronds to small containers.

For many regions, this will be in mid-February or early March. Adjust the timing based on your area’s typical weather patterns., Buy a seeding tray at a garden center. These come with multiple small containers, and they can be used to start several plantings., Buy special soil mix meant for sowing seeds at your local gardening center or online. Fill each container about ¾ full with soil. Add enough water to make the soil moist., Pour chamomile seeds into an empty bowl. Use your finger to pick up several. Put about six in each container by scraping the seeds off your finger with your nail. Cover them lightly with just a little bit of soil.You should still be able to see the seeds through their covering.

, Mist the seeds with water from a spray bottle right away. Continue checking on the seeds each day to make sure the soil stays moist, but not soaking. Spray the seeds as much as you need to keep the soil moist, probably about once per day.You can keep the seeds covered with a loose sheet of plastic wrap if you’re concerned that the soil isn’t staying moist enough. The plastic will trap the moisture. Leave space for air circulation, and be sure to remove the plastic entirely as soon as you see any sign of green., Ideal growing temperature is between 65-85℉ (18.33-29.44℃). During the day, put the plants in a sunny spot that’s set at the higher temperature. At night, make it a little colder. This will imitate the natural warm and cold cycles of the outdoors., (5.08 cm) high. This will leave only one healthy seedling in each container. To thin the chamomile seedlings, cut the seedling off at ground level. Don't pull the seedling out by its roots, as you may disturb the roots of the chamomile plant you're keeping., Do what’s called “hardening off” the chamomile. This prepares them for life outside. Start by putting the plants outside in a covered area for a few hours per day. Increase their outdoor exposure by a few hours each day for two weeks.Do this only when the weather cooperates. If the temperature drops or rises suddenly or there are strong winds, keep the plants inside to protect them. Gentle breezes, however, are good for the little guys.
Alter the plants’ sun exposure as you go, giving them less and less shade over the course of the two weeks. Be sure to keep the soil moist during this time.
Keep the plants indoors at night while hardening them off.

, This should be about six weeks after you started the seeds. Gently loosen the soil and remove the plantings from their containers, placing them in holes double the size of their root balls about 8-10 inches (20.32-25.40 cm) apart. Fill the holes back in with a mix of soil and slow-release fertilizer.Water the plantings about an hour before you transplant them. Then gently mist them once they’re in the ground.
Make the holes deep enough so the base of the leaves is at soil level.

Fertilize the flowers once every two weeks from June through September.,
Remove bottom leaves late in the season, usually around mid-July.,
Spray your dahlia with fungicide or insecticide as needed.",How to Grow Dahlias in Pots," Dwarf and low-growing varieties work best, but nearly any type can be grown if you have a large enough pot.;
, A good container to start with should be approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep by 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter. Larger varieties may need even larger containers, however, especially if the flowers exceed 3 feet (0.91 m) in height.

, A light pot may not be sturdy enough, and the dahlia could become top heavy as a result.

, This step may not be necessary if the container you use already has several large drainage holes that allow excess moisture to drain quickly. If your pot has small holes or only has one center hole, you may need to drill a few extra holes to improve drainage.

, A dirty pot could spread disease, and hidden insect eggs may be lying in wait at the bottom of the pot. Remove these threats by cleaning the container before you plant. Simple soap and water will usually do the trick.

, Standard potting soil alone is too porous and may lead to pour bud formation. A good potting mix includes both potting soil and garden soil, or potting soil and compost. Alternatively, non-soil mixes made of fine bark, peat, and various minerals may also work.

, Long roots will become entangled, and separating the roots will damage them. If the tubers need to spend time forming new roots, the flower's upward growth and bloom will be delayed and may be minimized for the season.

,


If starting the dahlias in pots that sit outdoors, wait until mid-April through all of May.
If starting the flowers indoors, you can plant the tubers in early April.

, Filters wick away moisture, preventing the roots from drowning. Placing gravel at the bottom of your pot will accomplish the same task, but a dahlia's roots need all the space they can get to grow, and the coffee filter method takes up much less room than gravel would. Placing filters over the holes may also prevent bugs from getting in.

, Do not pack it tightly; allow the soil to remain loose.


If using a pot deeper than 12 inches, you may need to fill it with more soil. When all is said and done, dahlias need to be planted about 6 inches deep, and there should be an inch between the surface of the soil and the rim of the pot at the end of the potting process.

, Make it damp, but do not soak.

, Dahlias require a lot of nutrients to thrive. Fish or seaweed fertilizer can provide additional micro nutrients, as well.


You can also purchase a copolymer slurry from a gardening store instead of using bone meal and fertilizer. Follow the package for usage directions.
If mixing the slurry, fertilizer, or bone meal into the soil causes the coffee filters to move from the bottom of the pot, remove the soil from the pot and mix the elements together that way. Simply add it back in, over the repositioned filters, once everything is combined.

, Lay it down horizontally and leave at least 1/4 inch space between the root end of the tuber and the side of the pot. If an eye has already developed, center the eye in the middle of the pot and allow it to face upward. The sprout will come through from this eye.

, Do not bury the tuber at this time, however. Instead, cover it with a minimal amount of soil so that you may monitor its growth.

, Lightly spritz the exposed surface of the tuber with just enough warm water to moisten the surface.

, Do so carefully to avoid damaging the stalk, since the stalk is still fairly fragile at this stage. Never cover the top set of leaves. Continue adding soil until only an inch of empty space remains between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.

, Large dahlia varieties need extra support to prevent the stalks from breaking off. Use a four foot stake with most varieties. Metal works best due to its sturdiness. The base of the stake should touch the bottom of the pot, and the stake itself should be firmly held in place by the soil and/or wires tied to holes drilled into the sides of the pot.

, Give them a thorough watering two or three times a week. Dahlias growing in hot, dry climates may need daily watering. Never allow the soil to get soggy, however.

, Dahlias grow best with six to eight hours of direct sunlight.

, Many indoor dahlias do not receive enough light from the sun, and a plant light may be necessary to spur proper growth. Set the light about six inches above the top rim of the pot for newly planted tubers and raise the light as the plants grow.

, Use a low nitrogen fertilizer, and avoiding over-feeding.

, The removal of these leaves improves air circulation, which reduces the risk of mildew.

, Dahlias are subject to attacks from mold, earwigs, slugs, spider mites, aphids, and cucumber beetles.

Ideally, seeds started indoors should be sown roughly four to six weeks before you plan to transplant them outside.
While cleome can be sown early indoors, many gardeners believe that the plants thrive best when sown outdoors.;
, For best results, choose a seed starting soil mix instead of a standard garden mix. Loosely fill the containers with soil; do not pack it in.


Plastic seedling trays are recommended, but you could also use small plastic cups, small plastic pots, or small ceramic pots. Regardless of the specifics, try to stick with a container that has a diameter or length no greater than 4 inches (10 cm).

, Make a shallow 1/4-inch (6-mm) indentation in the soil with your fingertip, the drop a seed inside. Sprinkle over the seed with a very light layer of soil.


If you are using small seedling trays, plant one seed per compartment.
If you are planting the seeds in a slightly larger plant, make sure that the seeds are 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart., Place the sown seeds and their containers in large plastic bags, then transfer the bags to the refrigerator. Keep the seeds there for two weeks.This part of the process, known as verbalizations, takes advantage of the plant's natural ability to thrive when brought out of cold temperatures and into warm temperatures, and mimics the way this happens in nature.
Only keep the seeds in the refrigerator, though. Do not use the freezer. Do not allow frost to form, and do not allow the soil to dry out.

, The seeds should be kept in a warm location with regular, daily access to direct sunlight.


The soil temperature should be kept between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 and 25 degrees Celsius) during this time.
Bottom sources of heat work best. Consider resting the containers on top of a heat mat designed for use with plants.
If you cannot provide bottom heat, at least make sure that the seeds remain in a room that is continually kept warm.
Usually, the seeds will germinate within one or two weeks once they are transferred to a warm area.

, Spray the soil with water from a spray bottle as the seeds prepare to germinate.


The soil must remain continually moist during this time, but at no point should you allow it to become flooded. Do not give the seeds so much water that puddles form on top of the soil.
Make sure that the soil remains moist throughout the entire germination process.

, Ideally, the cleome seedlings should be planted in full sunlight. Areas with very light shade are also acceptable.


For best results, choose a spot with soil that drains well. Since cleome grows well in most types of soil, though, it is not necessary to amend the soil before transplanting the seedlings.
If you are planting the cleome in a bed with other flowers, plant them near the back since they tend to grow tall.

, You should wait three to four weeks after the last frost in your area before transplanting cleome seedlings.


Usually, this means waiting until late April.
You also need to make sure that the seedlings have established themselves enough to be transplanted. Seedlings are ready to be transplanted once they are at least 2 inches (5 cm) tall.

, Use a garden trowel to dig a hole that is roughly as deep as the seedling container. The hole should be slightly wider than this original container, however.


Spread the seedlings apart, keeping roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of space in between each one.

, Slide the garden trowel in between the side of the container and the soil inside. Glide it around the perimeter of the container to free the soil from the sides, then gradually slip the entire clump of soil, seedling and all, out of the pot.


It might be easiest to tip the container on its side as you do this.
If you are using plastic seedling trays or other thin plastic containers, you might be able to free the seedlings simply by squeezing the sides of the plastic and pushing up on the soil inside.

, Carefully place each seedling in its own prepared hole. Fill the remainder of the hole with additional soil.


Lightly pat the soil around the seedling to secure the new plant in place.
Water the soil lightly after transplanting the seedling. It should be thoroughly moist, but not quite drenched.

, If you decide to sow the seeds directly outdoors instead of starting them early, you will need to wait until late April, or three to four weeks after the last frost in your area.


Note that late April is the earliest you can sow seeds outdoors, but you can continue sowing seeds all the way through May.
Directly sowing the seeds outdoors is actually recommended for cleome plants.
Some of the best varieties to choose for direct sowing include Cherry Queen, Mauve Queen, Pink Queen, Purple Queen, Rose Queen, and Ruby Queen., Cleome grows best in full sun to light shade.


These flowers can grow in most soil types, but the best soil for cleome will be soil that drains well.
When planting cleome in a mixed flower bed, consider planting them toward the back of the bed. Cleome tend to grow taller than most flowers.

, Pull any weeds from the soil and remove any debris, such as rocks or sticks.


Even though cleome grows best in well-draining soil, you do not need to amend the soil in your garden, even if it isn't loose and well-draining. Cleome can survive in a wide range of soil types.

, Use your fingertip to make an indentation in the soil no deeper than 1/4 inch (6 mm). Drop one seed inside the indentation, then sprinkle a very light, small amount of soil on top.


The seeds should be sown 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) apart from one another.
If the soil is too hard to press into using your finger, you could use the tip of a small garden spade, instead.

, After sowing the seeds, you should keep the soil moist by lightly showering it with a small amount of water from a watering can or spray bottle.


The ""mist"" setting on a garden hose nozzle can also be used.
At no point should you flood the soil. Avoid letting water puddle up on the surface.

, When the cleome plants are about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) tall, pull out the weakest looking seedlings so that 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) of empty space can remain in between the strongest ones.


Pull up the weak seedlings gently and carefully. If you are too rough, you might accidentally rip up some of the seedlings you want to keep, as well.
Note that the seeds should sprout within 7 to 14 days.

, Once the plants are established, you can usually let nature water them. You will only need to water cleome if you are undergoing a drought.


Note that cleome do need to be watered every other day or so while they are still establishing themselves. During this time, keep the soil regularly moist along the surface but do not drench it. If there are puddles on the surface of the soil, you've added too much.
After the plants have established themselves, they only need 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of water per week. Standard precipitation should take care of this, but if not, gently water the plants with a watering can or a light shower setting on a garden hose.

, Spread a thin layer of mulch around the plants after they establish themselves. The layer should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.


Do not let the mulch touch the stems. If you crowd the stems with mulch, moisture can build and cause stem rot.
Mulch can be very helpful to the overall health of your cleome bed. A layer of mulch can prevent weeds from popping through while insulating the soil during chillier weather.

, Cleome will usually survive without additional fertilizer, but if the quality of your soil is poor, applying a dose of fertilizer once at the beginning of spring and once in the middle of summer can benefit your flowers significantly.


Choose a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer labeled for use with garden flowers and apply it as directed on the label.

, Pests are not a common problem for cleome, but stem boring insects can be an issue, especially if you live in a humid climate.


If you spot stem boring insects or other pests on the plants, buy an appropriate outdoor pesticide labeled for use against such insects.
Test the pesticide on a small section of the plant to make sure that it does not destroy the plant itself. Once it seems safe, follow the label instructions and apply the pesticide over all of the infested areas of the plant, focusing on the stem.

, Once established, cleome will naturally self-sow by dropping seeds. To prevent the plants from spreading and taking over your garden, you should dead-head the flowers before any seeds can ripen.To dead-head flowers, wait until the flower shows signs of drooping or dying, then simply snip or pluck it off the stem.

Pick a sunny, warm spot for your chamomile.,
Rake and even out the soil to prepare it.,
Plant German chamomile if you have poor soil.,
Plant Roman chamomile if you have well-drained, fertile soil.,
Sow your seeds in late spring or summer to avoid frost.,
Sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil.,
Water the seeds until the soil is moist.,
Thin seedlings when they're about 2 inches (5.08 cm) tall.,
Plant pre-grown chamomile in autumn or spring.",How to Grow Chamomile2," While chamomile can handle a little bit of shade, it prefers lots of sun. Set aside a spot in your garden that’s sure to enjoy plenty of light throughout the day., Remove any rocks, clumps of soil, or weeds by raking and hoeing the area. Go at least 1 foot (30.48 cm) deep. Then rake the soil back into place and pack it down for a nice, smooth planting surface., German chamomile is a bit hardier than other varieties. It can handle a bit of clay or low nutrition in the soil.German chamomile is technically an annual, which means it needs to be replanted each year. However, it self-seeds, so you don’t need to do the replanting! This means it actually acts like a perennial plant.

, Roman chamomile does better in higher-quality soil. This variety is a perennial, meaning it doesn’t need to be replanted each year.If you want to raise the quality of the soil, mix a slow-release fertilizer with the soil before you sow seeds.

, Be sure all threat of frost has passed before you put in the seeds. This timing will vary depending on where you live.In the United States and Europe, you should be safe to plant by mid-May or June. Warmer states in the southern half of the U.S. may be able to start earlier, depending on the weather.
If you’re in the southern hemisphere planting in someplace like Sydney, Australia, the last frost should occur in early August., Sprinkle handfuls of seeds across the soil. Don’t worry about placement. You’ll make them into neat rows later.Use your hands to gently cover them with only a little bit of soil, as these seeds need light to germinate.You should still be able to see the seeds under their light covering of soil.

, The seeds need a lot of water to germinate, so start this process off as soon as they’re planted. Use the mist or shower setting on your hose to moisten the soil. Keep the soil moist throughout the germination period, and when the seedlings are small. This will probably require a daily watering., Leave about 8 to 10 inches (20.32 to 25.40 cm) between each seedling, making neat rows of spaced plants. To thin the seedlings, cut the tiny plant off at ground level. Don't pull the seedling completely out of the ground, as you may disturb the roots of the remaining seedlings., If you want, buy mature chamomile plants at a garden center rather than starting the seeds either outside or indoors. Dig a hole double the size of the root ball and deep enough so the base of the leaves is right at soil level when the plant is put in the hole. Mix some slow-release fertilizer in with the soil, pack it down loosely, and water it until the soil is wet.While perennial plants can be put in any time of year, they do best when started in early autumn or late spring. Annuals should always be planted during these times.
The ideal planting time varies depending on your location, but you should generally stick to a season when the weather is turning and getting either warmer or colder. Avoid planting in extreme heat or cold.

Water young chamomile plants frequently.,
Reduce watering once plants are established.,
Keep weeds from stealing the plants’ nutrients.,
Cover the plants with evergreen boughs to protect them during winter.",How to Grow Chamomile3," Until you see flowers on your plants, water them daily. This will give them the water they need to fully mature. Don’t soak the soil. Water until it’s just moist.If you’re getting lots of rain, you may be able to reduce your watering. Especially if it’s hot out, however, check the soil even if it’s rainy.

, Chamomile is a pretty hardy plant. Once it’s fully grown, it does fine with less water.Let the soil go almost dry between waterings, then soak the plants. This usually takes about a week or two., Make sure the chamomile garden stays free of nasty weeds! You don’t want them to choke off your chamomile. Give the garden a weekly once-over to remove these invaders.

While chamomile may attract bees and butterflies, it’s usually pest free beyond that. You shouldn’t need to worry about pesticides., Chamomile plants can survive outside during winter, but they need a little bit of protection from dry, harsh winds. Lay several evergreen boughs over the plants at the start of the cold season."

Wait about 60-65 days for the plants to mature.,
Cut flowers throughout summer once they’ve bloomed.,
Dry the snipped flowers away from dust and sun.,
Store dried chamomile in a sealed jar away from sunlight.,
Make tea with a teaspoon of dried flowers per cup.",How to Grow Chamomile4," It usually takes about two months from the time the seeds are planted for chamomile to produce flowers. This should occur by early to mid-summer, or about two weeks after you’re transplanted indoor seedlings., Your plants should continue blooming all summer long. As you snip off blooms with garden scissors, new ones should grow in their place. This will give you plenty of flowers to dry and enjoy all year round!Snip the flowers at the base of their individual stems. You can then trim the stems down to the base of the blooms for drying., Place the flowers on a plate and put them in a cabinet. This will allow them to dry fully. Wait until the plant crumbles easily to your touch, usually about 1-2 weeks later., Keep the dried flowers safe from moisture and sunlight, which could make them go bad. Mason jars work perfectly, and they’ll store easily in your pantry next to the tea., Using a tea ball, make chamomile tea! Put about a teaspoon (5.69 g) of dried chamomile into the tea ball. Let it steep for several minutes in hot water.You can make tea with fresh flowers as well, although dried blooms work better. Double the amount you use.
Add some honey to make this bitter-tasting tea sweeter.

Don’t overwater the crocuses.,
Don’t mow the grass where crocuses are naturalized until the foliage starts to die.,
Repeat the mulching and watering every fall.",How to Grow Crocus," Most crocuses are planted in clumps of 6 to 12, because they are small flowers. You will get the most impact with a grouping.;
,, This is the best time to ready your planting project.

, Remember that the area will need to be sunny in spring, not just in fall.

, Loosen it with a spade and fork. Plant crocus bulbs near the borders of flowerbeds or under grass.


You can plant crocus bulbs directly into the lawn to naturalize them.

, If possible, allow the compost and soil mixture to sit in the area for two weeks.

, You need to plant the crocus corm at a depth double the bulb’s width. The bulbs themselves should be placed 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) apart.


Remember to plant the corms in clusters, rather than in a row. They will naturalize and spread more easily in this formation., This is a natural source of phosphorous and is great for root systems.

, Set it into the soil. Cover the bulb with dirt and pack it in lightly.

, Make sure the soil is well drained, so that the bulbs don’t rot in the ground.

, Wait until spring to continue caring for them.

, Since they come up in early spring, rain and snow may contain enough water to keep them healthy.

,, Crocuses can last 20 years if properly cared for."

Prune in February and July.,
Prune the long shoots.,
Avoid cutting the plant frame.,
Cut the new growth back six inches.,
Completely remove unnecessary shoots from the main framework.,
Leave the seedpods.",How to Get Wisteria to Bloom1," Winter pruning for wisteria is best done in February on a mild day. Then, pruning in the summer will cut back on the unruly growth and keep the plant in check. It is important to restrict the vegetative growth so that the flowering spurs are encouraged to blossom.Pruning in the winter is generally easier because the leaves have been shed and the framework of the plant is exposed.;
, The shoots are the new branches that have grown since the summer. They should be cut back so that there are only three to five buds per shoot. This will generally mean that three to four inches will be cut off each one.


Pruning the branches will direct the plant’s energy to flowering. , While the shoots can be cut back, the main woody frame of the plant should not be cut. Maintaining a strong frame will ensure that the integrity of the plant remains intact.

, This creates better air circulation and allows the sunlight to reach the new growth. This improves the chances of the formation of flower buds., For older plants, it is necessary to remove branches that are run-down and branches that have grown over structural features of buildings, such as windows and doors.


This is known as a “hard prune” and it will stimulate strong growth, as this is a plant that can grow aggressively. To avoid this, avoid fertilizing in the first spring after the hard prune., Many gardeners find the seedpods of the wisteria plant to look decorative. You can leave the seedpods if you enjoy how the look; otherwise, it is acceptable to remove them.

Repot when the roots have filled their container.",How to Grow a Plumeria," Plumerias require temperatures of at least 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 18 to 27 degrees Celsius). They will not survive in temperatures below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius). Any parts of the plant exposed to freezing temperatures will die. Therefore, it is important to choose the right location. If your climate regularly or seasonally gets colder than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius), do not plant your plumeria in the ground outside. Instead, plant it in a container that you can keep inside when it gets cold.Even though plumerias have strict temperature requirements, they are flexible in that they can flourish outside or inside.
Plumerias can survive in very hot temperatures, even over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius).;
, Plumerias grow best in full sunlight, but can live with a minimum of 6 to 8 hours a day. Find a location where the tree will be exposed to regular sunlight. Plumerias grow well in greenhouses or near a big window with lots of light if you are growing it inside., If planting your plumeria outside, you can plant it in a pot or in the ground. If planting plumerias in the ground, they will need to be planted 10 to 20 feet apart so that their roots have adequate space to grow.You can plant a root ball in a hole that is the same depth as the roots, but 2 to 3 times the width. Choose a planting location where the soil drains well and water doesn't puddle after a rainfall.Avoid locations where the plumeria will be exposed to heat radiating off a brick or concrete wall.

, Planting your plumeria in a container is useful so that you can move it inside if it gets cold. Or you can simply grow your plumeria inside year-round. If planting your plumeria in a container, be sure to use one with a hole or several holes in the bottom to provide soil and water drainage, as a plumeria won't do well with wet feet. Use at least a one gallon size container so that it has adequate room to grow. Black nursery containers are preferable to clay pots because of the porous nature of clay, which allows roots to be embedded in the walls and moisture to escape too quickly.You can find black nursery containers at your local gardening store.
Plastic pots are another good option because they lack the porousness of clay.

, Since one of the biggest hazards to plumerias is overwatering, make sure your soil is fast draining, like cactus mix or potting mix. If it is too dense or fine, it will hold too much water. Coarse soil will help ensure adequate drainage. Choose one with a slightly acidic pH as well, from around 6 to 6.7.To make sure your soil will drain properly, you can mix it with some perlite or sand. Soil can be found at your local gardening store.If you are planting your plumeria outside, make sure the soil drains well by mixing it with an organic material like manure or peat.

, If you don’t want to plant your own plumeria, you can buy one already grown. Purchase a healthy plumeria tree at a local nursery. Select a compact plumeria plant with even, bright color and a sturdy, straight trunk. Look for evenly spaced branches. Avoid plants with wilted leaves or poor color.

, You will need to plant plumeria seeds or cuttings to grow your own plumeria. Unfortunately, these are not very commercially available. It can be a challenge to find them, so your best bet is to obtain them from someone who already has a plumeria. Perhaps a neighbor or relative already has a plumeria and would be willing to share these with you. The seeds and cuttings can be harvested in the spring or fall to allow for the propagation of the plant.Seeds and cuttings can also be found online on websites like Amazon, although there are some concerns about the quality of these, since plumeria seeds and cuttings lose viability within a few months.

, This involves placing the seeds in a wet paper towel for one full day. They will absorb the moisture and look slightly swollen, indicating that they are ready to grow. This will help them to take root more quickly. Make sure they are in a warm environment while germinating., To plant plumeria seeds or cuttings, fill the container with soil and insert the seeds about .2 inches (about 5mm) into the soil or the cuttings about 2 inches (about 5cm) into the soil. Pack soil firmly around the seeds or cuttings to hold them securely in place. If planting seeds, make sure the swollen end is at the bottom and that part of the seed wing sticks out of the soil. Only plant one seed or cutting per pot.You can plant them originally in a smaller pot (about 500 mL or 16.9 fluid ounces) and then transplant them into a larger pot (2.5 gal or 9.5 liters) after the seed begins to grow in about a week to a month. The smaller pots are known as cultivation pots and can be helpful for a plant that is just beginning to grow.

, When you first plant your plumeria, do not water it immediately. New plumerias are very delicate and their root systems will grow with minimal water. Simply make sure it has enough light and heat for about 3 weeks and then begin to gradually add water. Start by adding a half cup of water to the plant each week.In about a month or two, the plant will begin to grow leaves. This means you can regularly water it each week.
When leaves are about 5 inches long, it means the plumeria is rooted and you can water it thoroughly.

, Once the seedling is at least 3 inches tall, you can transplant it into a larger pot. Simply remove the seedling with its soil and place it in a larger container filled with potting soil, at least a gallon in size. Simply cover the roots with soil and pack it firmly in its new pot.Opt for a plastic pot or black nursery container if possible.

, A plumeria should be watered frequently, at least once a week, when it is in bloom from March/April to November/December. Stop watering your plumeria when its leaves begin to drop, and do not water it when it is dormant or first rooting. Overwatering a plumeria is a big hazard to the plant. To ensure that it isn’t overwatered, allow its soil to fully dry in between waterings.When watering it, add enough water to moisten the soil, but it should never puddle on top. The amount of water will vary depending on the size of the plant.

, When the plumeria is in bloom, add a high-phosphorous fertilizer twice a month, such as 10-30-10 (the middle number is phosphorous). Dilute the fertilizer by adding 1-2 tsp per gallon of water. Then apply enough of the solution to moisten the soil.No fertilizer or care is required during the dormant season during winter months.

, Plumerias do not often need to be pruned, but if the branches start getting very long, you can prune it in late-winter. Simply cut the branches back by 1/3. This will improve the plant's health and help it to grow better., Certain insects can damage plumerias, such as mites, flies, or aphids. If you notice insects on your plumeria, apply a horticultural oil or insecticide like malathion to its leaves. It may require more than one application to effectively combat insects. Be sure to follow the directions on the insecticide for best results., If your plumeria is in a container outside, move it inside for winter. You can store it in the garage or basement as long as they do not get colder than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius). The plumeria must be kept dry and warm during its dormant season.They can survive without sunlight over the winter, but will do better next season if they were stored in light. You can use fluorescent lights if your garage or basement doesn’t have windows., In spring or fall, cut the stem tips one to two feet long and allow them to sit for at least two weeks before planting.You can take seeds when the pod splits open. Be sure to keep them dry until you are ready to plant them. Dry seeds last for about three months., If your plumeria has outgrown its container, it is time to move it to the next size pot. For example, if it is currently in a 1-gallon pot, you could move it to a 2.5-gallon pot. A plumeria will only grow larger if its roots have room to grow.If the plumeria is too big to repot, you can simply remove the top few inches of soil and add fresh soil on top.

Prune the stems and move the plant to a cool, dark locations.",How to Grow a Peony in a Pot," Peonies (Paeonia spp. and hybrids) are commonly grown outdoors, but they can also be grown in a pot. Select a variety that naturally stays smaller.


Some peonies like “Zhao Fen” (Paeonia suffruticosa “Zhao Fen” or “Zhao’s Pink”) can grow to a height of 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 m) and width of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 m).
Two smaller, more suitable options are “Zhu Sha Pan” (Paeonia “Zhu Sha Pan” or “Cinnabar Red”), which grows to a height and width of 2 to 2 ½ feet, and fern leaf peony (Paeonia tenuifolia), which grows to only 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) tall and 9 to 16 inches (22.9 to 40.6 cm) wide.;
, Pot up the peony in early spring. Put it in a container that is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in diameter and 1 ½ to 2 feet (0.6 m) deep to give the peony plenty of room to grow.


Larger varieties will require an even larger pot. The container must also have several drain holes in the bottom.
Gardeners should also note that these plants respond badly to being transplanted and should start out their lives in large containers. Therefore, a 5 gallon (18.9 L) size pot is ideal for peonies.

, Set the tuber on top of the potting mix to check the depth. There should be no more than 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of soil over the top of the tuber.


When the potting mix is at the right depth, mix water into it until it is thoroughly moistened.

, Before planting the peony bulbs, it’s a good idea to sprinkle some compost into the soil for additional nutrients.


In the spring, adding some slow-release low nitrogen fertilizer to the peonies is also recommended.
This will help keep them healthy and encourage blooms but will not burn the plants as other types of fertilizer might.

, Finish filling the container with potting mix and water it until the water drains from the bottom. Peony bulbs should only be covered with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of potting soil.


Gardeners should err on the side of caution in such cases because peonies that are buried too deep will not bloom.
Specimens that are producing lush foliage but no flowers may have to be dug up and reburied to appropriate depths before they begin to produce blossoms.

, Set the container outdoors in a protected location where the peony will be exposed to at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight. Peonies require lots of light to grow and bloom.


If the peony is to be grown indoors, put it in front of a south- or west-facing window where it will get plenty of direct sunlight.

, A grow light will be necessary to supplement the natural light. Use a four-bulb fluorescent light fixture with two special full-spectrum 40-watt fluorescent bulbs and two 40-watt cool white bulbs.


Set up the fixture so that the bulbs are about 6 inches (15.2 cm) above the peony and leave it on for 12 to 14 hours each day.
The light should be plugged into a timer that turns it on in the morning around sunrise and turns it off at the end of the day.

, Water the peony when the top inch of potting mix becomes dry. Pour the water evenly over the potting mix until the water drains freely from the bottom of the pot.

, When the new peony stems appear, begin giving it houseplant fertilizer every four weeks.


It is important to use houseplant fertilizer as opposed to fertilizer for garden-grown peonies since it is being grown in a container.
A water-soluble fertilizer is best. Always give it the fertilizer after a regular watering. Stop giving fertilizing around mid-summer.

, In late summer, water the peony less often. Let the soil dry completely before watering it again to encourage the peony to go dormant for the winter. Peonies must have a two- to three-month rest period.


If the peony is being grown indoors, slowly reduce the number of hours of supplemental light it receives to coincide with the shorter days of autumn.
If the peony is outdoors, leave it out until after a few hard frosts.

, When the leaves begin to turn yellow and die, use hand pruners to snip the stems off all the way down to the soil.


Set the pot in an unheated garage or cool area in the basement. Bring it back out in the spring when the weather warms.
Put it outdoors in a sunny spot or in front of the window and water it generously.

, These can either be pinned back against the lattice or will use the lattice to climb against.


Some examples of suitable flowers include astelias, delphiniums and verbascums.

, Alternatively, place in containers and arrange along the length of the latticework.

, This helps to retain moisture.

, Trim and replace flowers as needed.

Know that peonies grow well in locations with a winter chill.,
Choose a sunny location with well-draining soil.,
Test the pH of your soil.,
Adjust the pH of your soil, if necessary.,
Add some organic matter to the soil.",How to Get Peonies to Bloom1," Peonies perform their best in areas where there is some winter chill and, therefore, are not recommended for gardeners who live in the lower portions of the Southern United States. Peonies in zones 8 and 9 may fail to bloom if the winters there are too warm for their liking. Minimum temperatures in zones 8 and 9 are 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-12.2 to -6.7 degrees Celsius).


Warm climate gardeners who are determined to grow these plants should select early blooming cultivars, because they are generally resistant to botrytis blight and will bloom before the weather turns warm.;
, The area where your peonies are planted will affect how well they bloom. Be sure to plant them where they will be exposed to a minimum of six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day. The soil must drain quickly or the peony roots or tubers can rot or develop fungal disease.


In shadier conditions, they may still bloom but will not reach their full potential.

, Ideally, the soil should be organically fertile clay loam with a pH between 6.5 and 7.0. Have the soil pH tested at a local garden center or purchase a soil pH testing kit that you can use to test the soil yourself.


When using a soil pH test kit, dig down four inches before retrieving the soil sample. Be careful not to touch the test kit with your hands as this can influence the test results. Put the soil in a clean bowl, break up any chunks, remove weeds, grass or roots and let the soil dry.
Place the dried soil into the testing container, add the chemical solution provided, add the recommended amount of distilled water, put the lid on the container and shake it vigorously.
After the soil settles, check the color of the liquid in the test container against the pH chart provided with the test kit.

, Peonies can live for many years. The planting site should be prepared before planting to insure that they will continue to thrive and bloom throughout their long lives. Prepare the site three to six months before planting to give the soil time to settle. Add sulfur or lime to the soil to adjust the pH, if necessary.


The amount required to change the pH of soil varies, depending on the soil type and how much the pH needs to be adjusted. For example, adjusting the pH of sandy soil from 5.5 to 6.5 will require 2 ½ pounds of lime per 50 square feet of soil while making the same adjustment in clay soil will require 5 ½ pounds.
Adjusting the pH in sandy soil from 7.5 to 6.5 will require ½ to ¾ pound of aluminum sulfate per 50 square feet while the same adjustment in clay soil will take 1 ½ pounds.

, Spread the sulfur or lime, if necessary, along with a 3- to 6-inch depth of organic matter over the planting bed. Sphagnum peat moss, composted shredded pine bark, well-aged cow manure and compost work very well. Use a rototiller to work the soil amendments into the soil thoroughly to a depth of at least one foot.


A depth of 3 inches (7.6 cm) is fine if the soil is already high in organic matter but, if it is low in organic matter or if the level of naturally occurring organic matter is not clear, add a 5- to 6-inch depth.

Identify Cosmos bipinnatus cultivars.,
Learn more about Cosmos atrosanguineus aka Chocolate Cosmos.,
Learn about Cosmos parviflorus.,
Consider growing Cosmos sulphureus aka Yellow Cosmos .",How to Grow Cosmos Flowers1," This species of the Cosmos genus is the one most often seen in cultivation, in gardens and in cut flower arrangements. It's also an ingredient in many wildflower mixes and offered in many catalogs. This species has become a weed problem in some regions due to its fast growth and vigorous reseeding. It is easily recognized by it's fine cut foliage resembling a dill plant. This species can grow 2 to 4 feet on average and may grow even taller in more fertile soil. The original variety has starry, single, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink, pink and purplish-red, but there are many other cultivars:



Sensation This cultivar is very easily found in the seed section of many stores.

Sonata This is a dwarf, smaller variety that grows only two to three feet tall

Seashells has petals around the center disk that are fluted like trumpets.

Psyche cultivars have flowers unusually in semi-double form and irregularly sized petals.

Bon-Bon kinds are full, like pom-poms.
Many of the double or semi-double cultivars will occasionally produce different flower shapes on the same plant or from seeds in the same package.
There are many more color forms that can be listed in this article. These are solid (single) colors, bicolored (two colors on one bloom) and some with different colored blotches and streaks on one bloom. Some varieties even change colors as the flower ages and sometimes one plant will have different flowers of varying colors on the same plant.
There are also several cultivars that are a very pale lemon/creamy/primrose yellow color. However these are quite rare and are in limited supply in many specialty garden catalogs.;
, This species originated in Mexico but is now extinct in the wild. It only survives in cultivation as clones from division or tissue culture. This flower is more of a perennial than the other species listed in this article. It forms a tuber which can be dug up in colder winter climates and stored indoors until spring the following season, like a Dahlia bulb.The name comes from not only the dark maroon red-brown color of the flowers but also from the chocolate-vanilla scent the plant gives off in late summer. This species also has larger dark green to burgundy leaves than other species in this article, and may be mistaken for a Dahlia or Coreopsis plant.

, This species shares a height and flower color with Cosmos bipinnatus, but looks a bit more fragile. This flower is a North American native from Southwest parts of the country and is sold in stores specializing in Native American wildflowers. However, in other regions, it has become a weedy wildflower.

, As its name implies, this species is often yellow, or more accurately a bright, neon, yellowish orange. This species can produce flowers in shades of deeper orange to a very interesting orangish-red as well.


The leaves of this variety are also coarser (more like parsley) than other species of this group. This species also tends to be shorter two to three feet tall and is sturdier, making it a great plant for more formal landscapes.
This species can be confused for a Coreopsis or Bidens plant and older botanical texts list it under Coreopsis. Coreopsis produce rounder seeds while Cosmos seeds are skinny and needle like. Also the yellow disk of Coreopsis is bushy and powdery looking while Cosmos centers are looser and have little ""flowers"" and black ""needles"" in the center. Bidens is another yellow daisy wildflower that has lots of species all over the world. The seed has two to five barbs on the end that stick to fur and clothing and also the flowers are smaller than Cosmos with more weedy looking plants. This plant can be called Beggar-ticks, Stickseeds or Tickseed Sunflowers.

Purchase a phosphate fertilizer.,
Add the phosphate fertilizer to the soil.,
Add compost to the soil.",How to Get Wisteria to Bloom2," Using a fertilizer will encourage your wisteria to blossom. You can find phosphate fertilizer from an online retailer, or you can find it in a local or a big box store.

, You should only do this in the early spring, such as April. When you have the fertilizer in your possession, read the instructions on the package and heed any warnings.


If you have plenty of time to fertilize, use a natural fertilizer and apply it to the surface of the soil. This method takes a longer time to release nutrients into the soil.
If you are short on time to fertilize, use a water soluble fertilizer. This is a fluid solution that is dissolved in water and is sprayed onto the soil and the plants.
Many times, when struggling to get a wisteria to bloom, too much nitrogen is the culprit. Adding phosphorus to the soil will balance the nitrogen already present in the soil and will encourage the wisteria to blossom.

, Each spring, you should add compost to the soil around the wisteria. Apply a two-inch covering of mulch on top of the compost. This will retain moisture and deter weeds from growing around the plant.


Wisteria grows best in fertile, moist, well-drained soil.You can make your own compost or purchase compost from a gardening store.
You can also make your own mulch.

Plant wisteria in its ideal climate, if possible.,
Ensure that wisteria gets plenty of sunlight.,
Protect wisteria from frost.,
Give wisteria extra water between July and September.",How to Get Wisteria to Bloom3," Wisteria is best suited for the United States Department of Agriculture’s Hardiness Zones 5 through 9.Although it can grow and adapt to just about any environment in the United States and other countries that do not have extreme climates, it will grow best in Zone 5, located along the United States’ Midwest and Central regions.The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map is the standard used by gardeners to determine which plans are likely to thrive in certain locations.
Zones 5-9 cover most of the continental United States, with the exception of upper midwest region, which covers, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Montana, northern Michigan, and the northern portion of Wyoming.

, The various types of wisteria need a different amounts of sunlight to bloom. Generally speaking, wisteria grows best with sunlight all day long.


Either check online by performing an internet search or check at a gardening store to find out how much sunlight is appropriate for the plant that you would like to bloom.
Chinese wisteria can bloom in partial shade.
Japanese wisteria requires full sunlight to bloom.

, Newly planted wisteria does not do well in cold weather and the buds can be damaged by frost in the spring. If you live in an area with cold weather, you will need to plant wisteria somewhere that is sheltered so that the buds are protected from the frost.You can shelter the plant by wrapping it in burlap during the winter and when frost is expected during the spring. Be sure to keep an eye on the weather and stay on top of any frost warnings.
You can also plant wisteria so that it is protected by a structure, such as a screen, but this may not work if the species of wisteria requires a lot of sun.

, This is when the buds for next year are formed and the plant could benefit from some extra water.Wisteria does not need to be watered often and should actually only be watered if you live in an area that receives less than an inch of rain per week. Otherwise, wisteria will receive enough water."

The only requirement is that it be a cloth one, as all-plastic ones will likely heat the flower roots too much and could kill them during warmer weather periods.

, It will need to be at least as wide as the shoe bag.

, Either place two hooks on the wall at the same space across as the shoe bag hanger holes are, or knock in two nails. Whatever you use, it must be solid and strong because once you add soil to the shoe bag, it'll be hanging heavily.

, Adjust if necessary to ensure that it is sitting straight and taut.

, Old grocery plastic bags or freezer bags are ideal.

, Add any well-rotted manure or compost, or other fertilizer to help the flowers grow well.

, Continue until the whole shoe bag is filled with flowers.

, Water regularly but gently, so as to not over water the plants. Mulch to keep the soil moist. It can also help to add a saturating aid to the soil, to evenly distribute and retain the water.

, Consider using other items you don't need anymore to make a flower wall, such as cloth bags, stitched up denim shorts or jeans, etc.

Build a wall that can contain flowerpots filled with flowers.,
Design the wall.,
Add soil and seeds or seedlings to the flowerpots.,
Care for the flowers as required.",How to Grow a Flower Wall3," For this method, you'll need sufficient cinder blocks to complete the area of wall you wish to cover.

, The approach to this is to stack the cinder blocks so that they leave open holes for slipping the containers into. As such, you'll need to develop a criss-cross building method, such as:


Build a row of cinder blocks measuring five blocks in total.
Place the first cinder block lengthwise, the second cinder block frontward, with one hole completely facing outward.
Place the next cinder block lengthwise. Place the next cinder blocks facing frontward, again with one hole completely facing outward. This first row allows for three flowerpots to be inserted into the holes.
Build the next row with three cinder blocks going along lengthwise.
Build the next row with the first cinder block facing frontward, with one hole hanging in mid-air and the back of the block firmly held on the row beneath. Place the next cinder block lengthwise.
Finish up with one cinder block facing lengthwise.
In all, starting with a five block base, the above described structure will give you about nine holes for inserting flowerpots into.
Adjust the amount of cinder blocks according to your needs, using the above description as a guide to the criss-crossing method.

, Place the flowerpots in their new homes, one in each of the holes.

, Water and feed regularly. Mulch to keep the soil moist. When the flowers bloom, you'll have a pretty flower wall.


The cinder blocks can be decorated with paint, glued-on craft items, etc., as wished. If painting, use paint suitable for cinder blocks.

Plant the peonies in early to mid-fall in holes that are 1 to 1 ½ feet deep.,
Avoid planting your peonies too deeply.,
Water your peonies.,
Feed the peonies with a low nitrogen fertilizer.,
Don’t trim the peonies over the summer.,
Divide older plants if they stop blooming.",How to Get Peonies to Bloom2," The eyes or buds on the top of each tuber should be covered with no more than 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of soil. Planting peonies before the frost date gives them time to get established and often allows them to bloom sooner than they would under other circumstances.


However, even these peonies may not bloom in their first season and specimens that have been grown from seed may take up to five years to flower.

, Gardeners need to be careful not to plant peony roots too deeply or these plants may produce foliage and no flowers. Specimens that are heavily mulched may also suffer from this problem. In the spring, you should clear away mulch and make sure the root’s eyes are buried no more than two inches deep in the soil. Otherwise, you may end up having to dig up the plants to place them at the correct depth.

, Water the peony tubers generously every 10 to 14 days until the ground freezes. Deep but infrequent watering will encourage the peonies to grow deep roots, making them more tolerant of drought conditions.


When the ground freezes, spread a 2- to 3-inch layer of organic mulch over the peony tubers. Pull the mulch back away from the peonies when the first new stems begin to emerge in the spring.
Begin watering them again, if they are not getting enough water from spring rain, and continue to water them every 10 to 14 days throughout the growing season.
In the fall, when the foliage has begun to die down after the first hard frost, remove the foliage and stems and water the peonies less often.

, Peonies do not need high amounts of fertilizer but a little low-nitrogen fertilizer will give them a boost to help them bloom. Use fertilizer with a 5-10-10 or 5-10-5 ratio


A common application rate is 1 to 1 ½ pounds per 50 square feet, but this can vary. Follow the application rate recommended by the fertilizer manufacturer. Sprinkle the fertilizer over the soil 6 to 18 inches (15.2 to 45.7 cm) away from the peony stems. Do not let the fertilizer touch the stems.
Work the fertilizer into the top few inches of soil gently with a hand rake. Water the peonies generously after applying the fertilizer to help wash it down to the roots.

, During July and August, gardeners should avoid trimming their peonies if they want flowers because doing so will weaken the plant and reduce the number of blooms. Sometimes the plants will not flower at all under such circumstances.


However, gardeners may want to consider trimming their plants to ground level during the autumn months to prevent any illnesses from taking hold while the peonies are dormant.

, Clusters of peonies that have been growing for over five years may need to be divided if they suddenly stop blooming. Peonies that are being crowded by other plants may stop flowering because they are having to compete for nutrients and may not have enough. Dividing will help rejuvenate the plants.


However, recently divided plants may fail to bloom for a while after they are divided.

Water in the seeds.,
Troubleshoot issues as the plant grows.,
Remove the dying flowers.,
Know how to grow the more delicate chocolate cosmos.",How to Grow Cosmos Flowers2," Most Cosmos species come from South America or Mexico, and thrive in hot, dry climates with late summer rains. In these conditions they are very easy to grow, making them great plants for children or novice gardeners. In fact, this species has run wild in many regions in the world. Over-pampering does more harm than good.


They are drought-tolerant plants rarely bothered by pests or diseases.

, Cosmos plants only want to be planted in a full sun and well drained soil conditions. Soil that is too fertile or too wet will cause plants to grow tall weak, and leggy that don't stand up well to heavy winds and rain. They can tolerate partial shade.



Cosmos flowers don't really like being transplanted or moved once established. Choose a spot wisely.

, Always wait until the last frost has passed, and preferably until the soil has warmed to 60 to 70ºF (16-21ºC). Cover the seeds lightly with ⅛–¼"" (3–6mm) as they need dark to germinate.

, Water the soil to settle the seeds into the soil and to aid in seed to soil contact. The seeds should germinate in 7 days to 2 weeks on average. Cosmos seeds don't mind being heavily planted.

, Once the first true leaves appear (the second pair), the sprouts have a high survival rate on their own. Cosmos is a hardy, annual plant that can tolerate drought as well as light to moderate frost. Check occasionally for problems and address them as follows:


Water only in severe drought.
Some older varieties are daylight sensitive, and may not bloom until late summer. Provide partial shade if you want to speed this up.
You may wish to throw out plants that produce extra-small flowers, or that turn completely yellow. This second group may be about to wilt, but note that yellowish-green seedlings are normal.
If your plants get top-heavy as they flower, stake or support them.

, This is called deadheading. After you cut the dead flowers off, more buds will form beneath the cut flower stem giving more flowers.


Know that most Cosmos plants are annuals and after one growing season. When your plants start looking sickly and dead it's time to pull em out of the garden and throw them out.

, Cosmos are hardy annuals with the exception of the Chocolate Cosmos. This particular species is a tender perennial that can't stand the winter weather of northern climates.


The chocolate cosmos practically has the same requirements as the other species, but the bulb can be dug and stored indoors over winter in a frost-free dry location. Planting the tuber is like planting a Dahlia root. If you live in a frost free environment (zones 7 to 10 USDA hardiness zones, maybe zone 6) they can be left all year around. This plant will rot in overly moist soil, growing more slowly in the garden and can be placed in a container that can be brought indoors. In warmer areas, the plants benefit from mulching to protect from cold.
You can propagate the plant via division of the tuber. Lift the plant out and cut pieces of the root with eyes (growing spots with leaves and roots growing) and planting in original garden soil with watering after planting or in the spring right before you are just ready to plant.

"
"
Let the plant reseed (optional).,
Wait until the seeds mature.,
Collect the seeds.,
Spread out the seeds to dry.,
Plant immediately or store for up to six months.",How to Grow Cosmos Flowers3," Cosmos can reseed in a garden, surprising the grower with new plants in the spring. There is usually no need to harvest the seeds yourself, unless you want to place them in a particular spot.


Note that the next generation may or may not be the exact clones of the original plants you planted.
Chocolate cosmos will not produce fertile seeds.

, After the flower dies, the center of the bloom (disk) will turn into what looks sort of like a porcupine with brown to black seeds. Wait until these seeds shrivel and turn brown.

, Once the seeds are ready, you can easily pull them off the flower. Grasp the base of the flower head with a light touch and pull outward to brush the seeds into a sandwich bag or other container., Leave the seeds in a sunny area protected from wind. After about four to seven days, they should feel mostly dry and a little sticky.

, If there are frosts in your area, seal them in a plastic bag and keep them in a cool, dry place. Plant next spring.


Label the bag with the year you collected the seeds and the variety of Cosmos.
Sometimes you'll see little bugs in the cosmos seeds you've collected and dried. Don't panic –– they are not a major problem, and typically die off after a month or so.

Remove each flower as it fades.,

Move on to the next section after 6–8 weeks.,
Test to see if the bulb is rotted.,
Replace some or all of the soil.,
Water the soil thoroughly if you repotted it.,
Keep the plant in a relatively cool location.,
Wait for the plant to flower.",How to Get Amaryllis to Rebloom," Once a flower has faded, cut the flower where it meets the main stalk with a clean knife or scissors. Make sure to remove the green lump and thin green stem attaching the flower to the stalk.This prevents the plant from producing seeds, which requires a lot of energy that could be going into survival and growth instead., The main stalks contain food and water the plant can use, but they will likely begin to droop or turn yellow shortly after the flowers fade.They are no longer useful at this point, and should be cut back to within 2 inches (5 cm) of the bulb.Be careful not to cut the leaves or the top of the bulb. Only the flower stalks should be removed.Do not be alarmed if sap runs out of the cut. This is normal for a well-watered plant., Most people with amaryllis plants keep them indoors while they bloom in winter. If this is the case, move the plant to a windowsill with indirect sunlight to let it adjust to increased sunlight.You may skip this step if the plant was already exposed to indirect or full sunlight.


In the northern hemisphere, north and east facing windows receive indirect sunlight. In the southern hemisphere, south and east facing windows do.

, Your amaryllis will likely require daily watering unless kept in a humid environment or planted outside in moist soil.Don't let the soil dry out completely, at least not for longer than a few hours.

, Depending on your local climate, this typically begins in May or June in the northern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere, warm weather usually begins in December or January.

, Once the last frost has passed and the weather is consistently warm, plant the container outside in a flower bed or garden. Bury it so the rim is at or just above the surface. Select a location that receives full morning light if possible, but is protected from sun during the hottest part of the day.Amaryllis plants grow better in containers, which also protect against burrowing animals and insects.Growing them directly in the soil is possible, but will be more difficult.
The leaves may flop over when the plant is first moved outside, but with proper care new, more upright leaves should grow., Check the soil daily and water whenever it is dry or almost dry. Water the soil around the plant, not the leaves or bulb. Avoid watering any plants during the hottest part of the day, since the hot water can burn the plant.


Keep the soil moist, not soaked. If your soil does not drain properly, the pooling water could rot the roots.

, Make the bulb strong and healthy by applying a balanced fertilizer to the soil every two weeks. Use a soluble houseplant fertilizer and apply according to instructions.Do not apply more than instructed.


You should see the plant grow new, darker leaves throughout the summer.

, If the leaves begin to turn yellow, which is normal, the plant is entering its dormant period. This typically occurs in early autumn. Expect this change in August or September if you live in the northern hemisphere, or March or April if you live in the southern hemisphere.

, The amaryllis should lose its foliage as the summer ends and autumn begins. When this begins to happen, start giving the plant slightly smaller quantities of water, but do not allow the soil to dry out completely.

, Trim the yellow or brown leaves once they have withered by cutting them off next to the neck of the bulb. Allow living green leaves to remain on the plant., Once the weather is cooler and most of the leaves have died, bring the amaryllis indoors. Place the pot in a cool, dark area between 40 and 50ºF (5–10ºC), such as a basement.If you do not have a suitable area for a pot, you may carefully remove the bulb and roots from the soil and place it in the crisper (vegetable drawer) of a refrigerator.Always bring the amaryllis in before the first frost, which typically occurs at 32ºF or 0ºC night temperature.
If storing in your refrigerator, do not store fruit in your refrigerator at the same time. Many fruits, especially apples, release chemicals that can sterilize your amaryllis bulb., Leave the amaryllis in the cool, dark environment for at least six weeks. Do not water it during this time, but do remove any remaining leaves as they die.This is the bulb's dormant period, and the plant must experience this in order to bloom again.

, If you want the amaryllis to rebloom by a particular date, such as Christmas, remove the bulb from the cool area at least six weeks before that day.

, Reach under the soil surface and gently squeeze the bulb. If the bulb is soft, it may have rotted and become unusable.If you are not certain, you may wish to attempt to rebloom the bulb anyway, but acquire a backup amaryllis as well in case the original bulb dies.

, Like most plants, amaryllis plants grow better in certain types of soil, and over a period of 1–3 years they may remove the nutrients from their soil. While it is not difficult to get an amaryllis to rebloom, you may have a larger, healthier plant if you use a special potting mix. Amaryllis roots are easily harmed during transplanting, so if you are not used to transplanting flowers you may wish to replace the top 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of soil instead.The best soil for amaryllis consists of two parts loamy soil, without much sand or clay; one part perlite or gravel; and one part organic matter such as rotted manure, peat, leaf mold, or composted bark.A clay pot might be better than a plastic one, since the amaryllis can become top-heavy and tip a lightweight pot over., If you transplanted the bulb into a new pot, you should water the soil thoroughly and allow the excess to drain through the base of the pot. Following the initial watering, you should keep the soil damp, but not soaked, as in the summer or autumn.

, The ideal temperature for forcing an amaryllis to flower is between 55 and 65ºF (13–18ºC). Warmer temperatures may result in floppy, limp leaves and stems.Cooler temperatures may prevent or slow growth.

, While a new amaryllis plant usually grows a flower before leaves, you may see these appear in either order when it reblooms.Keep the soil damp, but not soaked, and expect your new flower or flowers approximately six weeks after you moved it to warmer area.

Buy the bulbs at a nursery or garden center.,
Look at a home improvement store.,
Go online.,
Try buying by mail order.,
Get the bulb from an existing tulip.",How to Get Tulip Bulbs1," Nurseries specialize in propagating various plants, but some retail nurseries may also sell seeds and bulbs. Garden centers sell fewer developed tulips than nurseries do, but they are more likely to sell tulip bulbs than most nurseries are. Since tulips are fairly popular flowers, both small, local garden centers and larger chains are likely to sell tulip bulbs, but the selection of species may not remarkably vast. Finding a garden center with a varied selection may take a little effort.;
, Nowadays, most chain home improvement stores have a ""garden center"" section. Gardeners tend to have mixed results by shopping for bulbs at these locations, but as long as you know what to look for, you can usually find decent bulbs. Home improvement stores are particularly convenient for buying large bulk amounts of bulbs in common species, but rarer species will be hard to come by at these venues.

, The Internet is your best resource for finding a wide selection of specialized bulb varieties. Since you cannot physically examine each bulb you purchase, however, you must take extra precaution to find out if the online shop you buy is reputable. Shop with retailers with a recognizable name in the gardening world. Look at reviews of each site, and favor online retailers that offer some form of guarantee or pledge of quality.


Consider buying bulbs from retailers based in the Netherlands. The Netherlands regulate tulip production, and as a result, Dutch tulips and tulip bulbs usually end up being top-notch.

, With the dawning of the Internet, the seed catalogs of old are used less and less. Some companies still put out seed catalogs, though, and many of these catalogs are free. The benefits of mail ordering tulip bulbs through a catalog are numerous. Even though you cannot physically examine your purchase, the vast majority of retailers who put out seed catalogs are reputable and worth dealing with. You also have a wide selection to choose from and can order in bulk if desired.

, Technically, tulips are perennial flowers, so one bulb has the potential to bloom year after year. The trouble is that tulip bulbs take a little encouragement to continue blooming. Bulbs need to be planted deep in loose soil that drains remarkably well; otherwise, they may rot. Fertilizing active tulips also helps the bulb gather more energy. Once the flower begins to wilt and the leaves yellow, the tulip must also be cut down so that more of the energy can go to the bulb rather than the dying growth.

"
"
Purchase enough.,
Select large, healthy bulbs.,
Look for ""naturalizing"" or ""perennializing"" bulbs.While tulip bulbs are perennial by nature, those specifically labeled for perennializing purposes are even more likely to return year after year.,
Choose a variety that suits your wants and needs.The options are markedly vast.",How to Get Tulip Bulbs2," If you plan on planting the bulbs in a container or small area, you may only need a few. On the other hand, if you want a beautiful bed of tulips, you will need a great deal more. To cover 10 square feet (3.05 square meters), you will typically need about 65 large tulip bulbs or 75 species tulips, which tend to be a bit smaller.

, In order to get the most performance from a tulip bulb, you need to pay attention to size and quality.Bigger bulbs have more energy stored. As such, the bigger the bulb, the bigger the resulting tulip. If you want smaller tulips, smaller bulbs are in order, but most gardeners prefer to get the biggest bulbs their money can buy. Bigger bulbs are also more likely to successfully produce flowers on a perennial basis.






The bulb should be hard and solid when purchased. The outer skin, called the ""tunic,"" can be a bit torn or scraped up, but the bulb beneath should not be marred. Soft spots are indicative of rot and spots usually signify the presence of disease.







, This is especially important when selecting a hybrid species, since cross-breeding sometimes diminishes the perennial nature of the tulip. Most wild bulbs, or ""species,"" retain their full perennial nature, though.

, Do thorough research to determine which type offers you the look you want for your garden.


Natural varieties, or ""species"" tulips, are usually listed by height. You should choose whichever height you favor.
Single earlies are the most common type used for formal beds and often look best in yellow, orange, and pink.
Double earlies are a bit smaller than single earlies, and they often look nice in yellow, red, and violet.
Darwins have notably tall stems.
Cottage tulips are similar to Darwins, but the flowers are a bit taller.
Lily-flowered tulips are among the best tulips to use if you plan on cutting them for bouquets or decoration.
Late doubles have heavy flower heads and occasionally need to be staked when grown in regions that experience heavy rainfalls.
Parrots have ""feathery"" petals with fringed edges.

or 1 tablespoon sugar mixed with 1/4 teaspoon bleach






or 2 parts water to 1 part tonic water,






or non-diet lemon lime soda







,
Re cut stems and change the water every few days add.

",How to Force Spring Flowers in Winter," Experiment with a variety of things from your garden, cutting heavily budded branches on a mild day. Choose stems of medium thickness or better, since these contain large quantities of stored sugar needed to nourish flower buds.;
, Cut branches at least 2'-3' long; shorter branches are less effective in arrangements.

, Slit up the stem ends a few inches or crush slightly with pliers to encourage water absorption. Some may bloom faster if you submerge them completely in a tepid water bath for a few hours before making your arrangement.

,,"
"
Check for new buds on the branches in early to late winter.,
Cut the stems with sharp hand pruners.,
Split the stems using a sharp knife or pruners.,
Place the cut ends in warm water.,
Use your thumb to rub off any flower buds below the surface of the water in the vase.,
Keep the vase of branches in a room at 60- to 70-degree Fahrenheit.It’s important to keep the branches warm in a humid environment to encourage them to bud.

,
Place the vase in a spot with bright, indirect sunlight.,
Replace the water in the vase with fresh warm water every two to three days.,
Pay attention to how quickly the forsythia flower buds bloom.",How to Force Forsythia Blossoms," Depending on your climate, you should begin checking forsythia branches every few days for new flower buds in December, January or February.In USDA Hardiness Zones 8 and 9, begin checking in December as these shrubs can begin to bloom by the end of January.In Zones 5 through 7, begin checking in January or February.These buds will appear small, elongated, and pointed and green or yellowish in color, encircling the branch all along its length.;
, Once the buds appear, you can cut the stems as long or as short as you’d like and bring the stems indoors., You will want to split the branch up the middle at the cut end. Make the split 1 ½ to 4 inches long.

, Fill a vase or decorative cup with warm water and place the cut ends in the vessel. After a few minutes, take each branch out of the water one at a time and use sharp pruners to cut 1 inch off the end.


Splitting the branches and removing another inch from the end will help keep the stems open to absorb water. If you do not split the branches, the cut end of the branch will try to seal itself off with sap.

, If these buds are left on the stems submerged in water, they will rot, causing bacteria to grow in the water and make your beautiful arrangement of forsythia smell bad, rather than fragrant.

,, Avoid spots with direct sunlight as this will cause the flowers to fade more rapidly.

, This will help to eliminate any bacteria that may begin to grow, which will cause the flowers to stink and make the stems slimy.


You can also add a floral preservative to the water to help reduce bacteria. They can be purchased from a garden center or your local florist. The packet of preservative should be poured directly into the water in the vase and stirred until it dissolves, before putting the branches back in the vase.
As long as you replace the water in the vase regularly, you will not need to add a preservative.

, The length of time it takes the buds to bloom depends on how close they were to blooming before the stems were cut, but typically the buds should bloom within one to eight weeks.


If the buds do not open four to six weeks after you’ve cut them, they will probably take about three to four weeks to open.
Though the flowers will bloom more quickly after they are brought indoors due to the warmer indoor temperature, it still takes some time for the buds to mature and open. Of course, the beauty of forsythia buds, especially in the dead of winter, are well worth the wait!

Trick the bulbs using a cold environment to make them flower.,
Pick large, firm bulbs of short tulip varieties to have the best chance of flowering.,
Store bulbs in a cool, dry, dark place after the chilling process.,
Choose a properly-sized vase.,
Try the alternative stone-filled vase method.,
Place your bulb on top without touching the water.",How to Force Tulip Bulbs in Water1," Bulbs need to be ‘tricked’ into believing they have survived winter in order to start flowering. This means they need to experience a sustained cold environment whilst they are dormant.


The ones you buy commercially are likely to have been chilled for you.
If you are supplying your own bulbs, you’ll need to recreate this cold environment yourself.
You can place the bulbs in a fridge salad drawer, but keep them well away from fruit, especially apples, because they emit gases that will inhibit the bulbs’ later flowering.
You can also try using a cool cellar if you can achieve an ideal temperature of between 30 and 50 F.
Your bulbs need to stay at this cool temperature for around 4 months.;
, Not all commercially purchased tulips will stand forcing.


Check the label when you are shopping for bulbs.
As a general rule, shorter tulip varieties tend to do better than taller varieties when forced.
The essential thing is to select good healthy bulbs that are large and firm.
Reject any bulbs that seem rather small or are soft or mushy.

, After chilling or purchase, store your bulbs in a cool dry and dark place until you are ready to force them.


You don’t want your bulbs to dry out completely, so keep them out of drafts.
Inside a paper bag in a cool cupboard is ideal.

, You don’t always have to get a specially designed vase to force tulips.


The most important thing to remember is that the bulb should not touch the water, otherwise it will rot.
The bulb does need to sit right above the water though, so the roots can grow down into it.
You can get special glassware vases for forcing bulbs in garden stores or online.

, You can try filling a receptacle, like a tall vase, with a few handfuls of decorative pebbles or glass beads. Then fill with the vase water.


The bulb should sit on top of the stones but still not touch the water.
The bulb roots will need a few inches of water to grow down into.
If you’re improvising with your own vessel, just remember that the tulip needs to sit above the water but shouldn’t touch it.

, Fill your receptacle with a few handfuls of pebbles or glass beads. Top it up with cool water and place the tulip bulb on top.


The pointed part of the tulip bulb should point upwards.
The base of the bulb should not touch the water, but the water should be just a few millimeters below the bulb.
It’s fine to force several bulbs in the same vase, but avoid the bulbs touching in case one rots and spreads the infection to its neighbor.
Remember, bulbs may swell during forcing, so give them about an inch of space each.

"
"
Place your forcing receptacle into a cool, dimly lit place for a month.,
Keep your tulips hydrated.,
Keep rotating the vase to ensure even sunlight.,
Decide when to force your tulips.,
Understand that you can't force tulips multiple times.",How to Force Tulip Bulbs in Water2," The cool and dark space encourages the plant to grow its roots rather than shoots, which is a better use of energy in the first few weeks.


60 F is the optimum temperature. This is a rather cool room temperature, such as you might get in a cellar or garage.
This step is optional but highly recommended.
After a month, you can bring the tulip and its vessel out into a bright warm room.
You should always make sure the water is topped up.

, Make sure the water in your vessel is topped up so the roots remain in water, but don’t let the bulb itself soak.


Unless you home is very hot and dry, you should check once or twice a week.
It’s best to keep forcing tulips out of direct sunlight but they will appreciate a bright room out of direct sunlight.

, You are advised to keep rotating the vase. Tulips will grow pointing towards the light, such as from the nearest window.


Rotating the vase encourages them to grow straight and even.

, Depending on when you want your tulips to be fully flowered, decide when you want to begin the forcing process.


If you start forcing tulips in the fall, they will need around 3 or 4 months to come into flower.
However, those that started right in the middle of winter, for example in December, won’t need as long to come to flower; possibly only 2 months.
If you want tulips in flower over the holidays for indoor displays, you’ll need to get started no later than October.
If you are keen to have tulips for a very specific date, it’s usually wise to try forcing them at intervals.
Start in early September and start forcing one bulb each week until the middle of October.
This will make it more likely that you’ll have flowers by the holiday season.

, Unfortunately, forcing a bulb tends to take a toll on the bulb’s reserve of energy.


Some kinds of bulbs can recover from forcing and go on to flower again, but tulips are less good at this.
It’s fairly unlikely a tulip will flower again once forced, and a tulip bulb won’t stand being forced twice.
If you are really reluctant to give up on a bulb once its been forced, you can try planting it in an out of the way corner of the garden with some fertilizer.
Possibly it may recover after a few years but you’ll get a better display if you buy new bulbs to replace forced ones.
Spent forced bulbs can be composted, unless they show signs of disease. In this case, burn them or dispose of them with household waste.

"
Use a general purpose, slow acting fertilizer.,
Combine with the seedling-appropriate soil.,
Apply a second dose when the plant's buds develop.",How to Fertilize Impatiens1," Choose one that is either 15-15-15 or 20-10-20.;
, Water as usual.

, This is optional.

"
"
Use a water soluble fertilizer.",How to Fertilize Impatiens2," Fertilize every 2 weeks for best, lush growth.

Use a pellet fertilizer that has slow-release properties.,
Place the pellet fertilizer directly into a hole that has been dug around the root area of the plant.

,
Water a little more than usual directly after fertilizing.,
Repeat doses every 6-8 weeks.",How to Fertilize Impatiens3," Various brands of slow-release pellet fertilizer can be obtained from your local garden center or nursery.

,, Then water as normal.

, Any more often than this risks burning the plant. If the plant is growing well, you may not even need to repeat the does that season.

Understand that when you force narcissus, they may not flower again.,
Add fertilizer to the bulb to try to get it to flower again.",How to Force Paperwhite Narcissus Bulbs," Don’t choose any that seem at all mushy or discolored as this can indicate rot. Any bulbs showing signs of disease or rot should be thrown away – don’t compost them as this can spread infection round the garden.;
, After purchasing, store your bulbs in a cool, dry place and exclude light until you are ready to prepare them for forcing. It’s best to use them quickly and not store for very long.


It isn’t desirable for bulbs to get totally dry. To avoid them drying out too much it’s best to keep them away from drafts or sources of heat such as TV or computer equipment, lights etc.
A good way to store them is in a paper bag placed inside a cupboard.

, You can force individual bulbs in special hourglass-shaped containers but narcissi generally look better in a group rather than individually.


Most bulb forcing vases may be a bit big for small Paperwhite Narcissus bulbs, therefore it’s better to group several into a larger container.

, Choose a container without any drainage holes: a glass vase or deep dish at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep is ideal. Glass works best so you can see what’s going on inside and the light can penetrate.

, Perhaps you want to get your Paperwhite Narcissus blooming for a particular date, such as the holiday season. It isn’t always easy to predict exactly how long they will take but it’s usually between 4 and 6 weeks.


To have Paperwhite Narcissus on the Christmas table, you should probably start the forcing process no later than the middle of November. To be absolutely sure of hitting the date you had in mind, try forcing a set of Paperwhite Narcissus weekly starting about 6 weeks ahead of your intended date.
For Christmas flowers, start the first batch off in the second week in November, then do another batch every week until the second week in December.

, Fill the container with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of pebbles, marbles, shells or glass beads. Add water to just the top of the pebbles.

, Place your bulbs carefully on top of the pebbles. The pointed end of the bulb should point upwards. It’s best if you can avoid the bulbs touching. If one rots, the rest will then avoid being affected if they aren’t touching the rotted bulb.

, You might like to add additional glass beads or pebbles to approximately the neck of the bulb, but this isn’t essential. Only the very base of the bulb, the lowest millimeter, should touch the water.

, Keep the room at a cool room temperature, for example in a cool room away from sources of heat such as radiators and electrical equipment. You should exclude light by putting the container in a cupboard until you see roots begin to develop.

, Once roots appear, it’s time to move the vase to a sunny position. A window ledge facing the sun is a good spot, but try not to let the temperature get too warm. Cool room temperature is best, away from radiators or other sources of heat.

, Once the flowers appear, you want to move your forced Narcissi to a cool spot out of direct sunlight. A brightly lit room but without direct sunlight is perfect: a window ledge that does not receive full sun is good.


This kind of cool, sunless position will make the flowers last a bit longer than they would in hot direct sunlight.

, Depending on your room conditions, you may need to check every other day or at least twice a week to check the water level.

, It’s a good idea to rotate the container once or twice a week because the bulbs will point towards a source of light, such as a window. If you rotate the vase it will encourage them to grow straight rather than leaning towards the nearest light source.

, If you choose to cut the flowers to use in a vase arrangement of cut flowers, it’s best not to mix Paperwhite Narcissus with other flowers as they release chemicals which cause other varieties of flower to wilt.

, A Paperwhite Narcissus bulb tends not to perform too well if you try to get it to flower again after forcing it.


Forcing a bulb depletes its reserves of energy and the bulb won’t always recover to flower again even if planted in soil. The bulbs won’t stand being forced twice.
You can try planting them outdoors in a sunny site in frost-free areas if you are patient and don’t mind waiting a few years, just in case the bulb recovers.

, If you are very keen to keep the bulbs after forcing, make sure you add some water-soluble fertilizer to the water you force the bulbs in.


As soon as it finishes flowering, cut off the flower stalks and plant the bulb in a sunny spot in the garden with a handful of slow-release fertilizer, and let the foliage die back naturally. It’s best to leave it in a secluded spot in the garden as it may take a few years to recover.
The bulb may appreciate a thick mulch being put over it after the foliage withers away – this will help it survive the colder months.
You may do better to throw the forced bulbs away and buy new ones because the forced bulb won’t perform as well again.

Plant calla lilies in soil with good drainage.,
Incorporate some organic matter into the soil.,

Use a water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season.,
Control pests using a bug spray.,
Cut off the flowers for indoor display.,
In warmer climates, leave the calla rhizomes in the ground.,
In colder climes, lift the calla rhizomes after the first frost.,
Move potted calla lilies to a cool, dark location.",How to Get Calla Lilies to Flower," Like most plants, calla lilies hate sitting in soggy soil, so make sure the soil in your garden (or wherever you intend to plant the calla lilies) is free-draining.


If you aren’t sure if your soil has good drainage, wait until it rains and see if the water soaks away easily.
If puddles form and don’t easily disperse, lingering for several hours, your soil drainage could be improved.;
, You can improve soil drainage by incorporating some organic matter into the soil, such as well-rotted manure or compost. This will also enrich the soil, helping the calla lilies to flower.


If you’re really doing this right, remove the soil to spade’s depth, then fork it over to another spade’s depth, incorporating plenty of manure or compost as you fluff up the soil.
Finally replace the removed soil, also incorporating plenty of, manure or compost.
Alternately, try gardening using the raised bed method.

, Calla lilies prefer to grow and flower in sunny spots, however they will tolerate some shade, at least for part of the day.However, in particularly hot climates, calla lilies will prefer to be in the shade during the intense heat of the afternoon. They will still require sunlight in the mornings though.

, Mid spring is usually a good time to start planting calla lily rhizomes. Just make sure to wait until all threat of frost has passed and the soil has had a chance to heat up a little before planting the rhizomes., Calla lilies are grown from rhizomes. These rhizomes have growing points, also known as ‘eyes’. The rhizome should be planted with these eyes facing upwards and just visible at the top of the soil. Space the rhizomes approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart., After planting, give the calla lily rhizomes a good soaking with water. After this initial soaking, you should keep the soil moist but not wet.

, If you plan on growing calla lilies indoors, you can start planting in December. This will allow the calla lilies to flower earlier than usual, in late spring.

, Container-grown calla lilies will prefer a loam-based compost as this provides a good mix of the nutrients necessary for their growth. However, a decent-quality compost will also do.

, Plant the calla lilies with the eyes of the rhizome facing upwards - they should be just visible under the surface of the soil.

, Make sure the pot you use for planting the calla lily rhizomes has good drainage holes. Calla lilies will rot in soggy soil.

, The best place to keep a potted calla lily is on a bright windowsill, at a cool room temperature.

, Calla lilies need to be watered throughout the summer. Remember that the soil should be moist but not wet or soggy.

, Feed the calla lilies fortnightly during the growing period. A water-soluble fertilizer added to the watering can is ideal.


You should stop feeding ground-planted calla lilies once flowering begins, but continue to feed container-grown callas throughout the flowering period.

, Calla lilies are generally trouble-free when it comes to disease, but they can suffer from pest attacks such as aphid or whitefly. Keep an eye out for pests and spray the flowers as required with an all-purpose bug spray.

, It won’t harm the plant if flowers are cut for indoor display. Use a clean sharp knife to remove flowers at the base of the stem.


They will do best in a cool room in a vase two thirds full of water. Aim to replace the water every third day and keep it topped up.
Some people like to keep their vase in the fridge overnight to preserve the life of their flowers – but you need a big fridge for this!

, Calla lilies can cope outdoors through winter in zones 8-10.


If you are overwintering outdoors, apply a mulch of about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of straw. evergreen branches or well-rotted manure in the fall, or put them under an upturned pot or cloche.
The plant needs some dormant time after flowering, so refrain from watering and allow the plant to die back. It’s best to refrain from cutting the foliage until it has withered away.

, If you live in a colder climate, consider lifting your Calla rhizomes over the winter to give them a better chance of survival.


To do this, wait until just after the first frost. Brush off as much soil as you can without damaging the roots and then allow the rhizome to dry for a few days. You can put them on some newspaper sheets in a cool dark place such as a garden shed.
After they have dried out for a few days, put them into paper bags with a small amount of peat moss. Damp and rot are the biggest threats to overwintering rhizomes, so try to keep them dry where possible and store in a dark, dry place.

, Once flowering ends, give your potted calla lilies a feed with a potassium-rich fertilizer (one suitable for tomatoes will do).


After that, cease watering your container-grown Calla Lily and move the pot to a cool dark area once the foliage withers away. A dark corner of a garden shed is suitable.
Don’t water again for 3 months and avoid cutting the foliage until it has withered away."

Be aware that irises need to be divided.,
Cut the leaves down to a height of six inches.,
Shake the soil off the rhizomes so that you can divide them more easily.,
Throw away older pieces of rhizome with no leaves growing from them.",How to Get Irises to Bloom1," The first and most likely cause for irises failing to bloom is overcrowding. Irises must be dug up, divided and replanted every three to four years.If this does not happen, it becomes less likely that your irises will bloom.;
, Use a shovel to begin working the soil roughly six to eight inches away from the stems of the irises. Loosen the clump of iris roots away from the dirt.


When it is loosened up, lift the clump out of the ground with the tip of the shovel.

, Pull multiple rhizomes apart by hand. Make sure there is a healthy fan of leaves attached to each rhizome.

, Re-plant the remaining, healthy rhizomes right away. Choose a spot that is bright and sunny. The soil should drain quickly or else your irises will get soggy feet, which can also halt their ability to bloom.

"
"
Understand that irises require sunlight to bloom.,
Move your irises.,
Give your iris the water it needs, depending on the type of iris it is.,
Determine which type of iris is growing in your garden.",How to Get Irises to Bloom2," A lack of sunlight will prevent irises from blooming to their full potential. These plants require at least four to six hours of direct sunlight each day.Most varieties prefer six to eight hours of sunlight.

, If your irises are planted in a shady place, move them to a sunnier location in late summer. Make sure the soil at the new location drains quickly.

, Sufficient moisture is necessary to get irises to bloom but irrigation frequency depends primarily on the iris species.


Reticulated irises (Iris reticulata), for example, should be watered once per week or so if it does not rain in the spring but only once every few weeks throughout the summer months.
German irises (Iris germanica) should be watered when the top of the soil begins to dry out. This should be done throughout the growing season.
Southern blue flag irises (Iris virginica) require constantly moist soil and actually thrive in sandy-bottom bogs.

, Adjust the watering schedule according to your specific iris's needs.


Always water irises in the morning so that the moisture will be available to them during the heat of the day.

"
"
Look out for fertilizers that will not promote blooms.,
Give the irises a 5-10-10 fertilizer.,
Do not sprinkle the fertilizer on the rhizomes as it can damage them.,
Consider using a slow release formula.",How to Get Irises to Bloom3," High-nitrogen fertilizers like those used to fertilize grass encourage only green leafy growth. They do not encourage flowering., This means that the fertilizer should contain 5% nitrogen, 10% phosphate, and 10% potash.Plan to use about ¼ pound of fertilizer per 25 square feet.

, Instead, sprinkle the fertilizer around the outside of the main clump of rhizomes. Water the plant to help mix it into the soil.

, A 6-month slow-release formula can be used if preferred. If a slow-release formula fertilizer is not used, reblooming irises should be fed fertilizer again immediately after they bloom in the spring.

Apply 10-10-10 plant fertilizer to the base of your hydrangeas in late fall.,
Water the plant thoroughly after fertilizing.",How to Prepare Hydrangeas for Winter1," Fertilizing in the fall will supply the roots of woody plants the extra nutrients needed to sustain them through the dry winter months. Remove all debris, such as leaves, sticks or rocks, from the base of the plant. Spread the fertilizer uniformly over the base of the plant at the root bed.;
, Completely saturate the root area in order to allow the fertilizer to sink into the base of the plant.

Create a base for wiring the hydrangeas.,
Roll a piece of 1/4-inch (2.54 cm) mesh hardware cloth around the stakes at the perimeter of your plant.

,
Secure the mesh to the stakes.",How to Prepare Hydrangeas for Winter2," Using a hammer or a mallet, drive 3 to 4 wooden stakes vertically into the ground around all sides of the plant at a distance of at least 4 inches (10.16 cm) from the base of the plant.

,, Attach the mesh to each stake using a staple gun until the plant is enclosed with mesh, which will create a cage to contain protective material.

"
"
Fill the space around your hydrangeas.",How to Prepare Hydrangeas for Winter3," Place a single type of mulch or a combination of mulch, pine needles or compost around the base of the plant. This protective material will act as insulation from winter winds and frost, protecting the roots and the stems of the plant. Fill the space from the base of the plant to the top of the wiring, until the plant is surrounded by the protective material.

Next time, only prune the spindly wood and leave the young, fresh growth to grow.",How to Troubleshoot a Non Flowering Hydrangea," Was the winter a prolonged and colder one than usual? If so, it is possible that the intense cold killed off the buds.;
, A hydrangea that has been pruned too heavily can set back flowering for a year. If this is the case, you might just have to be patient and wait for the next flowering season.

, Hydrangeas flower on new wood and also flower well on two year-old wood.

Pay attention to which stems your hydrangea is producing flowers on.,
Prune hydrangeas growing on old wood in the summer, no later than August.,
Prune hydrangeas growing on new wood while they are dormant during the fall or winter.,
Prune dead and diseased stems right back to the ground and dispose of them.,
Disinfect the pruners with a household disinfectant like Lysol before and after using them.,
Cut one-third of the oldest, thickest stems off at the ground and throw them away.,
Use hand pruners to cut each stem just below where it is tied.",How to Prune Overgrown Hydrangeas," The best time of year to do drastic pruning depends on whether the hydrangea blooms on old wood or new wood.If your hydrangea is producing flowers on stems that grew the previous season or seasons, this is a sign the hydrangeas are blooming on old wood.
If your hydrangea is producing flowers on branches that grew during the current season, this is a sign they are blooming on new wood.;
, Old wood will be stiffer and thicker than new stems, which generally remain quite flexible until late summer. In August, they will begin to form flower buds for the following blooming season.


Mophead, Lacecap and Big Leaf hydrangeas (Hydrangea macrophylla) as well as Oakleaf hydrangeas (Hydrangea quercifolia) bloom on old wood.
If your hydrangea blooms in blue, pink or purple, it is H. macrophylla. If it has leaves that are shaped like an oak leaf and its blooms are white, it is H. quercifolia.

, PeeGee or panicle hydrangeas (Hydrangea paniculata) bloom on new wood.They have cone-shaped panicles of flowers that start out white but change to pink and then rust throughout the season.


Panicle is the technical term for a cluster of flowers that is produced at the ends of the plant’s branches.
Smooth hydrangeas or “Annabelle” types (Hydrangea arborescens) produce white flowers from spring to fall on new wood., Use sharp hand pruners that will cut the stems quickly and easily.


Hedge shears or clippers should not be used as they tend to shred the hydrangea leaves. This not only looks unsightly, it also opens the plant up to bacterial and fungal diseases as well as insect attacks.

, If you are removing any diseased stems, disinfect the pruners between pruning cuts to prevent the spread of disease.


Always wipe the disinfectant off the pruners before using them as it could harm the hydrangea., Then, wrap a woven nylon strap, twine or rope around the whole shrub at two-thirds to one-half the shrub’s height from the ground. Pull it snug and tie it to hold all the stems together like a bouquet.

, You should remove the top one-third to one-half of the shrub.


When all the stems are cut and settle back to their natural position, the shrub will have a pleasant, rounded shape.
Smooth hydrangeas or “Annabelle” types and PeeGee or panicle hydrangeas can have all of their stems cut all the way back to 4 to 6 inches from the ground and they will grow back in time to bloom the following year. This should not be done every year, though, as cutting them all the way back each year will eventually result in weak stems that cannot hold up the flowers.

"
"
Sterilize your shears to make sure you don't spread a plant disease.,
Remove any stems that seem damaged or diseased.,
Mix old and new growth to get a good shape.,
Keep top limbs and trunks intact to maintain a tree shape.,
Gather together all the old limbs and dispose of them properly.",How to Prune Tardiva Hydrangea1," It is always a good idea to sterilize your garden shears before using them in order to prevent the spread of any possible illnesses that could be trapped on the blades from previous pruning.


Using a little bit of dish soap should be enough to remove any untoward diseases that have left residue on your shears.;
, A quick removal of stems that are damaged, diseased, frail, or at odd angles is recommended.


This will help keep the hydrangea bush healthy and should be the first step before trimming the plant into shape.
Heavy pruning generally will not harm these plants, so the occasional slip of the shears probably won’t hurt the hydrangeas too much.

, The best way to get a good shape overall is to leave a mixture of old and new growth standing, so that there is plenty of support for the floppy new flowers.


Without a bit of old growth remaining for support, the new flowers and branches will be floppy and limp.
This could cause them to die over time.

, If you are growing your Tardiva hydrangeas in a tree formation, you should be careful not to remove any of the plant’s upper limbs or the main trunks that contribute to the plant’s particular shape.


By pruning the base, your plant will grow much larger at its top rather than its base, contributing to a tree-like look.
This is because the hydrangea will grow several feet taller before it produces blossoms, giving it time to gain height relative to its width.
However, if you want to reduce your plant to a shrub, then go ahead and prune these upper branches and the hydrangea will revert to its naturally shrubby state.

, Parts that are not diseased can be broken into small pieces and thrown in the compost pile.


If one does not have a compost pile or the parts are diseased, the debris can be placed in paper bags and left out for the local waste removal personnel to cart away.

Determine if your hydrangea blooms on old wood.,
Prune just after the blooming peak.,
Remove old blooms.,
Remove the oldest canes.,
Prune the hydrangea to reduce its size.",How to Prune Hydrangeas1," This is another way of saying that your hydrangea produces new spring blooms on last year's buds. Hydrangeas with this characteristic tend to bloom in early summer, and the flowers die by mid summer. At this point the shrub begins producing the buds that will bloom the following year. Hydrangeas that bloom on old wood include the following:


Bigleaf, Mopleaf or Lacecap hydrangeas (Hydrangea macrophylla and H. serrata)
Oakleaf hydrangeas (H. quercifolia)
Use the images at http://www.hydrangeashydrangeas.com/identify.html to help you identify what kind of hydrangea you have before you start making any plans to prune your plant.;
, Since these types of hydrangeas start producing buds soon after blooming, in late summer and early fall, it's essential to prune them just as the blooms begin to fade in mid-summer. This way you can trim the shrub before it begins to produce the buds that will turn into next year's flowers. The longer you wait, the likelier it will be that you'll cut off some of next year's growth.If you've missed this window, just wait until next year to prune the hydrangea. Hydrangeas don't have to be pruned every year, so it won't be a problem to wait.
If you're unhappy with your hydrangea's shape, you can go ahead and prune - just know that in doing so outside of the short midsummer window, you'll risk hurting it's appearance next spring.

, Right after they're spent, use hand shears to deadhead the blooms. Do this by making clips just under the heads at the tips of the stems. This will tidy up the hydrangea's appearance during the blooming season.


You can also remove dead or dying canes at this time; trim them at their base.

, When a hydrangea is several years old, it'll start to produce fewer blooms. You can promote fresh growth by taking out some of the older canes - up to 1/3 of them. For thicker canes, you may need loppers to cut them. Cut these older canes to the ground.

, If your hydrangea has grown quite large, you can prune it in June or July (just after the blooming season) to contain it a bit. Trim back the branches by 1/3 to the nearest joint. In most cases hydrangeas will grow back quite quickly, so you may not be able to maintain the smaller size for long.


This type of pruning isn't necessary for the health of the plant. Only do it if your hydrangea is taking up too much space.When planting new hydrangeas, it's best to choose a spot where they can grow freely.

"
Maintain a height of 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3.0 m) to achieve ideal growth.,
Refrain from excessively pruning young shrubs to maintain a compact shrub.,
Prune older hydrangeas to rejuvenate them.,
Remove dead or odd-growing branches to tidy up your shrub.",How to Prune Tardiva Hydrangea2," The ideal height for this shrub is between 6 and 10 feet, because this height allows it to be full, lush, and compact.


Always use sharp hand pruners when pruning this shrub.
Even if it is grown as a hedge, hedge shears should not be used.
They tend to shred the leaves.
Find a growth bud on the stem that is located at a height of 6 feet (1.8 m) or less.
If it has not reached its mature height yet, the stem can be cut down to about two-thirds its current height.
Make the cut at an angle just above the growth bud.

, While Tardiva is a young shrub, it does not need to be cut back drastically to reduce its height.


A light pruning is all that is necessary. It will keep the shrub more compact and encourage additional new stem growth which means more beautiful hydrangea flowers.
Make the cuts at an angle above a growth bud with sharp pruners, but find a growth bud that is not very far down on the stem.

, Older Tardiva hydrangeas sometimes need serious pruning to help them look their best.


This type of pruning is called rejuvenation pruning because it does, in a sense, rejuvenate an old bush.
Cut one-third of the oldest stems right off at the base in winter or early spring each year for three consecutive years.
The height of the remaining stems can be reduced by one-third each year as well to help reduce the overall size of the shrub.
In the fourth year, most of the stems will be new and the shrub will be full-looking.

, Dead branches should be removed completely and immediately, as soon as the dead branch is noticed.


This can be done at any time of year.
When doing your annual pruning in the winter or early spring, cut out any branches that are growing at odd angles and crossing other branches.
These branches can rub against other branches, causing wounds that open the shrub up to disease and boring insects.

Determine if your hydrangea blooms on new wood.,
Prune in late winter before bud generation begins.,
Prune dead canes and crossed branches.,
Leave some old growth to support the plant to help it to grow well.",How to Prune Hydrangeas2," These hydrangea varieties produce new growth each spring, then bloom from that growth later in the summer. They tend to bloom later than hydrangeas that bloom on old wood, since varieties that produce new wood need that extra time to create buds. The following varieties bloom on new wood:


Panicle hydrangeas (H. paniculata), such as PeeGee
Smooth hydrangeas (H. arborescens), such as Annabelle
Use the images at http://www.hydrangeashydrangeas.com/identify.html to help you identify what kind of hydrangea you have before you start making any plans to prune your plant.

, Since these varieties produce their blooms on new stems, you want to prune them in the winter before they start growing. This is the best time of year to prune new wood varieties, but you can prune them at other times of year as well - just avoid pruning them right before they're about to bloom in the spring and early summer.


You can cut back all the stems by 1/3 in the winter. Pruning at this time will help the shrub produce bigger, showier flowers.
However, many gardeners like their hydrangeas to have smaller flowers on sturdier stems. If this is your preference, do your pruning in the fall instead, to allow the plants to grow strong branches before blooming.

, Use hand shears or loppers to take out dead canes and branches that are crossed or tangled. This will free up the plant and allow for better airflow, encouraging it to grow stronger.

, Hydrangea flowers tend to be on the heavy side, so don't go overboard pruning old canes. Leave a good network of canes intact so that the branches don't flop over under the weight of the flowers."

Start by looking at a planting zone hardiness mapto determine the number of your zone. There are hundreds of varieties of hydrangeas to choose from. If this is your first time planting these beautiful flowers, you may want to choose from among these common varieties that are known to be hardy and produce long-lasting blooms.Mophead and lacecap hydrangeas, or ""bigleaf"" hydrangeas, grow well in zone 8, which has a warm climate. They don't do as well in colder regions unless you take measures to protect them from frost.. Look for the ""Endless Summer"" mop-head variety at your local nursery - it's a type of mophead hydrangea that blooms more than once over the summer. This type of hydrangea produces large balls of pink or blue blossoms that deepen in color over the course of the season.
The oakleaf hydrangea grows well in places with very hot summers without too much moisture. It is hardy through zone 4b/5a. This type of hydrangea has white blossoms.
Annabelle hydrangeas are more cold hardy than mophead or oakleaf hydrangeas, can still grow in zone 3. This type of hydrangea has white blossoms that turn light green later in the season.
Peegee hydrangeas can grow hardy even further north than Annabelles - all the way up to zone 3a. They are also able to grow in southern zones. They have white blossoms.;
, Planting in one of these milder seasons will give the hydrangeas time to acclimate to the soil conditions and take root before the weather gets more extreme. Look for hydrangea plants in your nursery in early spring or early fall., Hydrangeas are easy to grow either in planting beds or in large pots. Whichever method you choose, you'll need a spot that gets full sun in the morning and partial shade in the afternoon. Bigleaf hydrangeas will grow in complete partial shade, so choose this variety if you have a shady yard., Hydrangeas need rich, well-drained soil that is kept moist. If you're working with dry or depleted soil, get it ready for hydrangeas by working in some compost. If your soil tends to hold water, you can add peat to help with drainage.

, The hold you dig should be as deep as the root ball on the hydrangea plant, and at least twice as wide. Use a spade or shovel to dig a big hole to accommodate the plant's roots. If you're planting more than one hydrangea, they should be spaced 5–7 feet (1.5–2.1 m) apart, since the plants can grow to get very large.


Check the instructions that came with your particular hydrangea variety. Some hydrangeas can be planted closer together, while others may need to be planted at least 10 feet (3.0 m) apart., It's important to make sure the roots of the hydrangea get watered at the time of planting, so start by setting the hydrangea's root ball in the hole you dug. Fill the hole with a few inches of water and let it drain thoroughly, then fill the hole with soil and water it once more. Pat it down around the base of the hydrangea.


Planting hydrangeas too deeply can cause the roots to fail. If not planted deep enough, your hydrangeas could fall over in heavy rain or strong wind.

, Hydrangeas will begin to wilt if the soil gets too dry, so make sure you water them every day or two, especially during the hot summer months. Water the hydrangeas near the base of the plants and above the roots, rather than spraying the water directly onto the flowers; this prevents the flowers from getting burned by the sun.

, New hydrangeas do not need to be pruned; if you do so, you may not get new blossoms the following spring. If you have older hydrangeas that have gotten quite large and need to be cut back, make sure you prune at the right time of year according to the variety of hydrangea you planted.


Bigleaf hydrangea varieties should be pruned after the blossoms have faded in the late spring.
Oakleaf and other hydrangeas that bloom on the current season's wood should be pruned while the plant is still dormant, in late winter before the blooms emerge., Cover them with mulch, straw, or pine needles to a depth of at least 18 inches (45.7 cm). If you have smaller bushes, you can cover the entire plant for the winter. Remove the cover in early spring, after the last frost.

, The color of hydrangeas depends on the pH of the soil in which they are planted. If you have pink or blue hydrangeas, it's possible to change their color by changing the soil's pH. This can take weeks or months, so be patient!


To change flowers from pink to blue, lower the soil's pH by adding sulfur or peat moss.
To change flowers from blue to pink (which is more difficult than changing from pink to blue), add limestone to the soil to raise the soil's pH.White hydrangea blossoms don't change color.

, Wait until the color is rich and the flowers have a papery, rather than juicy, consistency. This will make the flowers easier to dry. Use a scissors or pruning tool to cut the stems.

, Hydrangeas preserve beautifully when dried. Their color stays bright for a long time, and they hold their shape for years before disintegrating. To dry hydrangeas, use one of the following methods:


Hang them upside down. Tape the stems to the top of a doorway in a dry, dark room. Let them hang until they completely dry, then remove them and arrange them in a vase.
Dry them in water. Place the stems in a vase filled with a few inches of water. Allow the flowers to slowly dry as the water evaporates.
Use silica gel. Place the blossoms in a container and cover completely with silica gel. After a week or two, the flowers will be dry, their color perfectly preserved.

"
"
Select hydrangeas to dry.",How to Dry Hydrangeas1," To keep the color of most hydrangeas, it's best to start the drying process when the flowers first bloom. Cut or buy fresh, recently opened hydrangeas on the morning you plan to start the drying process.

Pee Gee Hydrangeas however, look better when left to mature. Take these at different times of the season. They start out a pale green, then as they mature, some pink shows up, later turning to burgundy, and finally a chocolate brown color very late in late fall.

Know that blue hydrangeas grow in acidic soil, while pink hydrangeas grow in alkaline soil.,
Test the pH level of your soil.,
Use white vinegar to gauge whether the soil is alkaline or acidic.,
Test the pH of your soil scientifically.,
Sprinkle elemental sulfur over the soil.,
Use acidic compost and aluminum sulfate powder.,
Apply a fertilizer that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium.,
Use organic matter to increase the acidity of the soil.,
Water your hydrangeas with rainwater.,
Consider growing your hydrangeas in a separate pot.,
Avoid planting hydrangeas in chalky soil.,
Don't plant hydrangeas near any concrete structures.",How to Keep Blue Hydrangeas Blue," Hydrangeas are rather unique garden plants because of their ability to change color according to the pH level of your soil. This means the color of hydrangeas in your garden will depend on how acid or alkaline the soil type is.


The scientific reason behind this is that different levels of aluminum become available to the plant depending on the soil’s acidity level (also known as pH). Acidic soils have a high aluminum content, turning the flowers blue.
An alkaline soil will produce pink blooms in hydrangeas; an acid soil will cause the same plant to bear blue flowers. The exception to this is white or green hydrangeas, which are unique varieties and don’t change color. You won’t have any success trying to change a white hydrangea to pink or blue!;
, To see whether the soil in your garden is alkaline or acidic, you will need to test the pH levels. This will help you to predict the likelihood of growing blue hydrangeas.


Soil with a pH lower than 5.5 will result in bright blue hydrangea flowers.
When the pH is 5.5 to 6.5 the flowers will be an odd purple color.
Soil with a pH higher than 6.5 will cause the flowers to be pink.

, You can get a fairly good indication of whether your soil is alkaline or acidic using distilled white vinegar. Just grab a handful of your soil, pour the vinegar on top an wait for a reaction.


If the vinegar fizzes and bubbles when it comes in content with the soil, this means that the soil is alkaline and will produce pink hydrangeas. The more intense the fizzing, the more alkaline the soil.
If nothing happens when the vinegar comes in contact with the soil, this means that the soil is either neutral or acidic and is more likely to produce blue hydrangeas., If you want to find out the exact pH value of your soil, you can test it using an at-home pH testing kit. These are widely available at gardening centers or online - just follow the instructions on the packaging.


Alternatively, you can take a sample of your soil to a local gardening center where they will test the pH of the soil for you.

, In order to keep your hydrangeas blooming in blue, elemental sulfur should be sprinkled over the soil around the shrub to lower the pH to below 5.5. The exact amount of elemental sulfur required will vary, depending on the soil type and how much the pH needs to be adjusted.


Loam or silt loam soil will require ¾ pound of elemental sulfur to lower the soil pH in a 25 square foot area by one unit. In other words, it will take ¾ pound to lower the pH from 6 to 5. Sandy or sandy loam soil, on the other hand, will require less than ¼ pound of elemental sulfur to lower the pH by one.
Start sprinkling the elemental sulfur about 2 feet (0.6 m) beyond the shrub drip line or outer edge of the shrub. Spread it evenly over the soil up to about 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) away from the stems. This is the area where most of the roots grow and absorb water and nutrients.
Use a small hand rake to mix the elemental sulfur into the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of soil, then water the area generously to help wash the sulfur into the soil. The elemental sulfur will probably need to be re-applied from time to time in order to keep the blue hydrangea blue.

, To plant hydrangeas into a garden with alkaline soil and still get a blue flower, you will need to incorporate plenty of acidic compost and aluminum sulfate into the ground when planting and continue with regular applications over the lifetime of the plant.


You can buy acidic compost at the gardening center - it is usually labelled as ""ericaceous"". Aluminum sulfate is available as a powder from garden centers or online outlets. It’s often labeled as ‘blue hydrangea powder’. Be careful not to apply the powder directly to the root of a plant, as it will scorch the tissue.
Instead, add one tablespoon of aluminum sulfate to one gallon of water and use this solution to water fully-matured hydrangeas throughout the growing season. Don’t be tempted to apply a stronger concentration as this can burn the roots., All hydrangeas benefit from fertilization. To produce or maintain blue flowers on a hydrangea bush, use a fertilizer that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium.


This fertilizer may be labeled as an appropriate fertilizer for azaleas, camellias and rhododendrons.Avoid using fertilizers such as bone meal, as this will make the soil more alkaline, undoing all of you hard work.

, If you don’t fancy using chemicals in your garden, an application of certain organic matters such as grass clippings, fruit and vegetables scraps or used coffee grounds can turn the soil mildly acidic.


Used coffee grounds are particularly effective, just make sure that they have cooled completely before working them into the soil around the base of your plant.You can also incorporate coffee grounds into the soil when planting a new hydrangea shrub – perhaps ask your local café if you can take some away, they are usually happy to oblige.
Keep in mind that organic matter changes the acidity of your soil more slowly than chemical powders and fertilizers, so you'll need to be patient if you decide to go down this route.

, Try to use rainwater (rather than tap water) to water your hydrangeas. If you use a hard tap water on your blue hydrangeas, this will counteract the soil acidity and the flowers will gradually turn pink. For information on how to collect rainwater, see this article.

, Rather than attempting to change the acidity of the soil in your garden, it may be easier to just plant new hydrangea bushes in a pot containing acidic (""ericaceous"") soil.


You can encourage a blue bloom even further by watering your potted hydrangea with an aluminum sulfate solution, as described above.

, Altering the pH of your soil will only work if you have chalk-free soil. You’ll know if you have a chalky soil if you can see white clumps of chalk or flint. You’ll find water drains easily and doesn’t form puddles. The ground will also be very dry in summer, as water drains away without being retained.


If you’re faced with a chalky soil, you won’t have much luck altering the soil pH so it’s best to grow your hydrangeas in containers using purchased compost rather than any dug out of the ground in your garden.

, You’ll find that having concrete near your flower bed (such as a concrete fence base or concrete walkway) can affect soil pH. Concrete is likely to turn soil more alkaline, which will hinder the growth of blue hydrangeas. If you can, plant hydrangeas well away from concrete structures to maintain their blue color.

Prepare the flowers for drying.,
Prepare the drying container.,
Place the blooms in the container.,
Add more silica gel.,
Start the drying process.,
Remove the blooms from the container.,
Store or display the dried hydrangeas.",How to Dry Hydrangeas2," Remove discolored parts and extra leaves, so the flowers are in good shape for drying. Cut the stems down to and or inch 2 (2.35 to 4.7 cm) from the base of the flowers.;
, Choose a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid to use for drying your flowers. Deeper containers work better than shallow ones, since the flowers will need to be completely submerged in silica gel.


Pour a thin layer of silica gel in the plastic container. The gel should completely cover the bottom of the container.
Err on the side of pouring in too much gel to keep the flowers from being crushed against the bottom of the container.

, Take each bloom by the stem and carefully place it bloom-side down into the container. Add as many blooms as will comfortably fit in the container without touching each other or the container's sides.

, Place enough silica gel in the container to completely surround and support the hydrangeas.


Hold each flower steady with one hand and sprinkle the gel with the other until the flowers can stand up on their own and are covering the petals and stems. Fill the container with gel until it rises 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) above the blooms in addition to covering the stem.
If the container is narrow and very deep, you can suspend a flower at the bottom, cover it with silica gel, and add another bloom above it. Just make sure the container is deep enough that the flowers don't touch each other.

, Put a lid on the container. Place it in a corner or a closet to allow the drying process to commence.


Write the date you submerged the flowers on the container, so you know when it's time to take them out.
Leave container undisturbed for 4 days. Drying hydrangeas any longer in silica could result in brittle blooms that could shatter.

, After 4 days, they should be completely dry.


Open the container and slowly pour the contents onto newspaper. Remove the dry hydrangea blooms and gently tap them to remove any loose silica.
Save the silica gel in a plastic container for the next time you want to dry flowers.

, Carefully store the dried hydrangea blossoms in plastic bags until you're ready to use them or place them in a vase.

Cut the hydrangea blossoms in half to preserve and flatten their round shape.
Cut individual flowers and plan to arrange them in the shape of a hydrangea blossom after they're dried.

, A press is made with two pieces of plywood that are tightened with screws and wing nuts. Remove the top piece of plywood and lay a piece of cardboard followed by two sheets of parchment or pressing paper on the bottom piece of plywood.


The cardboard and parchment paper should be cut a few inches smaller than the bottom of the press.
The bottom sheet of parchment paper is called the ""blotter."" It absorbs moisture from the drying flower and is switched out every few days. The top sheet of parchment paper anchors the flowers during the drying process.

, Arrange them so that no petals or folded or crushed, unless you are trying to create a windblown effect.


A little layering is fine, but don't build too many layers of petals, or they won't dry out correctly.
If you wish, add other foliage like leaves, ferns and other flowers.

, Cover the flowers with a sheet of parchment paper, a second ""blotter"" sheet, a piece of cardboard, and the top piece of the flower press. Screw the plywood pieces together and tighten them with the wing nuts.

, Set the press in a dry place in your home and let the drying process begin.


Open the press and change out the blotter sheets every few days. Discard the old sheets and replace them with fresh ones.
After a week or two, the flowers should be completely dry. Remove them from the press.

Determine if your Hydrangea blooms on old wood or new wood.,
Remove all old blooms at any time no matter what type of Hydrangea you have.,
Remember the old wood rule when cutting new blooms for your flower arrangements: you can cut your flowers with long stems before August, but after August, cut new blooms just above the first set of large leaves so that you don’t disturb new developing bloom buds.

,
Prune all dead stems every year no matter what type of Hydrangea you have.

,
Prune all new wood Hydrangeas in the fall and winter.",How to Prune Hydrangea Bushes," This is extremely important because if you prune at the wrong time of the year, your Hydrangea bush may not flower again:


If your blooms are pink, blue or purple, you have a mophead or lacecap Hydrangea. These flowers bloom on old wood (stems that have been on the plant since the previous summer). Prune this type only in the summer, but before August—before they set their flower buds for next year.
If you Hydrangea flowers are white, they are blooming on new wood (stems that have developed during the current growing season). This type of Hydrangea produces flower buds on the stems in August, September and October—which will result in flowers the following summer. If you prune this type of new wood Hydrangea in the fall, winter or spring, the bloom buds will be removed and you won’t have a flowering shrub the following year.;
, This practice is called “deadheading.” Use sharp pruning shears to clip off the spent flower. If you deadhead before August on old wood Hydrangeas, it doesn’t matter where you cut on the stem because it won’t jeopardize next year’s blooms.

,,, Never prune them in the spring and summer or you will destroy the flower buds.

Purchase good quality, properly processed mulch.,
Use an acidic mulch for blue hydrangeas.,
Try a neutral or alkaline mulch for pink hydrangeas.,
Experiment with mulches such as sawdust or pine needles to deter pests.,
Purchase a mulch mat to maintain the pH level of the soil.,
Use inorganic mulches for decorative purposes.,
Do all of your mulching in springtime.,
Water the hydrangeas before you apply the mulch.,
Apply a layer of mulch approximately four inches deep.,
Keep the mulch 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) away from the stems.,
Apply new mulch each year.,
Remember to water your plants more generously after mulching.",How to Mulch Hydrangeas," Always use a good quality mulch that has been properly processed. Mulch made from diseased or insect-infested trees can spread the disease or insects to your hydrangeas. Therefore, mulch must be composted properly to eliminate these potential hazards.


Shredded bark mulch or bark chunks sold in bags at garden centers are the safest option, but many companies that sell bulk mulch also offer a good quality product. Bagged mulch at garden centers should state right on the bag that the mulch has been composted or sterilized.
If you are buying mulch in bulk, make sure to ask the company for their assurance that the mulch has been properly processed. If there are huge, steaming piles of mulch at the bulk mulch yard and large equipment used for turning the mulch, this is a good indication that the mulch has been properly composted.;
, It is possible to encourage hydrangeas to bloom in your preferred color - pink or blue - by altering the acidity level of the soil. Blue hydrangeas prefer acidic soil, while pink hydrangeas need a more alkaline soil. Therefore, using an acidic mulch will alter the pH of the soil and support the growth of blue hydrangeas.


Spent coffee grounds make a good ‘acid’ mulch – ask your local café if you can take a bag of theirs. They usually throw their coffee grounds away, so this shouldn't be a problem.
Other suitable acidic mulches include sphagnum peat moss, pine needles (also known as ‘pine straw’), shredded or chipped pine bark (also known as ‘pine bark nuggets’), or similar mulches made from cypress or eucalyptus.

, Alkaline soil is necessary to produce pink hydrangeas, however it is harder to find alkaline mulches. Therefore you may need to use a combination of neutral mulches and alkaline dressings in order to produce pink flowers.


Try applying a neutral pH mulch (such as regular compost) to the soil surrounding your hydrangeas. This will not make the soil more alkaline, but it will not make it more acidic either.
To boost the alkaline properties of the soil, try adding a dressing of ground limestone or chalk on top of the neutral mulch.
Alternatively, you can use a slightly alkaline mulch such as the shredded or chipped bark from hardwood trees. Unfortunately this type of mulch isn't alkaline enough to significantly change the pH level of the soil, so you will still need to use one of the alkaline dressings mentioned above.

, Mulch can be a good barrier to protect your hydrangeas from pests such as slugs and snails. The best mulches for deterring these pests are sawdust or pine needles, as the slugs and snails cannot travel across these types of surfaces.


An alternative to using these mulches would be to apply a layer of pest-deterring material over the top of a regular mulch. Such pest-deterring materials include crushed egg shells, finely crushed nut shells, a thin layer of ash or cinders or even a layer of human hair clippings. These materials can be placed around the base of the hydrangeas, on top of the existing mulch.

, Using a mulch mat is a good idea if you want all of the benefits of a good mulch, without altering the pH level of the soil.


A good mulch mat will allow rainwater to permeate the ground whilst keeping weeds at bay and heat in the soil, which will greatly benefit your hydrangeas. However, mulch mats won't break down like regular mulch (unless you purchase biodegradable ones) so the pH of the soil won't be affected by the mat.
If you dislike the appearance of mulch matting, consider covering it with a layer of organic material such as bark chips.
Mulch mats tend to be especially useful when planting a completely new bed. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for further information on using mulch mats.

, While organic mulches will break down and affect soil acidity, some gardeners prefer to use inorganic mulch materials such as slate, stone or gravel.


These are more expensive than organic mulches (such as leaf mold) but tend to last longer and give a neat, decorative finish to your flower bed. It’s unusual to have to top up or replace inorganic mulches such as gravel, so less maintenance work is required than for organic mulches. However, inorganic mulches may be slightly harder to apply in the first place.
In addition to their aesthetic appeal, inorganic mulches have the added benefit of not smelling bad, as some organic mulches do.

, You should aim to apply your chosen mulch to the hydrangea bed in springtime (though the timing isn't overly important).


Mulching the hydrangeas in spring will help to retain moisture in the soil over the dry summer months, which will prevent you from needing to water the flowers as frequently.
You should avoid mulching in the wintertime as this causes the soil to retain cold, which is bad for the plants.

, Before you apply the mulch, you should remove any weeds from the flower bed and give them a good watering. This prevents the soil from drying out or becoming clogged with weeds beneath the mulch.

, For best results, you should apply a relatively thick layer of mulch, approximately four inches deep.


As a general rule, finer-textured mulches - such as sawdust - should be applied less thickly (about 3 inches depth) than ones with thick chunky pieces.
Larger-textured mulches - such as bark chips - may be applied to a depth of about 5 inches (12.7 cm)., Keep the mulch 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) away from the stems of your hydrangeas. If the mulch is right up against the stems, it encourages dampness, which can lead to root rot.


It could also encourage rodent activity during the winter and subsequent stem damage from the rodents.

, You should replenish the mulch around the hydrangeas every year, in order to keep it fresh.


Do not just pour new mulch over the old - use a garden fork, dirt shovel or rake to loosen and turn the old mulch. This will prevent the mulch from becoming too compacted, which restricts water and air movement.
Add new mulch to the old mulch to bring the total depth up to between 3 and 5 inches. , Remember that your hydrangeas will require a bit more water after mulching, because the thick mulch layer will absorb some water before it reaches the roots. Therefore you will need to provide more water to prevent the roots from drying out.

, Cut off leaves below the top leaf pair, being careful to cut above the leaf nodes. Removing these leaves causes the plant to produce more roots.








, Although optional, if you trim the largest leaves to about half of their current size, it can help increase root production.








, You can use either a liquid or powder form of rooting hormone. Hydrangea cuttings will propagate without rooting hormone, but roots will grow more quickly if you use it.








, Push down gently until the cutting is 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the soil.

, It will usually take 2 to 3 weeks for cuttings to root, but it may happen more quickly depending on temperature and humidity.









Place your potted cuttings outdoors if your outside temperature ranges from 60 to 80 degrees F (15.5 to 26.7 degrees C) and you have an area available protected from wind with partial shade.
Keep potted cuttings indoors if you are experiencing hotter or colder temperatures. Make sure the rooting hydrangea cuttings receive partial or filtered sunlight.
Keep soil moist, but do not over water. Soil shouldn't become soggy as over watering can lead to rot.

, If you feel resistance, the cutting has rooted. You can transplant now or allow the cutting to further develop its root system.

A few species can tolerate zone 4 conditions (-30ºF/-34ºC), including H. arborescens and H. paniculata., Hydrangeas may suffer when planted in hot temperatures or frost. Container-grown hydrangeas are best planted in the garden during spring or fall. Bare root hydrangeas without soil should be planted in early to mid spring so they have time to adapt to their new location., Ideally, the hydrangea should get several hours of sun each day, but be protected from the hottest afternoon sun by a wall or other barrier. If this is not possible in your yard, select a location with bright partial shade throughout the day., Hydrangeas can grow to become 4' by 4' bushes (1.2m x 1.2m). Research your species and variety online if you want a more accurate idea of how large your hydrangeas will grow.

, Mix compost into your soil if it is low in nutrients. If your soil is dense or mostly clay, mix in pine bark or other mulch material in order to prevent water from forming pools around the plant.

, Roots can become tangled or clustered together, which makes it harder for them to grow out into the soil once they're planted. This can limit the amount of nutrients the plant absorbs. To loosen your roots, cut a few of the outside roots, then gently shake the roots apart. Once the inner roots are free, they will be able to spread out into the soil., Dig a hole about as deep as the root ball or potting container, and two or three times as wide. Carefully lift the hydrangea and place it in the hole. Be careful not to scrape or break the roots while moving the plant.

, Press the soil gently together as you fill the hole to remove air pockets and provide support to hold up the plant.Stop when the hold is approximately halfway filled.

, Water the half-filled hole thoroughly, then leave it to drain for at least 15 minutes or until there is no standing water. Fill in the rest of the hole in the same way you were filling it before, pressing down small portions of soil at a time. Stop when the roots are covered. Do not bury any more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the trunk or stem.

, Newly transplanted plants may not yet have roots functioning at full capacity, so it's important to water them well. Water once more when you're finished filling the hole, then water daily for the first few days after planting.

, Once the hydrangea is established in its new location, water whenever the soil is about to dry out. Make sure that you give it a deep watering each time, not just a sprinkling of water. The soil should be kept somewhat moist, but not soggy. Hydrangeas do not usually require additional care, and often grow or bloom without difficulty.


If your hydrangeas wilt or dry out, construct a shade to block the sun during the afternoon. You can also try using mulch.
If the winter forecast predicts unusually cold or prolonged frost, or if you are planting in a lower than recommended hardiness zone (see above), you may need to provide winter protection for your hydrangeas.

, Some varieties of hydrangea can bloom pink or blue depending on the soil's aluminum content and acidity. Most cultivated hydrangeas of this type belong to the species Hydrangea macrophylla, but some members of this species only produce white blooms, or favor the pink or blue side too heavily for easy adjustment. Ask the previous owner of the hydrangeas to identify your hydrangea variety if you are not aware of its name.


The varieties named Enziandom, Kasteln, Merritt's Supreme, Red Star, and Rose Supreme all have the ability to be grown as pink or blue blossoms, although they vary in intensity., Most garden supply stores sell a pH test kit for measuring the pH, or acidity, of your soil. Because acidity affects the hydrangea's ability to take in aluminum, which in turn affects the flower color, you can get a rough prediction of the flower color by measuring the soil pH. As a rule of thumb, a soil pH below 5.5 will likely result in blue flowers, and a soil pH of 7 and up will likely result in pink or red flowers. The effects of soil pH levels between 5.5 and 7 are difficult to predict. They may result in blue, pink, or purple flowers, or in a blotched blue and pink pattern., To encourage a blue color during the growing season, mix 1 tbsp (15 mL) aluminum sulfate into a gallon of water. This both adds aluminum to the soil and increases the acidity (lowering pH), making it easier for the plant to use the aluminum.Once every 10–14 days, Apply as much of this water as you would in a normal watering. Continue to measure the pH of the soil, and stop applying once it drops below 5.5 pH.


Alternatively, you can also create blue blossoms by applying a fertilizer that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium. Look for a 25/5/30 fertilizer blend. You'll also want to avoid superphosphates and bone meal., If the hydrangea is already blue, it is hard to make it pink due to the existing presence of aluminum causing a blue color. However, you can take precautions in advance to encourage pink blooms, or you can grow your plants in a pot. Avoid planting near driveways or walls, as some concrete mixes or mortars can leach aluminum into the soil. Apply a fertilizer that contains no aluminum, but high levels of phosphorus, which inhibits aluminum uptake. Look for a fertilizer that contains a 25-10-10 blend.Consider raising the pH by adding wood ash or crushed limestone to the soil, as this also makes aluminum uptake difficult. Avoid raising the pH higher than 6.4, or the plant may develop health problems.

Add a sprinkling of lime around the hydrangea for pink flowers.,
Add a tablet of aluminum sulfate to the watering can used for watering the hydrangea.,
Bury steel wool under hydrangea bushes.",How to Change the Color of Hydrangeas," 2 or 3 limes will work.;
, This will result in blue flowers. The water pH should be no more than 5.6 or it will affect the results.

, This will make blue flowers more vivid. Make sure you don't interrupt any insects or animals (For that matter, Anything) Critters could chew it. Put it near the roots.

Determine when to fertilize.,
Add natural fertilizers to soil surface.,
Apply granular fertilizer to your soil.,
Administer water-soluble fertilizer to your plants and soil.,
Pay extra attention to your annuals.,
Water your plants.",How to Fertilize Flowers1," The type of flower you wish to fertilize, whether it is an annual or perennial, and whether it is new growth or an established plant will all play a role in determining when you need to fertilize. Determine the best time to fertilize your specific flowering plants.


Fertilize the soil for annuals, as well as any new planting, during bed preparation.
Fertilize established perennials and ornamental grasses as soon as their growth resumes in the spring.
Bulbs need fertilizing as soon as growth appears.
Roses need fertilizing beginning in May but not after July. You do not want to encourage new growth as fall and winter approach.;
, The simplest way to apply natural fertilizers is to spread them on the soil surface of your planting beds. Natural fertilizers take a much longer time to break down and release their nutrients available into the soil, so it is a good idea to apply them at least a few months before planting, if possible., Granular fertilizers are applied by sprinkling directly on to soil, or by using a spreader. You will want to turn over the soil to create an even distribution of granules. Granular fertilizers are longer lasting. They can remain in your soil for up to 9 months.

, Water-soluble fertilizers are a type of powder that dissolves in water. This fluid-solution is then applied to your flowers. In can be sprayed directly onto the plants and soil. Water-soluble fertilizers remain in the soil for 2-3 weeks.

, Annual flowers (those that complete their life cycle in one growing season) tend to need more fertilizer than perennial flowers (which return again each year.) , After your chosen form of fertilizer has been applied, you should water your flowers the way you normally do. It is important for your flowers to get a nice drink after they have been fertilized, but there is no need to overdo it.

"
"
Evaluate different forms.,
Weigh the short-term versus long-term costs.,
Choose synthetic fertilizers for fast results.,
Select natural fertilizers to improve soil quality.,
Consider using a combination of natural and synthetic fertilizers.",How to Fertilize Flowers2," The first step will be deciding if you will use a natural fertilizer or a synthetic one. There are some benefits to each.Natural fertilizers are composed of organic material. Examples include compost (homemade or store-bought), manure, cottonseed meal, blood meal, bone meal, fish emulsion, and liquid seaweed.
Synthetic fertilizers come in a variety of forms, such as granules, water-soluble powders, and liquid concentrates.

, Purchasing natural fertilizer (as opposed to generating your own compost) can be cost prohibitive. A similar quantity of synthetic fertilizer will definitely cost less. However, natural fertilizers will release more nutrients slowly over time, nourishing your plants for longer and improving the quality of your soil over time. , Within a day of applying a synthetic fertilizer (particularly a water-soluble variety) you will see dramatic results. This may be the right choice for you if your plants need an immediate pick-me-up.

, Natural fertilizers work slowly because they are improving the quality of your soil from the inside out. Rather than merely providing nutrients directly to the plant, they also provide nutrients that will remain in the soil. Natural fertilizers can improve the quality of your soil, meaning that you will ultimately need fertilizers less frequently., Natural fertilizers are much better for your soil over time, but they are much slower to release. One option is to use a natural fertilizer as your primary fertilizer, but to also give your plants the occasional boost with a water-soluble synthetic fertilizer."
"
Read labels.,
Look for N-P-K.,
Choose phosphorous for flowers.,
Consult an expert.,
Expect some trial and error.",How to Fertilize Flowers3," If you are purchasing store-bought fertilizer, be sure to read the label carefully. You should look for a fertilizer product clearly designated for use with flowers (or flowering plants). If you mean to fertilize a specific flower (e.g., roses) you may even be able to locate a product designed for that flower.

, The best fertilizers for flowers contain nitrogen (N), which promotes growth; phosphorus (P), which enhances root systems and flower production; and potassium (K), which improves overall vigor and disease resistance). A package of fertilizer will generally have a three-part number (e.g., 5-10-10) that indicated the percentage of each of these macronutrients per volume.

, Plants that are known for their prolific flowering abilities will generally need more phosphorous. This is the middle number is most fertilizers. A 10-20-10 will contain a higher dose of phosphorous to help nourish your flowering plants. , It never hurts to speak to someone in your region about what fertilizer they recommend. This can help save you time and money. Consider speaking to a local gardener, someone from a landscaping company, or a representative at your garden supply store. , They only way to truly determine what your flowers will respond to is to give something a try. You may need to experiment with several different options or combinations before you find the perfect fertilizer for your flowering plants."

Water 'Limelight' as often as necessary to keep the soil lightly moist during the first year after planting.,
Keep the type of soil in mind when watering your plant.,
Check the soil by sticking a finger in to a depth of 2 inches (5.1 cm) or so before watering.,
Reduce the amount of watering you do as your hydrangea grows.,
Use a soaker hose to water the shrub or water it by hand using a watering can to avoid getting the leaves wet.Keeping the leaves dry will reduce the likelihood of fungal disease.

,
Set a 1-inch deep dish or can next to the hydrangea.,
Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of mulch over the soil around the shrub to help reduce moisture loss through evaporation.,
Fertilize 'Limelight' in the spring as soon as is begins putting on new leaves.,
Sprinkle the fertilizer over the soil around the hydrangea.,
Alter the fertilizer if your plant is not blooming.",How to Care for Limelight Hydrangeas1," In general, 1⁄3 to 2⁄3 inch (0.8 to 1.7 cm) of water two to three times each week will be plenty but this depends on the soil and weather., When 'Limelight' is planted in soil that drains more slowly, it may only need to be watered twice each week.


If the soil is sandy loam and drains quickly, it may need to be watered every other day when the weather gets hot.

, If the soil is moist, wait another day or two to water.


If it is dry, water immediately.

, After the first year, water 'Limelight' once per week, giving it 3 to 6 gallons (11.4 to 22.7 L) or 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of water each time, depending on how quickly the soil dries.

,, This is to measure how much water is delivered in inches when using a soaker hose. Check the can periodically.


When it is full, the hydrangea has received 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water.

, When “Limelight” is not getting enough water, it will wilt in the afternoon. If this happens, water it immediately, check the soil more often and water the shrub when the soil begins to dry.


This shrub may also wilt when the soil is kept too wet. If it wilts and the soil is damp, do not water it again until the soil begins to dry.

, Use a slow-release fertilizer with a balanced ratio like 10-10-10 or 16-16-16.


This type of fertilizer will give the shrub a steady supply of the nutrients it usually needs.

, Extend the fertilizer out to 6 inches (15.2 cm) to 1 foot beyond the outer edge of the leaves. This is where most of the roots are and where the fertilizer needs to be.


A common application rate is 1/4 to 1/2 cup but this varies, depending on how the fertilizer is formulated. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations carefully. Do not give 'Limelight' too much fertilizer.

, If 'Limelight' does not bloom or blooms very little, give it fertilizer with a 10-30-10 ratio the following spring. The middle number represents the amount of phosphorus in the fertilizer. Phosphorus promotes better flowering.


Yellowing leaves at the center of the shrub indicate it is not getting enough nutrients. If this should occur, give it ¼ to ½ cup of fast-release, 10-10-10 or 16-16-16 granular fertilizer for a quick boost in addition to the slow-release fertilizer.
If 'Limelight' has plenty of lush, green leaves but does not bloom, it is getting too much nitrogen. If this should occur, use fertilizer with a 0-30-10 or similar ratio. The first number listed on the bag represents nitrogen.

Prune your plant in the spring.,
Trim the stems back by no more than 10 to 20 percent in the shrub’s first winter or early spring.,
Prune your plant more intensely as it ages.,
Always use sharp hand pruners to prune one branch at a time.",How to Care for Limelight Hydrangeas2," 'Limelight' can be pruned in late winter or very early spring to reduce its size, improve its appearance or encourage it to produce larger flowers.


It produces flowers on new stems each year so pruning it in the winter or early spring will not reduce the number of flowers it produces.

, They do not have to be trimmed at all but can be to even up the branches and tidy up their appearance.


Dead branches should be removed at the base of the branch whenever they are noticed.

, After 'Limelight' has been growing for a year or two, all of the stems can be pruned back to about 6 inches (15 cm) tall to keep it from getting too big.Thin the shrub to five to ten main branches in the spring to get larger flower clusters.Select five to ten new healthy branches to keep then prune the rest of the branches back to a height of 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm). This will let 'Limelight' devote more energy to fewer branches resulting in larger flowers.

, Hedge shears will tear the leaves and make 'Limelight' look ragged.

Check your plant for pest activity.,
Combat slugs and snails.,
Know what aphids, thrips, spittle bugs, and spider mites look like.,
Use water to combat these pests.,
Spray the shrub with insecticidal soap if the pests persist and are causing serious damage.Be sure to coat the tops and bottoms of the leaves and the stems until the soap begins to drip.",How to Care for Limelight Hydrangeas3," 'Limelight' is occasionally attacked by slugs, snails, aphids, spider mites, spittle bugs and thrips. Check the leaves for snail and slug activity. They chew on the flowers, leaves and stems., If they become a problem, either pick them off the shrub in the morning and drop them into a bucket of soapy water to drown or sink tuna or cat food cans into the soil around the shrub and fill them with beer.


Snails and slugs will crawl into the beer and drown. The edge of the can should be level with the surrounding soil. Check the cans each afternoon. Dump the dead snails and slugs into the garbage, replace the cans and fill them with fresh beer.

, Aphids are little soft-bodied, slow-moving insects that can be almost any color.Spider mites are actually tiny spiders that can barely be seen without a magnifying glass. They spin a fine webbing between the leaves and stems.
Thrips are also very tiny. They are yellow to black and leave black excrement on the undersides of the leaves which take on a dusty appearance as the thrips feed. The flowers usually develop brown streaks.
Spittle bugs are 1⁄4 to 1⁄3 inch (0.6 to 0.8 cm) long and can be brown, green or yellow. They deposit a frothy white substance on shrub stems.

, All of these insects suck plant juices from the leaves and stems of shrubs. They can usually be controlled by spraying 'Limelight' in the morning several times each week with a forceful spray from a garden hose. Be sure to spray the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems.

, Insecticidal soap is available already diluted in spray bottles or in concentrate form.


Insecticidal soap concentrate is commonly diluted at a rate of 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) per gallon of water. Spray the shrub in the morning or evening.
Spraying it in the afternoon when the sun is hottest or when temperatures rise above 85 °F (29 °C) can cause damage to the leaves.
Hose the insecticidal soap off the shrub after an hour or two. The soap will only kill the pests that are sprayed. There is no benefit to leaving it on the shrub and it could damage the leaves.

"
"
Watch out for certain diseases.,
Monitor your watering habits to combat these diseases.,
Prune away diseased parts of the plant.,
Fight bacteria.",How to Care for Limelight Hydrangeas4," Bud blight, leaf spots, rust and mildew will occasionally afflict 'Limelight'. Bud blight causes brown flecks on the flower petals and mature flowers to rot.


When the weather has been cool and damp, brown spots and gray mold may appear on the leaves and stems. Leaf spots are caused by fungi that cause brown or black spots.Rust is also caused by a fungus that coats the leaves with an orange, powdery substance.
Mildew can become a problem for 'Limelight.' Powdery mildew makes the leaves appear white and powdery while downy mildew will cause yellow spots on the leaves with gray fluffy mildew underneath.

, All of these maladies are caused by fungi. To help prevent them, do not get the leaves wet when watering and water in the morning so that the leaves can dry before evening if they do get wet.

, If 'Limelight' gets any of these diseases, prune off the diseased leaves, flowers and stems immediately and put them in the trash. Disinfect the pruners by soaking them for 5 minutes in household disinfectant then rinse them off before using them to prune other shrubs.


Rake up any fallen leaves and debris from around the base of the shrub and dispose of that, too. Fungal spores live in the debris and will be splashed back onto the shrub when it rains.

, Bacterial wilt is another disease that can infect 'Limelight' hydrangeas. Bacteria infect the shrub at the base, interrupting the flow of moisture and nutrients to the rest of the shrub.


Unfortunately, there isn’t much that can be done for the shrub if it becomes infected with bacterial wilt. The leaves and stems will wilt and the whole shrub may die within weeks. If this occurs, appropriate watering is all that can be done to help it. If the soil seems wet, let it dry before watering again. If it is dry, water the shrub more often.

Fertilize daffodils when the soil needs additional nutrients.,
Buy a soil testing kit to assess nutrition levels.,
Choose the right kind of fertilizer for your daffodils.,
Feed the daffodils at the start of the growing season.,
Mulch daffodils after the growing season instead of fertilizing again.,
Fertilize container-grown daffodils after the growing season.",How to Fertilize Daffodils1," Once planted, daffodils usually flower again every year without too much assistance from you. However, because they stay in the ground for a long time, the surrounding soil can become depleted as the plants use up the local nutrients. Fertilizing is necessary to replace the soil’s depleted nutrients.


Daffodils also reproduce by division of the original bulb, which means more plants eventually occupy the same space. This puts additional strain on the availability of nutrients in the soil.;
, You can buy soil testing kits to assess soil nutrition but it’s important to understand that soil conditions vary across small distances in your garden (often depending on what’s been planted there before).


Don’t assume that fertilizing your plants will always make for bigger, better flowers. In fact, it’s important to get the right balance of nutrients in the soil so that your flowers continue to produce at all.
Too much of one kind of nutrient such as nitrogen or potash can often encourage the plant to grow leaves rather than flowers or cause weak growth.

, A slow release balanced fertilizer, or one higher in phosphorus and potash (also called potassium) than nitrogen, works well for daffodils.‘Balanced’ means these three main ingredients are in similar proportions. Slow release fertilizers are usually labeled as such, but are also called ‘granular’.
The cheapest option is usually blood, fish and bone fertilizer but take care—it can be very smelly!

, Daffodils should be fed at the start of the growing season, just as the first part of the plant becomes visible above ground. This is usually in the early spring.


At this time of the year, it’s best to use a liquid or water soluble fertilizer.
Some gardeners continue to feed daffodils every few weeks during the growing season until the foliage dies away, but in most gardens this is likely to overfeed the plants.

, Fertilizing your daffodils isn’t always the answer. They don’t need a great deal of fertilizer and you’re more likely to overfeed than underfeed daffodils. While some plants need to be fertilized before and after the growing season, you should consider only fertilizing your daffodils at the beginning of the growing season and then laying down mulch at the end of the season.Apply two or three inches of organic mulch around your daffodils. Organic mulch can include well-rotted manure or leaf mold. The mulch will help to protect your plants from the cold and will also restore some nutrients to the soil.

, If you’ve planted container-grown daffodils in the spring, the compost you used should have nutrients available through the growing season so there should be no need to fertilize these plants at the beginning of the growing season. However you can fertilize them after if you hope to have blooms the following year.


Keep in mind that container-planted daffodils generally do not grow as well the second year that they remain in the container. However, if you want to keep them for a second season, fertilize after the growing season to improve their performance the next season.
After flowering ends, top dress your container with a slow-release fertilizer such as bone meal (this is pretty stinky so you may not want to keep it in the house!) or a granular fertilizer. About two months after the flowers fade, turn the container on its side for about three months and avoid watering it until the fall.

Let the daffodil foliage die back on its own.,
Keep the soil damp but not wet.,
Make sure your daffodils are planted deeply enough.,
Chill the daffodil bulbs over the winter months to ensure flowering.,
Place your daffodils in a sunny spot with where the soil drains well.,
Hoe around the daffodils to prevent infestation.",How to Fertilize Daffodils2," Daffodils are very adept at making the energy they need through photosynthesis (the absorption of sunlight). It’s important not to cut the foliage back after flowering as this is the main period when the plants are taking in energy via their leaves. Let the foliage wither away naturally.


Roughly eight weeks after flowering has finished (usually mid summer) the foliage should be brown and shriveled. It should be okay to cut it back at this time.
Daffodils that have lots of foliage but no flowers may have been over supplied with nitrogen. To correct this, use a fertilizer with more phosphorus next spring.

, Some gardeners find that their plants have lots of leaves but no flowers. One reason that your daffodils may be underperforming is a lack of water. If your area experiences a dry spring, try watering your daffodils each time the ground is dry around the plant.


However, don’t be tempted to overwater as this can cause the bulbs to rot—the ground should not be perpetually wet.

, Daffodils also fail to flourish if they aren’t planted deeply enough. If you didn’t plant the bulbs at a depth of at least two or three times their own height (usually 4 to 6 inches deep) and the width of two bulbs apart, then this may be a problem.


Failure to flower may also indicate the bulbs need dividing; this is more likely in a daffodil bed that’s been blooming for several years.

, Daffodils may also fail to flower if they haven’t had a proper chill over the winter months, or if you’ve planted at the wrong time. Most nursery bulbs are supplied pre-chilled but if this wasn’t the case, and you planted late in the year, they may fail to flower in the first year.


You may have better luck the following year after they’ve experienced the winter chill. You can also try planting pre-chilled bulbs next time.

, If the bulbs are in an area where puddles form after rainfall and don’t easily drain away, you may have a drainage problem. Consider lifting the bulbs and incorporating plenty of grit or horticultural matter such as compost into the ground to improve drainage. You can also consider raised-bed gardening, which also improves drainage., Narcissus fly can be another reason the daffodils don’t flourish. Regular hoeing around the plant can help eliminate these pests. Make sure there are no cracks in the soil that will allow the larvae to climb in.

This gives the newly formed rhizomes time to become established.


Irises should be divided every 3 to 4 years or when the middle of the clumps look bald.
Irises may indicate they need divided when the amount of blooms decrease from year to year.;
,,, Use a garden hose to clean off the rhizomes.

, The iris borer is a small caterpillar that eats its way into the leaves of the iris and then bores down to the rhizomes. The borers introduce bacteria to the rhizomes, which causes them to grow soft, turn brown, and eventually die.


Use the pruning shears to cut off any rhizomes that show damage if there are several in a clump that are not infected and you wish to save them.
Discard any leaves or rhizomes that have holes or are soft and mushy to the touch.
Cleaning up dead iris leaves in the fall will help to eliminate iris borer eggs and reduce the number hatching in the spring.
Apply dimethoate in the spring as a systemic insecticide if you have a severe iris borer problem.

, You will notice that the central part of the clump, which is usually the oldest part, will have several rhizomes shooting off from it. Some may have fan-like leaves growing up from them. Use the pruning shears to cut of the young rhizomes, and discard the older, center part of the rhizome.

,,,


You may store the rhizomes in a cool, dry location for several weeks before planting.

Divide daylilies (also known as Day Lily) any time from early spring to the middle of fall.,
Prepare the spot where you will plant the new divisions.,
Remove any mulch that may be around the daylily clump.

,
Use a garden fork and begin digging about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) from the base of the clump.,
Shake any loose dirt from the daylily clump.,
Separate the daylily clump in half with two garden forks or with a garden shovel.,
Cut the foliage of the daylilies back to around 12 inches (30 cm).,
Place the divided clumps or fans into holes you have previously prepared.,
Add mulch around the base of the daylilies.,
Water the daylilies well.",How to Divide Daylilies," The very best time to divide daylilies is late summer after they have finished blooming.;
, Loosen the soil and dig a hole deep enough to cover the base of the new clumps. Daylilies grow well in almost any soil in the full sun.

,, Dig all the way around and under the daylily clump. Remove the clump from the ground completely.

, This will help you to see where to make your divisions. The best places to divide are areas where the foliage is weak.

, Make other divisions with a garden fork or a small garden spade to suit your needs. You can keep the divisions larger, or you can further divide into individual fans. The fans can then be planted close together to fill in areas of your garden.

, This step is not necessary, but it will make the plants easier to handle.

, The hole needs to be a few inches larger than the clump, but not too deep. Cover the area around the plant with soil. Be careful not to cover the crown of the plants with too much soil. Pat the soil down around the plants.

, The mulch will keep grass from growing around the plants, and it will help to hold in moisture.

, Keep the plants watered through the coming weeks.

Wait for the snowdrops to finish flowering.,
Lift out clumps of snowdrop plants using a hand fork.,
Shake off any soil that has congealed around the roots.,
Pull out any individual bulbs.,
Pull any bulblets that you can see away from the parent bulb.,
Select a suitable part of the garden for planting the snowdrop bulbs.

,
Dig the soil over in preparation for planting.,
Replant each bulb to the same depth as the original snowdrop plants.,
Scrape the soil back over each bulb using the trowel or hand fork.,
Firm the top of the soil gently.,
Water.,
Expect snowdrops to appear the next spring.

",How to Divide Snowdrops," The snowdrops can be divided after the flowers have died off but when the plants are still ""in the green"";
, Be careful not to stick the tines of the fork through the bulbs.

, Do this gently. This will help you to see what is being divided.

, Leave both roots and leaves attached to each bulb pulled out of the clump.

, These are also capable of forming new plants if they're in good condition. However, do note that these will take longer to form than the other bulbs pulled away.

,, Dig holes large enough to fit the bulbs, breaking up any soil clumps in the bottom of the holes.


A trowel or hand fork work best for digging small bulb holes.







, Place each bulb upright in its selected hole. Press into the soil firmly.

, Cover the bulb as appropriate to ensure the right depth.

, Do this by patting it down with the flat of your hands.

, Keep an eye on the soil moisture––don't over water or the bulb risks rotting.

Cut the stems of the peonies down to ground level in September.,
Prepare your new planting area.,
Dig around and under the plant cluster to remove as much of its extensive root base as possible.

,
Shake the plant gently to remove any loose soil.,
Cut the plant cluster into smaller pieces using a sharp knife.,
Dig a hole for the new plant that is slightly larger than the plant's root system.

,
Put the peony in the hole at a depth that places the buds 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) below ground level.,
Fill the hole the rest of the way with soil.,
Water the peonies well.,
Mulch the area around and over the plant with 3 to 5 inches (7 to 12 cm) of straw or another organic mulch.,
Remove the mulch in early spring before new growth begins.

",How to Divide and Transplant Peonies,";
, It is best to prepare the soil for the new plant before digging the peonies out of the ground. Plant the newly-divided plants as quickly as possible so the roots do not have time to dry out.


Choose an area that receives full sun. Although peonies can survive in partial shade, they do best in areas that receive at least six hours of direct sun daily.
Till the soil and enrich it with peat moss or compost if necessary. Peonies prefer well-drained, rich soil.

,, This will give you a better look at the roots. You must be able to see the buds (eyes) at the top of the root structure. Rinse the roots off with the garden hose.

, Make sure that each new division has at least three buds and an adequate root system.

,, If the buds are more than 2 inches (5 cm) below the soil, remove the plant and add soil to the hole. Peonies planted to a greater depth may fail to flower.

, Tamp the soil down to firm it.

, Keep them well-watered for several weeks while the new plants grow their root base.

, The layer of mulch helps protect the soil from thawing and re-freezing during the winter months, which could kill the plant.

Examine lilies each year to know when they need dividing.,
Separate lilies in the fall, 3 to 4 weeks after flowering is completed.,
Use a garden fork to dig under and around lily clumps.,
Get rid of excess soil attached to the lilies.,
Divide the lily bulbs.",How to Divide and Transplant Lilies1," Lilies need to be divided if they show an abundance of short and spindly stems.;
, You can harm the bulbs and roots if you separate lilies prior to flowering.

, Work cautiously so you don't cut the bulbs.


Dig several inches (centimeters) away from the lily clumps. Do this at multiple spots encircling the lily clumps.
Excavate to a greater depth than the lilies were initially planted.
Raise the lily clumps from the soil.

, You need to be able to see the bulb formations clearly to divide the lilies.


Shake the lilies very gently to dislodge excess soil.
Use a hose to wash the remaining soil from the bulb clumps.

, As they grow, lilies form clumps of bulbs that are attached to each other. Gardening experts recommend pulling the bulbs apart or gently twisting to separate them.


Break apart the bulb clumps, taking care to allow the roots to untangle themselves. Don't tear the roots apart.
Tug little bulblets, immature lily bulbs, from the stem.
Use a knife to separate lily bulbs if you can't get them apart any other way.

"
"
Take off the current stem.,
Choose a new site within your garden to replant the lily bulbs.,
Dig holes wide enough to accommodate the lily bulbs.,
Dig holes to the appropriate depth based on size of the bulb you're transplanting.",How to Divide and Transplant Lilies2," The stem is attached to the top of the bulb.

, Generally, the transplanted lilies will grow better in a new location.


Pick a site with good soil drainage and good air circulation. Both are necessary for healthy lilies.
Select a spot with appropriate sunlight and shade. Lily plants require direct sun while the bulbs require shade provided by mulch and low-growing plants.
If you must transplant your lilies in the same bed, add new soil or bolster the existing soil with fertilizer or compost.

, Give each bulb a minimum radius of 6 inches (15 cm).

,


Replant big bulbs at a depth of 4 inches (10 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm).
Replant small bulblets at a depth of 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5 cm).

Dig the lilies from the ground.,
Divide the daylilies.,
Transplant the divisions.,
Cut back the foliage on the new plants to 12 inches (30 cm) if you transplant them after they are done flowering for the year.,
Water the new plants well.",How to Divide and Transplant Daylilies," It is best to divide them in early spring before they begin their yearly growth or wait until late summer when flowering is done. Whenever you choose to divide the plants, they may not produce flowers the first summer, or may produce fewer flowers than normal.;
,


Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil.
Dig the soil and till it to a depth of 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm).
Amend the soil by adding organic compost if necessary. Daylilies do best in rich, moist soil.

,,


Stick the tines of a garden fork into the soil 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) away from the base of the plant.
Push the garden fork's handle down gently to pry the roots from the ground.
Move the fork over and continue loosening the roots. Move the fork all the way around the clump of daylilies until the roots are free from the soil.
Lift the loosened clump of plants and soil from the ground with a shovel.

,


Stick 2 garden forks, back to back, into the center of the root ball.
Push the handles of the forks apart, separating the roots.
Divide each new division in the same way if your clusters are still too large or if you want to make more new transplants. Be sure that each division has at least three sets of fan leaves.

,


Dig a hole for each new transplant. The hole should be deep enough to plant the roots to the same depth as they were before. Make the holes 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) wider than the width of the root balls.
Plant the new divisions into the holes and then backfill the holes with soil. Tamp down the ground around each plant to firm it up.
Apply a layer of mulch to the soil.

, If you transplant lilies in the spring before they flower, do not cut the foliage back.

, Keep the area well-watered until they become established.

Harvest partially open sunflowers.If you intend to dry sunflowers for decorative purposes, it is better to use small to medium sized sunflowers that have only just begun to open.,
Bundle the sunflowers together.,
Hang upside down until dry.",How to Dry Sunflowers1," The seeds have not fully developed, so they should not fall out after being dried.

Cut the stem off at the length you want. Note, however, that you should have at least 4 inches (10 cm) of stem, if not more, since you will need to attach twine to these stems in a later step.;
, Tie the sunflowers together in groups of three using thick kitchen twine. Make sure that the heads do not touch., Keep the sunflowers in a dry, cool, and dark spot for several weeks until the flowers have completely dried out.Make sure that the area gets plenty of airflow to prevent mold or other fungi from growing.
The flower petals should unfurl as the sunflowers dry out.
When dried in this manner, sunflowers can last for several weeks to several months during the fall.

"
"
Choose small to medium sunflowers.,
Combine borax and white cornmeal.,
Cover the flowers with the dust.,
Let dry.",How to Dry Sunflowers2," Small, partially open sunflowers that have not fully matured are a better option than large, mature sunflowers since the seeds have not fully developed. As a result, the seed-filled center will not dry out and lose its seeds after being dried.

This method will help preserve the natural color of the sunflowers better than a standard air-dry method will. It is also thought to preserve the dried flowers even longer.

, Combine three parts borax with seven parts white cornmeal, stirring well to combine thoroughly.Both borax and cornmeal act as drying agents. The combination helps draw the moisture out of an away from the sunflower.

, Coat the sunflowers in the cornmeal and borax mixture, focusing especially on the cut stems and any notably moist portion of the flower.

If possible, place the cut sunflowers in a box and cover them with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of this mixture instead of merely coating them lightly. The more mixture you use, the more effective the drying out process will be.
Place this box in a cool dry place and do not disturb it for 10 to 15 days.

, Place in a dark, dry location for a couple of weeks. Once dry, carefully dust off any remaining cornmeal and borax before using the sunflowers for decorative purposes.

Most of the mixture should come off if you simply give the flowers a gently shake. If necessary, lightly brush your fingertips over the sunflowers to help remove the excess. Do not brush roughly or with an artificial tool, though, since the sunflowers are more fragile now and more likely to break against force.

"
"
Allow the sunflowers to mature in the ground.,
Protect with cheesecloth.,
Cut the sunflower stem at an angle.,
Hang to dry.,
Remove seeds after several weeks.",How to Dry Sunflowers3," As long as the weather is still warm and dry, you should let the sunflowers reach full maturity while still growing. If possible, do not cut the flower heads off before the back turns yellow-brown.

Ideally, you should wait until the sunflower loses its petals and the head droops. You might need to tie the flower head to a stake as it begins to die back, though, since the head will become heavier and the plant will begin to weaken under its own weight.

, Wrap cheesecloth around the flower heads and tie with kitchen twine. Doing so will protect the seeds from birds and squirrels.

Instead of cheesecloth, you could use a paper bag tied on with a rubber band. Either way, the material should be tied on at the base of the head and the seeds should be protected.
Wait until after the flower starts to die back before covering the flower head.
Also note that the bag can help catch seeds that dry and fall off during the drying process.

, If you need to cut the flower heads off early due to pests or climate, cut off about 1 foot (30.5 cm) of the stem along with it., Hang the sunflowers upside down in a dry, dark spot for several weeks, or until the back of the flower head turns completely brown.

Even if you bring the sunflower in early, you should still cover it with cheesecloth or a paper bag to collect the seeds and to protect those seeds against any small animals that may find their way into the shed or garage you decide to keep it in.

, Once the flowers have completely dried, you should be able to remove the seeds simply by brushing them off with your fingers or with a stiff brush.

If you have multiple sunflowers, you can also remove the seeds by rubbing two different sunflower heads together.

Collect the petals.,
Place the petals in between sheets of blotting paper.,
Put pressure on the flower petals.,
Let dry for several weeks.",How to Dry Sunflowers4," Choose a sunflower with bright, undamaged petals and pluck these petals off one by one using your fingers., Keep a layer or two of blotting paper above and below the petals. Place these sheets of paper, with the sunflower petals still inside, in between to pieces of stiff cardboard.

If you do not have blotting paper, you could use tracing paper, parchment paper, or clean paper towels, instead. None of these options will work quite as well as blotting paper, but they are decent alternatives.
Make sure that the petals do not touch one another. If they touch or overlap, they may end up sticking together, and you could cause the petals to break when you attempt to peel them apart.

, Place the petals-filled pieces of cardboard underneath a stack of books or other heavy object.

Alternatively, you can create an even more secure flower press with a few layers of cardboard and wooden press boards.If you do so, you will not need to place the petals beneath a heavy stack of books, and you can move the structure around as needed while the petals dry out.

Place cardboard or padded board below the blotting paper sandwich securing the petals and a second padded board above it.
Place a third padded board on top of the others.
Sandwich everything between two wooden press boards and hold the pressing structure together with rubber bands.



, Press the sunflower petals for a few weeks, disturbing them as little as possible during the process.

When you do check the petals after two or three weeks, remove the cardboard and blotting paper carefully and pick the petals up gently. If the petals still feel moist, lay out new blotting paper and continue pressing them for another few days to another week before checking again.

"
"
Collect the petals.,
Place in between paper towels.,
Microwave until dry.",How to Dry Sunflowers5," Choose sunflowers with brightly colored, undamaged petals. Use your fingers to pluck the petals off one at a time until you have as many petals as you want., Lay out two sheets of paper towel on a microwave-safe plate. Arrange the petals in a single layer on top of these paper towels, then place another two sheets of clean paper towel on top of the petals.

The paper towels will wick away the moisture released by the sunflower petals as you microwave them.
It is important that you keep the petals in a single layer. If you layer them together, there is some chance that they may end up sticking together or breaking apart when you try to separate them.

, Microwave the petals on high power for 20 to 40 seconds, or until the petals completely dry out.Check the sunflower petals after the first 20 seconds. If they still fill damp, continue microwaving them in 10 second intervals until they feel dry. Do not let the petals become crisp, though.
Dry the plates and switch out the paper towels in between batches. You could also let the paper towels sit out for a few minutes to let them dry instead of using new paper towels.
You should let the petals rest on your paper towels for several hours before you use them, for crafting purposes or otherwise. Doing so can help preserve them longer.

Check what type of petunias you are growing.,
Start with pinching petunia blooms.,
Get close to the plant, like you are weeding.,
Find a spent bloom above a new bloom.,
Repeat with each dead bloom on the same stem.,
Pinch growing tips at mid-summer.",How to Deadhead Petunias1," Find the seeds or the plant markers. If they are new types of petunias, like Wave or Tidal Wave, they don’t need to be deadheaded.


Many new petunias have been engineered to be low-maintenance. They will fill out without being deadheaded.
Wave and Tidal Wave petunias are more likely to be available from large seed companies and garden centers than farmer’s markets.;
, If you have never deadheaded a flower before, you may feel more comfortable pinching off spent flowers than cutting the plant itself. Move onto the next method once you have a season or 2 under your belt.

, Fading blooms can be hard to see after a few weeks, and you will need to get your hands dirty. Avoid wearing thick gardening gloves, because you are more likely to hurt the plant.

, Move 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) up, or just above the bud. Grasp it with your thumb and forefinger and pull. It should come off easily. Discard the bloom in the compost.

, Then, move onto a new stem. Herbaceous plants like petunias can have dozens of blooms on a single stem, so plan to deadhead every few weeks during growing season.

, If you find your petunias are getting “leggy,” meaning each stem is long and hanging toward the ground, you should pinch off growing tips. Grasp the stem lightly and find the thickest bud at the top of a set of blooms.


Pinch it between your thumb and forefinger to pluck it off. In this case, you are plucking an actively growing part of the plant, instead of a dying part.
This type of deadheading will encourage new buds below that point to bloom. It will also make the plant look thicker and healthier. "
"
Allow your petunias to start blooming.,
Get a sharp pair of pruning shears or scissors.,
Pick up a petunia stem gently.,
Cut up to 1/2 of the petunia stem with your sharp shears.,
Prune 1 stem weekly on a small petunia plant, or prune 8 to 12 stems in a large hanging basket.,
Time a large pruning session for mid-summer, if you were not able to do it weekly.,
Fertilize petunias with a liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks.",How to Deadhead Petunias2," You should wait to prune the plants until they are getting 6 or more hours of sun a day and they are filled with blooms. Once blooms start to die, you can start deadheading.

, Unlike deadheading by hand, the plant will do best with a sharp cut.

, Choose 1 that has several dying blooms on it. Find a point just below all the dead blooms.

, Aim to prune them below the majority of the spent blooms, if possible.


Although you must cut back portions of a healthy plant to encourage new, thick growth, pruning petunias will extend your growing season.

, Doing regular pruning will help you avoid pruning off all your stems at once, making them look bare for a few weeks.


Occasionally, you will need to prune off a healthy blooming stem. If a stem is looking long and leggy with lots of dead blooms, sacrifice the healthy bloom on the end so the plant will bloom longer.

, If possible, do it right before you leave for a trip, so that you will return when the petunia returns to full bloom.

, Do it after a pruning session to encourage new growth.

Determine when to divide phlox.,
Remove the entire cluster of phlox from the ground.,
Wash the soil from the roots with a garden hose.,
Make multiple small divisions from the cluster.,
Cut the cluster into 2 to 4 smaller clusters by chopping it with the garden shovel.

",How to Divide a Phlox Plant1,"


Divide phlox while it still looks healthy. The most common mistake home gardeners make when growing phlox is waiting until the plant shows signs of failing or over-crowding before they divide it.
As a rule of thumb, allow the diameter of the plant cluster to grow to the same width as the plant's height before dividing it. Divide the phlox sooner if the plant becomes over-crowded, or if the center of the plant fails to bloom and produces less foliage.
Divide phlox in early spring, late summer or early fall. Phlox division is most successful when done in the early spring before new growth begins, or in the late summer or early fall when flowering is done.;
, If you want to leave a piece of the plant in its original location, you can plant 1 of the divisions back into the original spot later.


Dig a trench around the outside of the entire plant cluster, severing the plant's roots with the blade of your garden shovel as you go.
Chop the roots under the plant by circling back around the trench again with your shovel. Push the shovel blade into the ground, angling it to reach under the plant's root base. Push down on the handle to lift the roots. Continue around the phlox until the cluster lifts from the ground.

, This gives you a better look at the roots and plant crowns. The crowns are visible at the top of the root base.

, Make sure each new division has at least 1 or 2 healthy plant crowns and an ample root base to sustain the plant. There are several ways to divide the cluster:


Break pieces off from the outside of the cluster using your fingers to separate the roots and your hands to snap the plant crowns apart. Keep breaking divisions off until the entire plant has been divided.
Use a serrated kitchen knife to cut sections off the cluster you are unable to divide the plant by hand.

,"
"
Keep the new plant divisions cool and moist.,
Select sunny, dry, well ventilated locations in which to transplant the phlox divisions.

,
Till the soil to a depth of at least 12 inches (30 cm).,
Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the root base of the plant.

,
Put the roots into the hole.,
Space the divisions so that each plant receives good air circulation.,
Water your newly transplanted phlox at ground level.",How to Divide a Phlox Plant2," Put the bare-rooted phlox into boxes, buckets or pots and move them into the shade if you are transplanting on a hot, sunny day. Cover the plants with newspaper to help them retain moisture.


Mist the roots and the newspaper lightly with water if the plants are still waiting to be planted after a couple of hours.

,, Enrich the soil with organic compost if necessary. Phlox prefer rich soil with good drainage.

,, Make sure the crowns of the plants are at ground level, and fill the rest of the hole with soil.

, This prevents moisture from accumulating on the leaves. Phlox grown in areas without enough sun or ventilation or with too much moisture are prone to powdery mildew disease.


Space new plant clusters at least 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 m) apart. You can space the divisions at least 10 inches (25 cm) apart if you are growing smaller clumps or single phlox in a row or border.

, Avoid getting the flowers and foliage wet.

Measure your garden.,
Evaluate the shade and sun patterns.,
Determine the garden view.,
Take inventory of the current plants in the garden.,
Sketch a diagram of the garden.,
Evaluate the color palette.,
Incorporate a variety of textures in the garden.,
Evaluate what size annuals you need for the garden.,
Select annuals for the garden.",How to Design the Garden with Annuals," Before starting a plan for garden design, it is important to determine the size of your garden. Using a tape measure, measure both the length and width, making note of any irregularities in size or shape.;
, Before planting annuals, it is important to determine what type of sunlight the garden area receives. This will help you select annuals best suited to the light conditions in your garden.


Observe the garden throughout an entire day. Every hour or 2, evaluate the sun and shade patterns, taking notes of direct sunlight, dappled sunlight and shade.
Understand light terminology. In most cases, a plant that requires full sunlight needs 8 or more hours of direct sun. A plant that requires partial sunlight needs 5 to 7 hours of direct sun. A plant that requires semi-shade (or part shade) requires dappled sunlight throughout the day. A plant that thrives in shade requires no direct sunlight.

, Depending where your garden is located, you may have to determine the best vantage point for garden design. For example, a garden located in a corner of your front yard may be viewed from either the street (outside the yard) or the house (inside the yard). Determine which view is most important before creating a garden design.

, Take note of all current vegetation, including plants, shrubs and trees. If there are flowering plants or shrubs, record the bloom colors. If perennials are located in the garden, note when they bloom and when they die back for the season. The existing permanent vegetation can serve as a framework when designing a garden with temporary annuals.

, Using graph paper, create a diagram of the garden. Use the graph paper squares to draw the garden to scale. For example, each square could represent 1 foot or 1 meter. Mark where there are existing plants, shrubs or trees. This will help you determine where to place annuals.

, Color combinations are subjective, but can set the tone for your annual garden. Color palettes may match, complement or contrast. Keep in mind that too much contrast (or too many colors) can be unattractive, but that too much matching (or all the same color) can be boring.


Use a color wheel to help create combinations that are visually appealing. If you don't have access to a color wheel, arrange different colors of flowers together in a flat at a garden center. If the colors look appealing together in the flat, they will create a pleasing color palette in the garden.
Select cool colors for a calm or relaxing color palette. Cool tones, such as white, blue and violet, are soothing and make the garden seem larger.
Choose warm colors for an energetic color palette. Warm tones, such as red and yellow, are bright and exciting, but tend to make the garden seem smaller.
Select colors that complement your home. For example, if you have a red home, steer clear of pink flowers, which will clash with the red. Instead, choose tones like yellow, white, purple and blue.
Consider complementary tones. Complementary colors, such as red and green, purple and yellow, or blue and orange, intensify each another, creating more visual interest in the garden.
Limit the color palette. For formal gardens, use 1 or 2 colors. For informal or cottage gardens, incorporate 3 or 4 colors. Repeat the colors throughout the garden to lead the eye from one plant to the next.
Consider bloom times. Annuals bloom at different times. To ensure your garden offers color from spring through fall, combine annuals that flower at different times to ensure constant color in the garden.

, A garden featuring plants with the same texture can be boring. Use a variety of textures to add interest to the garden. Choose a diverse selection of annuals with fine, feathery, spiked and bold textures. When evaluating texture, consider both the bloom and foliage.

, The most eye-catching gardens feature plants in a variety of heights. Determine the mature size of each type of annual you'd like to incorporate into your garden. This will help you determine placement, with smaller plants to the foreground of your garden and larger plants near the back.


Plan from the back of the garden to the front. In cases of a round garden, plan from the center of the garden to the outside edges.
Separate the garden into 3 levels. Background plants should be about 2/3 as tall as the total width of the garden bed. Middle plants should be 12 inches (30.5 cm) to 36 inches (91.4 cm) tall. Foreground plants typically should be less than 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall.
Include a variety of plant sizes. A variety of contrasting heights will add dimension to the garden area. The most interesting flower beds include a variety of plants shapes and sizes.

, The annuals you choose are a matter of personal preference. Select plants that will thrive in the lighting conditions of your garden, are the right height and texture for the space, and match your intended color palette.


Select larger quantities of a few types of annuals when designing a garden of strictly annuals. Too many different types of annuals will make the garden look busy. For the most impact, plant annuals in groups of 3 to 5 plants.
Choose a single type of annual for an eye-catching border. For maximum impact, select 1 kind of annual for a border.
Fill in gaps in a perennial garden with several types of annuals. To add splashes of color in an existing garden, select a variety of annuals.
Consider foliage annuals. Not all annuals have showy flowers. Annuals like coleus add texture and color in a garden. Many non-flowering annuals feature foliage in colors like blue, gray, gold or silver, which can be a striking contrast among flower blooms.
Add containers planted with annuals. Containers can be moved anywhere in a garden, which means you can add instant color to an area of the garden simply by adding a container. Containers also can fill in bare areas where mature plants have died out for the growing season.

Deadhead mums in late spring to mid summer.,
Find blooms that are wilted or dead.,
Pull off dead blooms with your fingers.,
Clip off bunches of dead flowers with shears.,
Shear at the bottom of the stem for major deadheading.,
Don’t prune outdoor mums after they flower.",How to Deadhead Mums1," The best time to deadhead or prune mums you are growing outside is during the late spring up to mid summer. This is right before blooming season, so the flowers have time to branch off from the cut stems. Deadheading during the warm season also makes it less likely that the vulnerable cut areas will be exposed to cold temperatures.If you are growing your mums in a greenhouse or indoors, you can deadhead them as soon as you see dead growths since the mums won’t be exposed to cold weather.;
, When it’s time to deadhead your mums, inspect the plant to find the flowers or branches that are spent. Most mum blooms are orange or yellow in color when healthy, and brown when dead or dying. They also are likely drier than the other healthy flowers of the plant, often with a papery and brittle texture to their petals., If your mum plant only has a few dead blooms, you can simply pull off the browned flowers with your fingers. To do this, grip the stem of the mum right under the dead flower, then simply pinch and snap off the dead bloom.If you are growing your mum indoors or in a greenhouse, this method is probably best for you since you can continuously deadhead throughout the year and don’t have to worry about exposing your mum to cold temperatures.

, If many of the blooms of your mum plant are dead, but the stalks appear to be alive and are growing buds, use a pair of garden shears to clip multiple flowers off at a time. Angle the shears right under the dead blooms and clip, taking off the blooms from a whole section of the plant. Repeat until you have taken off all the dead blooms., If most or all of the blooms and stalks on your mum plant are dead, you’ll need to use a pair of gardening shears to deadhead your plant. As soon as you see new green growth from your mum plant emerging from the ground, take a sharp pair of gardening shears and clip all of the dead sections of plant as close to the ground as you can. This will eliminate not only the dead flowers, but also the dead stems of the mum plant so that it can start anew.You may feel nervous about cutting off so much of the plant. However, if your mum is a perennial plant that went through a winter season, it’s necessary not only to cut off the flower but also the dead stems.
Make sure that if you are doing a major deadheading that you do it during spring or early summer. This will give the new growths of the plant time to grow fully before blooming season in the fall.

, Once your mums flower in the fall, you may be tempted to deadhead any dead flowers you see among the healthy blossoms. Resist this temptation if you are growing outdoor plants in a region that has a cold winter season, as clipping back flowers right before cold weather will leave your plant vulnerable."
"
Pinch mums during late spring and early summer.,
Identify leggy stalks to be pinched.,
Grasp the tip under the first set of leaves.,
Pinch the tip off with your fingernails.,
Stop pinching in mid June to early August.",How to Deadhead Mums2," Pinching refers to the pinching off of the top of the stems of a plant to encourage bushy growth and blossoming. Pinching can be done alongside the removal of dead blooms in late spring to early summer, as doing it before winter can also cause the mum to be vulnerable to the cold weather.Pinching is not strictly necessary but is a good addition to your deadheading routine, as it can make your plant fuller and healthier while keeping the shape of the plant compact and bushy.

, Because pinching is best done on tall stalks that you want bushier and more fruitful, take a good look during the late spring and early summer for stalks that you want shorter. It’s best to pinch your mums once the new shoots that emerge in the spring are 3 to 4 inches (7.62- 10.16 cm) high.Also look for any tips that look dead or browned.

, Once you have identified some stalks that should be pinched, grasp the tip of a shoot right under the first set of leaves, about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) down the stem from the tip., Use your fingernails to pinch off this tip and discard the pinched off tip of the plant. Repeat the process of pinching on all unhealthy or overly-tall stems.Pinching not only shortens the height of a tall plant, it also allows encourages rapid growth of leaves and blooms right below the pinched off area.

, The optimal time to stop pinching for most mums is in mid July so that the plant has time to blossom and grow before blooming season. If your mum plant is an early cultivator then you should stop around mid-June, and if it is a late cultivator like a “Minnyellow” or a “Minngopher” mum, you can get away stopping pinching around early August.Look up your type of mum to see whether it is an early or a late cultivator.

Dispose of the dead blooms and branches.,
Mulch your mum during spring.,
Make sure that mums get sun after pruning.",How to Deadhead Mums3," After deadheading your mums, it’s important to get rid of the dead blooms, branches or stems that you have taken off in the process. Pests like slugs and snails can lay their eggs in the dead foliage and overtake the mum, which will harm the plant., A good time to mulch your plant is after deadheading and pinching because it can add nourishment to the soil and protect the vulnerable plant against cold spells. Add a few inches of lightweight mulch in the spring or summer after deadheading, and add mulch in mid to late fall to protect mums against the winter., Mums need plenty of sun, and it’s a good idea to give them the nourishment they need right after pruning. After deadheading an indoor mum, bring it to a sunny windowsill. Try to time the deadheading of outdoor mums so that it receives at least a few hours of sunlight after the deadheading process.

Use your fingers or scissors to deadhead your Iris.,
Avoid cutting blooms that have not opened yet.,
Remove the stems after any possibility of flowering is over.,
Leave the foliage on your plant.",How to Deadhead an Iris1," Try to remove the flowers just as they begin to wilt or fade as doing this prevents them from growing seed pods. To deadhead an Iris bloom, either use your fingers or take a clean sharp pair of scissors and snip or pinch off the single bloom just behind the flowerhead.


It’s important to remove not only the shriveled petals but also the green swollen sheath it emerges from, as this is the part that will eventually develop into a seedhead.;
, Try to avoid accidentally removing any remaining flowers as there may be other blooms on the stem yet to open.


Try to get into the habit of checking you plant twice a week or so during the flowering season. Some varieties of Iris (such as African Iris) have blooms which last only for one day but the plant will quickly grow new ones.

, Some Iris varieties (such as the bearded Iris) will often flower twice, once in early summer and once in late summer. Once all the blooms on a flower stem are gone and you don’t expect any more, you can then remove the flower stem from the plant. Removing the flower stem helps prevent rot. To do this:


Take a sharp blade such as a pair of garden sheers. The stem will be quite woody in many iris varieties.
Snip the stem off at the base near the ground about an inch above the rhizome. This stem can then be composted.

, It’s very important to leave the foliage on the plant after the flowering ends, so don’t be tempted to cut the plant back just yet. The Iris will use the foliage to draw energy into its roots to help it survive the winter. Leave the foliage on the plant until it withers away of its own accord.It’s okay to trim off any brown tips but leave as much healthy green growth as possible.
In the fall, once the foliage is withering away, you can cut back the foliage to about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the ground.

Know that seed production may keep your plant from producing more flowers.,
Keep your flower’s appearance in mind.,
Understand that seed production can lead to more irises growing in your garden.,
Consider keeping attractive seed heads if you don't want to deadhead your plants.",How to Deadhead an Iris2," Seed production takes your plant's energies away from flower production, so removing the dead flowers at their swollen base prevents seeds from being formed at that site. The plant then often goes on to produce more blooms than it would otherwise have done.


In the case of some varieties of Iris, you may get a second flush of blooms if you deadhead your plants.

, Deadheading also improves the plant’s appearance so that ongoing flower production can be enjoyed. Removing withered brown flowers also improves the plant’s appearance even if it doesn’t produce further flowers.


This is especially true of Iris plants, as the dead flowers turn brown very quickly and detract from other flowers.

, Some plants need to be deadheaded to prevent the plant from self-seeding throughout your garden. Plants such as poppy and ox eye daisy tend to spread themselves by seeding the surrounding area of ground and this may become a nuisance.


Some Iris varieties such as the African Iris (Dietes bicolor) are likely to self seed in your garden. Deadheading these and other plants will stop this from happening and contain the spread of plants in your garden.

, Some Irises have attractive seedheads so you may wish to avoid deadheading in order to enjoy the seedhead display once the flowers are finished.


These varieties include Stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and Blackberry lily (Belamcanda), both of which produce attractive visible seeds after flowering.

"
"
Feed your Iris.,
Steer clear of putting mulch directly on your plant’s rhizome.,
Consider dividing your rhizome.,
Give your Iris the water it needs.,
Collect seeds from your Iris if you don't deadhead your plants.,
Help your seeds to grow.",How to Deadhead an Iris3," Irises will benefit from a feed in the early spring. Try to use a fertilizer that is relatively low in nitrogen relative to potash (potassium) and phosphorus.


High nitrogen fertilizers are thought to promote rot in Iris rhizomes.

, Avoid mulching on top of your Irises’ rhizomes to avoid rot. A rhizome is a horizontal stem that grows out from the center of the plant. You can put a shallow mulch that is roughly two inches in depth around the plant, but you should make sure that the mulch doesn’t cover the rhizomes and the center of the plant.Avoid using manure, even at planting time.

, It can take quite a while to germinate Iris seed so you may have better results and faster ones by dividing the rhizome. Dividing the rhizome every few years also helps maintain the plant’s performance.This should be done about 6 weeks after flowering. It’s fine to deadhead your Iris plant thoroughly if you are planning to divide it.

, Irises don’t tend to need a lot of watering but you may like to water your plants occasionally during dry weather. Try to give your plant a good amount of water once a week rather than giving the plant a small amount of water more frequently.


Avoid over-watering as this makes the rhizome prone to rot.
It’s especially important to water over the summer if you have a variety that will rebloom the same year. Varieties that only flower in the spring don’t need as much summer attention.

, If you want to get seeds from your Iris, limit your deadheading and let at least one flowerhead remain after flowering so that the seedhead develops there.


Bear in mind the resulting plants will vary in appearance and won’t necessarily be like the parent plant.

, Growing Iris from seed usually involves soaking them for at least 2 days beforehand. Many gardeners pre-chill the seeds by storing them in the fridge beforehand.

Use a premade mix specially created for carnivorous plants.,
Do not use any products that may contain fertilizer during planting.,
Stick to using genuine sphagnum moss.,
Mix the soil ingredients in the correct ratio.,
Choose the right type of container.,
Use sphagnum moss when growing nepenthes pitcher plants.,
Place the plant in the prepared container and cover its roots with soil.,
Don’t add any additional materials to the container.,
Keep the plants well-watered.,
Be careful about the kind of water you use.,
Don’t allow the soil to dry out.,
Allow sarracenia plants to sit in water.,
Water nepenthes plants from above.",How to Plant Pitcher Plants," Using these mixes is highly recommended. Pitcher plants typically grow in damp soils that are devoid of most regular nutrients. They evolved to catch bugs to fulfill their nutritional needs. Therefore, even the tiniest bit of chemical fertilizer is a recipe for disaster and most of the time will cause fatalities.


Pitcher plants tend to react badly when exposed to regular potting soil and using it may kill plants, especially if there is any fertilizer in the soil.;
, Most companies that sell carnivorous plants also sell potting soil for them but this can lead to expensive shipping charges and make growing these specimens cost prohibitive.


Gardeners who, therefore, want to create their own mix for their pitcher plants should take care to avoid Miracle Grow brand products, such as vermiculite and sphagnum moss, because these often contain fertilizer as well.

, Similarly, gardeners should only use genuine sphagnum moss. Oregon green moss can be fatal to a number of carnivorous plants.


Pitcher plants of both types (Sarracenia and Nepenthes) benefit greatly from having sphagnum moss added to their environments.

, Use either a 1:1 ratio of peat and sand or a 2:1 mix of peat and perlite for Sarracenia species. For the first recipe, horticultural sand is best but washed playground sand also works in a pinch.


Tropical pitchers should be grown in a mix containing a 3:1 combination of sphagnum moss and a secondary material such as orchid bark, pumice, perlite, or charcoal.

, Gardeners will want to use a plastic container or one that is made of glazed ceramic to hold their plants. These containers should be carefully washed out, preferably with the same type of water one would use to irrigate the pitchers, and allowed to dry.


Nepenthes species can also be grown in orchid baskets, wooden boxes, and terracotta containers.
Sarracenia plants can be grown in pots that do not have drainage holes, but those that are growing nepenthes types will need a container with the aforementioned feature.

, When planting nepenthes specimens, try to begin covering up the drainage hole with sphagnum moss to prevent the soil from escaping.


Otherwise, gardeners can skip this step and begin by filling up the container almost full of the appropriate potting medium.

, Gardeners will want to scoop out a hole in the soil and gently stick the plant’s roots inside. They should then cover the roots and fill in around the pitcher plant with additional carnivorous plant soil.

, Gardeners should also resist the temptation to top off the container with inappropriate materials. Even if there is not enough specially formulate soil to completely fill the pot, the plants should be fine as long as their roots are not exposed.

, Water the plants well, so that they can easily recover from the stress of being transplanted and also so that they don’t dry out.

, Carnivorous plants should not be irrigated with anything other than distilled water, reverse osmosis water, or collected rainwater. Part of the reason these species are endangered in the wild is that these plants are particular about their water sources and are very sensitive to impurities.


Chemicals that are found in most tap water will have a detrimental and possibly fatal effect on your plants.

, Pitcher plants should not be allowed to dry out because most prefer slightly moist to constantly damp soil and this is the second quickest way to kill them. (The first is by administering fertilizer.)


With that in mind, Sarracenia species are more tolerant of the occasional missed watering than other carnivorous plants are.

, Sarracenia plants should be watered by setting a tray underneath them if the container they are being grown in has a hole. The tray should be kept topped up with water.For plants that are being grown in bog environments, try to pour the water directly into the containers and keep the dirt as moist as a damp sponge.

, Nepenthes don’t prefer to sit in water, so gardeners can skip having a tray for these specimens. They should still be watered regularly from the top of the plant rather than at the base.

Find a good place to put the plant.,
Water them often.,
If you have purchased a plant from a local hardware store or nursery in a small pot with a dome over it, you will need to take steps to help it adjust to lower humidity.,
Re-pot your plants every year for optimal growth, or whenever their current pot becomes too small.,
Get a nutrient-free soil mix, consisting of 1 part peat moss and one part perlite.,
Re-pot your carnivorous plants just as you would a normal plant: make sure to place it in the new pot to the same soil depth as in the old one.,
Respect their dormancy!",How to Raise Carnivorous Plants," Although many carnivorous plants look very exotic and look like they come from a remote part of the rain forest, many are actually temperate perennials native to North America. Carnivorous plants are generally divided into two groups: hardy perennials that need to be grown outdoors, and tropical or sub-tropical plants that cannot tolerate frost and must be grown indoors during cold weather. It is imperative that you know which type you are dealing with, so you will know where to grow them. For hardy perennials, i.e., Venus Flytraps, Sarracenia pitcher plants, and temperate sundews, grow them outdoors year-round in a place where they will receive at least 4-6 hours of sunlight per day. For tropical plants such as Nepenthes and tropical sundews, grow them indoors in a window that receives at least two hours of direct morning sun, and bright ambient light for the rest of the day.;
, Place the potted plant in a shallow tray or dish and make sure that the dish always stays filled with mineral-free water, but avoid letting the water level rise above half-way of the pot. For Nepenthes, keep only a small amount of water in the tray, or avoid the tray altogether and keep the plant watered well. (Nepenthes' roots may rot if kept in standing water. A good method to make sure the plant is not sitting in water is to put a plant pot in a tray and put the pot with the plant in on top of that, then the water will go into the tray, thus not affecting the roots) Make sure that the water you use is either rainwater, distilled water, or water that has been through a reverse-osmosis filter. Minerals, salts, fertilizers, and chemicals will harm your plants. If you live in an area of soft water, you can use tap water, as long as your house is no older than about 10 years, as newer houses use more plastic pipes for sinks, stopping chemicals.

, If it is a hardy perennial, you will need to place it outside in bright shade for about a week with the dome partially removed. The second week, it is safe to take the dome all the way off and move it to a location that receives part sun. The third week, it will be ready to endure full sun and wind. Tropical carnivorous plants can be done the same way if it is warm outside (for nepenthes, above 5 degree Celsius for highlanders all year round, and above 18 degree Celsius for lowlanders all year round, and for tropical sundews over 5 degree Celsius all year round) if you are planning to grow them there. This process will also work for tropical plants you are going to grow indoors. Simply follow the same steps indoors.

, Also, peat moss can begin to break down into potting soil after too many seasons and harm the plants. You should never use potting soil or fertilizer on them, as fertilizer and chemicals will kill them.

, For some plants that require faster draining soil, such as Nepenthes, use 1 part peat moss and 2 parts perlite, or you can use pure sphagnum moss.

, Generally, make sure the white or light colored growth is below the soil as it was before. Be careful not to set off more of the Venus Flytrap's traps than you have to, as each false alarm cost the plant energy. This can be reduced by re-potting just as it is coming out of dormancy. It is also a good idea to be careful not to get too much dirt stuck to the leaves of sundews, for appearance's sake. Be sure to water in well, and be careful not to wash the plant out of the soil.

, Many carnivorous plants, because of their cold winters and higher activity levels than normal plants, must ""hibernate"", or go dormant, during the winter. Make sure that you leave your Venus Flytraps, Sarracenia pitcher plants and other temperate plants outside all winter. They produce important enzymes that allow them to grow properly and flower the following spring. Don't be tempted to bring them in if they begin to loose leaves, as it is natural for them to shed frost-bitten leaves. The only time you should worry about your plants is if the temperature drops below 20 °F (−7 °C) for more than a week at a time, or if there is dry freezing wind overnight. If these cases arise, you need to move your plants into an unheated shed or garage until the temperature rises above 20 degrees, otherwise they could become dehydrated. Come spring, they should emerge from dormancy with vigor. If the soil in the pot expands, don't worry, it is just expanding due to ice.


Tropical carnivores do not require dormancy, and may be grown indoors all year. If you have been growing them outdoors during warm weather, bring them in before the temperature falls below 55ºF. Because of lower light conditions in winter, many tropical plants may slow down dramatically in growth. This is normal, and you should continue to keep water in their trays.

Only feed bugs to your carnivorous plants.,
Don't overwhelm the trap with food.,

Understand that most carnivorous plants don't need to be hand-fed.,
Avoid triggering the flytraps unnecessarily.,
Don't fertilize your carnivorous plants.,
Flush out any fertilizer with distilled water.,
Read up on your specific variety of carnivorous plant.",How to Feed Carnivorous Plants," Do not feed any meats intended for human consumption, or anything other than bugs. It is astonishing how many well-intended but clueless garden books and websites tell folks to offer small pieces of meat, usually hamburger, to their Venus flytraps. However, these traps are only designed to process bugs.Unsuitable foods may not kill the plant outright, but these items will kill every single trap they are placed into.
Choose the bugs carefully. It is best to select small bugs that are about 1/3 the size of the traps, otherwise the carnivorous plant could become overwhelmed. You can use live or dead bugs to feed these plants. However, some carnivorous plants like Venus flytraps will only eat live bugs unless otherwise motivated. ;
, Each sticky trap on a Venus flytrap can only process so many bugs before it turns black and dies off. , A natural, hands-off way of feeding carnivorous plants is by placing them around other garden specimens with insect problems.


Gardeners should keep in mind that this technique won’t get rid of all the bugs on the other plants, but it may work as a control method.

, Even houseplants do not generally have to be fed. As much as every homeowner hates to admit it, there are always the occasional bugs that get in and really, that’s about all the plant needs to be happy., Gardeners are also advised against triggering the traps on their Venus flytraps, because these traps only open and shut a set amount of times before they fall off. This can waste valuable plant energy., Carnivorous plants such as sundews (Drosera species), butterworts (Pinguicula species), Venus flytraps, pitcher plants (Sarracenia species) and tropical pitcher plants (Nepenthes species), as well as the more expensive types, typically grow in damp soils that are devoid of most regular nutrients. This, in turn, led to them adapting by catching prey to fulfill their needs.


Therefore, gardeners should avoid feeding fertilizer to their carnivorous plants, unless they are absolutely certain that it will be beneficial., If gardeners accidentally get ordinary fertilizer on their plants, they should flush out the specimen with enough distilled water or rainwater that it seeps out the bottom of the bottom of the pot.


Repeat this process several times. There is no guarantee that the plant will be saved, but if it was only exposed to a small amount of fertilizer the chances of success are good.

, There are a lot more types of carnivorous plants than those discussed here, each of which has their own specific needs and requirements. Therefore, gardeners should do the appropriate research on the specific specimen they are hoping to acquire to ensure that they know how to care for it properly.

Good luck!",How to Grow a Nepenthes3," There are many, many, many soil mixes for Nepenthes, which one you choose is pure preference and experience as to which produces the best results. Orchid bark, perlite, pumice, peat, long-fibered sphagnum moss (be careful when buying this stuff, make sure it's real moss and not decorative), charcoal, tree-fern fiber, are all good ingredients. Be careful when repotting as the roots are delicate. One reason not to choose long-fibered sphagnum is because it tends to cling to the roots.

, The flowers are either male or female, and they typically appear after the plant has made a climbing or scrambling vine. They don't change. If you find that it is in fact, for example, a male, then the next flower stalk is going to be male. It is a male plant. It can't be changed. Female flowers have a rather bulgy cit in the middle, whereas on the male flower is is thinner and yellow pollen is visible. To get an idea of this, look on Google images, there is a picture somewhere that shows the differences. On many of the carnivorous plant forums, there have been projects set up that let you trade pollen with other members of the forum, and when there are seeds, you get an equal share of them.

Watch your plant for dormancy.",How to Choose a Venus Flytrap," These plants require a regular care regimen.


You will be able to keep your Venus flytraps inside or outside, planted in pots.
Venus flytraps will need a good deal of sunlight and warmth for most of their growing cycle.
You will need to have patience, as Venus flytraps require a period of dormancy during the winter. They will grow less and require grooming.
Be prepared to trim dead leaves and blooms off of the plant to keep it healthy and to water the plant on a schedule.
You may need to feed the trap with crickets or other insects if it doesn't catch many on its own.;
, These plants have several different breeds or species. Some breeds are hardier than others.
If you are just getting started with Venus flytraps, growers recommend the following types of Venus flytraps: King Henry, Dentate Traps, Dingley Giant, or Microdent varieties. These types tend to be hardier plants that are less susceptible to common problems like disease and root rot.
The DC XL variety of Venus flytrap is known to be very hardy, but these can be more expensive than other types.

, Many nurseries and home and garden stores will have them in stock during their growing season.


Venus flytraps are usually sold in season, which typically runs from mid-spring to mid-autumn.
You can search at larger retailers like Home Depot or Lowes in the garden section.
Walmart can even carry them, if your local store has a garden section.
Smaller, privately owned nurseries are also likely to have these in stock when they are in season.

, You will want a plant that looks healthy and that is growing well.


Avoid any Venus flytrap plants that are potted in regular soil. These plants require a special kind of soil that is free of minerals.
Look for a plant that has vibrant green leaves and shoots. The traps themselves will be green or even reddish in color.
If a plant has many dead leaves that have not been trimmed, don't choose this plant. Grooming is a part of Venus flytrap maintenance, and you will want to purchase a plant that has been properly cared for.
Keep an eye out for any plants that appear wilted, dull in color, or that look sparse. These plants might have a fungal or bacterial problem and should be avoided.

, If you are having trouble finding one in a retail store, there are many online sources for purchasing Venus flytraps.


Online sources, such as www.flytrapstore.com and www.growcarnivorousplants.com sell many varieties of Venus flytraps.
You are more likely to find more variety in breed or species of Venus flytrap through online sellers.
This can be especially helpful if you are new to raising Venus flytraps and are looking for a specific variety that is hardier, or if you are looking to expand your collection to include more variety in breeds.

, Regular garden or potting soil is not appropriate for growing these plants.


Most of the time, if you buy a Venus fly trap it will already be potted in suitable soil. However, if you need to add more soil to your potted plant, you will need to get the right kind.
Venus flytraps will die if they are planted in regular garden soil or potting mix.
These plants naturally live in soil mediums which are free draining and contain almost no nutrients or soluble minerals.
Venus flytraps naturally grow in sandy soil that has very low fertility and very little organic material. This soil is usually slightly acidic.
You can buy potting mix specifically geared towards Venus flytraps. This usually contains a mixture of sphagnum moss, silica sand, and perlite.

, They will not thrive in areas with too much shade.


During the spring and summer growing season, Venus flytraps will do best if they are kept in pots outdoors in direct sunlight except in the hottest weeks of summer.
In the hottest part of summer, you should move your Venus flytraps to an area with partial shade or the plants will get too much direct sunlight.
You can also grow Venus flytraps indoors, but they will not be as vibrant. Artificial light sources that are recommended are LEDs and fluorescent bulbs.

, You should never water this plant with regular tap water.


Tap water and bottled drinking water contains too many minerals. This will kill a Venus flytrap.
You should only water your Venus flytraps with distilled water, deionized water, or reverse osmosis water. You can buy these bottled in the grocery store or garden stores and they are relatively inexpensive.
You can also collect rainwater to use to water your Venus flytrap.

, Venus flytraps can become too moist and this will promote bacterial or fungal growth that can kill the plant.


How often you water your flytrap will depend on a number of factors. If you are keeping your plants in an area with lots of sunlight and humidity, they will dry out faster. If they are in a cool area, the soil will remain moist for longer periods.
Most Venus flytrap growers recommend watering your plant every 2-5 days if you are keeping it in an area with more heat and sunlight.
If you keep your flytrap in a cooler area with more shade, watering your plant every 8-10 days, or even up to every 14 days, is recommended.
A good test to see if your plant needs to be watered is to feel the soil. If it is dry or cracked, the plant needs to be watered.
Using a turkey baster to water your plant gently is recommended by Venus flytrap growers.

, You will have to trim off dead leaves and blooms from the plant to keep it healthy.


Dead leaves not only make a plant look unhealthy, but can actually shade new growth leaves and prevent them from getting adequate sunlight.
If leaves are brown and dry, they are dead.
In many cases these can be gently pulled off of the stem and disposed of.
Otherwise, you will need to trim off dead leaves and blooms gently with plant shears.

, Most plants require fertilizer, but in the case of carnivorous plants like Venus flytraps, you will need to feed it insects.


Trap flies and put them into the traps while still alive. The motion will trigger the plants to close and trap the insect inside. It will slowly be digested by the plant's natural enzymes. This can take several weeks.
If you are having trouble getting flies into the traps, put them in a jar and refrigerate them. The cold will make them sluggish and easier to put into the traps.
If you can't find flies, you can feed the plant small earthworms. You can also feed it with live insects like crickets or mealworms that are used to feed lizards and reptile pets. You can buy these at pet supply stores.
When feeding, you should only feed one or two traps at a time. Avoid having all of the traps on a plant full at once. Digesting all those insects will expend the energy of the plant and can cause it to wither.

, Venus flytraps go through a yearly period of dormancy in the winter.


Colder weather in the fall triggers dormancy in a Venus flytrap. During this period, growth slows and traps become sluggish.
During its dormant period, you can still keep the Venus flytrap outdoors but bring it inside if temperatures fall below or close to freezing.
You should still water and feed the plant during dormancy, but the plant will require less water and food during this period. Check the soil of the plant to make sure it is dry before watering and decrease the frequency of insect feedings.

The leaf-blade is the ‘head’ that everyone will recognize—it looks like a green clam shell with some wicked long ‘teeth’. These ‘teeth’ are actually trigger hairs that tell the fly trap there’s a tasty insect nearby., These protein-powered plants are common enough that you could find one in supermarkets or garden centers, but if you want an older or more disease resistant plant, look up a reliable nursery that carries them.


There are also online sites that specialize in carnivorous plants. While you won’t be able to pick out the specific plant you want, they will be able to ship a fly trap to you, as well as provide you with care information about your plant.

, They are an endangered species and protected by law. You could be facing a fine or even jail.

, Venus fly traps have relatively long roots, so they prefer pots that have vertical depth. In general, a pot that gives your plant 4 or 5 inches (10cm) of root growth space should be good.


Pick an insulated pot. Their roots are also sensitive to temperature change, so an insulated pot works best. While plastic pots do work, you should definitely consider searching your local garden center for insulated pots.
Pick a pot that will filter and absorb nutrients and salts that would otherwise harm your fly trap. An unglazed terracotta pot is a porous container that will let your roots breathe oxygen through the soil and act like a sediment filter for the water.
Having said all this, Venus fly traps are not terribly picky about their pots. You can use a deep terracotta pot with a hole in the bottom or a bucket with some holes cut in the bottom of it for drainage.

, Mix equal parts of sphagnum peat moss and perlite. Never use beach sand, which contains nutrient salts. Perlite is a form of hydrated obsidian that looks like small chunks of white sand. Perlite helps potted plants retain moisture.Native to the bogs and swamp-lands of North and South Carolina, Venus fly traps enjoy high humidity and moist, poor, acidic soil. The ideal PH for a Venus fly trap is in the acidic range of 4.9 to 5.3 (most normal plants and vegetables prefer a more neutral range of PH 5.8 to 7.2).
Another mixture combination that is preferred by some fly trap growers is five parts sphagnum peat moss, three parts silica sand, and two parts perlite. Silica sand helps with aeration; is known to help plants develop a resistance to warmer temperatures and pests, and both silica sand (which is quartz) and perlite do not release excessive nutrients and minerals into the soil, which is good for your carnivorous plant.
Do not use regular or organic potting soil, as this sort of soil will kill the plant by burning its roots. You should also stay away from fertilizing your fly trap, as fertilizer may also ""burn the roots,"" thus killing your plant. Do not use any enriched soil, like Miracle-Grow, as it contains fertilizer and highly organic compost.

, You may wish to keep the fly trap inside the terrarium to increase the relative humidity in the air, but keep an open vent in the terrarium to allow your plant to use her skills and lure the bugs to come in for dinner. Healthy, live, and disease free bugs are the best food for your plant.

, During the growing period, they need 12 hours of light so that they can properly photosynthesize and flower. At least four of those hours should be direct sunlight.


Keep in mind that the more direct sunlight your plant gets, the healthier it will be.Most fly trap cultivars will show a reddish pigmentation when they are healthy and happy where you place them.

, In addition to needing plenty of light, your fly trap needs high humidity and protection against breezes or drafts. Keeping your plant indoors in a sunny yet draft-free area will usually be ideal.


Observe where sunlight reaches during the morning hours and afternoon hours.
If you are planning on keeping your plant inside, you will need to put it in an east, west, or south-facing window. Remember that the plant should get a minimum of four hours of direct sunlight each day.
You could also grow your plant in an open vent terrarium with a ‘plant light’ or fluorescent light close by. The closer the light is to the plant, the healthier the plant will be.

, You could also grow it in your bog garden). Just make sure to put the plant where it will be in direct sunlight and not in nutrient rich soil.


You may also wish to shield the plant from strong winds by placing it near other structures or draft-hardy plants.

, From April to October, or whenever you make your plant think it is spring, it needs plenty of water and sun. The growing period is when your plant will be in full activity; '‘catching’' prey, photosynthesizing, and producing flowers.

, You should only ever use pure water; distilled water, deionized water, and rainwater are all viable options.


Giving your plants Reverse Osmosis filtered water is the best choice because most other sources, like drinking water, already have minerals added for flavor.

, There are three main reasons why tap water is bad for your fly traps.


Tap water contains things like chlorine, sodium and sulfur (among others) that will build up in your plant’s soil over time, causing sickness and, eventually plant death.
Most tap water sources the PH levels are on the 7.9 to 8.3 range.
The chlorine kills most living organisms even the beneficial ones.

, You can use tap water if you measure the water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) meter. Your water has to read less than 50 parts per million (ppm) on the TDS meter in order for it to be safe for your plant.

, During the growing season, your plant’s soil should never be completely dry. Try to keep your plant’s growing medium so that it is moist to the touch (not soggy). There are three ways to water your plant, each with their own benefits:



The Tray Method: The tray method of watering is one of the best watering methods for an actively growing plant that is in direct sunlight. Your plant should be in a pot that has drainage holes in the bottom. Place the pot in a tray that is filled with water. Your plant’s growing medium will absorb the water like a wick, giving your plant all of the water it needs & increasing humidity around the pot.

Keep in mind, however, that if your pot is relatively shallow (5 inches or 13 cm) this method could be detrimental to your plant because the plant’s roots could be too surrounded by water, causing fungal or bacterial growth.



The Top Method: This is how most plants are watered, you pour or spray water onto the soil around the plant and let the water drain out of the bottom of the pot. Your plant’s soil should always be moist but not soaked. This means watering your plant two to five times per month during the growing period.

The Double pot Method: This is the most effective method for growing fly traps; The second pot surrounding the smaller terracotta pot in the middle isolates the plant from drastic temperature changes, increases humidity in the air, and retains moisture. Only pour water into the second pot on the outside diameter of the middle pot.

The porous terracotta pot in the middle should allow moisture to enter the middle of the pot and filter out extra nutrient salts.



, As stated previously, Venus fly traps need at least four hours of direct sunlight during their growing periods. Aside from ‘eating’ bugs, traps rely on photosynthesis to grow and stay healthy.


Put your plant in a spot where it will receive at least 12 hours of sunlight.

, Between November and March, your plant will go through a dormant phase. The dormant state is when the plant stops producing flowers or growing. Many fly traps die off during the dormant period because people continue to care for them like they would during the normal growing period.

, You should not use the tray method of water when your plant is in dormancy; instead, water your plant by hand. While growing fly traps need a lot of water, their need is greatly reduced during the dormant period. Most fly traps will only need to be watered every 10 to 14 days.


The soil should become much drier (though never fully dry). The soil directly around the base and roots should be slightly damp, while the rest of the soil is dry. Water the plant like you would any other time, making sure to water thoroughly.
When you do water your plant, water it in the morning so that it has the whole day to dry out a bit before the cooler night temperatures come in.
Do not over-water your plant--only water it when the soil begins to feel dry around the base of the plant. If you give your plant too much water, bacterial and fungal growths may occur.

, While dormancy invites the idea that the plant does absolutely nothing, Venus fly traps will actually continue to photosynthesize during their dormant period. Therefore, your plant should still be exposed to sunlight.


If possible, bring your plant inside and set it up under a strong artificial light for the duration of its dormancy.

, The extent you go to will depend on what climate you live in, and whether you are growing your plants outside or indoors. If you are growing it outdoors, you have two options:


If you are growing your plant outdoors and live in a climate that stays relatively warm (where the temperature generally never dips below 30 degrees F (-1 degree C)) then you can leave your plant outside all year long without protection.
If you are growing a plant outdoors where the climate is colder there are occasional freezes, you should plant your fly traps in the ground for winter (pots absorb the temperatures of the air around them). Plant them in a bog garden, or in soil that is good for fly traps (see Part One). You should also cover your plants with mulch or leaves to keep them safe from the bad weather.

, If you live in a place that has extended freezes, you will have to bring your Venus fly traps indoors for the winter. Put it in the window of an unheated room like a garage or porch. This is the best way to keep your plants alive but dormant indoors. Put your plant in a south-facing windowsill if you can, as this will allow the plant to continue to photosynthesize.

, You can feed your Venus flytrap to give it the nutrients it needs, or you can add a very small amount of nutrient-rich fertilizer to your Venus fly trap’s soil, or mist them occasionally with a spray-on fertilizer.When Venus flytraps are outdoors, they catch insects, grasshoppers (and occasionally small animals like frogs) that provide nutrients that will make the plant healthier.


Keep in mind that the trap sometimes doesn’t seal unless the item it has caught is moving. This means that you should feed your fly trap live prey like flies and mealworms. A helpful tip when using live prey is to put the prey in the freezer for a few minutes so that it becomes very slow. You should only feed one or two of your plants traps at a time, and only when the plant is healthy and strong.
If you do decide to feed your plant a dead insect, you should place the insect in the trap and then gently rub the trap every 20 or 30 minutes until the trap seals fully. Rubbing the trap makes it think that the thing it has caught is moving. This is not always necessary, however, as the plants also use chemical receptors to close with the presence of nutrients inside the trap.
Do not feed your plant ‘exotic’ food like bits of hamburger or cake. This will more than likely kill the plant, particularly if you give you plant meat, as the plant will have a negative reaction to the fat.

Fats and the decomposing meat will grow bacteria that could also harm your fly trap.



, Grooming your plant helps to keep your Venus fly trap healthy. Dead leaves can block the sun from young leaves that need the light to grow. Your plant’s leaves will turn brown as they die—these are the leaves you will want to get rid of. You can cut them away when they turn brown by using a small pair of scissors. Make sure you do not cut away any leaves that are still partly green--these leaves can still photosynthesize.


As the leaves turn brown, they should begin to weaken and detach from the plant. Most of the time, you should be able to just pluck them off the plant. For the tougher ones, sewing scissors work well. You should also be aware that Venus fly trap leaves tend to die off in bunches.

, If you notice that you plant looks like it is too crowded in its pot, that it has divided into two (or more) plants, or that it dries out too quickly, it is time to re-pot your plant. Doing this is much the same as potting your plant in its original container. Make sure to use the right composition of soil (see Part One)., Triggering your plants to close when there is nothing in their traps for them to ‘eat’ is an unnecessary waste of energy for your plant.


It takes two to three weeks for a plant's trap to reopen and again be ready to trap its potential food.
While it is OK to gently rub the outside of the traps after you have fed it an insect, you should limit the amount you touch your plant. Never put anything inside their traps except for insects."

Light is very important.",How to Care for a Carnivorous Plant," When you buy your plant, it may be in a small container with a dome cover. You might think about moving it to a larger terrarium just in case you want add more plants later. The domes are not needed but the plant may need to be slowly acclimated to the outside humidity. Remove them slowly. If the nursery can sell exotic tropical plants with no domes, they should sell North Carolina´s own Venus flytrap without them as well.;
, Most experts recommend a potting mixture of 60% peat moss and 40% perlite, or clean sand. You can now add your plant to the pot.

, If you are growing in sphagnum moss then you don't need to water as much because of water retention, but that does not mean let it get dry. Water from the bottom only.

, Some species do best in indirect light, but most thrive in full sun-as much as possible. Venus flytraps and most, if not all, other north American carnivores should bask in as much sun as you can give them. DO NOT place plants that still have a dome over them in the direct sun.

If you put the sundew outside, remember to check it every day to see if the plant has been attacked.",How to Grow Sundews," If you do some research on this plant, you'll get an idea of what it is and whether you can grow it in your area. There are approximately 194 sundew species worldwide. They grow in all different shapes and sizes - from round ones to long ones. Sundews tend to live for 50 years, if kept in good condition. In some cases, they can be used for medicinal purposes. Some of the more common sundew species you might want to grow are:



Drosera capensis: The easiest sundew to grow.







Pygmy sundews: Usually found in Australia, this one has hairs to ward off the heat.







Tuberous sundews: Very good at surviving hot weather.







Petiolaris complex: Usually grown in warm or wet areas.





;
, If an insect lands on one of the leaf's sticky tentacles, they may get stuck and the Sundew would wrap its tentacle up and digest the content.

, Sundew plants are rarely found in generalist nurseries. Try really big nurseries or order them online. When purchased, the plant usually only comes in seed form or as a very small plant.


Ask the helper in the shop for any tips or information on your plant's specific growing requirements. Remember that their characteristics differ, depending on which sundew plant you're buying.







, Moist or dry soil should be 70% peat / 30% sand or perlite (although take into account specific needs as revealed by your research). You will need a 4 inch pot or larger because a sundew's roots are unusually long and providing adequate space will enable the plant to reach its maximum height. This plant usually grows better in moist conditions. The roots tend to be weak, though, and are nearly useless for absorbing nutrients from the soil., Make sure if you spread many seeds on the surface in the same container to space them out as much as possible.

Water the plant with a little rain/distilled/reverse-osmosis water (about one or half an inch/2.5 to 1.5cm), via the tray method, to avoid disturbing the small seedlings.
Check the plant every single day - the Drosera are very sensitive plants!

, This growth period will take approximately one month, maybe longer.

, The more light shone on the plant, the better. Place the plant near your window so it gets enough sunlight. High humidity is not needed, so anything up to 50%RH would be fine.


The sundew should be placed in a well lit place. It should receive direct sunlight for at least half the day. Be aware, too, that the dew or the sticky substance may dry up.







, If your plant is situated indoors, you'll need to hand feed it. Feed it some dead insects or live insects, such as an ant. Feed the plant only fresh bugs.


The sundew is not able to digest meat, so do not feed it any.
Do not feed the plant an insect that is bigger than the plant's tentacle, or it could escape (and you'll have to catch it) or it will simply be too large for the plant to digest.
Don't overfeed the plant if it is living in a high humidity environment. Doing so might promote mold growth, killing the leaves.
If you place the plant outside, it will most likely feed itself, hence feeding is not required.

, You may notice the sundew is not doing much at this stage due to the energy expended in making the flower. When the flower has developed, you can place the plant outside so a bee or other insect can transfer the pollen from plant to plant. The flowers are usually red, pink or white and will self-pollinate if they are not pollinated by another insect first.


Seeds might develop and these are known to come out better if you cross-pollinate by rubbing the pollen from one plant against another flower's stigma.

, A sundew's roots are often weakly developed and most water is taken in through the leaves. Therefore, spray the plant with an inch or two of mineral-free or distilled water once every week. Remember not to spray too much or drown the plant. Too much moisture or water will rot the roots.


Do not use any other type of water (such as tap water), as there may be excess minerals which build up and may kill the plant. If you do over-water the plant, invert the pot and plant while pressing down on the soil to squeeze out the extra water.

, Since the terrarium is enclosed, few insects will be able to get in there and you'll be the sole provider of food.


You can control the light intensity inside of a terrarium. This is another reason a terrarium might be a good choice for your sundew.

, Check for diseases at this time, too. Put the sundew in a well-lit location where the plant can receive direct sunlight for part of the day, yet also have a bit of shade."
"
Determine the species of your plants.,
Provide species-appropriate temperatures.,
Expose the plants to direct sunlight at least four hours each day.,
Provide a humidity level of 60% or higher.,
Grow them in porous, low-fertility potting materials.",How to Care for Nepenthes (Tropical Pitcher Plants)1," Nepenthes are divided into two species groups – highland and lowland. The two species are divided based on the altitude of their natural growth habitat, so they need slightly different care to thrive. There is also a less common intermediate group that can grow in both highland and lowland conditions. The species mostly dictates the temperature and amount of light the plants need. Most of the other growth conditions are about the same for all species.A few examples of lowland species are N. Ampullaria, N. alata, N. eymae (infundibuliformis, eymai), N.khasiana, N. mirabilis, N. ventricosa, N. ampullaria, N. bicalcarata, N. gracilis and N. maxima.
Some examples of highland species are N. Ventricosa, N. burbidgeae, N. lowii, N. rajah and N. villosa.A good example for an intermediate species is N. Sanguinea.;
, The lowlanders prefer night temperatures that are above 70°F (20°C) and day temperatures between 85°F and 95°F (29°C and 35°C). They are sensitive to cold temperatures. The highlanders prefer a cooler environment. They like night temperatures between 45°F and 65°F (7°C and 18°C) and day temperatures between 65°F and 85°F (18°C and 29°C). They can be sensitive to higher temperatures.Most species of nepenthes are able to grow in daytime temperatures ranging somewhere between 65°F and 80°F (18° and 27°C).
In general, most nepenthes can thrive at temperatures between 55°F and 95°F (12°C and 35°C)., The amount of light required by nepenthes varies wildly from species to species. Research the species you have, find out its natural habitat, and try to recreate that as closely as you can. As a general rule, they need at least four hours of direct sunlight each day, along with very bright (but not direct) sunlight for the rest of the day.No matter what species you have, avoid putting nepenthes in full shade. They won’t thrive.
If you can’t replicate the light requirements needed by your plant, look into using broad spectrum lights.

, Nepenthes come from tropical climates, so humidity is essential for them. In general, they like humidity levels of 60% or more.They will tolerate lower humidity levels, but it can cause them to stop making pitchers. Lowlanders prefer a steady humidity level. Highlanders, on the other hand, will tolerate low humidity levels during the day, as long as they get higher during the night. If you live in a warm, humid climate, you can try putting your plants outside. Always bring them in when the temperature drops under 50°F (10°C).


Many people use indoor humidifiers to create the right environment for their plants. If you do, make sure the area is well-ventilated.
Greenhouses and terrariums are other humid spots many nepenthes species enjoy., Because of the way they evolved, nepenthes prefer nutrient-free soil. This means the potting material should have little to no trace minerals in it. They need to grow in a medium that provides plenty of aeration and drainage. Most nepenthes enthusiasts like to create their own planting mix using several different kinds of potting materials. The most common ones used are coconut husk, dried sphagnum moss, perlite (or pumice), peat moss, and silica sand.


Feel free to create your own mix using these options.Other growth media to consider for mixes – charcoal, lava rock, orchid bark, cedar chips and limestone."
"
Water every few days with purified water.,
Check for adequate drainage.A nepenthe should never be left in standing water, since this will rot their roots.,
Avoid feeding your plant unless it has limited access to insects.,
Repot your nepenthes in fresh media every year.",How to Care for Nepenthes (Tropical Pitcher Plants)2," The precise amount of water will depend on factors like type of potting material used, humidity level and so on, but as a rule you should make sure your plant remains in moist media at all times. Never allow the potting material to dry out completely – if the topsoil is starting to dry out, it’s time to water your plant. Just like their soil, nepenthes need water that has little to no trace elements in it.


They will tolerate a low level of minerals, but rain, distilled or purified water are the best options. They dislike salt.Tap water is acceptable, but only if it’s under 250 ppm.
In general, lowlanders tend to need more water than highlanders.

, The key to avoiding this is adequate drainage. Select potting material that is porous, well-drained and open enough that air can reach the roots of the plant. Tree fern fiber, chopped fir bark, long fiber sphagnum moss, peat moss and perlite are all good choices. A mix of several of these is typically used for best results.


After watering, always make sure there’s plenty of drainage.
If the potting material starts to break down (which can happen over time), or if you notice that your plant is drying out very quickly, the issue may be too much drainage. The solution is repotting.

, Carnivorous plants like nepenthes eat insects for food. Generally, you’ll never need to feed insects to your plant. Most homes have insects in them, and the plants have adapted over time to survive on very small amounts of nutrients. An adult nepenthes only needs two or three insects every month to thrive.If you choose to feed your plant, it should only eat freshly killed insects. Make sure the insects will fit comfortably into the plant’s pitcher.
Never feed your nepenthes actual meat., After about a year, most potting materials start to break down. Nepenthes like to be repotted annually with new potting material and, if necessary, a bigger planter. Changing the potting material helps to improve soil aeration. You can safely repot your plants at any time of the year.Be sure to water your plant right after you repot it.

"
"
Reduce light exposure if you see yellow leaves.,
Increase light exposure if your plant looks thin and won’t grow pitchers.You will know light exposure is too weak when nepenthes appear scrawny or frail.,
Cut off dying leaves and pitchers.",How to Care for Nepenthes (Tropical Pitcher Plants)3," Yellow leaves, and sometimes red spots, indicate that the plant is getting too much sunlight. If you see any red or yellow on your nepenthes, check for burned leaves on the areas of the plant that face the sun. After you reduce light exposure, you’ll usually find new and normal-colored leaves beginning to grow soon after., Poor coloration can also mean the light exposure isn’t adequate. You plant may refuse to make pitchers if it’s not getting enough light, although occasionally this can be caused by inadequate humidity levels., It’s normal for leaves and pitchers to start dying around fall or winter. The pitchers only last a couple of months, about the length of one season. Then they age, turn brown and die. Prune dying pitchers off your plant by cutting them off at the end of their tendrils.Remove browned and dead leaves.
Avoid pruning off more than 30% of your plant’s foliage at one time."
"
Prepare the growing medium.,
Rinse the growing medium with distilled water, reverse osmosis water, or rainwater.,
Provide full sunlight.,
Find a low-mineral water source.,
Provide plenty of water.,
Apply fertilizer with caution.,
Feed indoor plants.,
Understand dormancy.,
Reduce water and food.,
Trim away dead traps in the spring.,
Bring them indoors during extreme temperatures.",How to Grow Sarracenia (North American Pitcher Plants)," Just like most carnivorous plants, Sarracenia grows well in a 50/50 mix of peat moss and coarse sand (use 100% silica sand with no added minerals - this can usually be found at pool supply stores). Perlite is an excellent substitute for sand if you can not find any.


Peat moss that includes fertilizer can kill your Sarracenia plants, so be very careful which brand you choose! Make sure it doesn't say there is any additives.
Horticultural or aquatic sands work well - do not use play sand! Again, silica sand is the safest bet.;
, This removes potentially toxic minerals, along with nutrients that can attract pests and algae. Try the following rinsing method:Place peat moss in a bucket and cover with tap water. Stir with your hand, then squeeze to wring out water. Transfer to second bucket and repeat two or three times with distilled water or rainwater.
Place sand in a bucket or tray outdoors, to avoid clogging plumbing. Blast sand with hose until submerged, then drain out water. Repeat 10–20 times or until water is mostly clear, then rinse a final time with distilled water or rainwater.

, These plants naturally grow in nutrient poor soil, where few other plants can compete with them for light. Most pitcher plants will even have trouble growing under artificial lights or on a sunny windowsill. Keep them in an outdoor location that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Try the south side of your house if you're in the Northern Hemisphere, or the north side if you're in the Southern Hemisphere.



Sarracenia Purpurea, Rosea, Psittacina, and some of their hybrids can grow decently well on a sunny windowsill or in a terrarium; however, make sure you know the dormancy needs.full sun. Every few days, move it to an area that receives slightly more sun or put it outside for an hour longer each day.

, Most tap water contains too many dissolved minerals and salts, which can build up over time and kill the plant. For best results, use collected rainwater, reverse osmosis water or distilled water.


Avoid ""spring water,"" which may contain harmful additives.
If you have a water testing kit, check that your water contains fewer than 100ppm minerals, and no chlorine or heavy metals. If your tap water meets these standards, it might be safe. Reduce risk by rinsing the watering tray periodically.

, All species of Sarracenia respond well to the tray method of watering. Place the pot in a large tray or trough, and pour in water. As a general rule, as long as the water is below the crown of the plant (the base of the stem), they should be fine.


Some species have specific requirements concerning the amount water. Try to find species-specific information if you suspect water-related problems.

, Fertilizer can just as easily kill your pitcher plants as help them. Light fertilizing for the first two or three years can improve growth, but experiment at your own risk. Try burying just four grains of balanced (14-14-14) slow-release fertilizer ½ cm (0.2 inches) beneath the surface, at the start of the growing season. Or you can get something such as seaweed fertilizer (like Maxsea 16-16-16) and dilute it 1/4 tsp per gallon and put it inside the pitchers... All the way up to the top!

, Outdoor pitcher plants are adept at catching their own meals. Feed indoor plants dehydrated phoenix worms, or meal worms during the growing season. About one worm per trap per month should be enough, but this may vary based on size and species. Bloodworms can also be used.


Outdoor pitcher plants, especially upright pitchers, may even find too much food, and topple over from the weight of the insects! If this starts to happen, stick a cotton ball in the mouth of the pitcher until it's had time to digest.

, All Sarracenia go through an annual dormancy period. Growth will stop, and some or all of the traps will brown and die. This is triggered by colder temperatures and shorter days. It usually lasts at least 3 months.


Indoor plants may not go dormant on their own. Trigger dormancy in late autumn by moving them to a cold garage or basement. In some cases, if no other option is available, you can place them in the fridge for the required time.

, During this period, the plants require considerably less water. Allow them to partially dry out before topping up the water. Stop feeding completely until the spring. Never add fertilizer to a dormant plant.

, Before new growth appears in spring, usually in February or March, trim away the dead, brown traps. Apart from aesthetic reasons, this reduces the chance of mold and insects. For upright species, including flava and alata, trim the traps right down to the rhizome, so the rhizome can photosynthesize.


For best results, look up your individual species or hybrid to check for different pruning requirements.
Some species have traps that can last up to two years, including psittacina, purperea, rosea, and some of their hybrids. There may be a second die-off in late summer, which also requires trimming.

, Most Saracenia are pretty forgiving when it comes to temperature, and will usually survive outdoor winters in zones 5-9, even if covered in snow. Consider bringing them indoors if temperature drops below -6.7ºC (+20ºF), or during an early or late frost. Species native to Florida or Gulf of Mexico, including psittacina and rosea, should be taken indoors if the temperature drops below freezing.


Plants can withstand low temperatures more effectively if protected from wind and kept near the house, rather than on an exposed deck or open area.
Keep indoor plants dormant by storing them in an unheated garage or shed, with temperatures below 13ºC (55ºF).

Grow a new plant from tissue.",How to Grow a Venus Flytrap," The most common, and easiest, way to start growing a Venus flytrap is to purchase a bulb (or several bulbs) from a company that specializes in growing the plants. Search online to find a vendor from which you can mail order bulbs. You'll be able to choose from among several varieties that have differences in shape and color.You may also be able to find a nursery in your area that sells Venus flytrap bulbs.


While it's less common, you can certainly grow a Venus flytrap from seed as well - bearing in mind that it could take up to 5 years for the seed to become a mature plant.Order seeds online and germinate them in deep pots filled with a seed substrate composed of sphagnum moss. Place the pots in plastic bags to keep the environment warm and moist. Once the seedlings have sprouted, you can transplant them to a more permanent growing medium.;
, Since Venus flytraps require high humidity, a glass growing container is an excellent choice. This is especially true if you live in growing zone 7 or lower, where the winter temperature gets too cold for the Venus flytrap.


If you live in growing zone 7 or lower, consider planting the Venus flytrap in a terrarium. The high sides of the terrarium will keep heat and moisture trapped in, helping the Venus flytrap thrive. Airflow is important, though, so don't plant it in a container with a lid. A fishbowl or another glass container with an opening works well.
A glass pot or a regular clay pot with drainage holes both work fine if you live in a warm climate with mild winters - growing zone 8 or higher.

, This plant naturally grows in very poor soil, and gets most of its nutrients by eating insects and spiders. In order to replicate the plant's natural growing medium, make a mixture of 2/3 sphagnum moss and 1/3 sand. If you plant a Venus flytrap in regular potting soil, it won't thrive. Regular potting soil contains too many nutrients.
Never add lime or fertilizer to a Venus flytrap's growing medium.
If you're using a terrarium, line it with gravel and place the soil mixture on top, so that you can ensure the soil will drain adequately.

, Dig a small hole in the soil and plant the bulb so that the top of the bulb is even with the soil. If you started your Venus flytrap from seed, plant the sprouted seedling so that the bulb is under the soil and the green stems are exposed to the air. After planting the Venus flytrap, providing the right environment and food will help it grow and thrive.

, The Venus flytrap is native to Carolina boglands, where the soil is constantly wet. It's very important that the soil in your Venus flytrap's pot or terrarium be kept moist to mimic its natural habitat. That said, the Venus flytrap should not be kept in standing water; make sure the pot or terrarium drains well so that the plant doesn't rot.

, Tap water is usually too alkaline-heavy or contains too many minerals to use to water a Venus flytrap.An easy way to get enough water to keep conditions moist and humid is collecting rainwater for this specific purpose. Set out a container to catch the rain and store it up so you'll have some on hand whenever you need it. Otherwise, you can buy distilled water by the gallon in most grocery stores.

, During the warmer months, you can keep it either outside (as long as the temperature doesn't dip too low at night) or place it in the window in the sun. Take care to water the Venus flytrap consistently so that the sun doesn't dry out the soil, especially during the summer.


If your Venus flytrap is in a glass terrarium, make sure it doesn't get burned in the sun. If the plant looks like it's wilting a little, take it out of the sunlight after a few hours every day.
If you'd rather not worry about making sure it gets enough sun, you can also grow Venus flytraps using a fluorescent grow lamp. Just make sure to keep the lamp 4 to 7 inches away from the plant. Turn on the grow lamp so that it provides a regular day's worth of light, and make sure to turn it off at night.
If the leaves of the Venus flytrap aren't rosy pink, it's probably not getting enough sun.

, Venus flytraps have a natural dormancy period during the winter season. It usually lasts from September or October through February or March - the natural winter of the Carolinas. During this time, the Venus flytrap should be kept at a temperature of 35 to 50 °F (2 to 10 °C), with less sunlight than it receives during the summer months.


If you live in growing zone 8 or below, you can keep the Venus flytrap outside all winter, as long as temperatures rarely drop below freezing.
Expose the plant to light and warmth slowly at the spring equinox.
If you live in a place with a colder winter, it's necessary to take the Venus flytrap inside. Keep it in the garage, shed or unheated greenhouse where it will receive protection from frost but still get sunlight and be exposed to cold enough temperatures to facilitate a dormancy period., If you keep your Venus flytrap outside, it will catch spiders and insects on its own (unless your outdoor environment is unnaturally sterile). When you see the leaves in a clasped position, the Venus flytrap has probably caught something.

, If you want to feed the Venus flytrap - either because you're keeping it indoors or you just want to experience the excitement of watching it eat - you can use mealworms, insects or spiders that are small enough to fit in the leaf traps. Place the food inside one of the traps or release it inside the terrarium. The trap will close when the tiny hairs inside are triggered by the insect's movements.


It's best to feed a Venus flytrap live bugs. The plant won’t close unless it senses movement, so feeding the plant dead bugs is not a good idea.You can purchase live or dead insects from a pet store, but you could also try catching your own. For smaller Venus flytraps, black flies are a good size. For larger traps, you could try small crickets.
Venus flytraps can go months without eating, but if you're keeping yours indoors you should plan to feed it about once a month for best results., Once the Venus flytrap closes over its food, it takes at least 12 hours to digest its meal. Digestive enzymes break down the soft inner fluids of the insect or spider, leaving the exoskeleton intact. After about 12 hours, the trap will open and the empty exoskeleton will blow or wash away.


If a small stone or another indigestible object ends up in the trap, it will release the object after 12 hours.

, You might be tempted to give the Venus flytrap a piece of ham or chicken,however,the plant does not have the right enzymes to digest animal meat. Feeding it anything besides spiders or insects could cause it to rot and die.

, Be sure to repot in a mixture of sphagnum moss and sand. You can repot the plant at any time, except when the plant is flowering.

, Pinch off the smaller flower stalks and keep a strong stalk with many heads. Let the flower stem grow high above the rest of the plant. This way the insects that pollinate the flowers won't get caught in the traps. Each flower will produce a seed pod.


If you choose to cut off the stalk instead of allowing the plant flower, stick the stalk in the ground to encourage it to grow.

, After a few years, when your Venus flytrap has matured, you can propagate it by planting the seeds it produces. Break open the seed pod to find the tiny black seeds. These seeds can be stored for up to a year in an airtight container in your refrigerator. Plant them in sphagnum moss, and keep them warm and moist until they sprout.Make sure that you keep the seeds moist by misting them several times a day.
Expose the seeds to light for 13 hours per day as well.
The seeds will germinate in anywhere from 5 to 30 days.
After the seeds germinate, plant them on top of some peat moss or moss mixed with sand.
Keep the planted seeds in a terrarium with a humid environment and a temperature of 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Since the plants can grow from rhizomes, you could also try planting a leaf pinched off at the base to see if it sprouts. If conditions are right, the leaf will die and a tiny new plant will begin to grow.


Find a healthy leaf that is outside of the rhizome and gently tug it downward.
Trim off the top of the leaf and place it in good soil.
Give it lots of water and light. It will take about two months to grow.

, This method will produce man plants quickly, but it is an advanced method that involves growing the plant in a petri dish, so only attempt it if you are comfortable with this technique.

Sterilize the tissue and the container with alcohol.
Place the sterilized tissue in a nutrient and vitamin enriched mixture, and leave it be until leaf growth starts. This can take anywhere from 8 to 16 weeks.
Move the plant to the standard growing medium.

Oyster mushrooms grow best in straw or coffee grounds (described later); Shiitakes grow best on hardwood sawdust; button mushrooms grow best in composted manure. These different substrates reflect the different nutritional needs of each species; however, each of these three species can be grown readily enough in sawdust or straw. Make sure that if you use sawdust it is from untreated wood.
Choosing a type of mushroom to grow is a matter of taste. You should grow the type you most want to eat.;
, Mushroom spawn is sawdust permeated with mushroom mycelia — essentially the root structure of the fungus. It is used much like plant seedlings to facilitate growth.


You can purchase high-quality mushroom spawn from several online retailers, some gardening supply stores, or some specialty organic living stores.
Make sure to buy spawn rather than spores. Some retailers will also sell spores, which are more akin to the seeds of plants (rather than seedlings). Growing mushrooms from spores takes more time and practice, and is best suited for a seasoned mushroom grower.

, If you are growing mushrooms in straw or sawdust, it will be necessary to sterilize these growing mediums before inoculating with the spawn. This is done to kill off any micro-organisms that could compete with the mycelia.









To sterilize the substrate, place it in a microwave-safe bowl and add enough water to make the straw or sawdust damp. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat on high for two minutes, or until the water has boiled off.
This kills off any microorganisms, leaving the substrate safe to receive the mushroom mycelia. You may need to work in batches in order to sterilize all of the straw or sawdust.

, The mycelia in your mushroom spawn need to spread into the substrate thoroughly before producing mushrooms. A warm temperature encourages this growth.









After choosing the substrate best suited to your mushroom species, place a few handfuls of it into a baking pan. A shallow pan with a large surface area will provide the most room for your mushrooms to grow.
Mix the spawn into the substrate with a sterilized utensil. Place the baking pan on a heating pad set to 70°F (21°C). This is the ideal temperature to encourage growth. You can also try simply placing the pan in a warm area of your home.
Leave the setup in a dark environment, such as a cabinet, for about three weeks. This will allow the mushroom mycelia to permeate the substrate., After two weeks, check the substrate to see if it has been fully colonized — the substrate should be entirely covered with what looks like white fuzz. This may take between two to four weeks. If the substrate is colonized, you can move the pan into an environment that is dark and cool (about 55°F or 13°C). A basement usually works well for this, but a cabinet or drawer in an unheated room will work in winter.









If you notice any dark spots of green or brown (like what you might see on moldy bread), remove these areas from your substrate and throw them out.
Cover the substrate with a handful of potting soil and spray the entire mixture with enough water to dampen it thoroughly. You can place a damp towel over the pan to prevent moisture loss if desired.
Consider placing a low heat lamp near the pan. This simulates the sun, which can help the mushrooms orient themselves and grow ""up,"" making them easier to harvest.
The mix should be kept moist and cool as the mushrooms grow. Check it periodically and spray it with water as necessary.
The mushrooms will prefer a cooler environment, but the key is just not to let them get too hot. If the environment is below 70°F (21°C), then your mushrooms should grow fine.

, In about three weeks, you should see small mushrooms appearing. Continue to keep their environment moist, cool, and dark to encourage their growth.









When the mushroom caps separate fully from their stems, they are ready to harvest. You can pluck the mushrooms out with your fingers, but this risks damaging the newly developing fungi beneath the surface. Instead, use a sharp knife to cut the mushrooms at the base of the stem.
It is best to rinse the mushrooms before cooking or eating. You can store harvested mushrooms in a paper bag in the refrigerator for up to a week.

, Growing mushrooms from coffee grounds is a fun project which helps to use up coffee grounds that would otherwise go to waste. Coffee grounds are a fantastic growing medium for mushrooms (oyster mushrooms in particular) as they are already sterilized thanks to the coffee brewing process and are full of nutrients.


For 500 g (17.6 oz) of mushroom spawn, you will need 2.5 kg (88 oz) of fresh coffee grounds. The best way to get this amount of fresh coffee grounds (brewed that day) is to go to a cafe and ask nicely. They're usually more than happy to give it away.

, The best thing to use is a filter patch grow bag, which can usually be purchased along with the mushroom spawn. Otherwise you can use a large, sealable freezer bag or a sterilized milk carton or ice cream tub, with four small holes poked into the sides.

, Wash your hands thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap, then mix the mushroom spawn into the coffee grounds, breaking them up with your hands to ensure that they are evenly distributed. Place the inoculated coffee grinds into the plastic bag or container and seal tightly.








, Place the bag or container in a warm, dark location, somewhere between 64 and 77°F (18 to 25°C), like in an airing cupboard or under the sink. Leave it here for two to four weeks or until it turns entirely white — this due to the mycelia colonizing the coffee grinds.









Again, cut out any dark spots of green or brown that develop on the colonizing substrate, as this can make you sick.

, Once the bag or container's contents have turned completely white, move it to a bright area (but not into direct sunlight) and cut a 2"" by 2"" hole at the top. Mist the contents of the container with water twice daily to prevent it from drying out — the mushrooms won't grow in too-dry conditions.








, Over the next five to seven days, tiny mushrooms will begin to sprout. Continue to mist them with water and they should double in size each day. When the cups of the mushrooms have started to turn slightly upwards, they are ready to harvest.








When the mushrooms have stopped sprouting, plant the coffee grinds outdoors under bark mulch or compost and new mushrooms may develop, depending on the weather.

, For first-time growers, growing mushrooms from a ready-made kit can be a fun, easy option for producing your own mushrooms. These kits usually consist of plastic bags filled with sterilized, inoculated straw or soil. All you need to do keep the bag in the correct conditions and in seven to 10 days you'll have homegrown mushrooms.


Kits will usually cost between $20 and $30 and can be used to grow most of the common mushroom varieties such as white button, crimini, portobello, lion's mane, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms.
To begin the growing process, simply open the bag and place it in a bright location, out of direct sunlight — such as a shade windowsill. The kit can be kept at room temperature, but it will need to be misted with water daily to keep humidity high. Some kits will provide plastic tents to cover the bag and maintain humidity levels.
The mushrooms will start to sprout after seven to ten days, but you can expect to see two or three flushes of growth over a three month period.
The great thing about these kits is that after they have finished producing mushrooms, you can bury them outdoors under bark mulch or in your compost pile. Then, depending on weather conditions, mushrooms may start to pop up in that spot., Another interesting way to grow certain species of mushrooms — such as Reishi, Maitake, Lion's Mane, Shiitake, Pearl and Phoenix Oyster — is from a log. This is done by inoculating hardwood logs with birch plugs that have been fully colonized by mushroom mycelium. These plugs are available online and from specialist mushroom spore suppliers.









The first thing you need to do is find an appropriate log for mushroom growing. The logs should be cut from non-aromatic hardwood trees, such as maple, poplar, oak and elm. They should be 3 or 4 feet (0.9 or 1.2 m) in length and no more than 14"" in diameter. The logs should be cut at least two weeks before plugging, to allow the tree's naturally-formed anti-fungal properties to degrade.
To colonize a 3 to 4 foot (0.9 to 1.2 m) log, you will need approximately 50 plugs. To insert the plugs, use a 5/16"" drill bit to make 2"" deep holes in a diamond pattern over the entire log. The holes should be spaced about 4"" apart. Place the birch plugs into the holes and tap with a hammer to insert fully.
If you plan on leaving the logs outdoors you may need to seal the holes with cheese wax or beeswax to protect the plugs from insects and harsh weather. If you plan on keeping the log indoors, in a garage or basement, this usually isn't necessary.
Over time, the mushroom mycelium will spread from the birch plugs throughout the log, until the entire piece of wood has been colonized. Once fully colonized, mushrooms will begin to sprout from cracks in the log. This typically takes between 9 to 12 months, but depending on temperature and humidity conditions, the mushrooms should return year after year."

Maintain the pitcher plant's well-being.",How to Grow Pitcher Plants," Carnivorous pitcher plants can be found all over the world, so the requirements to grow them vary according to the region from which they are sourced. Read a few quality books on the subject to give you a solid understanding of the plants and their needs. A brief overview of the different types of pitcher plants follows:



Nepenthes, tropical pitcher plants, monkey cups - There are about 120 species in the Nepenthes genus and they grow in the Old World tropics (mostly in the Malay archipelago). Most of these species will require high humidity, lots of water, and moderate to high light levels (similar to orchids).These are not ideal ""beginner"" plants.Sarraceniaceae - This family of pitcher plants grow in the New World and can be broken down into three genera (groups of species):


Sarracenia - All of these species grow in North America. They require require a distinct summer and winter, strong, direct sunlight, and lots of water.

Darlingtonia - These species are limited to Oregon and northern California and are difficult to grow. The roots need to be kept cooler than the rest of the plant because they grow in environments with cold running water.

Heliamphora - All of these species are native to South America. They are also difficult to cultivate.



Cephalotus - There's only one species in this genus (Cephalotus follicularis) and it can be grown like any subtropical plant.

Bromeliaceae - This is the same family that contains pineapples. One or two species in this family are believed to be carnivorous. They don't form the characteristic pitcher shape.;
, Once you've decided which species you're best prepared to grow, start looking for a source. Your best bet is to find a reputable greenhouse and purchase a healthy pitcher plant from there. Ask the assistants for additional tips on growing that particular species.


It's also possible to order pitcher plants online, but they can get damaged and die during shipping.
Although it's possible to grow pitcher plants from seeds or cuttings, this is not advised for beginners.

, Ideal temperatures range between 60ºF to 85ºF (15.5ºC to 29.6ºC). The beautiful coloring of the pitcher plant will be much more intense if the plant receives at least a couple hours of bright, full sunlight each day, but will also grow reasonably well in partial shade. Most people grow pitcher plants in a greenhouse environment or in a terrarium.You can make an inexpensive version using a saucer and a soda bottle; cut off the top of the bottle and place upside down over the plant on a saucer.The garden will only be suitable where it replicates the exact environment where pitcher plants grow naturally.


Inadequate lighting is a common cause of killing pitcher plants in the homegrown environment. If you don't have a greenhouse or humid, sunny space for the plants, consider using artificial lighting. Illuminating with several cool or warm white fluorescent bulbs placed 12"" (30 cm) from the plant will assist.Only place hardier pitcher plants in a windowsill, and even then, only if you have adequate sunshine and humidity. While bathrooms are wonderfully humid, their windows are usually too dark to provide the amount of light required by the pitcher plant.Hardier pitcher plants include sundews, bladderworts, and butterworts. A Venus flytrap probably won't like being situated on a windowsill.Air-conditioning makes the room too dry for pitcher plants.

, During travel, the fluid already present in the cups sometimes falls out, and if the cups dry out, the plant could die.

, A good soil is one composed of a one to one mixture of peat moss and perlite or combine Sphagnum moss, charcoal and orchid bark. The type of soil and the ratios, however, should be researched very carefully for the type of pitcher plant you have. If your pitcher plant doesn't like the soil, it won't thrive and will die. Don't use potting mix or fertilizers – pitcher plants are primed for poor soil and rich soil will be an overload.

, A drained pot should sit in 1 inch (2.5 cm) of standing water. Don't let the plants dry out completely. Make sure the water you use is either rainwater or distilled, with low levels of salts. Aerating the water before watering the plant can help the plant grow. To aerate the water, fill a container half full with water, seal it, and shake it vigorously.

, Pitcher plants can tolerate low humidity, but they usually stop making pitchers if the humidity is inadequate. About 35 percent humidity is fine for the plants. Greenhouses and terrariums can provide the needed humidity, but be sure to provide the proper ventilation so the air does not overheat or become stagnant.

, If the pitcher plants are growing somewhere without access to insects for an extended period of time, you can add a few small insects, such as a fly, or a cockroach, to a mature plant. However, this is usually not needed. Many types benefit from adding a small amount of a balanced soluble fertilizer to the pitcher (e.g. Miracid mixed 1/8 teaspoon per quart of water). Add this solution only to the pitchers until they are 3/4 filled., Besides watering, humidity, and feeding, keeping the pitcher plant in good shape requires that you ensure it has room to grow and is protected:


Clip off all the dead leaves with scissors when the winter dormant period begins. Their dormant period varies by species, but is normally about 3-5 months during the winter. During this time, they should be kept cool and drier than normal.
Protect outdoor pitcher plants. Leave any developing pitchers in the pot or provide thick mulch of leaves and cover with plastic or a container in hardiness zones six to eight during the winter months when left outside.
Divide and re-pot the plant when the pitcher comes out of dormancy before rapid growth for new plants and begin the cycle over again. Pitcher plants can live for several years if cared for properly.

All you need to do to grow mushrooms is to prepare these spawn in a proper growing medium, keep them in a humid, dark location, and wait.


If you're going to commit to growing mushrooms, make sure to select a variety that you'll like to eat a lot of.

Consider the humble button mushroom. It goes by many names: crimini, button mushroom, white mushroom, table mushroom, but the agaricus bisporus is one of the most popular, versatile, and delicious mushrooms you can grow. Hearty enough to grill but delicate enough for salads and sautées, you can't go wrong with the button.






Mushrooms sold as cremini and portobellos (both agaricus bisporus) are essentially white button mushrooms that have been discarded because they lacked the salable whiteness. More recently, as tastes have changed, these once-discarded mushrooms have become more popular, even though they are essentially the same variety. The portobello mushroom is simply an agaricus bisporus allowed to mature slightly, until the cap opens up and plumps.


Grow some wine caps. Not as common as the portobello, but similar in texture, flavor, and heartiness, the wine cap stropharia rugosoannulata is a beautiful brownish-red mushroom with a bright white stalk.Just as versatile as the button varieties, the wine cap could be a change of pace in your kitchen. Impress your friends at a dinner party with this seldom-used mushroom plucked straight from your garden.






Grow shiitakes. Cultivated for its nutritional properties (shiitake has proven tumor-reducing effects) this Japanese variety is translated ""oak mushroom."" Grown on logs, the delicious and rich caps of the shiitake mushroom are perfect for soups and stews, as well as a killer mushroom risotto. The stems are somewhat tough to chew when cooked, but are still very useful for flavoring broth.Try out some oyster mushrooms. A popular mushroom to pick, the pleurotus ostreatus is commonly known as the oyster mushroom because of its delicate briny taste and oyster-like appearance.Grown on logs like the shiitake, the oyster mushroom is easy to grow and even easier to eat.







;
, Styrofoam coolers, plastic terrariums, or even old grow-trays covered with enough wet newspaper can be used to grow mushrooms in the right environment.


If you've got a dark basement in which to grow your mushrooms, you don't necessarily need a growing chamber with a lid. Use or build some 6-inch deep trays to grow your mushrooms in.
Use an old fishtank or a plastic storage bin for growing mushrooms in drier climates, or if you don't have a basement in which to grow your mushrooms and need to regulate the temperature more readily.

, You can buy your own pre-mixed beds to grow mushrooms, or make your own. Materials as diverse as manure, rye meal, vermiculite, and sawdust are used successfully for growing different varieties of edible mushrooms, but the basic mix will need to include compost and wood chips.


The medium is very important, because mushrooms--unlike plants--can't manufacture their own nutrients and need an appropriate mix of sugars, starches, cellulose, and nitrogen. The kind of substrate you'll want to create for growing your mushrooms depends on the variety you want to grow:
A manure-based compost is most appropriate for button varieties. Straw-rich horse manure, aged to the proper pH is appropriate. Many large-scale growers find it easier to make compost from corn fodder, straw, peat moss, tankage, and greensand instead.To prepare a fruiting substrate for morel spawn, mix together 80% small hardwood chips, 10% rice hulls, 5% soybean meal, and 5% sphagnum, then add a little lime to adjust the pH to 7.1 to 7.3. Next, combine 5 parts of this mixture with 2 parts sand and 3 parts potting soil and mix well., Plant your spawn about two inches deep in your substrate, several inches spaced from your other plantings.


Alternatively, you can sprinkle your growing chamber with your spawn and cover with compost.

, Placing the container in a heated room or in direct sunlight may be used to regulate the heat. It will take about 3 weeks for the roots to spread into the medium.


You want to check for the thin, white thread-like mycelium, which serve as the root base of the mushrooms. When you see this spiderweb-like formation happening, place the container in a darkened room or basement, so that the temperature is reduce to 60 degrees Fahrenheit or 16 degrees Celsius, and cover the spawn with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of regular potting soil.

, Do this regularly. A wet cloth is also useful for keeping the mushroom and soil damp. If you are keeping the container in a heated indoor space, then spraying everyday is necessary.

, During this time, keep an eye out for any problems. You may need to start over if you notice pin-prick dots of black fungus, or if your substrates is over-saturated and slimy. Remove the cloth that your mushroom spawn came in once mushrooms begin to poke out of the soil.

, The mushrooms are ready to be picked when the ""veil"" connecting the cap to the step of the mushroom is lifted. As soon as you see this happen, the mushrooms are at their optimum ripeness and deliciousness. Pick them.


Don't pull them up from the substrate and risk knocking loose other mushrooms. Hold them firmly and twist them out, or use a small knife to cut them off near the base.
Picking the mushrooms regularly is important--don't wait. Keeping the ripe mushrooms out of the way allows the flush to continue spreading, leading to a fruitful harvest.

, You can buy pre-inoculated logs directly from spawn suppliers, or start with ordinary fresh-cut logs with the bark intact. Oak is ideal, but you can also use other hardwood such as hard maple, hornbeam, ironwood, or sweet gum.Regardless of your choice, the logs should be about 4 feet (1.2 m) long and 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) in diameter. If you use your own logs, you'll also need ""plug spawn,"" or cylinders of mushroom spawn specifically for growing in logs. Oyster mushrooms and shiitake are two varieties commonly sold as plug spawn.


For best results, cut the logs in late winter or spring. The wood is richer in sugars at this time, so the mushrooms have more to feed on., If you are starting with your own logs, inoculate them within three weeks of cutting to stop the growth of undesirable organisms:

If the wood is unusually dry due to a drought or a long storage period after felling (more than one or two months), soak the logs in clean water for a day or two, then let dry completely.Gently clean off all moss, lichens, and other organisms that could compete with your mushrooms.
Drill a diamond-shaped pattern of 3–8 inch (7.6–20.3 cm) holes in each log. Use a 5/16th inch (7.9 mm) drill bit and make each hole deep enough to insert the plug spawn.

, Tap the plug spawn fully into each hole with a hammer, or use the inoculating tool included in some types of plug spawn kits. Knock off any protruding excess spawn, then cover the holes with a thin layer of beeswax or cheese wax to protect the spawn from pests. The wax should be heated just hot enough to melt, but no hotter, to avoid starting a fire., Avoid wind and sun. You can purchase fruiting blankets to cover the logs with, or find a location with about 60% shade-cover to allow your logs time to fruit. A location near a building or evergreen trees is ideal, since they provide shade year round.

, It's important to keep the logs about 50% saturated with water so the spawn can establish itself.For best results, set up a misting system or sprinkler for light misting over a long period of time. You can instead spray heavily with a hose (or rain) for two to three hours twice a week instead, but this may be less reliable.

, Once you see white mycelium reach the ends of the log, start checking regularly for fruiting (the formation of tiny mushroom ""pins"" that will grow to full size). Stop watering once this happens unless you experience very hot, dry weather. Fruiting takes anywhere from five to twelve months for shiitake mushrooms. Oyster mushrooms may be ready in much less time, but all mushrooms require at least one warm season before fruiting.If you let the fruiting happen naturally, most or all of your mushrooms will be ready in spring and fall. Commercial growers often practice ""forced fruiting"" in summer and winter, soaking the logs and controlling temperature and humidity for year-round production.Forced fruiting is more difficult and labor-intensive.

, When you see the veil of the mushroom lift away from the stem, it's time to harvest your oysters and your shiitakes. Twist them off or cut them with a knife.You can let the mushrooms grow larger before harvesting, but this will reduce the overall number of harvested mushrooms per log., After this rest period, your logs will be ready for new spawn., You don't need to soak the mushrooms or wash them considerably to get them ready to cook. Use a paper towel to brush any dirt or stray particulate from the mushrooms and trim off the stem ends. Discard the stems of shiitakes completely, or save them for making stocks or stews.Some people disagree on the proper method of cleaning mushrooms. You can get them wet, and getting them wet won't ruin the mushrooms, especially if you're eating them right away, but you don't need to. Make sure there's no large dirty spots on them, and they're fine to eat.

, One of the most simple and delicious ways to prepare and eat your fresh mushrooms is by cooking them quickly in butter and oil and and letting them chill overnight to gain flavor. For this recipe, you'll need:


A pound of fresh mushrooms, any variety, chopped into quarters or halves
a tablespoon of butter
three tablespoons of olive oil
half an onion, chopped (or shallots, if you prefer)
two cloves of garlic, chopped
half cup of dry red wine
a handful of chopped green herbs, like oregano, thyme, or parsley
salt and pepper to taste
Heat the butter and a tiny amount of olive oil in a pan on medium-high heat until the butter bubbles. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent.
Add the mushrooms. Do not stir for a minute or two until you hear them start to sizzle. That means the water is being released. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and toss them to coat them with the garlic and onions. Continue browning the mushrooms.
Add more oil as the liquid cooks off and deglaze the pan with the red wine. Let some of the liquid cook off and add the chopped herbs and seasoning to taste. You can eat it now for a delicious side dish or transfer it to a container to chill overnight.

, Mushrooms and eggs go together well, combining a meaty and substantial substitute to pork. It's perfectly simple and complex at the same time.

, Cooking mushrooms are versatile and delicious any way you prepare them. Use your imagination and try different combinations. You can make:


Mushroom risotto
Mushroom pizza
Mushroom soup
Mushroom stroganoff
Stuffed mushrooms

, If you end up with several pounds of fresh mushrooms, it may be difficult to use them all at once. Consider investing in a food dehydrator to keep your kitchen well stocked with your own produce well into the year.

Make your own mushroom spawn.",How to Grow Mushrooms," Oyster mushrooms are the easiest to grow, and a great choice for novices. To get started, buy them online, in a home gardening store, or in a homebrew supply store in the form of ""spawn"": spores or root-like mycelium stored in sawdust, grain, or agar. You can buy the spawn alone or as part of a complete oyster mushroom kit.Any oyster mushroom variety will work, but blue grey oysters and pink oysters are especially easy and quick to grow.Growing outdoors? ""Plug spawn"" is a slow but even easier alternative. Just drill holes in the side of a newly fallen hardwood log (avoid “softwood” or pine because they will inhibit the growth of fungus), insert the plugs, and wait for damp weather.;
, If your kit came with a large bag of straw, that's a ready-to-go substrate, or material that provides nutrients and a place to grow. If you only have a small container of mushroom spawn, you'll need to make your own substrate, and heat it so only beneficial microbes can grow. Here are two ways to make a substrate:
Cardboard:Best for spawn in sawdust1. Cut corrugated cardboard into pieces of equal size, a few inches square.
2. Put the cardboard in a bucket and weigh it down with a heavy object.
3. Add boiling water to submerge the cardboard.
4. Cover with lid and let cool for eight hours.
5. Wash hands with antibacterial soap.
6. Squeeze out as much water as you can.

Straw:Best for spawn in grain1. Choose a cereal straw such as wheat or rye.
2. Cut into 3–4 inch lengths (7.5–10cm) using a shredder or a weed whacker in a garbage can.
3. Tie in a pillowcase or nylon mesh laundry bag.
Submerge in pot of water on stovetop.
4. Heat at 160–170ºF (70–75ºC) for one hour.
5. Drain well and let cool to below 80ºF (27ºC)., This is called ""inoculation."" To minimize competition from other spores, wash your hands first and inoculate as soon as the substrate is ready:










Mushroom kit with included substrate: Sterilize a syringe and inject spawn into the grow bag through the small hole, or into the tray of substrate at several points.

Cardboard substrate: Stack the cardboard squares inside a food-grade plastic bag. Sprinkle a little spawn between each layer as you stack. (Break up the spawn by hand if it's in a solid clump.)Homemade straw substrate: Wipe a table with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Spread the straw out on the table and break up the spawn over it, mixing thoroughly. Transfer to food-grade plastic bags until they are full but not compressed.There's no exact ratio of spawn to substrate, but you can start with a mix that is 2 or 3% spawn by weight. Adding more spawn helps the colony grow faster and resist contamination., Tie the top of the plastic bag closed. Punch holes into the sides of the bag every 3 inches or so (7.5 cm), plus a few more in the base to allow for water drainage. The mushrooms need ventilation to grow quickly and reliably, or carbon dioxide build-up will prevent fruiting.








Most bags included in mushroom kits already have holes, or an air filter system that makes holes unnecessary.

, Now the spawn is ready to colonize the substrate with mycelium. Most strains do this best at temperatures between 60º and 75ºF (16–24ºC).Even small variations in temperature can decrease mushroom yield or encourage contamination, so try to find a room that stays at this temperature 24 hours a day.Mycelium can grow at any light level except direct sunlight. Some growers find they get better results with low light on a daylight cycle (real or simulated). However, if you are using straw, too much light can cause grain to sprout and interfere with mushroom growth.The ideal temperature depends on the strain. If your spawn came with instructions for a growing environment, follow them.

, It takes two to five weeks for the white, feathery ""roots"" called mycelium to spread throughout the substrate. During this time, all you need to do is check on the moisture level every few days. If the substrate feels dry to the touch, mist it through the holes in the bag. If you see standing water inside the bag, poke more drainage holes in the base.








Mycelium is white. If you see large patches of another color, mold has contaminated the bag.Throw the bag away and wipe the area down with isopropyl alcohol before trying again.

, Once the mycelium has formed a thick mat inside the bag, it is ready to fruit (produce mushrooms). The fungus has different needs for this stage, so move it to a new location and follow these instructions:









Mushrooms will not fruit without light. Provide at least enough to read by during daylight hours.Use indirect daylight, a grow light that mimics daylight, or (less effective but cheaper) a cool white bulb.The fungus needs fresh air to clear out carbon dioxide, which prevents fruiting or leads to small mushrooms. Open the top of the bag and ventilate the area with a light cross breeze.
Lower the temperature, ideally to 55–61ºF (13–16ºC). Increase humidity to at least 80%, ideally to 90–95%, by running a humidifier or hanging plastic sheets around the grow bag.This part doesn't have to be perfect, but other conditions can affect the yield, shape, and color of your mushrooms., Over- and under-watering are common problems at this stage. To prevent drying without soaking the mushrooms, lightly spray the inner walls of the bag once or twice a day.








If the growing mushrooms turn brown, or new mushrooms start to grow on an older mushroom's surface, the substrate is probably too dry.If the caps of the mushrooms feel clammy or sticky, the substrate is probably too wet., Mushrooms start as tiny ""pins,"" then grow rapidly over the next few days if conditions are right. Once they have reached full size, press down on the substrate with one hand, then use the other to twist the stalk off at the base.You may eat them immediately or dry them for later use.









If you're not sure what a fully developed oyster mushroom looks like, wait until the edges of the first mushroom go wavy. This is slightly past optimal harvesting point, but still edible. Pick the other mushrooms just before they reach the size of the first.Tiny, aborted mushrooms are common in some strains. Leave them in place without picking them.

, Most spawn is good for at least two fruitings, and some will continue growing for three or four months. Keep the substrate lightly moist and continue picking mushrooms until they stop appearing.








, The basic process for growing oyster mushrooms works for most mushroom species, but you will need to make adjustments. When you buy spawn, check the instructions or ask the seller for the following information so you can adjust your approach:


Preferred substrate (some species need a specially prepared compost)
Ideal temperature during colonization
Ideal temperature and humidity levels during fruiting (mushroom growth)Lion's mane, lingzhi, shiitake, enoki, and nameko mushrooms are all good choices for a second project, only a bit more difficult than oyster mushrooms., If mold or other contaminants take over your substrate, that batch of mushrooms will be unusable. Most mushroom species are not as resistant to contamination as oyster mushrooms are, so it pays to spend more effort keeping the area clean:


Wash your hands with antibacterial soap before handling any part of the operation.
Take special care to pasteurize your substrate. If stovetop heating becomes impractical, look into a steam room or chemical treatment.
Treating a compost substrate is complex, and may require help from an experienced grower., ""Casing"" is a layer of sterile material on top of a tray of substrate, usually a mixture of peat moss and ground limestone. Keep the casing moist so water gradually leaches through to the substrate, without making the substrate soggy.Not all types of spawn need casing. Ask the seller or an experienced grower for advice.
Do not ventilate the area until the tiny ""pins"" have appeared on the surface of the casing. Ventilating too early will trigger fruiting before the pins have broken through, growing mushrooms underneath the casing.

, Tracking and controlling temperature and humidity will improve your mushroom harvests, and help you improve your setup with each attempt. If you get serious about a mushroom growing hobby, prepare a room with fans or an air duct for ventilation, plus a heating system and








Temperature can vary significantly between the ceiling and floor of a room. If you're growing on multiple shelves, put a thermometer at each level.Strong drafts can be fatal to some mushroom types. Protect the spawn from direct wind.

, If you plan on growing more mushrooms in the same room, pasteurize your substrate again to get rid of mold and bacteria that might contaminate the room. With a compost substrate, this can take 8–24 hours of steaming at around 150ºF (70ºC). Although the substrate is low in nutrients for mushrooms, you can use it as garden compost or mulch for newly planted lawns.








Spent substrate has a high concentration of salt, which some plants are sensitive to. Leaving it outdoors to ""weather"" for six months should remove this problem.

, Instead of buying spawn each time, you could grow your own from spores. This is a difficult and complicated task, but there are many free resources that can guide you. (Try contacting a mycological association in your area). One way to create a spawn culture is to make a spore print. Transfer the spores to a petri dish of agar using an inoculation loop, as described here (though you do not need to draw a T pattern). Repeat with several petri dishes, since some may fail to germinate.A mostly sterile environment is a necessity for making spawn. Before you begin, remove all rugs and curtains that could trap dust. Clean all surfaces with mild disinfectant, including the ceiling. Cover all openings with plastic sheeting, and make an ""antechamber"" at the entrance with a second layer of plastic."

Use a selective broadleaf killer.,
Try a spot treatment.,
Be careful with area applications of non-selective herbicides.,
Add a spreader sticker product to the herbicide.,
Apply herbicides more than once.,
Dig out established wild violets by the root.,
Pull out young wild violets.,
Improve soil drainage.,
Keep the lawn mowed and properly cared for.,
Thin out tree limbs and similar obstructions.,
Spread mulch in problem areas.,
Switch to an adapted turfgrass cultivar.If your lawn is too damaged to save, your best bet might be to dig everything up and sow fresh turf grass seeds in its place


Select a turf grass cultivar that has been adapted for use in your specific region and climate.",How to Control Wild Violets," For best results, select an herbicide containing either 2,4-D or Dicamba. One containing Quinclorac may also work well against wild violets.These herbicides are formulated to kill broadleaf plants, like wild violets, while leaving most grasses unharmed. As such, they can be applied to the wild violets in your lawn without damaging the lawn itself.
You will need enough of your chosen herbicide to fill an herbicide sprayer. Follow the instructions on the label of the product to determine how to safely mix and apply the chemical.
Regardless of the ingredients in the herbicide, you should always check the label to verify that it will only kill broadleaf plants and not thin-leaf plants (like grass). Make sure that the weed killer is formulated to do exactly what you need it to do before you apply it.;
, When the problem is relatively minor, you can apply a spot treatment directly to each individual violet.


Buy a spot treatment herbicide in a small spray bottle and follow the label instructions to safely apply enough of the chemical to the base of each flower.
Some of the best herbicides for this use are glyphosate and triclopyr. The former will also kill grass, but the latter will not affect most grass species., Only use an area application of non-selective herbicide if there are no other plants you wish to preserve in the area.


As the title suggests, non-selective herbicides do not pick and choose which plants they kill. Everything the chemical touches will suffer and die, including grasses and other flowers.
Glyphosate is an herbicide chemical that is especially effective for use against wild violets and many other plants.
Follow the label instructions carefully and apply the weed killer using an herbicide sprayer.

, Spreader-sticker products make herbicides more effective by helping the chemical cling to the surfaces of the plant better.


This is especially helpful when you are trying to control wild violets since the leaves of these plants have a very waxy surface.
Mix the spreader-sticker into the herbicide before you apply the herbicide. Follow the instructions that come with the spreader-sticker product when determining the best way to do this.

, Wild violets are very resilient, so you'll need to apply your chosen herbicide multiple times before the plants die off.


Try applying the herbicide once or twice a week, or as directed in the manufacturer's instructions.
Note that herbicide treatments are often most effective during the fall since these chemicals have an easier time navigating down to the taproot. During the spring and summer, herbicides tend to cling primarily to the leaf tissue without impacting the root. As a result, the violets grow back.

, Mature violets have a tendency to break when you pull them, leaving the root behind and making it possible for the flower to regrow. Digging each violet out is a much more effective option.


Use a spade or digging fork and start digging toward the flower from about 1 foot (30 cm) away from the visible center of the plant. This loosens the soil around the plant.When you can get beneath the weed, use your digging tool to lift the weed from underneath. Get as many root pieces as possible to reduce the likelihood of the violet growing back.

, Young violets are less likely to break when you pull then, so if digging isn't an option, pulling might still be worth consideration.


Wear thick leather gardening gloves to protect your hands as you pull the violets.
Plan on pulling the weeds when the soil is moist. If you're going through a dry spell, moisten the area with a garden hose or watering can before proceeding.
Grasp the main stem of each violet as close to the soil line as possible, then yank the flower straight up.
If the violets are breaking off at the crown when you yank them, insert a kitchen fork or garden fork beneath the root and pry it up as you pull.

, Wild violets tend to thrive in shady, moist soils. If the soil in your garden or lawn does not drain well, taking steps to improve its drainage abilities can help the rest of your vegetation grow while restricting the growth of violets.


You can improve the drainage of heavy soil in your garden by mixing in coarse organic material like sawdust or sand. For clay soils, try mixing in gypsum.
There are multiple ways to improve soil drainage in your yard, but one of the simplest is to use a hollow tine aerator to remove plugs of soil throughout the surface of the lawn. Removing plugs of soil can help loosen the remaining soil, allowing water to flow through and drain more readily.

, Weeds like wild violets are less likely to grow in a lawn when the lawn itself is healthy. Mow the grass on a regular basis and take other precautions to ensure optimal growth.


The height requirements for grass varieties can vary based on variety and cultivar, but as a general rule, grass should be kept between 2.5 and 3.5 inches (6.35 and 8.89 cm) in cool weather and 1.5 to 2.5 inches (3.81 to 6.35 cm) in the warm season. Mow your lawn every five days during the growing season.
If you're currently undergoing a dry spell, water the lawn with a garden hose to prevent it from drying out and dying off.
Consider applying a general purpose lawn fertilizer during the spring or summer to give your grass an added boost.

, Prune any unnecessary tree branches and overgrown shrubs. Doing so will make it easier for more light to reach the lawn.


Sunlight strengthens your grass. Grass needs at least four hours of sunlight on a daily basis to survive.
On the other hand, violets do best in light shade and can become weakened in bright sunlight.
Clearing debris out of your lawn or removing any unused sheds can also reduce the amount of shade and help control your violet problem.

, After removing an initial spread of wild violets, cover the area with 2 or 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of wood chip mulch.Mulch will suffocate most weeds, including violets, making it more difficult for them to grow back as a result.
It should also be easier to remove any violets that do pop up from the loose mulch than it is to remove them from compacted soil.
An application of mulch can be used regardless of whether you removed the initial spread of violets by hand or by chemical.
Note that mulch should only be used when you are trying to control violets in a flower bed. Do not mulch a lawn since doing so can weaken the grass.

, Such cultivars are more likely to thrive when planted, and a thriving, healthy lawn is less likely to have problems with violets and other weeds.
In areas where grass cannot grow due to lack of sunlight, you can still restrict the growth of violets by planting ground-covers and shrubs that do well in shade.

Buy organic mushroom spawn.,
Choose a good log.,
Inoculate the logs within two weeks.,
Drill holes in the logs.,
Drill holes in a diamond pattern.,
Insert the plugs into the holes.,
Seal the holes.,
Store the logs.,
Check continually.,
Harvest quickly.,
Spur activity after the first harvest.",How to Grow Organic Mushrooms1," Mushroom spawn is specially harvested and grown fungal tissue that can be used to grow mushrooms. For the log method, select spawn in the plug form, which is basically spawn contained inside short wooden dowels.


You can buy mushroom spawn at many garden stores or online. To grow organic mushrooms, you may have better luck shopping at online shops that specialize in organic mushroom spawn.;
, The wood should be taken from a hardwood tree, like oak or sugar maple. If cutting a branch or log from your own tree, make the cut sometime during late fall to mid spring for ideal moisture conditions and select a portion that is 3 to 8 inches (7.6 to 20.3 cm) in width. Each log should be 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 meters) long.


If you do not have trees on your property that you can take wood from, buy logs from sawmills or home improvement stores.

, The longer you wait to use your logs, the more you risk having the wood rot. Moreover, logs that have rested for too long can sometimes react poorly to inoculation and may grow inedible fungus, rather than edible mushrooms.

, The spawn plugs should come with instructions about how big the holes should be, but for many plugs, you should use a 5/16 inch (7.9 mm) drill bit.

, Keep a margin of 2 inches (5 cm) at the top and bottom of the logs. The top and bottom of each diamond should be between 6 and 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) apart and the sides of the diamonds should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Make as many diamonds as you can fit, or as many diamonds as you have plugs for.

, The package should come with instructions, but essentially, you just need to fit the plugs into each hole.

, Heat organic beeswax in a double boiler until it becomes pliable. Remove the wax from the heat and spread a little wax over the top of each plug.

, Store your logs outside, in a location that receives partial sun and partial shade. The logs should be stored vertically, leaning against one another or against another object.

, The mushrooms can take 8 to 16 months to appear.

, After mushrooms emerge, you only have about one week to harvest them before they go bad. You can either pluck the mushroom by twisting and pulling it up, or you can cut the mushroom at the point where the stem meets the log.

, Allow a vertical log to topple over and slam on the ground horizontally. Doing this is said to spur activity and encourage further growth in logs that have already produced mushrooms in the past.

Add the spawn to the coffee grounds.,
Mix the spawn into the grounds.,
Continue filling the bucket with grounds and spawn.,
Cover the bucket with plastic wrap.,
Spray the top of the grounds with water.,
Monitor the coffee grounds.,
Pick the mushrooms quickly.",How to Grow Organic Mushrooms2," To grow organic mushrooms, you should use grounds from organic coffee beans. Keep the coffee grounds fresh and free of mold as you collect them by storing the grounds in a sealed plastic container in the freezer. Thaw the grounds out to room temperature 24 hours before using them.


If you do not drink coffee, or do not drink enough to collect the grounds, go to a local coffee shop that sells organic coffee and ask if they would be willing to sell you the grounds.

, The bucket should only be filled about halfway.

, Dry grounds will not work well. Add a little bit of water to the grounds, just enough to moisten them, and drain out any excess.

, For this method, spawn that comes in the form of sawdust mix works better than spawn plugs. You can usually find this spawn at garden supply stores or at online specialty shops.

, Break it up by crumbling the spawn in your hands and sprinkle it over the surface of the grounds.

, Use your hands to gently stir the spawn/sawdust mix into the moistened coffee grounds until the thoroughly combined. Use your hands to gently pat the surface, compressing the spores into the grounds.

, There should only be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty space in between the surface of the mixture and the rim of the bucket.


If you do not have enough grounds and spawn to fill the bucket, drill a few holes into the side of the bucket, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the surface of the grounds and spawn.

, The plastic wrap helps the mixture retain moisture. Puncture the wrap, poking several hold in it, to prevent the build up of carbon dioxide.

, The grounds should be misted twice a day. You can spray the mushrooms through the holes in the plastic wrap, or you can remove the wrap temporarily as you spray and replace it when you are finished.

, Mushrooms should begin to grow within one or two weeks.

, You only have about one week to harvest fully mature mushrooms before they go bad. Snip them off at the point where they come out from the surface, or twist and pluck them by hand.

Cut your gladiolus when they are already partially open.,
Use a heavy case to counter the weight of the flowers.,
Place the vase somewhere safe and cool.",How to Cut Gladiolus1," It is best to cut gladiolus at the point when one or two flowers are already open (the lower ones will open first).


It’s always best to cut flowers in the morning when the air is cool and the plant hydrated.






Use a sharp blade to give a clean cut.
Avoid using scissors or a blunt tool, as this will crush the cells and they won’t take up water very well, shortening the cut flower's life span.
Immediately put the base of the stem into a container of water until you can arrange them in a vase.;
, Gladiolus flowers arrange themselves nicely in a vase and look good by themselves or with other flowers. Be wary, because the cut flower stem is tall and heavy and can tip over a lightweight vase.


It’s best to use a heavy vase or one with a heavy base.
A big earthenware jug works well.
You can try adding a weight to the vase, such as the weights from your kitchen scales, to help add weight to the base of your vase and stabilize it.
Make sure the vase is at least 2/3 full of water as this will also provide stability.
Whatever container you use should be very clean.

, For safety's sake, don’t put the vase somewhere it will cause damage if it tips over, and try to arrange the flowers in a balanced way so the weight is not all along one side of the vase.


To keep your gladiolus flowers alive as long as possible, keep the vase in a cool environment.
It should be placed away from sources of heat and direct sunlight.
Don’t put the vase near a TV or other electrical equipment as these also emit heat.
Remember, gladiolus vases can be prone to tipping over!

Feed your gladiolus to keep them healthy.,
Deadhead your gladiolus to improve their appearance.,
Deadhead your gladiolus when they are wilting.,
Cut your plant off at the base when it's completely done flowering.,
Leave some foliage on the plant to preserve its energy.,
Water and mulch your gladiolus during dry periods.,
Protect your gladiolus from the winter.",How to Cut Gladiolus2," Many people recommend adding cut flower feed, or half a crushed aspirin, to your vase water to give the flower additional nutrients.


Change the water every 2-3 days.
Pinch off the flowers as they fade away, including the swelling at the base of the flower where it attaches to the stem.
This will encourage the next flowers on the stem to open.

, ‘Deadheading’ is a garden chore that involves removing the spent or withered flower heads from a flowering plant after the blooms are past their best.


This can improve the plant’s appearance by removing unsightly spent blooms from the plant.
This is especially true for gladiolus, as the new flowers form on the same stalk as the old ones.
Removing the spent flowers presents the new ones better on the stalk.

, Gladiolus should be inspected about twice a week so you can keep up with deadheading the spent flowers.


Remove each flower as it begins to wilt; don’t delay until the seed head begins to form.
To deadhead your gladiolus, only remove the individual bloom from the flower stalk not the entire stalk, unless no new flowers remain on it.
You can easily just pinch off the spent blooms with your fingers.
Take care to remove not just the shriveled petals but also the swollen bit at the base of the dead flower, where it connects onto the main flower stem.

This is the bit that forms the seed.



, Once every flower is spent on your gladiolus stalk, take a pair of garden shears or secateurs and cut it off at the base, close to the main body of the plant near the ground.


Refrain from cutting back any foliage at this point.

, It’s important to leave the foliage on the plant to die away naturally because this helps the plant gather the energy it needs to return the following year and bloom again.


Once the foliage turns yellow and dies away, it’s okay to trim it back.
This indicates the plant has taken all the energy it needs.

, The plants will appreciate watering and mulching, as this keeps moisture in the soil.


Try putting a 3 or 4 inch (7.6 or 10.2 cm) layer of well-rotted manure or some leaf mold around the base of the plant.
This will also keep weeds down and help protect the plant if you are leaving it outside over winter.

, Gladiolus can survive outdoors in zones 7-8, but will need winter protection.


To do this put down a nice pile of hay or straw over the plant in the fall after the foliage has died back.






Gladiolus will need winter protection in colder climates than this.
You can lift the Gladiolus corms over the coldest months and store in sand or peat in a cool dry place where the temperature remains above freezing.
Then plant them out again in the next spring once the frosts are over.

Use a sharp blade to cut your pansies.,
Make the cut.,
Keep your flowers healthy after they have been cut.,
Consider making centerpieces out of your cut pansies.",How to Cut from a Pansy Plant1," When cutting from any plant, you should try to use a clean, sharp blade. Sharp blades give a cleaner cut that can help to keep your pansy from becoming infected with a plant disease. If you have hard-stemmed pansies, try to use a sturdy gardening tool, such as a pair of gardening shears.


For weak-stemmed pansies, you can use a pair of sharp scissors to make cuts, as the stems of these types of pansies are easier to cut without damaging the plant.





;
, To cut pansy flowers, make the cut when the flower head is just opening up. Try to cut your flowers early in the morning when possible, as this is when the flowers will be the freshest. To cut the flower:


Use a sharp blade, as described in the previous step, to cut the stem to about a quarter of an inch above the next leaf set, below the leaf set that you are removing with the stem. A leaf set is a pair of leaves growing along a stem. Many people like to keep at least one leaf set on the stem of their cut flower.







, Pick out a short vase to accommodate the pansies’ short stems. Fill the vase with clean, cold water. Make sure that the vase is about two-thirds full of the water. Place the cut pansy flowers into the vase.


Change the water in the vase every other day to make your cut pansies last as long as possible.







, Because of the pansies short stems, people do not often think of them as vase flowers, even though they do just fine in a vase. While keeping pansies alive in a vase is covered in the previous step, you can also make beautiful centerpieces with the cut flowers. To do this:


Fill a bowl with cold water. Cut the pansy stems off so that you only have the flower heads (or blooms) left. Float the flower heads in the water.






While flower heads tend to wilt faster than regular cut flowers, they will make a very pretty centerpiece for a couple of days.

Cut your pansies to keep them healthy.,
Cut away diseased parts of the plant.,
Help your pansies survive very cold winters with some mulch.,
Look for new growth after you have cut your pansies back.",How to Cut from a Pansy Plant2," Cut your pansy stems back to about two inches in height. Try to make the cut about a quarter of an inch above the leaf set closest to this two-inch length.


You can compost the cut foliage unless it appears mildewed or otherwise diseased. Dig out and discard any plants that show signs of disease. This will be covered more fully in the next step.







, Try to remove all yellowing, diseased or withered foliage to improve the plant’s appearance and hopefully stop the spread of disease. Any plants where disease can’t be contained should be dug up and thrown away to prevent them from infecting others.


As mentioned previously, avoid composting diseased plant matter as the compost can infect other plants.







, Some gardeners in milder climates will see their pansies survive the winter to re-bloom in the springtime without the help of mulch. If you live in a very cold climate, diligently protecting and mulching your plants can help them survive the coldest months. Some gardeners protect plants with straw or a cover of evergreen tree branches to help them survive the winter.


If successful, the pansies should bloom again in the early spring.







, New growth should hopefully begin to appear on your pansy plant and it should bloom again until the first frost arrives.

Understand why a pansy might become too ‘leggy’.,
Determine how long you would like your pansy stems to be.,
Consider cutting back the whole ‘leggy’ plant.",How to Cut from a Pansy Plant3," Pansies are generally a low-growing plant and fairly compact. However, if they are grown in the shade, they are more likely to grow tall and become a bit ‘leggy’. If your pansies are too ‘leggy’ they can look straggly and flop over, which generally doesn’t look as good, particularly if the flowers become hidden.


Your pansy plant can also become leggy if they are fed too often, so try to stick to monthly fertilizing treatments.







, To deal with a leggy pansy stem, consider the length you would prefer the stem to be. Once you’ve determined the length you would like, find the nearest leaf set to your desired length. Cut back to about a quarter of an inch above the leaf set.


For most pansy varieties you can aim to cut the leggy parts of the plant back to about four inches of stem length (or the leaf set closest to this height).







, If the whole plant is leggy, you may want to cut the whole stem back to a stem length of about four inches. Try to make the cut just above the leaf set closest to this four-inch length.


When the plant grows back, it should grow back more compactly.

Help your pansies to behave more like perennials if so desired.,
Make sure to water and fertilize your pansies each month.,
’Deadhead’ your pansies.,
Help your pansy to flourish, even in a hot climate.",How to Cut from a Pansy Plant4," Although most gardeners treat pansies as annuals (plants that only live for one year) these plants actually have a slightly longer lifespan than that. To get your pansies to behave more like perennials than annuals:


Plant them in a sunny spot. Although pansies prefer a cooler temperature, they like direct sunlight. Your plant is more likely to produce larger and more plentiful flowers if it gets the full sun it loves.






Consider the soil where you are planting your pansies.These plants aren’t especially particular about soil type but, like most plants, they prefer a well-draining, rich soil.







, An all-purpose water-soluble feed is a good choice for pansy fertilizer. You’ll also want to keep your plants well supplied with water during dry periods.


To know when to water your plants, check to see how dry the ground around them is. You should water your plants when the soil is dry to the touch.







, Like most flowering plants, removing dead flower heads and emerging seed heads can help to prolong the flowering period. ‘Deadhead’ withered flower heads by snipping the stem away just above the next leaf set. Remember to use a clean sharp blade to do this.


Remove seed pods as they develop. Seed production draws energy away from flower production so you’ll get more flowers if you remove the seed pods.







, Hot weather may cause your pansy to look lackluster. If you’re in a warm climate and expect a hot summer, move your pansy into a cooler location out of the sun, if you can, for the next few months.

,
Consider blooming times when planning your garden.,
Consider flower use.",How to Choose Flowers for a Garden," Use a can of white spray paint to mark off the areas, and observe them over a week to 10 days to make sure they are accurately marked.


You will need this information when choosing garden flowers so that taller flowers do not cut off the sun from the lower growing plants.;
, Make a scale drawing of your garden, marking off the sections and indicating the sun density of each.

, Check their space requirements and compare that with your scale drawing to see how many flowers you can fit in a plot.

, It can be as simple as choosing 1 or more colors and staying in those color families, or you can plan out a color riot with small patches of every color imaginable scattered around.


One very pretty look is planting a color gradient by choosing 1 color, such as red. Plant the palest pink flowers in front and gradually darken the rows until you have deep red flowers, such as climbing roses, trained on trellises in the very back.







, Every gardening catalog includes zone maps and appropriate growing zones for every plant they sell.

,, Try to have a good mixture of blooming dates to ensure color all season long.

, Do you want a cutting garden to fill vases inside your home or maybe some lovely scented flowers to permeate the air? A cutting garden should have long stemmed flowers which will grow tall, so plan for that when plotting the flower garden. Scented flowers are nice beneath a window where their aroma can waft into your home.

Choose repellent plants.,
Pick plants that attract good insects.,
Make sure that companion plants thrive in similar conditions.,
Avoid using invasive plants.",How to Choose Companion Plants for Roses1," There are some plants that give off scents that destructive bugs do not like. One of the most well-known of this type of plant is marigolds. Marigolds are known to keep a variety of pests away, including whiteflies and bad nematodes.If you have a specific problem pest that is hounding your roses, then try planting a repellent plant for that insect close to your roses. For example, if you have spider mites attacking your roses, try planting dill or coriander close by.The scented foliage of some herbs helps repel insects. Herbs, such as lavender, thyme, and sage, are great companion plants for roses.;
, While some plants repel bad insects, plants can also be used to attract good insects, such as pollinators. Attract good insects, such as the ladybug and praying mantis, by planting certain plants near your roses. Plants that attract good insects include many beautiful bloomers, such as zinnias and dahlias.Many herbs attract beneficial insects, which will keep rose pests in check. For example, dill and coriander can attract lady bugs., Roses like rich, well-drained soil with lots of organic matter. They also need full sun.If you are going to plant companion plants for roses, they need to do well in these conditions also.


Roses need at least 4 to 6 hours of sun every day and they also need well balanced soil. A pH of 6 to 7 is best.Some plants that enjoy these same conditions include ground covers, such as antennaria and bearberry.There are also many flowers that enjoy these conditions, including: New England aster, red columbine, and false indigo., Even if a plant will keep pests at bay and enjoys the same conditions as your roses, that doesn't mean it will automatically be a great help to your roses. Invasive plants, such as mint and lemon balm, can take over an area and spread uncontrollably.Invasive plants do more damage, and create more work, than they are worth. Be sure to do research about whether plants spread before planting them next to your roses.

Use plants that flower at different times of year.,
Pick plants with differing colors.,
Pick plants that add contrasting shapes.",How to Choose Companion Plants for Roses2," If you are doing companion planting to improve the look of your garden, you should think about what time of year certain plants bloom. If you know that your roses bloom at the beginning of summer, try planting some plants around them that bloom in the spring and at the end of summer.


Planting plants that bloom at different times of year will keep your garden fun and interesting for more of the year.
Planting flowers that bloom at different times of the year is especially important if you are growing roses that are not ever-blooming. For roses that only bloom in the spring, try planting annual flowers beneath them, such as marigolds and pansies. This will give you more color throughout the summer., Adding a variety of colors to your garden will make it look dramatic and interesting. You can use companion plants to bring these different and complementary colors to your garden. For example, if your roses are all light pink, consider planting something nearby that has a drastically different color, such as blooms that are blue.You can even pick color schemes for different times of the year. If your roses are one color, such as pink, you could choose reds for spring and oranges for fall. This can be done with marigolds, zinnias, or even lilies. The change of color will add seasonal excitement.Your can bring different colors into your garden with blooms and with the foliage of companion plants. Some plants that have differing foliage colors and textures that work well in the same beds as roses include hostas, lamb's ear, and coleus., In addition to adding additional colors to your beds, companion plants can add interesting and complementary shapes. This could be the shapes of individual leaves or the shapes of the plants overall.


When using contrasting shaped plants you can use plants that enhance the look of the rose. There are some plants that can mask the weaker aspects of the rose, such as their sparse bottoms. For instance, lavender, catmint, lady’s mantle, and dianthus can all be great planted around roses."

Put tropical flowers in water immediately upon taking them home.,
Cut the stems and remove foliage.,
Fill a vase two-thirds full of cold water.,
Keep the flowers at a temperature as close to 50–55 °F (10–13 °C) as possible.,
Change the water in the vase every 2 or 3 days.",How to Care for Tropical Flowers1," If you receive tropical flowers as a gift or buy them from a florist, you should immediately unpack them and put them in water. Don’t delay doing this or you will significantly reduce their lifespan.;
, Before you place the tropical flowers in water, cut the bottom third of an inch off the stems using a clean sharp knife. The freshly cut stems will absorb water more easily.Cut the stems at a 45 degree angle, as this maximizes the amount of plant cell in contact with water.
Remove any foliage that will sit below the waterline, as this will rot underwater and reduce the life of the flowers.

, It’s advisable to add cut flower food to the vase water if you have some. Sometimes the flower food will be supplied with the flowers.

, 50–55 °F (10–13 °C) is the ideal temperature for tropical flowers, but unfortunately this temperature can be difficult to achieve, as it will be cooler than the room temperature of your house but warmer than the refrigerator.


The best compromise is probably to move the flowers to a cool, north-facing window ledge during the day, then putting them into the coldest room in the house overnight – a cold garage or cellar might work.

, Some florists will spray tropical flowers with a special anti-transpirant to prevent water loss, however that’s probably a step too far for the normal householder.

Plant your tulips in the fall, about 6 to 8 weeks before winter.,
Choose an area that receives some shade.,
Choose sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6 to 6.5.,

Dig up the bulbs of annuals.,
Know if your tulip is likely to come back.",How to Care for Tulips," Tulip bulbs are best planted in September or October in the northern climates and October or November in the southern climates. The warmer your climate, the later they should be planted. The soil should be below 60°F (15°C).You can keep tulip bulbs in your refrigerator (or some other cool, dry location) for about 2 months before planting season if you buy them in summer. However, do not store them next to apples, as they give off ethylene, destroying the bulb.
Most bulbs need 12-14 weeks of a ""cold period"" to bring about beautiful bulbs come spring.Do not buy bulbs after December 1st unless they've been ""pre-cooled."";
, It should be sunny at least part of the day where you plant your tulips. In places like the American southeast, plant them in a place that gets morning sun only.Tulips want sun, but they also want cool soil – don't give them sun that'll scorch them.


If you're farther north, sun all day may be fine (the soil will be naturally cool enough). But if you live further south where it's hotter, shade in the afternoon will be better to keep the soil cooler., There is no sub-species of tulip that prefers excessive moisture. The soil should be well-drained, neutral to slightly acidic, fertile, and even sandy.Wet soil is death to a tulip. Never purposefully go out of your way to water your tulips – all you can do is ensure drainage by adding shredded pine bark or even sand to the area.

, Before planting the tulip bulbs, use a planting fork or tiller to loosen the soil. Dig down in the soil 12 inches (30.5 cm) to 15 inches (38.1 cm). Then, mix 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 4 inches (10.2 cm) of compost into the soil., The bigger the bulb, the deeper your hole should be. It should be 12 inches (30.5 cm) to 15 inches (38.1 cm) deep. Loosen the soil to ensure drainage or create a raised bed.


The bigger the bulb, the bigger the bloom will be, too.If you live in a very warm climate, you may wish to keep the bulbs in your fridge for the first 4-6 weeks to simulate cold weather. Give it a light watering every couple of weeks to retain a bit of moisture.

, They need about 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) of their own soil to grow sufficiently, otherwise they encroach on each other's nutrients. Choose a plot size that allows each of your tulips its own ""home turf.""


Plant each bulb pointy end up. Fill the hole back with soil and press the dirt into place firmly.
Tulips rapidly multiply. Even if you only plant a few, in a couple of years, you'll have a whole family., After planting your tulip bulbs, cover them with chopped leaves, wood chips or mulch. If you have rodents or animals in your garden that you're worried about, you may need to erect a cage or fence around the bulbs. You may also consider putting thorny leaves or gravel in with the soil to deter pests.


Use a 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) layer of mulch, leaves, or wood chips to protect the bulbs, control weeds and retain moisture.
If you're planting perennials, you'll need to feed them every year to start them going again. You can use organic material, compost, or a balanced time-release bulb food every fall to start the process going.

, Right after planting, the tulips do actually need watering to trigger growth. This will likely be one of the few times you actually have to water them.


Do not water them again until you see leaves. Then, you can give them a light sprinkling and that's it., If it hasn't rained in a few weeks in your area, give your tulips a dusting of water. This will be one of the rare occasions when you should step in and get some moisture into the soil.


Tulips often need less water during the spring due to lots of rain and moisture. Most of the time, the weather will take care of this plant for you. Normal rainfall is all they need., If there has been an excess of rain in your area, drain out any extra water from the area if you can. Tulips can't stand having wet feet and drenched soil may mean a swift goodbye to your lovely flowers. You may even consider adding some shredded bark or sand to the area around your tulips to help keep them dry.


If you notice that the area you planted your tulips in collects water, you'll likely be better off moving the plant to a drier area. Dig them up taking the surrounding soil with you and find an area that rain falls on, but can drain out of.

, Fertilize your tulips once at the beginning of Fall and once in the beginning of spring for continuous growth. A balanced liquid fertilizer works well about three to four weeks after planting. This is especially important for perennials.


Sprinkle or pour about one tablespoon of flower or plant fertilizer around each tulip bulb. This will last them for their entire ""hibernation"" period in the winter. Tulips are great at storing nutrients for long periods of time.
Did you forget to fertilize in the fall? You can use a fast-release nitrogen fertilizer on developing leaves.Tulips are pretty easy in the scheme of things. If you're dealing with annuals, they may not need fertilizer at all. In the right climate, you can plant your tulip and essentially forget about it, no watering or fertilization necessary.

, Blight (or Tulip Fire) creates brown specks on the leaves and turns the flower grey in color. If any of your bulbs are diseased, dig them up and throw them away to prevent it spreading to other tulips. If only part of the plant is damaged, cut it off to see if you can salvage the plant.The only thing you can do to prevent disease is to adequately care for your tulips. You can only make sure they get a modicum of moisture, a little bit of shade, and are planted in decent, slightly acidic soil.
Aphids can be a problem, but they're easily handled with water spray.

, Tulips produce seeds once they begin to wilt, and these seeds weaken the bulb, making it unattractive. This practice of deadheading is best for perennials and annuals.Here's how it's done:


Take shears and cut off the flower head from the stem once it's fully spent.
Leave most of the stem in place for about six weeks or until the foliage starts to yellow.
Shear off the leaves at ground level and dispose of the spent plant matter once the six weeks is up. Mark the location, if desired, so you can find the bulbs later.
However, don't do this with species tulips. You want them to reproduce with their seeds and turn into an entire colony.

, Some tulips are annuals, meaning their entire life takes place over the course of one year &dash; they and their offspring won't be coming back. Once all the tulips have bloomed and died, dispose of the entire plant from bulb to tip.Many farmers and gardening enthusiasts prefer annuals when it comes to tulips. They're easy to grow, cheap, and when the year is done, that's it. They can grow more for the next year and experiment with different varieties if they so choose.

, If you're dealing with a perennial, you've left the bulb in the ground, and you cared for your tulips adequately, you may find that next year you have another crop of beautiful tulips (you may also find that you have too many – tulips reproduce quickly). Here are the varieties that are the most likely to come back with practically no effort from you:""Olympic Flame"" Tulip
""Peppermint Stick"" Tulip

Regulate the temperature in your home.,
Keep your tropical flowers out of direct sunlight.,
Learn how to water tropical flowers correctly.,
Increase the humidity levels in your home.,
Make sure there is good air circulation around the flowers.,
Feed your tropical flowers regularly.,
Learn how to care for specific tropical flowers.",How to Care for Tropical Flowers2," It's easier to grow tropical flowers indoors than outdoors, as you can regulate the temperature inside your home. It’s important for some tropical flowers to have a cooler nighttime than daytime temperature, so ease off on the heating overnight or move the plant to a cooler spot overnight - such as a conservatory

, Tropical flowers usually prefer a bright environment that is not in direct sunlight. A window ledge that does not receive direct sun is ideal.

, The best way to water potted tropical flowers is to water from the top, until water drains out the bottom of the pot. Don’t let the plant sit in a saucer of water.


Many tropical plants will prefer to dry out between waterings. For example, flowers such as orchids and bromeliads will tolerate drought but won’t appreciate their roots sitting in water.

, Tropical plants would ideally like more humidity than the typical home can provide. This is a particular problem over the winter months when central heating systems dry out the air in the home.


A simple way to improve local humidity is to put a layer of pebbles into a deep tray. Add water to the tray until it comes halfway up the pebbles, then put the plants on top. The water should not touch the base of the pot, but it will still help to improve humidity around the plant.
You can also help the plant by misting the leaves with water (don’t do this if your plant has hairy leaves). Other ways to improve humidity include buying a humidifier or putting the plants in a terranium.

, Air circulation is important to tropical flowers, so they will do well in a room with a fan. Avoid crowding them together with other plants or jamming them too tightly into a corner as this will impede the flow of air around the flowers.

, Tropical flowers that are growing in a pot will prefer a regular feeding regime. Try feeding fortnightly during their growing season (spring-summer) , then ease off to monthly feeding over the colder months.

, Although these general guidelines will help you to care for most species of pot-grown tropical flowers, it's a good idea to look at specific care instructions for the particular species of flower you wish to grow, for example:


Care for Orchids
Care for Bromeliads
Care for Peace Lillies
Care for Anthurium
Care for Bird of Paradise

Familiarize yourself with the general rules for growing tropical flowers outdoors.,
Decide what to do with your tropical plants over the winter months.,
Learn how to lift and store tubers and bulbs.",How to Care for Tropical Flowers3," As a general rule, garden-based tropical flowers will require sun, a rich, well-drained soil and protection over the winter months.Many tropical plants will also require regular feedings and a thick mulch. They will need to be watered when the soil is dry to the touch.
However, it's also important to be aware of the exact requirements for each species of tropical flower. Some plants, such as caladiums, will require full or partial shade. Others such as canna and bougainvillea will want to be in sun. Banana plants need to be sheltered from strong winds.

, Gardeners have a choice in terms of what to do with tropical garden plants over the colder months. Some treat tropical plants as annuals and let them die back in the winter months to replant again the following year. Others overwinter tropical plants indoors.


Plants such as begonia and orchids will want light and heat, so a heated conservatory attached to your home is ideal.
Other plants, such as hibiscus, bougainvilla and varieties of citrus, will tolerate cooler conditions - such as a greenhouse that does not fall below freezing.

, Plants growing from tubers or bulbs (such as caladium or canna) can be lifted and overwintered indoors for planting outside again in spring. One option is to lift the entire plant and repot in compost-filled container in a warmer location.


Alternately, you can clean the tubers or bulbs off and store in cool, dry and dark conditions such as inside a paper bag with a handful of peat moss.
The bulbs should not be allowed to dry out completely or they will become wrinkled or shriveled. However, it's also important to avoid mold and rot.

Clean or dispose of a fungus-infected plant.",How to Care for Peace Lilies," Peace lilies are native to hot, moist, shady tropical rainforests. Thus, in most temperate climates, they cannot be left outside year-round. However, inside, where it is usually relatively warm and humid compared to the outside environment, the plant can do well. The peace lily should be close to, but not directly under a window in a warm room in your house where it will benefit from indirect sunlight. North or West facing windows are best as these do not allow direct sunlight all day. Try to avoid exposing your plant to cold air or too much sun, as these can cause the plant to become unhealthy and develop brown, shriveled leaves.


Depending on your climate, you may be able to leave your peace lily outdoors for part of the year on a shady patio or similar location when the weather is warm and humid. If you happen to live in a tropical location, however, you can safely leave your plant outside year-round.;
, The best care you can give your peace lily is to water it attentively. When (and only when) the potted soil is dry, add enough water to make it damp, but not so much as to create standing water. Too little water will cause the plant to wilt and die - in fact, if you neglect to water your plant, you should be able to see it visibly droop. However, too much water can cause a condition called root rot which can be fatal to the plant. Aim to water about once per week , when the soil is dry. It is sometimes recommended to even wait until the plant has begun to wilt ever-so-slightly before each watering.

, Peace lilies thrive in the high humidity levels of the tropics, so, in addition to watering the soil, regularly mist your lily with a spray bottle to replicate the humid air of the rain forest. Mist your plant more frequently in the summer growing season- the more water you can supply the blooms, the healthier it will be.

, Compared to certain other plants, peace lilies don't need to be pruned very frequently. However, if, for whatever reason, one or more of your lily's limbs or leaves become brown or wilted, you may want to prune the leaves to keep the plant from wasting energy on the dying appendage. Use cleaned, sharp scissors/pruning shears to remove any unhealthy or dead spots - make your cuts cleanly and near the soil level without damaging healthy tissue.


Wilting and brown leaves can simply be an indication that you forgot to water your plant, but they can also be a symptom of a more serious problem. If you find yourself frequently needing to prune even when caring for your lily properly, look for signs of a more serious problem (see ""Solving Peace Lily Maladies"" below) and seek to cure the root cause.

, Apart from water and indirect sunlight, your plant will not need much maintenance. Fertilizers and nutrient supplements should not be necessary to grow a healthy, thriving peace lily. However, if you desire to do so (for instance, because you want to grow exceptionally large, vibrant blooms), take care so as not to over-fertilize, as peace lilies can be somewhat sensitive plants. Use a standard 20-20-20 house plant fertilizer at one half or one quarter its recommended strength about once per month in the spring and summer, when the plant's growth is most active.


Green blooms are a sign of over-fertilization.If your plant exhibits this symptom, stop fertilizing and cut your fertilizer dose in half next growth season.

, Like nearly all potted plants, if allowed to grow, peace lilies will eventually become too big to comfortably thrive in their original container. When your peace lily becomes too large for its pot, you may notice that it seems to require increasingly frequent watering and/or that its leaves turn yellow for no apparent reason. You may also be able to see its roots crowd the surface of the soil. Generally, peace lilies should be re-potted every 1-2 years, so if it's been about this length of time and you notice some of the above symptoms, your plant is a likely candidate for re-potting.

, When you re-pot a peace lily, you'll obviously want to use a bigger pot than you were using previously so that your plant has additional room to spread its roots and grow. Use a pot about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wider in diameter than the previous pot - a relatively small increase in pot size can give a plant enough room to grow for several years. Generally, peace lily's won't ever require pots larger than about 10 inches (25.4 cm) in diameter, so if your pot is larger than this and the lily is still exhibiting troubling symptoms, there may be another issue.Almost any pot material is fine - ceramic, plastic, and clay all work well.

Make sure your pot has one or more drainage holes on the bottom. It's essential that water be able to drain from the pot - if not, your lily may become at risk for root rot.

, As has been alluded to above, peace lilies are native to tropical rainforests. They typically grow under a thick, multi-tiered forest canopy and thus are nearly constantly surrounded by decaying plant matter. When picking a potting soil, choose one that retains this quality. Use a peat-based potting soil that contains composted bark, along with sand or perlite. Ideally, your soil should be light and springy (to allow proper drainage) and have little to no odor., Prepare your new pot by filling it with enough compacted soil so that your plant sits comfortably on top of it. Ideally, you should only need to add dirt around the sides of the plant, rather than below it or on top of it. Gently pack your soil down so that it will support your plant firmly without sinking downward. Pry or dig your peace lily out of its pot and place it atop the soil in its new pot. Add soil from the original pot around the plant in its new pot - using familiar soil can ease the plant's transition to its new home. Water your plant and add more soil when the water makes the soil in the pot settle. When the transition is complete, the soil in the new pot should be at a level of about 1/2"" to 1"" (1.3 to 2.5 cm) below the rim of the pot.


If you're having difficulty removing your plant from its old pot without breaking or tearing it, water it generously and let it soak for an hour.

, After it is re-potted, your plant's roots won't immediately have a strong hold on its new soil. This can make it difficult to get your plant to stay upright. If you're having a difficult time balancing your plant, use a sturdy wooden stake or dowel to hold the peace lily's stalk up. Bury the stake in the potting soil (taking care not to damage the plant's roots) and use a wire to tie the stalk to the stake. Remove the stake when the plant has established its roots and is able to stand on its own.

, If, rather than moving your plant to a new pot, you'd like to instead grow an entirely new plant in another pot, remove one of the plant's crowns and pot this in the new pot instead of the entire lily. A peace lily's ""crowns"" are clusters of two or more leaves that are separate and distinct from the main part of the plant.


To separate a crown from your main lily, first, remove the entire plant, crowns and all, from its pot. Work from the top of the crown down to the roots, disentangling the roots of the crown from the roots from the main plant. This can take some time and lead to accidental root breakages - this is common, but try to avoid breaking more roots than necessary. When you've completely separated the crown from the main plant, plant it in its own small pot (no bigger than about 6 inches in diameter) as you would do with a normal peace lily.

, One of the most common sources of problems when growing peace lilies is an improper watering regimen. Under-watering and over-watering can cause a variety of non-specific symptoms that sometimes overlap with other peace lily ailments. However, since improper watering is also one of the easiest problems to fix, try attempting these remedies first before moving on to a more drastic solution.


Under-watering should be fairly obvious: dry soil accompanied with wilting, yellowing leaves and a drooping stalk is a dead giveaway. Fix this by watering and misting more regularly - at least once a week for each. Note that plants that outgrow their containers will have a difficult time absorbing the water they need from a typical watering session.
Over-watering can be slightly harder to diagnose, but is often characterized by brown leaf tips. Note that over-watering can lead to root rot, a separate, much more serious condition.

, Root rot is serious condition that can affect any potted plant with roots below the surface and can easily kill the plant. Generally, root rot is caused when a plant suffers from over-watering or poor drainage. If the roots are held in contact with standing water for a prolonged period of time, it becomes difficult for them to get the air that they need to function correctly, and as a result they will literally begin to rot. Certain types of microorganisms called water moulds contribute to the spreading rot, the spores of which can spread root rot to another plant if adequate moisture is present. Root rot is often fatal, but, to attempt to remedy it, immediately remove your lily from its pot and cut off any dead, slimy, or otherwise rotten portions of root. Pot the plant in a new pot with dry soil and proper drainage.


Though root rot infects the plant below the surface, it will cause the plant to visibly begin to die above ground. If your lily seems to become increasingly wilted even with proper sun and frequent watering, root rot is likely the culprit.
Alternatively, as a solution, you may opt to re-pot a lily's crown to another container if its roots are unaffected by rot. The original plant may die, but the second will be a genetic copy of the first.

, Peace lilies are sometimes susceptible to infection by aphids, mites, or other small arthropods. If you notice your lily's leaves begin to wilt or die, especially if accompanied by visible pests, a sticky, slimy discharge, or the presence of white webbing, it's likely that your plant has a pest infestation. Use a strong stream of water to blast the pests off of the plant, then, to make sure they don't return, use a plant-safe insecticide or this homemade recipe for insecticidal soap:


Combine 1 Tbsp. (15 ml) vegetable oil, 3 Tbsp (16 g) cayenne pepper, and 1 Tbsp. (12 g) natural fat-derived soap (not liquid dish soap) in 1 quart (.95 liters) of warm water. Use a spray bottle to give your plant a thorough coating, but not before testing on a small part of the plant and leaving the soap in place for a day to ensure it doesn't cause any damage., Fungus infections can range from harmless to potentially fatal. If you see a white or grey fuzzy growth on the surface of the soil, you don't need to be terribly concerned, as this fungus is not a danger to the plant (though it can irritate some humans, especially those susceptible to allergies). To clear this minor fungal growth, you may want to try sprinkling cinnamon (which has anti-fungal properties) on the fungus.However, if the lily itself develops a dark or black coating on its stalk or leaves for no other apparent reason (frost damage, etc.), your plant likely has a serious fungal infection.


Discarding the entire plant is always a viable option in this case, as fungal spores can be very persistent, remaining in the soil and surrounding area for a significant amount of time, where they can re-infect other plants. However, if you'd like to try to save the plant, carefully remove all the affected areas of the plant and discard them somewhere that they'll pose no danger. (like your garbage). Next, water the plant with compost tea, a natural fungicide, to attempt to kill spores that remain in the soil.

Find the right location.,
Plant the bulbs when you get them.,
Dig a hole.,
Add mulch.,
Fertilize your lilies.,
Water your lilies only as needed.,
Protect from freezing.,
Keep the lilies trimmed.",How to Care for Lilies," Ideally, pick a spot in your garden with good drainage and plenty of sunlight.


To find a good drainage location, find the spot in your garden that dries out the quickest after a pour of rain. If there is no obvious location, plant your lilies on a slope, and let gravity take care of your drainage.
Find a spot that gets sunshine at least half the day. Too long in the shade, and the lilies will reach for the sun, and take on a noticeable lean. A full day's sun is ideal.
Lily leaves can be infested with fungal botrytis if the planting location is less than ideal. While botrytis is great for certain types of wine grapes, it reduces the leaf area used for manufacturing the sugars that will result in healthy new bulbs.;
, Lily bulbs come ready to plant, and lack a papery covering known as a ""tunic"" that keeps bulbs from drying out.


The sooner you plant your bulbs after receiving them, the better they will perform. If you cannot plant them immediately, keep them in a cold, dark place (such as your refrigerator—as long as it's kept above freezing). Do this to keep them from sprouting, for once they do, you'll need to plant them.
Plant them in the fall or early winter to have them bloom in the spring. You can also plant them in the spring, and they will bloom later in the year. The will bloom ""normally"" the following spring.

, Lilies like the sun, but their bulbs prefer to stay cool during the summer. Digging a hole about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15cm) deep, and keep in mind that deeper is better—not only will the bulbs be protected from potentially hot summers, it will also provide good support for the stems.


You can also plant them in a raised bed: plant them at ground level, then put 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15cm) of soil on top of them. This will also promotes good drainage.
Space them properly. If you're planting multiple lilies, give each lily about a 6-inch radius so that they have their own place in the sun.
Loosen the dirt at the bottom of the hole, sprinkle a little bone meal into the bottom, then place the lily bulbs inside and cover with dirt.
Water immediately. This will ensure that damp soil comes in contact with the roots, encouraging growth.

, If you're expecting cold weather, lay a top coating of mulch over the plantings to protect the shoots.


Trumpet lilies are the most vulnerable to frost damage.
Make sure you keep your mulch slug-free! They would love to munch on your emerging lily shoots.

, When they first push up shoots, add a little well-balanced fertilizer. Lilies are fairly hardy, and don't require a lot of fertilizer. In fact, too much nitrogen can result in weak stems, and in hot, wet climates can also result in bulb rot.


For optimal results, select a fertilizer that aids in potato growing.
Fertilize when first sprouting, and again about a month later.

, Lilies generally don't need a lot of water, so only water if required.


Asiatic lilies, Trumpets, and Orienpets flourish in hot, dry climates, as long as they have enough water up to flowering time.
Orientals need watering during the summer, as they do not blossom until August.
Adding mulch in the summer helps keep the bulbs cool, and so lowers the need for additional watering.

, During winter months, cover the lily bed with straw or evergreen boughs to protect the bulbs from freezing.

, During the flowering season, trim the spent blooms, keeping at least 2/3s of the stem intact to keep your strong and healthy for years to come.

Protect seeds from birds and squirrels.,
Harvest the seed head.",How to Care for Sunflowers," Sunflowers range from eighteen foot (5.5 m) stalks to a knee-high cluster of pom-poms. Besides the size and appearance, there are a few other considerations:


The classic, yellow, single-stem sunflower usually grow quickly and easily. Sunrich and Pro Cut are good beginner options.Branching varieties produce many flowers per seed, but most grow more slowly. If you plan to cut the flowers, get a pollen-free or low-pollen variety such as Cherry Rose to avoid a sticky mess.Larger varieties such as Mammoth Gray Stripe and Humongous tend to produce tastier seeds, and can provide support for climbing plants.(Some smaller varieties produce birdseed-quality seeds.);
, You can plant your sunflowers starting in late spring, once the last frost is passed. However, many sunflowers are daylight-sensitive, and may grow leggy and delay flowering if planted at the wrong time. There are three types of varieties:








Short-day: These need long nights to trigger flowering. Plant them toward the end of summer (or start them indoors in mid-spring).
Long-day: These bloom during the middle of summer.
Day-neutral varieties can be planted any time during the growing season.
Plan ahead based on the expected flowering time. Most single-stem sunflowers bloom 60 days after planting from seed, while branched sunflowers bloom after 90 days., Sunflowers grow best in loamy soil with good drainage and neutral pH.More importantly, make sure the area gets at least six hours of full sun a day, and preferably eight or more.If the soil is poor, mix in 3 or 4 inches (7.5–10cm) of compost into the topsoil., Farmers usually plant large, single-stem sunflowers at least an inch (2.5 cm) deep.In home gardens with good quality soil (not too dry or sandy), you can likely plant at ½ inch (1.25 cm) depth instead.








Plant extra seeds if you have the space. You may thin them later, or lose some seeds to pests.

, The further apart you space the seeds, the larger their flowers will grow:


Plant the seeds 6 inches (15 cm) apart for smaller, bouquet-sized flowers, or 9"" (23) cm + for larger blooms.If your sunflower's max height is above 5 ft (1.5m), plant them at least 1 ft (0.3m) apart. Giant varieties may need 2 ft (0.6m) of space.Most branching varieties need 18"" (46 cm) of space., Sunflower seedlings need plenty of water while they're establishing themselves. Keep the soil moist, but not soaked, until the seedlings emerge. This usually happens within 5–10 days of planting, but may take longer in cold weather.Once the seedling emerges, water about 3–4 inches (7.5–10cm) from the plant to encourage root growth.







, Sunflowers do not need fertilizer, and overdoing the nitrogen can create a leggy plant with delayed flowering. If your soil is poor, add slow-release fertilizer to the surface of the soil.This should help strengthen the plant without overdosing it.

, Protecting your plants against slugs and snails is especially important. You can surround your plants with slug repellent from a garden store, or make your own ""beer traps"" for slugs to fall in.

, Downy mildew can be a major problem in clay or waterlogged soils. Check regularly for this fungus, which causes shrunken yellow leaves in addition to its namesake down. If you see these symptoms, reduce water use to keep soil dry, and apply fungicide immediately. Infected plants rarely produce flowers, so you may want to simply remove them to avoid spreading the disease.If the leaves look normal except for a striking yellow bleached color, this is a bacterial infection instead. Keeping soil dry will help here as well, and the plant will usually be fine.
If the leaf looks yellow but still has green veins, the problem is most likely a mineral deficiency. It can be tricky to pinpoint the exact problem, but diluted fertilizer may work.

, Once they've developed a deep taproot, sunflowers are fairly drought-resistant. They'll still thrive on regular, deep watering, especially while buds and flowers are developing, but allow the soil to dry out between watering sessions. Over-watering is more likely to harm them than under-watering.








Try not to get the blooms wet, as this can damage them., Wind can severely damage most multi-branched varieties, as well as any sunflower over 3 ft (0.9m) tall. Tie them to a sturdy support using cloth or other soft material.You may need to put up a wind barrier for extra tall sunflowers.








, At this stage, the flower petals stick up perpendicular to the central disc. Cut them at this point for maximum vase life (usually five days, much longer with some varieties):Cut flowers in the early morning or early evening.
Use a clean knife or shears.
Strip off any leaves that would be below the water line.
Place in water immediately.

, In this case, it's best to wait until the flower is about half open, and the petals are leaning outward.Once cut, there are many ways to preserve them. The simplest is to tie the stems with twine and hang them upside down in a warm room with good ventilation.

, If you'd like to harvest the seeds yourself, you'll have to battle the neighborhood animals. Once the flowers start to droop and lose their petals, cover the head with cheesecloth or a paper bag.Most sunflowers will produce many more seeds if you attract bees to your garden to pollinate them.

, You may cut off the seed head once the disk it rests on starts to turn color from green to yellow. Store in a dry, cool location until the disk turns dark brown. The seeds are now ready to eat, raw or roasted.Store seeds in a cloth bag to allow air to circulate. This helps prevent mold.

Choose a healthy-looking plant.,
Observe the display conditions.,
Check the leaves and soil.,
Examine the true flowers.,
Avoid buying poinsettias which are wrapped in paper or plastic.,
Be careful when bringing the plant home.,
Select a suitable location for the poinsettia.,
Maintain the correct temperature.,
Water the poinsettia when necessary.,
Fertilize your poinsettia after the holidays.,
Commit to caring for your poinsettia.,
Maintain the same watering schedule til April.,
Allow the plant to dry out.,
Cut back the stems.,
Repot the plant if necessary.,
Move the poinsettia outdoors.,
In August, prune the new shoots.,
Move the poinsettia back indoors.,
Follow the correct reflowering procedures.",How to Care for Poinsettias," Healthy poinsettias should have dark green foliage and brightly colored bracts (these are the modified red leaves which look like petals). There should be no signs of wilting or drooping and no fallen or yellowed leaves.;
, The plant should look full and attractive and should not be crowded between other plants, as this can cause premature bract loss. It should stand two and a half times as tall as the diameter of its pot.

, Check the soil for dampness: if it is very wet, but the plant looks wilted, this could be an indication of root rot. Then have a look at the underside of the leaves to check for insects such as aphids and whiteflies. Do not choose a plant whose leaves are spotted and yellow.

, The true flowers of the poinsettia plant can be found at the base of the red colored leaves, or bracts. They should look like small, fresh buds with red or green tips. If there is a layer of yellow pollen covering the flowers, this means that the plant is more mature and will not last as long., It is possible that the plant may have been displayed this way for some time. If this is the case, the leaves may turn yellow and fall off much sooner than expected.

, It is important that you cover or sleeve the poinsettia before you take it home, if outside temperatures are lower than 50 °F (10 °C).


If poinsettias are exposed to low outside temperatures for even a few minutes they can chill or even freeze, causing the leaves to droop and fall off.
The gardening center or store where you purchase your poinsettia should be able to provide you with some form of protective covering for your trip home.
Just make sure to remove the protective covering as soon as you get home, otherwise it could cause damage., Place the poinsettia plant in a location where it receives at least six hours of indirect sunlight each day.


Placing it near a sunny east or west facing window is ideal.
Just don't let the leaves of the plant touch any cold window panes as this can cause them to freeze and fall off., Ideal temperatures for poinsettias don't reach above 70 °F (21 °C) during daytime hours or dip below 65 degrees at night.


This is important in order to maintain the bright red color of the bracts.
You should also avoid exposing the poinsettia to cold drafts, or to dry heat from radiators, appliances or open fires.
Be aware that temperatures below 50 degrees will chill the plant and cause severe damage, while exposure to frost will kill it.

, Poinsettias like moist but not soggy soil, so you should water your poinsettia when the surface of the soil feels dry to the touch. Water the plant until you see water begin to seep through the holes at the bottom of the pot.


After 10 minutes, remove any excess water from the saucer beneath the pot. If the plant is left sitting in water, the soil will become too wet and will not contain enough air, leading to root rot and other diseases.
If the plant is left too long without water, the leaves will begin to droop and wilt. To prevent this, make sure that you check the soil regularly. If the leaves do begin to wilt, water the plant at once, then water it a second time five minutes later.

, Depending on when you purchased your poinsettia plant, it should not be necessary to fertilize it at any point before the holidays, while they are still blooming. You can usually wait until you've had the plant for about 6 to 8 weeks before it becomes necessary to fertilize.


Of course, if you don't plan on keeping the poinsettia there will be no need to fertilize. Many people find that it's easier to just buy a new plant each year, rather than caring for the same one all year round.
However if you do plan on keeping your poinsettia, you should use an all-purpose, water soluble houseplant fertilizer to fertilize the plant in early January. Use according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The fertilizer will held to maintain the plant's green foliage and promote new growth.

, It is possible to hold on to your poinsettia plant and get it to bloom again the following year. However, this will require a yearlong schedule of care which must be strictly observed, otherwise the plant will fail to reflower.

, After the holidays, you can maintain the same watering schedule as before: watering the plant when the soil feels dry to the touch. Continue to fertilize the poinsettia every 6 to 8 weeks using an all-purpose houseplant fertilizer.

, Once April comes, you should stop watering the poinsettia and allow it to gradually dry out. However, you should not allow it to get so dry that the stems begin to shrivel. During this time, store the plant somewhere cool and airy, at a temperature of about 60 °F (16 °C).

, At the end of spring, when the bracts turn a muddy green color, it is time to cut back the stems. Cut them to a length of about 8 inches (20.3 cm), though this will vary slightly with the size and shape of the plant. You can begin watering the plant again at this point, using the same procedures as before.

, If the plant seems to be a bit cramped in its current pot, move it to a new one that's around 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) bigger. Use a commercial potting soil with a high percentage of peat moss. , During the summer months, you can move the poinsettia outdoors (still in its pot). Place it in a lightly shaded area. Continue to regularly water and fertilize the plant.

, Once August comes you can cut or pinch back the new shoots by about an inch, leaving three or four leaves on each. Fertilize again.

, At the beginning of September (or well before the first frost) move the poinsettia back indoors. Place it near a window where it receives plenty of indirect natural light. Continue to water as before, and fertilize every two weeks.

, The poinsettia is a photoperiod plants, which means that its budding and flowering schedule is determined by the amount of daylight it receives. So in order to have the plant blooming at Christmas time, you will need to limit its exposure to light in the months running up to the holidays.


From the 1st of October onwards, keep the poinsettia in complete, uninterrupted darkness for 14 hours a night, from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. Move the plant to a dark room or cover the plant with a box. Be aware that even exposing the plant to artificial lighting can halt or delay the reflowering process.
Remove the plant from the darkness during the day, as it will still need about 6 to 8 hours of daylight. Try to maintain the temperature between 60 and 70 degrees F and continue to water and fertilize the plant as normal.
Follow these procedures for approximately ten weeks until the poinsettia reflowers and the bright red color begins to show on the bracts. Move the poinsettia back to a sunlit area and follow the care procedures described in the previous section!

Pay attention to your climate.,
Ensure your lilacs are planted in well-drained soil.,
Watch out for powdery mildew, which forms a silvery powder on the leaves.",How to Care for Lilacs1," Lilacs usually only need watering in the heat of the summer or in dry climates. If you receive less than one inch of water per week in the summer, water them lightly at that point., They don’t do well in standing water. Add more soil so that water drains away if you find water pooling near the canes., Make a mixture of a half a cup (118ml) of milk and a gallon (3.8l) of water. Spray your leaves thoroughly.

The lactobacillus will colonize the leaves and prevent outbreak of powdery mildew.

"
Apply a layer of compost under and around the base of the plant in early spring.,
Don’t over fertilize your plants.,
Feed them once per year in later winter with a 10-10-10 fertilizer if the soil is poor.,
Consider placing some well-rotted manure and lime near the base of the plant after it flowers.",How to Care for Lilacs2," Add a two to four inch (5 to 10cm) layer of mulch, such as shredded leaves, over the compost to discourage weeds and other plant competition., Unless your soil is extremely poor, they do not need liquid fertilizer at regular intervals., Avoid fertilizing in the spring, since too much nitrogen will keep them from blooming. Compost and manure are preferred sources of nutrients.

10-10-10 fertilizer is 10 percent nitrogen, 10 percent phosphate and 10 percent potash., You should do this at the same time that you prune the bushes."
"
Pay attention to your mature lilac bushes.,
Wait until later spring, after the lilacs bloom, to prune them.,
Prune dead wood first.,
Cut back the tallest canes to eye height next.,
Finish your yearly pruning with the weakest branches.,
Start a different pruning plan if your lilac bushes are overgrown.,
Consider chopping your entire lilac bush down to six to eight inches high if you don’t mind it not flowering for a few years.,
Encourage blooming by cutting spent blooms each year.",How to Care for Lilacs3," If the flower clusters appear smaller this year, then it is probably time to prune., Lilacs bloom on old wood, so removing it too soon will take away your blooms., Cut them all the way to the ground, starting with your oldest canes., Your entire bush should stay near eye level. If it is overgrown, skip these steps and move on to a different pruning strategy, made for old and overgrown bushes., Prune them back to the strongest part of the shoot., This method will ensure your lilacs continue to flower as you try to get them back into shape. Use this three-year plan:

Cut one-third of the oldest lilac canes down to the ground the first year.
Cut half of the remaining old wood down to the ground in year two.
Cut the rest of the old wood down to the ground in year three., Lilacs are hardy, but you should not expect any blooms for two to three years as they recover., Cut them to the end of the flowering stem."

Prepare the soil for planting.,
Dig holes for the hostas.,
Plant the hostas.,
Water your hostas frequently.,
Cut hostas back after the first frost.,
Compost the soil in the spring.,
Divide your hostas after 3 or 4 years.,
Protect your Hostas from pests.",How to Care for Hostas," Hostas do well in partially shady areas, making them a great choice for planting under trees or near taller plants in your garden. They need soil that drains well and will stay evenly moist. The type of hosta you choose should also factor into where you decide to plant it; if your hosta is capable of getting quite tall, make sure you plant it in a place where it will get ample shade from the sun once it grows larger than the plants around it.Since hosta roots crowd out the roots of weeds, they are a good choice for use as a ground cover. If you're going to use them for this purpose, however, you need to be sure the planting site is sufficiently shady.
Make sure the site you choose is not too windy. Choose a place that is sheltered from winds exceeding 35 mph (56 km/h).;
, Planting hostas in the early spring, after the last frost has occurred, gives them time to take root and settle in before the hot summer months arrive.

, Hostas do well in most climates and thrive in most soil, but they're at their best in average or damp soils that are slightly acidic.Prepare the planting site by using a garden rake or hoe to loosen the soil to a depth of about a foot, then mixing it with a light application of fertilizer or compost. This will enrich the soil and help the hostas do well in a variety of weather conditions., The holes should be as deep as the root ball and twice as wide. Space the holes 1 to 3 feet (0.3 to 0.9 m) apart, depending on what variety you are planting., Set the hostas into the holes so that the top of the root ball is level with the ground. Fill in the hole with soil and pat it gently around the base of the plants. Water the planted hostas well.

, Hostas will wilt and turn brown if their soil gets too dry, so make sure to water them frequently to keep the soil moist. Water hostas under the foliage at their bases to prevent the leaves from getting burned by the sun.


Watering hostas in the morning will help keep them hydrated during hotter parts of the day during the summer.
You can sprinkle mulch around the bases of the hostas to help keep the soil moist.

, Hostas don't stay green all winter, so after the first frost of fall, you'll probably want to cut the back - otherwise they'll look dried out and dead all winter long. Use pruning shears or a scissors to cut them back to a couple of inches. They'll come back out in the spring.

, At the beginning of the growing season, help bring the hostas back by adding compost to the soil. Add a layer of mulch to help retain moisture. Water the area thoroughly to help the new growth emerge., Hosts are quite durable, and it's easy to divide them to share with friends or plant in other areas of your garden. To divide a hosta, lift it out of the ground and separate a few stems and their roots from the main part of the plant. This is best done in early spring, when the leaves are still curled, but you can do it at any point during the summer if your plants are healthy.This will help maintain the overall quality of your Hostas, and will make doubling your Hosta population easier.

, Hostas are favorites of deer, snails and slugs, if these animals are common in the area you live, take precautions to protect against these species.


Keep deer away by building a fence around your yard, or luring them to the edges with other deer-friendly plants.
Many gardeners find that setting out shallow bowls of beer around the hostas is an effective way to get rid of slugs.

Divide your plants every three to five years.,
Dig your plant up, making certain that you are not harming the roots.,
Divide the clump of roots and plant in half.,
Replant the newly divided mums as soon as possible.",How to Care for Mums1," Dividing plants prevents overcrowding and promotes the maximum amount of blooms. Diving also cleans and rejuvenates old clumps. Dividing mums should be done in the spring when new growth first appears., Lift the plant from the hole once you have cleared it of the dirt. Shake any excess dirt from its roots. Remove any diseased or dead parts of the plant.

, Some plants will be able to separated with your fingers, others may need a knife--it depends on the size of your plant. Try not to damage the roots any more than necessary.Using a sharp garden knife will cause the least amount of damage to the roots, as it will be easier to cut them and there will be less hacking involved.
Divide the plant in half again if you desire smaller plants.

, They should be planted in well-drained, nutrient-rich, loose organic soil.

Water mums sufficiently but don't allow them to stand in water.,
Keep mums away from street lights or artificial light during the nighttime hours.,
Fertilize mums frequently.,
Treat fungus with fungicides.,
Keep the plant area clean and clear of plant debris to prevent pests and diseases.,
Pinch the tips of young mum plants in late spring and early summer to make them bushy and compact.",How to Care for Mums2," Mums’ root systems cannot handle too much moisture. Mums planted in containers will require more water than those planted in the ground, as mums in the ground can absorb natural water like rain and dew.Don't allow mums to wilt between waterings. If the lower leaves wilt or turn brown you need to water them more. Avoid splashing water onto the foliage as this could promote the growth of bacteria or cause your mum to become diseased.

, Mums are short-day plants, which means they need a long period of darkness to flower.

, You should use a balanced all-purpose fertilizer. Feed them especially during the vegetative growth period to prevent premature flowering.At each watering use a 20-10-20 or equivalent solution. When the blooming season begins, switch to a 10-20-20 fertilizer or equivalent.

, Treat pythium root and stem rot, fusarium wilt, bacterial leaf spot, botrytis blight, and chrysanthemum white rust with natural fungicides like garlic oil, neem oil or sulfur.

, Abolish common mum insects like aphids, mites, thrips, and leaf miners with insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils., This ensures you will have domes of brightly-colored blossoms come autumn.Pick off dead or fading flowers to encourage more blooms.

"
"
Cut your mums back to the ground.,
Mound the dirt up around your plants.,
Prepare your potted plants for winter.",How to Care for Mums3," Do this after they have been killed back by hard frost. Provide an airy, light mulch for your mums. Insulated your plants’ roots with mulch will help them face the frost winter brings.Evergreen branches or similar material are good mulch for mums.

, Mounding the dirt will help to keep your plants from dying, even in the face of frost heaving (a constant freezing and thawing that can happen to plants in the winter.), If you have potted mums, move them to a well-lit but cool location. Remove any covering your might have put on the pot. Do not over water your potted plants, as this can lead to bacterial growth. Wait to water the plants until the soil has dried two to three inches deep. When you water your plants, fill the pots so that they overflow and water runs out of the hole in the bottom of the pot.

"
"
Plant or place mums in full sun.,
Use a fertile soil that drains easily when planting your mums in containers.,
Plant mums in an area where they will receive plenty of air circulation.,
Move them to a new location every three years.",How to Care for Mums4," If you don't have an area that gets a full 8 hours of sunlight everyday, put them in a place where the mums will get at least 5 hours.If you have an option to choose between morning or afternoon sun, opt for morning sun.

, Mums don’t do well with ‘wet feet’ so try to avoid soil that retains a lot of water.For in-ground planting, choose an area of the yard that doesn't accumulate too much water.

, Placing them against walls or other structures, or placing them too close to other mum plants could hamper their growth or cause root competition. Mums should be planted 18 to 30 inches (45.7 to 76.2 cm) apart so that they have room to grow.

, Moving your plants helps to prevent pest problems and reduces the risk of disease. (See the Dividing and Transplanting section for more instructions.)

Plant heather in sandy loam soil that contains organic matter.,
Test the soil to make sure it has an acidic pH of 6.1 to 6.8.,
Adjust the soil pH if it is at 6.0 or lower or above 6.8.,
Use a thin metal rod to determine the depth of the wet soil.,
Give the heather two inches of water every week.,
Don’t worry about fertilizing your heather plant.,
Prune the heather in the fall after it finishes flowering.",How to Care for Heather Plants," These plants do not do well in slow-draining, clay soil, as wet conditions can lead to stem and root rot. Organic matter like sphagnum peat moss, well-aged cow manure, pine bark humus, leaf mold or compost will help heather grow properly and beautifully.


If your heather has root rot, the stems will wilt as though they are drought-stressed and develop soft rotten spots. Heather plants are rarely salvageable when they develop rot and should be replaced with a new, healthy plant.;
, Heather grows best in soil with higher pH levels. They will develop chlorosis or very pale green leaves if they are grown in neutral to alkaline soil as they cannot absorb certain, necessary nutrients.


Use a soil pH test kit to test the soil. The kit can be purchased at your local garden center.
To determine the soil’s pH, dig 4 inches deep into the soil to get a good test sample. Avoid touching the soil as contact with your skin can change the soil pH. Let the soil sample dry before testing it. Pour the sample into a clean glass container, add distilled water and the chemicals that are in the test kit. Stir or shake the mixture vigorously and let it sit until the soil settles to the bottom. Compare the color of the liquid to the test strip to determine the soil pH.

, You can do this by mixing in lime, iron sulfate, or organic matter into the soil.


Sandy soil will require about 1 ¼ pounds of lime per 25 square feet to bring the pH up from 5.5 to 6.5 or about 1/3 pound of iron sulfate to adjust the pH down from 7.5 to 6.5. Mix the lime or iron sulfate into the top 6 inches of soil thoroughly before planting the heather. If the heather has already been planted, gently work the lime or iron sulfate into the top 1 inch of soil, being careful not to disturb the plant’s roots.
Before planting the heather, a 3- to 6-inch layer of sphagnum peat moss, well-aged cow manure, pine bark humus, leaf mold or compost should be mixed into the top 8 to 10 inches of soil thoroughly with a tiller. If the heather has already been planted, spread a depth of 2-inches of organic matter around the plant and mix it into the top inch of soil. Spread a 1-inch depth of sphagnum peat moss over the soil around the heather to help keep the area moist.

, To avoid under watering or over watering the heather, check the soil often with a thin metal rod.


Push the rod into the soil until it meets some resistance. Grasp the rod just above the soil when it hits dry dirt, pull the rod out and measure the depth of the wet soil.

, You may need to water the plant more in hot weather or a hot climate. When heather is not being watered enough, it will wilt and turn yellow so check the soil often to make sure it doesn’t dry out.


Pour enough water over the soil around the heather to moisten it to a depth of 6 inches. You can measure the depth with the thin metal rod.

, Heather rarely needs fertilizer, especially if organic matter like well-aged cow manure and compost are mixed into the soil. In fact, too much fertilizer will kill heather plants.

, Trim off the faded flowers with sharp hand pruners or hedge shears. Snip off the tips of the taller stems to tidy up and better shape the heather.


Be sure to rake up all of the trimmings and remove them from the garden to reduce the possibility for fungal or bacterial disease like stem or root rot.

Keep the plant watered.,
If you live in a cold climate, consider planting your bush in a pot.,
Water the plant throughout the growing season.,
Replace the layer of mulch annually.,
Feed the plant with a high-phosphorous fertilizer.,
Keep an eye out for pests and disease.,
Prune the bush in mid-late summer.,
Apply a fresh layer of mulch before winter sets in.,
Protect ground-planted purple flower potato bushes in extremely cold weather.,
Move pot-planted bushes indoors.,
Prune the dormant plant in December or January.,
Check to see if your plant survived the winter.",How to Care for a Purple Flower Potato Bush," The purple flower potato bush will thrive in US zones 8 to 11. Make sure to choose a spot in your garden where the bush will have plenty of space - around 40 inches (101.6 cm) on each side. This plant typically grows to about 5 feet (1.5 m) in height, so take that into account when planning your garden.


The zones refer to the location you live in, as outlined by the USDA Hardiness Zone Map. This map divides North America into 11 zones, according to average annual minimum winter temperatures. Each zone has an average winter temperature that is 10 °F (−12 °C) warmer (or colder) than the zone adjacent to it.






To find out which hardiness zone you live in, go to the National Gardening Association website and enter your zip code.;
, It's important that your purple flower potato bush gets plenty of sunlight, so make sure to choose a sunny spot in your garden for planting.


This plant is native to warm climates, so in cold areas it’s important to plant it in a sheltered area to help it survive the winter. Against a red brick wall - out of the wind - is ideal.







, The purple flower potato bush favors well-draining soil, so avoid planting it anywhere puddles form and linger after rainfall. If drainage is a problem in your garden, consider incorporating lots of organic matter or grit into the soil to improve the drainage ahead of planting.


The plant will prefer soil with a pH that is either neutral or slightly alkaline, but this isn't critical.






If your garden soil is sandy, it may be advisable to add some lime at planting time. This will result in better flowering.

, When you plant your purple flower potato bush, add an organic mulch to enrich the soil, conserve moisture and protect the roots. Incorporate three inches of well-rotted manure or leaf mold to the soil during planting..

, Keep the plant well-watered until it is established. This usually takes about a year.

, If your area experiences particularly cold winters, consider planting your purple flower potato bush in a container that can be moved indoors during the worst winter frosts.


As it is a large plant that will require a big container, it's advisable to use a container that's fitted with wheels to make moving it easier.






Relocate the plant to a less cold area during frosty weather: a greenhouse or conservatory is ideal.







, It’s important to keep your purple flower potato plant watered during the growing season, especially if the weather is dry. However, your should avoid over-watering it as this inhibits flower production.


You can cut right back on watering over the colder months.






Once established, the plant will be drought-tolerant but it’s still advisable to water during dry periods, especially if the soil becomes dry below the surface.

, The purple flower potato bush prefers even moisture in the soil so keep the layer of mulch topped up and remember to replace it annually. This will help to keep moisture in the ground.

, In the spring, feed your purple flower potato bush with a high-phosphorous fertilizer and continue to do so every few weeks during the growing season.


If you aren't sure what kind of fertilizer you have, check the ingredients. The amount of phosphorous should be higher than the amount of nitrogen in the mix. Nitrogen encourages leaf growth instead of flower growth.






If you prefer a more organic fertilizer, bone meal is a good high-phosphorous choice.







, The purple flower potato bush is vulnerable to pests and diseases. Keep a careful eye out for aphids and use bug spray if they appear. Other issues to be wary of include blights and mildew.

, As flowers tend to develop on fresh shoots, cutting the plant back after each flush of flowering helps to encourage more flowers to form. To prune your purple flower potato bush, cut stems back by about a third (cutting to just above a leaf node) in the mid-late summer flowering period.

, Ground-planted purple flower potato bushes will benefit from a mulch before the ground gets cold. This will help to protect the roots over the winter months.


If you’re lucky enough to live in an area that is frost-free, your purple flower potato bush may bloom year-round.
In other areas, you can expect it to die back in winter but re-grow and blossom again the following year.

, A really brutal frost can kill this plants off completely. If you expect a particularly cold snap, you could try fleece-protection using special plant cladding from the garden center.


Some gardeners recommend wrapping the plant with fairy lights suitable for outdoor use and then wrapping in an old shower curtain or similar.

, If you are growing your purple flower potato bush in a pot, you may like to overwinter it in a shed or conservatory, where it will be protected from winter frosts. However, this is only necessary if you live in areas that experience a lot of frost.

, You should prune your purple flower potato bush over the dormant winter period, in December or January. You'll want to cut the stems back by about a third at this time, though if you want to contain the size of the plant you can prune more aggressively.


To prune the stems, cut to a point just above a leaf node. Any diseased or damaged shoots should also be removed.
Also remove any suckers – the shoots that form from the rootstock – unless you want the plant to spread.

, To check if your purple flower potato bush has survived the winter, try scratching away the bark from a stem at the base of the plant. If it is still green and fresh inside (rather than woody), your plant is still alive and should regrow soon.

Consider plants that are either groundcover or low-growing.,
Ensure that the root systems of the under-plants are non-competitive.,
Select plants able to tolerate shaded light.",How to Underplant Roses," The perfect types of plants will not grow higher than 30 centimeter (11.8 in) or that are happy to be kept clipped to that height. If you have taller roses (for example, standard roses), these will be able to tolerate slightly higher under-plants, while shrub type roses will be better off with only groundcover under-planting. Good choices include:

Trailing plants



 


Spreading plants







Aleananthera dentata, known as the deep ruby-leaved alternanthera






Marigolds







Juniperus horizontalis, known as blue rug juniper







Lobularia maritima, known as white alyssum






Annual flowers that are hardy (don't need too much watering)





;
, The last thing that you need are plants that will compete for root space with the roses.

, The leaves of the rose bushes will filter the light during summertime, so avoid plant species that require full sun in summer but can tolerate winter sun.

Plant in light shade.,
Keep camellias out of the path of wind.,
Planting the camellia.,
Use deep watering.,
Mulch around your camellia.,
Apply a suitable fertilizer every spring.,
Don't overdo the acid.,
Look for infestations.,
Prune right after blooming.,
Remove dead and dying growth.This will improve the overall health of the plant.,
Shape bushes to your liking.",How to Care for Camellias," This is a golden rule. Camellias do best in light shade that protects them from hot afternoon sun.This doesn't mean that they need total shade, just enough so that they don't bake in the sun.


As a camellia grows, it can tolerate more sun. This is because a mature camellia will have a big canopy of leaves that will shade the roots and make sure they don't get too dried out by the sun.
This also depends on what climate you are planting the camellia in. If you are in a climate that never gets very hot, then a camellia can cope with a spot with less shade.;
, The more sheltered the camellia, the better the flowering will be. This is because the dehydration from winds any time of year can kill camellias, whether it be warm winds in the summer or cold winds in the winter.Try planting your camellia between 3 to 6 feet from your house. This will give it good protection from the wind.
If you need to, erect a fence or trellis to divert direct wind away from your camellia plants.
The lighter the flower color, the more protection from wind is needed.

, Dig a hole that is two feet wider than the root ball of the plant. The hole should be just a bit deeper than the root ball in the center but a few inches deeper than than that around the edges. Keeping the hole shallow in the center will prevent the plant from sinking.Digging the hole deeper around the edges will give the plant's roots some looser soil to easily spread out into.


Place the rootball in the hole, making sure the top is slightly above the soil level. Fill the rest of the hole with a mixture of top soil and organic material.
Press the dirt around the plant down so that it is firmly in place.
Then give the plant a deep watering. If the weather is dry, give a new plant a thorough watering every week until it is well established..

, Camellias love deep watering about twice weekly, rather than daily shallow watering. This is partially because camellias love generally moist soil as opposed to soggy soil. Giving a deep soak allows the soil to have a generally moist consistency for longer.

, Mulching will help keep moisture in the ground and it will keep the soil cooler on hot summer days. In addition, mulch will help keep weeds at bay.Use whatever mulch you have readily available but don't pile it more than a few inches high, no matter what you use. This can keep soil too wet and lead to root rot.
Remember that the mulch should not touch the trunk of the plant.Mulch also adds new organic material to your soil. This will help to break up clay soil or add richness to sandy soil. In general, it will increase the quality of your top soil tremendously.

, Some Camellias are considered heavy eaters, meaning that they need a lot of nutrients from the soil in order to thrive. This will ensure lush growth and good flowering each season.


There are other varieties too, where the plant is not a heavy feeder, and do not react well to over-stimulation.Interestingly their bloom time is also their dormant period and should not be fertilized then.Cottonseed meal and fish emulsion are good natural choices. Two or three feedings between April 1 and September 1 is all that is necessary.Contact your local extension service or camellia experts to get recommendations of fertilizers that work well in your specific area and for your specific variety of the plant.
Fertilizers usually have three numbers on them, which tells you about the nutrients in it. The first number is for nitrogen, the second number is for phosphorus, and the third number is for potassium.If you want your camellia to increase in size because it is newly planted, give it a fertilizer with a larger first number, such as 10 or 12.
If you just want to maintain the size of an already established plant, then a lower first number, such as 4, will work well.

, There is a common perception that camellias are acid loving. The reality is that camellias prefer slightly acidic conditions but they do not like very acidic conditions. If you've been overdoing the acidic fertilising, stop now!


If you test your soil, it should have a ph between 5.5 and 6.8 to make a camellia happy.If you notice the leaves turning yellow, the camellia likely needs more acid in the soil. Re-pot with fresh potting soil formulated for acid-loving plants.,


Check the top and the underside of the leaves weekly for aphids and spider mites. When you spot an infestation, rinse off the insects with a strong stream of water.
Check the woody stems for scale insects. Scale appears as raised welts that scrape off easily. Spray scale with a ready-mixed all-season horticultural oil., If you prune right after blooming then you will give the plant time to rejuvenate and grow new buds for the following spring. There is a good period of dormant time between when the plant blooms and when it starts to sprout new growth for you to do this.Pruning at other times of year will not kill a well-established plant. However, it will eliminate your buds for the following spring, so prune off season carefully.

, Pruning reinvigorates the plant and decreases the chances of bug or disease infestations.


To avoid the chance of disease entering the plant, cut branches flush to feeder branches, instead of leaving nubs., To begin with, remove leggy or lanky branches that stick out and don't look good. Then prune for general shape. Pruning should also be done to shape the plant so it fits into your landscape. This may mean a light or severe pruning, depending on the shape of the camellia and how long it has been left to grown untended.


Severe pruning means removing one third to one half of the plant. This should be done without fear of losing the plant, as most camellias are very strong and will outlive those that planted them. However, the year following a severe pruning you will probably have fewer blooms, as the plant it focused on regrowing its branches and leaves.Light pruning can be done with small hand shears or larger shaping shears. You will get a cleaner look if you prune individual branches, as opposed to cutting large swaths with shaping shears.

Consider removing the flowers from the stems.,
Place the plant in the sun.,
Prune your plant.,
Move your potted plant to a cool, dark location.,
Separate your corms.,
Remove the parent corm.",How to Care for a Potted Freesia After Blooming," The freesia plant has three stages to its life:


The first is the blooming phase where it produces dark green foliage and beautiful blooms.
The second is a rest phase, where the plant stops producing flowers and begins to use its leaves to store energy in the form of corms.
The third phase is a dormant phase necessary to rest the plant so it can bloom again the next year.
Continue reading to learn how to care for freesias in their rest phase.;
, The rest phase begins when the last blooms have died back from the plant. If you prefer, you can remove the flowers from the stems, but you should leave any part of the plant that is green and not yellow or dying.


By far, sunlight is the most important factor during this time. The green leaves must use sunlight to photosynthesize and store energy for the next year; quite a bit like hibernation.
If too little nutrition is stored, the plant could refuse to bloom or have greatly reduced foliage the next year.

, Once the plant has it’s flowers removed, place the container in full sun and fertilize according to package directions.


Leave the Freesia’s in full sun for the next two to three months or until the leaves turn yellow. During this time, you should frequently water and refrain from disturbing the plant too much.
This phase is critical for producing healthy corms for next year.

, When your freesia begins to die back and the leaves turn yellow it’s time to prune. Remove any yellowing or dead leaves.

, Once two-thirds of the plant has died back, move the plant to a cool, dark location and allow the plant to enter dormancy.


It’s important that the plant remains dry during this time, therefore you should reduce watering to when the plant is appearing to wilt, to prevent the corms from attempting to bloom at the wrong time.
You may keep the freesia in a dark location until you’re ready to start blooms again, even if you change seasons. If you remove the plant from dormancy in winter, you’ll enjoy blooms during the summer. If you remove them in the fall, you’ll enjoy blooms in the spring.

, If your plant is a few years old, it's probably time to dig up and separate the corms.


Be sure to remove the entire plant from the pot and avoid digging into the corm system. Try tipping the pot and removing all the dirt and corms onto a newspaper to prevent damage to the plant.
With a light hand, begin to pull off branching corms.

, Typically there will be a large, firm corm with smaller, similar corms off the side. Near the bottom will be an older, unhealthy looking corm.


This withering corm is last year's parent corm that is still attached to a healthy child.
You should remove and separate the new corms from the previous and set them aside in a dry location to allow them to cure for several weeks before replanting.

Plant your daisies outside if desired.,
Water the seeds or seedlings right away.",How to Care for Daisies1," Start the seeds indoors or purchase transplants if you want blooms the same year.If you choose to plant the seeds directly in the ground, expect the plants to bloom in their second year.;
, Plant transplants or direct sow seeds in early spring when there is no more risk of frost. To start daisies indoors, plant the seeds 6-8 weeks before the last frost. You can look up the last frost dates in your area online by searching for a frost chart for your country or region., Pour a lightweight seed-starting mix into trays or pots. You can purchase a seed-starting mix or make your own with equal parts peat moss, vermiculite and perlite.Poke a small hole in the medium with a toothpick. Plant the seeds pointing down. Brush soil over the tops to cover the seeds.
Keep the mixture moist and above 70° F (21° C) with at least 8 hours of bright light every day, using a grow light or window.

, Daisies love full sun, but partial sun will also work. Pick a planting area with moist, well-drained soil. Remove any existing growth from the ground so that your daisies won’t be crowded.Daisies can survive in poor soil. But if you want them to thrive, the soil should be moderate: not too rich and not too poor.

, Work a moderate amount of organic compost and/or aged manure into the soil for better blooms. Level the soil with a hoe and tamp it down lightly., For direct sow, cover the seeds lightly with ⅛ in (0.32 cm) of soil. When seedlings grow 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) tall, thin them to one plant every 12 in (30.5 cm).To plant existing seedlings, space the plants 12 to 24 in (30.5 to 60.9 cm) apart on all sides., For seeds that have not yet germinated, water the area regularly to keep it moist.Seedlings will need to be watered again only when the soil looks dry.

Prune your indoor azalea.",How to Care for Azaleas," Azaleas are generally found in Zone 6 growing areas. This means that they need warmer weather where temperatures generally do not dip below 0 or -10ºF (-17.8 to -23.3ºC). If you live in a colder climate, you might consider growing a different type of plant. However, there are some types of azaleas that remain hardy in colder temperatures.:


Deciduous varieties of azaleas like the Roseshell azalea (Rhododendron prinophyllum) can survive in Zone 4. This means that they can survive in climates where the temperatures drop down to -30ºF (-34.4ºC).;
, These are the best times to plant azaleas, as most azaleas will bloom in the next spring. However, there are some varieties, like the ‘Weston’s Lemon Drop’ and ‘Flame Creeper’ that will bloom in June or July.‘Sweet September’, which is a pink bloom, is a very late bloomer that bursts into color in September, as the name suggests.

, Azaleas grow well in organically enriched, acidic, well-drained soil. Your soil should have a pH level of 5.5 or to 6.0. It is important that the soil is well drained because these plants don’t do well in soggy soil. You should also avoid heavy clay when planting azaleas, as clay will choke the roots.If you live in a place without acidic soil, like in alkaline soil area such as Texas, you can build raised flower beds that are composed of a mixture of coarse sphagnum peat moss and finely milled bark.

, In general, azaleas do well when they are grown in a spot that is partially covered by thin shade that allows filtered light to come in. Look for a spot under tall trees. However, some species of azalea bloom better in brighter light. When you purchase your azalea, ask about your specific species or run an internet search when you get home.


The east and north-facing sides of a house are the best spots for azaleas as they provide less direct sunlight.

, Leave the plant’s root ball slightly showing when you put it in the ground. Plant the azaleas 2 to 6 feet apart. Fill in the hole halfway full with soil, and then water the planted azaleas well and add some more soil. On top., Azaleas are relatively shallow rooted, so they have a tendency to dry out if they do not have mulch over them. To keep the soil moist and acidic, add a mulch of pine needles, oak leaf mold, or aged hemlock, oak, or pine sawdust. This mulch will provide the plant with the nutrients it needs so you don’t need to add much, if any, fertilizer.Keep the mulch around one inch deep around the plant. If you planted more than one azalea, the mulch should be two to three inches deep between plants.

, These sort of plants absorb water through their leaves, so it is important to wet their foliage, as well as the area around their roots. However, it is good to water them in the morning because that gives their leaves the day to absorb the water and dry off—if they stay wet overnight, their risk of growing mold is higher., Once your azalea is established, they can pretty much handle themselves. However, in the dry season, it will be important to water your azalea. Azaleas will wilt when they become a little dry, so monitor your plant—it will tell you when it's thirsty.Using sprinklers to water the plants from overhead is a great way to water these type of plants—just remember to set your sprinkler system so that it waters them in the morning.

, In late spring when the plant’s flowers are fading, you should give your azalea a nutrition boost. Apply new mulch to the area. Use an acid-forming, controlled-release fertilizer (which can be sprayed through a hose-end sprayer) to give your plant a boost and help it get through the summer. Good fertilizers include commercial azalea food or cottonseed meal.Remember not to fertilize your plant before it blooms—the fertilizer will inspire leafy growth rather than flower growth.
Make sure to keep the mulch a few feet away from the trunk of the azaleas.

, If you have a deciduous azalea, you should prune your plant when it doesn’t have any leaves and is dormant. Evergreen azaleas tend to grow in crazier shapes, so heading off a wonky branch will give your plant symmetry. Never prune after July 1st, as this will greatly reduce next spring’s blooms.


Keep in mind that if you can avoid pruning, then this is a better option. Do not prune unless it is necessary.

, As with outdoor azaleas, indoor azaleas love acidic soil, well-drained soil. The best sort of soil to use when potting an azalea is a peat-based potting mix that does not contain any lime., You should give your plant a high-potassium fertilizer specially made for acid-loving plants. If possible, get a fertilizer that contains iron.


You will be able to tell if your plant is nutrient deficient by looking at the leaves. If they are yellow with green veins, your plant needs more nutrients.

, This means potting your plant in a pot with a drainage hole. Azaleas don’t do well when they have ‘wet feet’—a result of overwatering—but they do need their soil to be moist. If possible, use distilled water or rainwater to water your plant—hard water like that from a tap contains chlorine and chloramine that the plant does not react well with.

, As with outdoor azaleas, potted azaleas should not be put in direct sunlight, as too much sunlight could cause their blooms and leaves to turn brown and die. Instead, place your azalea in a brightly lit room where it is never in direct sunlight.


Double check that the variety of azalea you had does not need direct sunlight. Some varieties of this plant actually do well in direct sunlight.

, These plants do best in cool to normal room temperatures. Keep the temperature at 60-70°F(16-21°C) for a healthy plant. If possible, get a humidifier for the room you are planning on keeping your plant in, as these plants thrive in moderate to high humidity.If you can’t get a humidifier, you can place your potted plant on a tray of wet pebbles. This will give the plant the moisture it needs.

, Indoor azaleas have a hard time reblooming because these plants need a couple of months of low temperatures (their own winter) to be able to produce buds. During fall or winter, help your plant out by putting it in a place where the temperature will hover around 40-55°F (4-13°C). This will allow the plant to become dormant, like it would outside, and produce blooms for the spring., In order to get the most bloom for your buck (so to speak) you will need to prune your plant annually. Prune your plant after it is done flowering. Cut the stem about ¼ of an inch above the area where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem (this is called the leaf node). Using very sharp pruning scissors (so as to avoid tearing the branches) cut the stem away at a 45° angle. This will help your plant to produce many flowers the next time it blooms.

Clean the bulb with water.",How to Care for Amaryllis Flowers," You can find them in shades of red, pink or orange, as well as white. They may also be a combination of a few colors.


The larger the bulb, the more flowers the amaryllis will have.;
, Their ideal storage temperature is between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (4 and 10 degrees Celsius).Use your refrigerator’s crisper drawer to store your bulbs for a minimum of 6 weeks. However, you should not store the bulbs next to fruit, like apples, or they can sterilize.

, This will depend greatly on your climate. If you have cold temperatures, below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) in the winter, you will need to plant the bulb in a pot and keep it inside.


Winter blooms are generally bigger and last longer than summer blooms.
You can plant during both seasons, as long as there is 6 weeks of cold storage between the last bloom dying and the replanting.,, Do not use pots without holes in the bottom. Amaryllis bulbs are very sensitive to overwatering.


Amaryllis prefers to be pot bound, although it can be planted in some smaller garden beds.
Plant in the garden bed when temperatures are above 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) and there is no risk of a bad frost. Use the same instructions as you would to plant in a pot., There should be able 2 inches of soil between the side of the bulb and the pot. Most amaryllis bulbs prefer a sturdy 6 to 8 inch pot.,, You can buy pre-made mixes that will work well for this type of flower. Only garden soil will not work, because it will not drain adequately.

, Gently fill in potting soil around the bulb. Leave the stem of the bulb, approximately 1/3 of the plant, above the soil.


Don’t pack the soil in too much, since you want the roots to remain intact.
If you worry that planting them with the stem above the soil in a garden may force them to fall over, place a planting stake next to the bulb to keep it upright.

, It grows best in 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) weather.

,,, They should bloom for approximately 2 weeks. The blooms will last longer in a 65-degree temperature (18.3 Celsius) than a hotter temperature.

, Add liquid houseplant fertilizer at regular intervals.

, When the flower stem wilts, cut it off where it meets the bulb. You can maintain the plant as a green plant for several weeks or months.

,,,, Be gentle to avoid harming the bulb.

, Dry it and store it in a cool dry place, just as you did before you planted the bulb. It should be kept cool and dry for 6 to 8 weeks before you plant it again.

, These plants require temperatures between 55º to 85ºF (12.7 to 29.4ºC).

,, Use a bigger pot if the plant appears root bound.

,


Use distilled water or rainwater at room temperature.
Add water to the pot until water flows from the bottom.
Empty saucers beneath the plant as soon as the water stops draining out.
Touch the top of the potting soil to know if the plant needs water. Don’t rely on a schedule to water, water when the soil feels dry to the touch.

, 50-60 % relative room humidity is ideal.

,,


Use a flowering plant, water-soluble fertilizer mixed according to directions for indoor plants, once a month.
Or use a granular, slow release fertilizer for flowering houseplants as the label directs.
Wait to begin fertilization for 3 months if the potting soil you use has fertilizer included.

,


Tip each tall, upright branch when you re-pot in spring to encourage side growth and fullness. Using bypass garden pruning shears cut each branch back to the second leaf node from the tip. Cut just before the node.
You can prune back to just before any leaf node to reduce the height or width of the hibiscus. Make sure to leave 2 to 3 leaf nodes on each stem or remove the stem completely.

Fertilize two weeks after planting and once a month thereafter.,
Water daisies as needed.,
Mulch around the daisies and/or hand weed as needed.,
Deadhead and prune the daisies as needed.,
Cut down your daisies at the end of the growing season.,
Divide your daisies when they lack space.,
Maintain your existing perennials.",How to Care for Daisies2," Use all-purpose fertilizer like 10-10-10 in the amount listed on the label. For the best results, switch to a fertilizer high in phosphorous (such as 10-16-10) just before the plant blooms.To apply fertilizer: granular fertilizer can be sprinkled on the soil with or without a spreader. Water-soluble fertilizer should be applied using a sprayer or watering can. For either method, always measure your application based on the fertilizer's instruction label.

, Daisies don’t require a set watering schedule; in fact, they prefer the soil to dry out somewhat between waterings. Check the top 4-5 in (10.2-12.7 cm) of soil – if it’s dry, water the daisies deeply from underneath so that their leaves don’t get wet. The best time to do this is in the morning.Daisies don’t need watering in the winter unless the weather is unseasonably dry. If that is the case, water them 1-2 in (2.5-5.1 cm) every other month.

, Weeds can attract parasites and starve daisies of nutrients. Make sure to wear gardening gloves and remove weeds by hand or with a short-handled weeding tool regularly. This is especially important when your daisies are still young.For less necessary maintenance of weeds, apply 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) of mulch in mid-to-late spring when the ground warms and dries from winter. Keep a 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) circumference around the plant base free from mulch., Throughout the growing season, prune away any dead leaves and snip the flower heads off whenever their appearance begins to fade. This encourages regrowth.Stop deadheading the daisies near the end of the growing season if you plan to collect the seeds. The end of the growing season will vary based on your location., Trim down your daisies where the stem meets the foliage, approximately 3 in (7.6 cm) above soil level.Wait until the last killing frost. You can find the date range of freezes by looking up your gardening zone online. After trimming down, protect the perennials’ root balls with a layer of mulch. You can use straw, hay or leaves., Dig deeply into the ground about 6-8 in (15.2-20.3 cm) away from the plants’ centers. Loosen the roots by rocking the shovel, and lift the plants gently out of the ground by the root balls. Carefully pull the clump apart and discard the woody centers. Replant wherever desired, each group of daisies 12 in (30.5 cm) away from other plants.Autumn is the preferable time to divide your daisies, however you can divide them in springtime if necessary.
When dividing your daisies, place them gently in a temporary container to move them, and replant them right away.

, Use a single application of fertilizer just before the new spring growth appears, or as soon as it pushes up through the ground.Side dress with compost or apply no more than 1 pound (0.45 kg) of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet (305 square meters).

Put your daisies in an appropriate container.,
Set up a light source.,
Water the daisies and maintain a proper temperature.,
Fertilize your plants.,
Deadhead the daisies and prune their leaves as needed.,
Move your daisies as they grow.",How to Care for Daisies3," Make sure the container is at least 12 in (30.5 cm) with two or more drainage holes. Glazed ceramic or plastic pots prevent wilting and help the soil stay moist.The container should be sterilized. Soak it for 10 minutes in a solution of 1 part household bleach to 9 parts water. Afterwards, scrub it with dish detergent and water and let it fully dry before using it., Daisies should have sunlight or a grow light all day in the spring, summer and fall seasons. Indirect sunlight for at least 3-5 hours is sufficient for the wintertime.House plants need light from all sides. If your light source only hits one side of the plant, make sure to rotate the plant a quarter turn about every week., Check the top 1 in (2.54 cm) of soil – if it feels dry to the touch, water your daisies deeply. Allow the pot to drain completely. If the saucer or drip tray is still waterlogged, pour out the excess water so that the plant doesn’t sit in soggy soil.Daisies growing indoors prefer a temperature between 40 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (4 and 21 degrees Celsius).Water plants from underneath and avoid getting the leaves wet.

, During the spring and summer, feed your daisies monthly with an all-purpose fertilizer. Don’t fertilize during the fall or winter.Mix water with a soluble fertilizer such as 15-5-15 once a month when they are actively growing in the spring and summer., Use sharp, clean shears and trim close to the stem. Whenever the blooms begins to wilt, snip off the flowerheads.When the leaves look wilted or damaged, prune them to improve the plant’s health.

, If the plant gets crowded in its container, move it to a larger pot."

Harvest the daisy seeds.,
Dry the seeds.,
Collect the seeds.",How to Care for Daisies4," The seed head should be completely ripe before you collect any seeds – it should look brown and possibly cracked.Cut daisy stems at the base of each plant. Place them in a paper bag tied closed with string.

, Hang the bag(s) upside-down in a dark, dry area. The seed heads should be pointing downwards.Choose a spot that isn’t cold and has decent air circulation (but no strong drafts)., Check the bag to make sure the seed heads are brittle. Squeeze flower heads so that the seeds fall into the bottom of the bag.Dump the bag’s contents onto a plate. Separate the golden-brown seeds from any debris. Pour the seeds into a paper envelope and store them in a cool, dry place away from strong light.

Check the pH level of the soil.,
Treat daisies for pests as needed.,
Secure a cleaner, drier environment.,
Deal with mold.",How to Care for Daisies5," If you’ve followed proper planting and maintaining methods and your daisies still aren’t thriving, try testing the soil. Daisies prefer slightly acidic soil. Soil test kits should reflect a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0.Add limestone if your soil is too acidic. Add sulfur or peat moss if the soil is too alkaline.

, Daisies can be affected by the following pests: aphids, mites, leafminers, nematodes, thrips and whiteflies. Most often, you will have to remove the affected leaves, isolate infested plants from healthy ones, apply a narrow-range oil or insecticidal soap, or use a water spray.Visit a garden center or shop online to find available products for addressing specific pest problems.

, You can do this if the daisies show signs of disease. Daisies stricken with fungal or bacterial diseases are likely too moist and/or crowded. Signs of disease problems include leaf spotting, yellowing or death, stunted shoots, and wilting.Remove any spent or damaged blooms and leaves, then clear plant debris from the area to keep the plant bases dry.

, Mold may develop on the soil of indoor plants. If you see white mold on the soil's surface, scrape it off using gloves and move the plant to a well-ventilated area to let it dry out.If the mold returns, replant the daisies in a clean container with fresh, sterile indoor potting soil.

Protect the plant during cold snaps.",How to Care for a Gardenia," Gardenias perform best in day temperatures between 65-70 degrees F (18-21 degrees C) and night temperatures between 60-65 degrees F (15-18 degrees C). Since most climates will only see these temperatures in the spring, that’s the best time to plant them to ensure flower buds form.If your climate sees colder temperatures in the spring, you may want to wait until late spring to plant. And if your climate is hotter, plant in late winter or early spring.;
, Your gardenia should receive 6-8 hours of full sun a day. If you live somewhere with very hot temperatures, pick a spot with morning sun and afternoon shade so that it doesn’t get scorched.Potted gardenias should be placed somewhere with bright light but no direct sunlight. If indoors, try a table beside a bright window. For outside, place it on a bright but shaded deck or balcony., Gardenias like acidic soil, so test the soil where you’d like to plant it. You can use a store-bought probe or take a sample and pour water and baking soda on it to see if it fizzes. If not, you can make the soil more acidic by purchasing sulfur from a home improvement or garden store and adding the amount recommended on the packaging.Avoid planting your gardenia near a concrete walk or foundation, since the soil will likely be too alkaline., Gardenias have shallow roots, so you don’t need to dig it very deep, but make it 2-3 times as wide as the root ball. If you’re planting multiple gardenias, space them at least 3-6 feet (1-2 meters) apart., Add some organic matter like peat moss, which you can buy at a garden store, or compost, which you can make at home by combining dead plants, food scraps, and water in your backyard. Then place the gardenia in the hole and fill the hole halfway with some of the displaced soil., Pour enough water into the hole to saturate the soil. This will help settle the soil and reduce air pockets. Once you see the water drain away, refill the rest of the hole with the remaining soil., To maintain the moisture in the soil and keep its temperature constant, add 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) of organic mulch around the base of the plant. This may result in excess fertilizer salts in the soil, so water once a month with distilled water to drain them away., Gardenias should receive the equivalent of 1 inch (2.5 cm) of rain a week, but you can simply water your gardenia whenever the top inch of soil begins to feel dry. Check the moisture level by sticking your finger down into the soil at the base of the plant. If it feels dry, saturate the soil with water., Gardenias need humidity to thrive, so many people mist them regularly with a spray bottle of water. This can lead to fungal infection on the leaves, however, so it’s better to place the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water. You can also use a humidifier in the same room as an indoor plant to help with moisture., During the growing season, lay acid fertilizer, fish emulsion, or bone meal across the soil at the base of the plant. You generally won’t need to do this from November to February., Whenever you see your gardenia blooms begin to fade, clip them back to just below the leaf node. This will encourage continuous blooming.If you wish to prune the plant down, only do so when the plant is not actively growing (during the winter months is ideal). This will promote branching and give it a chance to heal.

, These pests can sicken your plants over time so it’s important to spot them early and treat the problem. Whiteflies look like miniature white moths and mealybugs look like tiny cotton balls stuck to the leaves. Check the top and bottoms of leaves as well as the stems for any insects., If you spot any pests, purchase an insecticidal soap or horticultural oil at a garden store and spray the tops and bottoms of all leaves. Do this 3 times, waiting about a week between each application., For cold snaps that produce frost, or throughout the winter months, bring potted gardenias inside. For planted gardenias, cover them with large tarps or blankets, or place a cardboard box over it."

Sunflower roots are sensitive to being moved, so transplanting them may kill them. They grow best at temperatures between 64 and 91ºF (18–33ºC), but you can plant at slightly lower temperatures, once the last frost has passed.Sunflowers usually take 80 to 120 days to mature and produce new seeds, depending on the variety.If the growing season is shorter than this in your area, plant the sunflowers two weeks before the last frost; most seeds will probably survive.;
, There are many sunflower varieties and hybrids, but most gardeners will only need to look at a couple characteristics, usually described on the seed packet or online listing. Be sure to check the sunflower's maximum height, since this ranges from dwarf varieties under 1 foot (30 cm), to giant sunflowers 15 ft (4.6 m) or taller. Also, decide between a sunflower that produces one stalk and flower, or one that branches out into multiple stalks with several smaller blooms.


It is not possible to grow plants from roasted sunflower seeds, but you can grow it from sunflowers in bird seed, as long as the outer shell is present., Moisten a paper towel slightly, so it is damp but not soaked or dripping. Place the sunflower seeds on one half of the towel, then fold it over to cover them.


If you have a large number of sunflower seeds, and don't mind a lower success rate, you can skip straight to planting. Seeds planted directly in the soil typically take 11 days to emerge.If you have a long growing season, try germinating seeds in batches one or two weeks apart, so you'll have blooms in your garden for a longer period of time.

, Put the damp paper towels in a plastic bag.Check on them once or twice a day, and continue once the seeds have sprouted. Typically, you'll see sprouts emerge from most of the seeds within 48 hours.Once this happens, move on to planting the seeds.


Keep the paper towels at a temperature above 50ºF (10ºC) for best results., If the seeds don't sprout within two or three days, try using a fingernail clipper to remove the edge of the shell.Be careful not to damage the seed inside. Add a few more drops of water if the paper towels are drying out.

, Sunflowers grow best with six to eight hours of sunlight a day, when they can get it.Choose a location that receives direct sunlight during most of the day.


Unless your garden receives strong wind, keep the sunflowers away from trees, walls, and other objects that block sunlight.

, Sunflowers grow long taproots, and may rot if the soil is waterlogged. Dig a hole 2 feet (0.6 meters) deep to check for hard, compacted soil.If you find any, try mixing compost into your soil bed to improve the drainage.

, Sunflowers are not too picky, and can grow in average garden soils without extra treatment. If your soil is poor, or you want to put in the extra effort to encourage growth, mix rich, loamy soil into your planting area. There is rarely any need to adjust your soil pH, but if you already own a pH kit, you may adjust it to between 6.0 and 7.2.Rich soil is recommended for giant varieties, since they require more nutrients., (15 cm) apart. Plant the seeds in holes or trenches one in. (2.5 cm) deep, or 2 in. (5 cm) if the soil is loose and sandy.Keep seeds at least 6 in. (15 cm) from each other, to give each one enough space to grow. If you only have a few seeds and don't want to thin out the weaker plants later, plant them 1 ft. (30 cm) apart instead, or up to 1.5 ft. (46 cm) for giant varieties.Cover the seeds with soil after planting.


If you are planting a large sunflower crop, space each trench 30 in (76 cm) apart, or at any distance convenient for your machinery., Keep the soil moist, but not soaking wet, until the sprouts emerge from the soil.While the sprouts are still small and fragile, water 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) away from the plant, to encourage root growth without washing the plants away., Birds, squirrels, and snails love sunflower seeds, and may dig them up even before the sprouts have emerged. Cover the ground with netting to make this more difficult without blocking sprouts. Place snail bait or snail repellent in a circle to form a barrier around your planting area.If deer are in your area, encircle the plants with chicken wire once they start growing leaves. You can use a 36 inch (91 cm) piece of chicken wire to surround the leaves and use a few 6 ft. (1.8 m) bamboo poles or wooden stakes to raise the chicken wire as the sunflowers grow. This should protect them from deer., Once the plants have formed stems and an established root system, reduce the watering frequency to once a week. Water generously during the weekly session, and increase the amount of water in dry weather. Sunflowers require more water than most other annual flowers.The period before and after your plant grows flower buds is a critical time and not getting enough water may damage it.Continue to water the your sunflowers weekly once the flower buds start to form.

, Once the flowers are about 3 in (7.5 cm) tall, remove the smaller, weaker flowers until the remainder are spaced at least 1 ft (30 cm) apart. This will give the larger, healthier sunflowers more space and nutrients, resulting in taller stalks and larger blooms.


Skip this step if you want small blooms to arrange in bouquets, or if you planted at this spacing to begin with.

, If you are growing sunflowers for your own enjoyment, fertilization is not recommended, since they grow well without it and can suffer if overfed. If you are trying to grow extra-tall sunflowers, or growing them as a crop, dilute the fertilizer in water and pour into a ""moat"" around the plant, well away from the base.A balanced or nitrogen-rich fertilizer are likely the best options.Another option is a one time application of slow-release fertilizer, worked into the soil.

, Plants over 3 ft (0.9 m) may need to be supported with stakes, as do varieties that produce multiple branches.Tie the stalk loosely to the stake using cloth or other soft material.

, Sunflower blooms often last 30–45 days. Toward the end of this period, the green back of the flower head will begin to turn brown.If you want to gather seeds for roasting, or for next year's planting, cover the flowers with paper bags to protect them from birds. Cut off the flowers once fully dry.


If left alone, the flowers will drop seeds for next year's crop. Harvesting them yourself guarantees protection from pests, however.

Choose an indoor type of begonia.,
Plant indoor begonias in a good indoor potting soil.,
Place indoor begonias where they get bright light.,
Keep indoor begonias warm.,
Water begonias carefully.,
Fertilize your begonias.,
Groom the plants regularly.",How to Care for a Begonia1," This list of begonias that grow well indoors is extensive. It is important to remember that some types of begonias are grown for their brilliantly colored flowers, while other begonias are enjoyed for their unique and beautiful foliage. Most begonias bought at nurseries will be labeled as indoor plants or outdoor plants.


If you are still uncertain of whether or not your plant will work well indoors, ask an employee at your local nursery.;
, When potting your begonias, you should keep three factors in mind: the type of soil, the size of pot, and the amount of soil you use.








When choosing your potting material, you want the soil to be relatively neutral or slightly acidic on the pH scale.
Your pot should roughly fit the size of your plant--you want to keep root growth in mind but do not want the pot to be overly large.
A pot that is too large can lead to using too much soil. When a pot contains too much soil, it can lead to soggy soil that could potentially ‘drown’ your plant roots and kill your begonia.

, Begonias like a lot of light so place them on windowsills that face east or west so that your plants get several hours of sunlight each day. Avoid southern windows from February through September, as they let in too much light, unless you hang thin curtains that filter the light.








If you choose to use fluorescent lights, you should place it 6 to 12 inches above your plant. You should keep the light on for roughly 12 hours a day, though some begonia growers leave their lights on for 14. Keep in mind that you will need to water your plant more often when you use artificial light., You will want to make sure that the minimum night temperature is 55ºF (13ºC). Begonias do not handle cold well and will suffer from lower temperatures.

, Water your plants when the surface of the potting soil feels moist but not soggy wet. You should water your plants more frequently when it is warm, the light is bright and the begonias are flowering heavily and putting out new growth. Water your plant until water runs out of the drainage holes.








Let the potting soil dry out slightly between watering during lower light and cooler temperatures of late fall and winter.
If possible, use room temperature water that has been distilled. Promptly empty drained water from trays and saucers.
Mist the foliage of Rex (foliage) type begonias twice a week or provide high humidity to avoid leaf drop. Use warm water in a misting bottle.

, You should fertilize your plants with a water-soluble fertilizer for blooming plants once a month from February through September. You should fertilize your plants less frequently during the late fall and winter months because your plant will not be growing as steadily during this time.








Mix the fertilizer according to the label’s directions.
Wait three months before fertilizing if the potting mix you used contained fertilizer.

, Your should remove dead flowers and leaves. You should also trim off broken stems to promote plant growth. Dust the leaves if it is needed.









Remove the small flowers of Rex type begonias as they start to bloom to concentrate the plants energy on foliage.

Plant the poppy plant to the same depth in the new soil.",How to Grow Poppies," Poppy seeds require exposure to cool or cold temperatures before they will reliably sprout. As long as the winter temperatures in your area do not fall below 0ºF (-18ºC), you may plant the seeds in autumn, before the first frost. In colder climates or if convenient, plant the poppy seeds in spring, as soon as the ground thaws.


The temperatures that allow for autumn planting correspond to United States Plant Hardiness Zones 7 and higher.If the winter temperatures in your area fall below -20ºF (-29ºC), consider planting the cold-resistant Iceland poppy.;
, If you divide your poppy seeds into groups and plant each group a week or two apart, your garden will have colorful flowers for a longer period of time. You may wish to plant half in the first week or two of spring, and the other half later in the spring to see which group suits your climate and poppy variety best.


If you will be planting poppies in autumn, then you don’t need to plant in stages.

, Generally, poppies grow best when they receive at least six hours of sunlight a day. However, if you live in a hot climate, select a spot where the poppies will be protected during the intense heat of the afternoon.


Purple poppies may retain a brighter, more attractive color in partial shade than in full sun., Soil with excellent water drainage is crucial, as poppies will rot in waterlogged soil. This is especially important during winter, when soil becomes wet or frozen. Begin testing by digging a hole 4 inches (10 cm) deep. Fill the hole with water, allow it to drain completely, then fill it a second time. Time how long it takes to drain again: this should take no more than four hours at the very most, and preferably less.

, If you cannot find a location in your yard with good drainage, try mixing the top 2 inches (5cm) of soil with compost and a little sand, or building a raised bed. Perennial poppies, which are able to live for longer than one year, may require compost or a store-bought garden soil to thrive even if the existing drainage is adequate., Use a shovel or tiller to loosen compact soil to a depth of approximately 8 inches (20cm). Poppy seeds grow one long taproot straight downward to collect water, and may not be able to push this important root through soil that is too hard., Pour the poppy seeds in a small container such as a pill bottle or pepper shaker. Add some sand, roughly twice as much by volume as the poppy seeds, and stir or shake them together. Poppy seeds are tiny and can clump together when sown. The sand will help space the seeds out, making it easier to plant them evenly.

, Sprinkle the poppy seeds and sand directly on top of the soil, then cover the seeds with a light dusting of fine soil. Don't bury the seeds, as too much soil will block available sunlight and prevent the tiny poppy seeds from germinating.


Avoid planting the seeds in clumps, which will interfere with growth. If you are planting poppies across a large area, take handfuls of seed and sand mixture and throw them out away from you as you walk across the garden or field.

, Use a watering can or spray bottle rather than a strong hose, in order to prevent washing away the tiny poppy seeds. Keep the soil lightly moist once mild spring weather begins. Depending on the poppy variety, it should then take 10 to 30 days for the seeds to sprout.

, Poppy plants may rot and die in soaked soils, so only water when the soil feels dry to a finger's depth. Typically, you only need to water the plants once every several days. Increase the amount of water per watering session in hot weather or if the poppies turn brown.


Avoid watering plants during the early afternoon, especially in sunny weather. The heated water can burn the leaves, and it may evaporate before it can be absorbed.

, While it's a good idea to remove weeds competing with your poppies as you see them, young poppy plants are small and easily pulled up by accident or mistaken for undesirable plants. Reduce the ability of weeds to grow in the first place by spreading two to three inches (6 to 8 cm) of organic mulch around the plants. A mulch such as bark chips will look attractive, and will keep the soil moist.

, Once the plants are one or two inches tall (2.5–5 cm), cut the smaller or weaker plants at the base using garden shears. Keep each remaining plant at least 6 inches (15cm) apart for the best chance at healthy growth and flowering.


Do not pull the plants out as this may disturb the root systems of the neighboring poppies.
Spacing plants out in this manner may also reduce the chance of mold and pest attacks, due to good air circulation and lower frequency of transmitting these problems from one plant to another.

, If you wish to hasten the growing rate, or if your soil is poor, you may add fertilizer once the plants are at least 5 inches (13cm) tall, and preferably 10 inches (26cm) for taller species. Use a low nitrogen, neutral pH fertilizer and apply as instructed on the packaging.Fertilizers display the balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium using three numbers. A low nitrogen fertilizer will have a lower first number, for example 2-5-5.

, Removing the spent blooms where they meet the stalk will encourage the plant to keep blooming throughout the summer. If left alone, the plants will turn yellow and wilt, but after several weeks they will drop their seeds naturally and likely result in dozens of new plants next year.Note that you should not cut off withered leaves from perennials if you would like them to remain healthy and bloom again next year.Allow the leaves to die naturally, and hide the brown color with longer-blooming flower varieties if you wish to keep your garden colorful.

, If you would like a new crop of poppy seeds, cut off the bulbous seed pods once they stand vertical and feel chalky to the touch. Dry them in the sunlight, cut them open, and shake them through a sieve over a container to catch the poppy seeds in.Because each plant produces hundreds of seeds, limit your collection to the healthiest and most attractive plants.

, Transplanting plants allow you to place the poppies more accurately, rather than casting them across the garden and seeing which seeds mature. However, due to their single, fragile taproot, poppies are easily killed during transplanting, especially large, adult plants. If possible, transplant poppy plants when they are young seedlings less than 3 inches (7.5cm) tall, and leave adult plants in their current container.


If you must transplant adult, perennial poppy plants, try to do so in late summer, after the most active growth period but before they begin to seed., Poppies require loose, well draining soil, and exposure to at least 6 hours of sunlight a day. Improve the soil by mixing in compost or manure if necessary.


More detail can be found in the section on planting seeds.

, Poppies are infamously fragile after transplanting, and they are more likely to die if they are exposed to more sunlight. Transplant in the early evening whenever possible to give them a full night of darkness to adjust to their new situation., It may take time for the poppies to adjust to the new location before the root begins to take in more water. Make sure they have at least some water stored already by watering them an hour or more before the transplant., If you were growing your seedling in a small container, make the hole larger than the container. Otherwise, you may need to guess at the size required, or pull out an extra seedling you do not intend to grow to examine its size.

, If you are transplanting from a container of several seedlings, carefully gather the soil around a central seedling, detaching other seedlings in the soil or moving them to the edge of the pot. This central seedling should not be handled directly, in order to minimize the damage.

, Try to keep the plant buried at the same depth it was before. Move it as gently as possible to avoid damaging the roots. Pack the soil loosely around the plant. Water it to hold the soil together, then care for it as you would any poppy plant.

Choose a variety of sunflower that fits your garden needs.,
Find a plot with full sun.,
Search for a spot sheltered from the wind.,
Check the pH of the soil.,
Make sure your soil drains well.,
Allow the soil to warm thoroughly before planting.",How to Grow Sunflowers1," While most sunflower varieties grow to be several feet tall, there are some miniature varieties that peak out at under three feet tall. Here's a list of popular varieties, large and small:



Mammoth: Their wooly namesakes may have gone extinct, but mammoth sunflowers grow just as tall as the prehistoric beasts, reaching a height of 9 to 12 feet (2.7 to 3.7 meters).

Autumn Beauty: This variety produces large flowers that grow up to six inches in diameter. It gets its name from the fall-like spectrum of flowers it produces. Bronze and mahogany flowers are not uncommon on these large stalks that can reach seven feet.

Sunbeam: Sunbeam is a medium-sized variety, standing at about five feet tall and producing flowers about five inches in diameter. Sunbeam flower petals are long and asymmetrical and the flower center is often yellow, making for a dramatic addition to any bouquet.

Teddy Bear: This miniature variety caps out at three feet tall and is perfect if you are tight on space in your garden.;
, Sunflowers thrive in warm to hot climates with full sunshine during the day. Climates with long hot summers are perfect for growing sunflowers.

, If possible, it is best to shield sunflowers from the wind. Plant sunflower seeds along a fence, the side of a house, or behind a row of sturdy trees. If possible, plant your sunflowers on the north side of your garden. This prevents the large sunflower stalks from shading other plants in your garden.

, Sunflowers prefer a slightly acidic to somewhat alkaline soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. However, sunflowers are relatively resilient and can grow in most types of soil.


Your local agricultural extension office should have soil testing forms, bags and instructions available. After making adjustments to the soil, test the pH level again.
If the pH level is below 6.0, enrich the soil using acid compost or planting mix.
If the soil pH is above 7.5, mix in granular sulfur to lower the pH level.

, Though sunflowers are extremely resilient, the one thing that can harm them is flooded soil.


Be sure that your plot has proper drainage, or opt to build a simple planter box instead.
If necessary, build a raised garden box out of cedar boards, which come in 8-foot lengths. Cedar is a good choice for a garden bed because it won't rot when exposed to water., Plant sunflower seeds at the beginning of summer after the soil has completely warmed. This usually occurs between mid-April and late May.

Regardless of whether you are planting your flowers in a pot or a garden, good soil is a must. Find out what the best soil conditions are for the flowers you are growing and then try to find the best location or potting mix for your flowers.






;
, Although flowers are typically easy to grow, they can’t be grown just anywhere. An area with too much direct sun or too much shade will be difficult for some flowers to grow in. Find out what type of light is best for the flowers you are planting.









If you have a specific plant in mind to grow, check the light preferences for that plant and choose your plot accordingly. You may end up wanting to choose an area with more or less sun than your original plot has.
If you plan on planting several different types of flowers, choose ones with similar light/shade requirements so that they grow equally well in the same location.

, Visit a local gardening center to choose the best flowers for your garden. Growing from seeds, a small plant, bulbs, or a cutting requires nearly the same process, so focus on flowers that you enjoy and that will add a beautiful appearance to your yard. Check the tags that come with the flowers or seed packets to make sure the flower is right for you.









Look for the completed growth size of the flower. Will it become very large and bushy, or stay relatively small? Will it grow upwards and become tall or outwards like a vine?
Ask about native flowers before looking at all the available varieties. Flowers indigenous to your area are already known to be successful growers in your soil, temperature, and humidity zones.
Check to see if the flower you are growing is an annual or a perennial. Annuals bloom only once a year and must be replanted yearly, but are known for their bright colors and beautiful blossoms. Perennials grow back every year without needing to be replanted and will continue to grow larger over time.
Read the tag for the watering requirements for the flowers. Some need water often, while others require it only infrequently. If you are getting multiple different species of flower, try to choose ones with similar watering requirements., Even with the perfect soil, ideal location, and healthy flowers, if you don’t plant at the right time your garden will be ruined. Most flowers don’t do well in weather that is too cold or hot, so it is usually best to plant flowers in spring because it is between these periods. Although planting in the spring may seem obvious, there is an art to choosing the perfect time. With the exception of bulbs and wildflowers—plant these flowers in the fall—wait to plant flowers till at least two weeks after the most recent frost, and avoid planting until temperatures at night stay above freezing on a regular basis.









Use a farmer’s almanac to find the best time to plant flowers in your area. Because of differences in weather in different locations, flowers can be planted anywhere from February - July.
Check the seed packets of the flowers you are planting to find the best planting time for your flowers.

, If you are planting your flowers from seed, you will usually only need to plant your seeds 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) deep, but it is important to check the specific planting recommendations for any flower you want to plant to find out how deep to plant them. A transplanted/potted flower will need a hole as deep as the root ball that it comes with. Flowers don’t need to be smothered with soil, so burying them deep isn’t necessary.








, This step is mainly for potted flowers that are being transplanted. While the flowers are still in a plastic pot, water them heavily to drench the soil. Then, pull the flowers out of the pot and gently break up the root ball with your fingers. This will help the roots of the flowers to grow out into the soil, rather than back into a confined lump.








, Putting a bit of slow-release food for flowers (similar to fertilizer) will help new plants to grow quickly. Add a few tablespoons to the bottom of each hole, and gently incorporate it into the soil with your fingers.








, Place each plant into the individual holes prepared for them. Use your hands to fill in the empty space around each flower and cover the top of the root ball. Avoid adding much soil to the top of the flower; the stem of the flowers should never be covered by the dirt.







, Unless you are experiencing rain on a daily basis, take the time to give water to your flowers. Add several cups of water to each plant by using a watering close to the soil to avoid disturbing the growing flowers or causing soil erosion. You can also have a sprinkler or drip system installed to do the work for you on an automated basis.








, You want your flowers to be the focal point of your little garden plot, so don’t let weeds steal the show! As you see them appear, pull out unsightly weeds from the soil around your flowers. Not only are the weeds unattractive, they take nutrients from the soil and space in the ground that your flowers need to grow healthily.








, Whenever blooms on your flowers die off or become old and wilted, cut them off. Cutting off the dead blossoms and leaves will stimulate new growth and have your flowers looking even more beautiful than ever.








, If your flowers are tall growing, over time they may become too heavy to stand on their own. Add bamboo stakes or forked branches upright in the ground for the plants to lean against or wrap around for support. This is particularly helpful and necessary for vine-y flowers which grow by wrapping around things.








, As you continue to help your flowers grow, they may become too large for the plot you originally chose for them. Consider moving them to a larger location and adding new flowers to their old location. This will keep your garden growing big, healthy, and beautiful!

Prepare to plant the bulbs in the fall.,
Choose tulip bulbs to plant.,
Decide where to plant the bulbs.,
Assess the planting site.,
Dig holes for the bulbs.,
Plant the tulip bulbs.,
Water the bulbs lightly.,
Watch for the tulips to sprout in the spring.",How to Plant Tulip Bulbs," After the summer weather has faded into fall, and the nights have gotten colder, it's time to plant your bulbs and start dreaming of spring again. You want to plant the bulbs before the first deep frost, which hardens the grounds and makes it much more difficult to dig holes for the bulbs. The bulbs should be planted when the soil is still at least 60 °F (16 °C).Plan to plant the bulbs within a week after buying them. They shouldn't stay above the ground for too long.Don't plant the bulbs too early, or they might come up before the weather gets cold and die as soon as the frosts come. They should lie dormant in the ground all winter and come up in the spring.;
, You can get them from a nursery, a home and garden store, or buy them online. Tulips are hardy flowers that will grow in most climates. Depending on what variety you buy, each bulb will produce one 1-4 stems and blossoms.









Choose bulbs that are firm to the touch with a light brown papery skin, almost like an onion skin.
Do not plant a bulb that is soft or shriveled, as it may be rotten or dead inside.

, Many people plant tulips along fences, walkways, or buildings to add little bursts of color. They're often planted in rows, since it's easy to control where they come up. Figure out where you want to plant your tulips as you get ready to plant them.








Tulips grow best in areas that are sunny or lightly shaded, and not excessively wet.
Tulips come in many colors, so it's easy to plant them in interesting patterns and shapes. You could alternate colors or plant a whole bed of multicolored tulips, for example. Design a tulip pattern that makes sense for your yard.

, Tulips grow in most soils, and there's not much you need to do to get it ready for planting. However, if the soil where you live is very dry or hard, you can wait to plant the tulips until a day after it has rained. Remove any weeds or stones and use a trowel to loosen and aerate the soil.








, Space the holes 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) apart, and dig them about 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the base of the bulb. So if you have a 1-inch bulb, you'll need a 9-inch hole. The larger the bulb, the deeper the hole must be.









As you dig, clear away roots, rocks and other debris that could impede the growth of your tulips.
You can sprinkle kitty litter, gravel, holly leaves, or thorny bush branches into the hole to deter mice and other rodents from occupying the hole., Place them in the holes pointy-side up (otherwise they'll try to sprout downward). Sprinkle the soil back into the holes and pack it down with your hands, taking care not to tilt the bulbs in another direction.









Tulip bulbs are naturally perennials, meaning they can come back more than once. In most climates, though, the soil isn't conducive to more than one year of growth, and the bulb only contains enough nutrients for it to bloom once. If you want the tulips to come back after the first year, place some plant food in the holes before closing them back up.

, Right after planting, give the bulbs some water. This helps them begin the process of growing. Don't give them a soaking, though; bulbs will decay and die if they get too wet.









Don't water the bulbs again unless it's extremely dry outside. Unless the ground is very dry, there is no need to water the bulbs. Newly planted bulbs may rot if the soil becomes sodden and waterlogged. There should be enough rain through the autumn and winter to provide your bulbs with enough moisture.

, By March or April in the northern hemisphere and September or October in the southern hemisphere, your bulbs should have transformed into beautiful spring tulips.

Pick the right location for planting.,
Plant your begonias in fertile soil.,
Water outdoor begonias.,
Fertilize begonias.,
Remove dead flowers and leaves frequently.,
Cut back your begonias.,
Enjoy your beautiful begonias!

",How to Care for a Begonia2," Plant all types of begonias outside in a partly or lightly shaded location after all danger of frost has passed. Use Tuberous begonias for planters or hanging baskets. Use fibrous rooted begonia for creating beautiful flower beds.








Place begonias where they get early morning or late afternoon sun to ensure that you get the best bloom. You can also place them in a location where they get dappled sunlight all day.
Avoid sitting begonias in containers on hot surfaces such as asphalt or concrete.
Start tuberous begonias inside 3 months before your last frost in the spring for best blooming results. See notes on how to start them.

, Begonias like fertile that is rich in nutrients. You can create this sort of soil by adding peat moss to the area, as well as thoroughly rotted compost. You also have to make sure that your plants’ roots have good drainage or else they could rot.









Try to avoid planting begonias in areas with strong wind, as they have weak stems that can be damaged by large gusts of wind.

, You want to make sure that you water begonias so that their soil is moist by not soggy. This means letting the top inch of soil dry out before water the plants again. Soggy soil can lead to a rotting or dead begonia.








Water begonias planted in containers until the water runs from the drainage holes.Dump the drained water out of any trays or saucers immediately after watering.
Check hanging baskets of begonias frequently as they can dry out in one day. If you find that the soil is dry to the touch, water the plant.

, Begonias prefer a balanced fertilizer, meaning that the fertilizer is neutral rather than acidic or basic. Work a slow release granular fertilizer into the ground where you plan to plant your begonias.








Read and follow the label’s directions for the amount to use.
Repeat the fertilizer application in three months by gently working it in the soil around the plants.
Use a water-soluble fertilizer for blooming plants once a week if you do not use a granular fertilizer.

, Doing this will ensure that the healthy parts of the plant are free to keep growing.








, Cut back bedding or fibrous begonias to 3”(7.6 cm) every 4 months in mild climates where there is no frost to renew the plants. This will ensure that they continue to grow and remain healthy.









Bring in bedding begonias that were growing outside to grow inside for the winter. Dig them before the first frost and pot them. Cut the plants back to about 3” to start new growth. See indoor care above.

Loosen the soil using your hands or a hand trowel.,
Dig one-inch deep holes, spaced six to 18 inches (45.7 cm) apart, depending on the varietal size.,
Place a few seeds in each hole and cover with soil.,
Mix a thin layer of fertilizer after planting the seeds.,
Water thoroughly after planting and fertilizing.",How to Grow Sunflowers2," You want the soil to be loose and light when sowing your sunflower seeds. If your soil is low in nutrients or drains poorly, mix in three to four inches of compost.

, You can simply use your hands to dig these small holes. If planting in rows, make sure to allow about 30 inches (76.2 cm) of soil between each row. Sunflowers need a lot of space to grow healthily.


For large sunflower types, allow 18 inches (45.7 cm) of space between seeds.
For medium-sized sunflower types, allow 12 inches (30.5 cm) of space between seeds.

, You can stagger your planting over a few weeks in order to experience blooms at different times throughout the summer. Since sunflowers are annuals, meaning they flower once per year, staggering your seeds will allow you to enjoy blooms over a longer period of time.

, Choose an organic fertilizer when possible and spread it over the seeding area to promote strong stalks.

, Make sure you wet the soil, but do not drench or flood the seeds."
"
Water the plants thoroughly once or twice a week.,
Mulch the area.,
Stake if necessary.,
Exterminate pests and mildew.,
Cut flowers for display.,
Harvest the seeds.",How to Grow Sunflowers3," Sunflowers have deep roots and prefer infrequent, heavy watering to frequent, shallow watering.Adjust your watering routine on particularly hot or cloudy weeks. Your sunflowers should bloom in mid to late summer, between two and three months after planting.

, Once the seedlings are tall enough to mulch without breaking them, cover the soil with a layer of seed-free straw or other mulch to retain moisture and prevent weed growth. Top up the mulch after heavy rain.If you're growing sunflowers as a seed crop or to display in flower shows, mulch with 1.5 inches (4 cm) of well-rotted manure or compost once the plants are 20 in. (0.5 m) tall.

, If you live in a windy area or your stalks lack strength, consider staking the plants with wood or bamboo stakes to support the weight of the plant.

, Though relatively free of insect susceptibility, a small gray moth may lay eggs in the sunflower face. Simply pick out the small worms to remove them.


Sunflowers also have the ability to contract mildew and rust. If either of these issues occurs, spray your flowers with a fungicide.
Deer and birds are also known to eat sunflower plants. Put up netting to prevent these animals from destroying your plants.

, To enjoy the flowers in a vase, cut the stalk at an angle in the morning before the flower fully opens. Change the water in the vase every other day to keep the flowers looking fresh.

, If you want edible seeds, cut the flower heads off when they begin to droop, or when the back of the head begins to turn yellow. Hang them upside down by the stem in a dry, breezy place and cover with cheesecloth or a paper bag to catch seeds as they fall out.


For delicious roasted seeds, soak overnight in water and salt. Then drain and place on a baking sheet. Roast in a low-heat oven (between 200°F and 250°F / 90 to 120ºC) until slightly browned.

, Plants that are in full bloom in the store will lose their flowers shortly after bringing them home.

,


Look at the roots that are starting to emerge from the drain holes in bottom of the pot. The roots should be flexible. Don't buy the plant if the roots are brittle or dehydrated.
Reject potted flowers if roots are visible above the potting dirt.

, These decide the plant's shapeliness and density.


Choose flowering plants with major stems that are sturdy and robust. Reject potted flowers with broken or wounded stems.
Buy potted flowers with at least 6 main stems accented by a few smaller branches. Avoid any that only have 1 dominant trunk.
Look for stems that are well balanced around the plant. This is preferable to stems concentrated on just 1 side.

,


Choose short potted flowers with thick foliage. Reject potted flowers that are tall and frail.
Select potted flowers with new growth. Budding leaves are a sign of good health.
Avoid plants with limp, wilting, yellow, speckled or browning leaves.
Be wary of potted flowers treated with a man-made leaf shiner. Leaves appearing unusually glossy or feeling slick have probably been artificially polished.

Bring your pot inside before the first frost.",How to Grow Cannas," Cannas are a warm weather plant that don’t do well in cold weather. Wait until spring to plant your cannas--when the soil becomes soft and warm from sunlight, its time to get planting.If you live in a colder area where the warm season is rather short, you could consider starting your cannas in an indoor pot. See Part Three for how to care for indoor cannas.;
, As tropical plants, cannas require a lot of sun. A lot of sunlight will allow your cannas to bloom to their full extent--and that’s something you definitely want. Cannas are known for the bright, beautiful flowers and intricate and colorful leaf patterns. Give your plant the sun it needs and you will be sure to have an exquisite garden.

, While cannas will survive in almost any soil, it does need to be able to drain. The way to tell if you have found a good spot is to check on the spot after a rain shower (or hose shower). If the soil still has puddles five or six hours after a shower, you will have to find another spot. While cannas do like moist soil, they don’t like soggy roots.


If you don’t have another spot to plant you cannas, you can help your spot to dry by adding organic material to the spot. You can raise the level two or three inches using compost, peat moss, or ground bark--all of which you can buy at your local garden or yard supply store.

, If you are going to plant one of the tall varieties of cannas, you will need to choose a spot where these tall beauties will be relatively protected from strong wind. In a strong wind, cannas stalks can snap or bend in a damaging way., You can do this with a tiller or garden fork. Mix in a layer of compost that is 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 cm) deep. The compost will give the soil an extra boost of nutrients that your cannas will appreciate., Place a single tuber (or rhizome) in the hole with the eye (or growing points) facing up. Plant additional tubers approximately 1 foot (.30 m) apart for dwarf to medium varieties and at least 2 feet (.61 m) apart for tall varieties., Press the soil down and water thoroughly. Watering the area will help to settle the soil around the tuber.

, The mulch will help retain moisture and will also keep the weed population at bay., Your sprouts should begin to show their heads a couple of weeks after planting, though if you live in a colder climate it might take a week or two longer. Cannas need heat to help them begin growing. For optimum blooming, apply a fertilizer rich in nitrogen to cannas about once a month.

, Cannas need moist soil, so its important to water your cannas regularly. If you live in an area where rainfall is one inch or less (2.54 cm) each week, you will need to water your cannas once a week. If you find yourself in a dry spell, water whenever you notice the soil getting dry., If you notice that your taller cannas are a little droopy, tie them to stakes to help them grow and support their own weight. Learn how to stake your plants here.

, As your plant’s flowers bloom and fade away, remove the dead foliage. You can tell what is dead by looking for a faded brownish yellow color. Pick these away, taking care that you don’t disrupt the still living parts of the plant. Do not cut leaves until they yellow because they will continue to provide nutrients to the plant even when it is not blooming., If you live in an area that gets frost, you will need to dig up your rhizomes after the frost kills the foliage of your cannas. Cut the plants back so that they are six inches tall and carefully dig the rhizomes up from the ground.


Some cannas specialists believe that you should let the rhizomes dry for several days before moving onto the next step., Both peat moss and perlite can be purchased at your local garden supply store. Once you have filled the box, place each bunch of rhizomes in the box, making sure that each plants rhizomes don’t touch one another.


You can also put them in a brown paper bag lined with peat moss or perlite if you don’t have a plastic box to spare.

, You should pick a spot that can have a maintained temperature of 45 to 55 degrees F (7.2 to 12.7 degrees C). Check on them every once in a while. If you notice that the moss is getting dry, lightly spray it with water so that it gets slightly damp. Your cannas will go into hibernation during this time, and will be able to be replanted in the spring, just like the first time you planted them., Dwarf cannas grow to about three feet tall. They come in a variety of colors, such as the bright red Ambassador or the City of Portland, which is known for its salmon color. Regular cannas are much larger in size, so dwarf cannas tend to grow better when potted., Potted cannas will grow in almost any potting medium that can be purchased at a garden supply store--they’re really not very picky. However, it must be soil that drains well, as cannas don’t do well with soggy roots and could develop mold.

, You will also have to choose your container based on the size of the variety of canna you are choosing to plant. If you are not sure how large your specific canna can grow, run an online search or ask someone to help you at your garden supply store.Remember, you can plant your cannas with other plants in your container, but just remember that all of the plants in one container must have the same water and sunlight needs or else they will not do very well.

, Plant your rhizomes (or tubers) in these holes, making sure that each dwarf or medium rhizome is at least 1 foot (.30 m) away from the next rhizome, unless you are planting them in a container, in which case you can often fit two or three tubers in a container. If you have a larger variety of canna rhizome, make sure that there is at least 2 feet (.61 m) distance between rhizomes. Make sure that the growing points (or eyes of the tuber) or pointing up., You should water your cannas right after you plant them so that the soil will settle around them and they can start to grow. When they have begun to sprout, water your plant as much as needed, keeping an eye on the soil to make sure that it is always relatively moist (though not soaking wet).

, It is recommended that you bring your cannas outside so that they can get full sunlight during the warm months. If you do choose to keep them inside, make sure they are near a window that provides them with bright sunlight for most, if not all, of the day.

, If you did bring your cannas outside for the summer months, make sure that you bring them back inside before the first frost has the chance to harm them. Store them indoors where the temperature stays at around 45 and 60 degrees F (7.2 to 15.5 degrees C).You can also dig up the rhizomes and store them in a plastic box with peat moss or perlite.

Choose plants hardy for your zone.,
Choose a well-drained planting area that gets six hours of sunlight.,
Plant bulbs in the fall and avoid storing them.,
Add well-draining organic matter to the soil.,
Plant lilies in well-spaced groups of three to five bulbs.,
Cover with mulch to insulate the bulbs.",How to Grow and Care for Asiatic Lilies1," Asiatic lilies are generally hardy plants, but need a cool period for overwintering. For this reason, they’re not the best choice for outdoor gardens in regions that don’t experience cooler winter temperatures.Your local home improvement store or nursery will likely carry plants appropriate for your area. Check with staff for help choosing plants that will thrive in your climate.
You can also look for a local public garden or arboretum. Their plants will most likely be labeled, which will help you choose varieties for your own garden.;
, Your planting area should have enough drainage that water doesn’t pool after heavy rain. It should receive at least six hours of full sunlight, preferably in the early morning or late afternoon.Lilies can tolerate less than six hours of sun, but less light exposure will result in spindly plants that produce fewer blooms and lean toward the sun.

, Planting in the fall will keep plants in a normal blooming cycle. Plant bulbs as soon as you bring them home. Asiatic lily bulbs will dry out quickly, since they lack a paper-like covering called a tunic.You can plant bulbs in the early spring, and they’ll likely flower later in the year then readjust to their normal bloom cycle the following year.

, Remove rocks and other debris from the soil, and loosen it with a garden tiller if it’s tightly compacted. Use the tiller to incorporate a layer of organic matter, such as peat moss, at least six inches (15 cm) deep into the soil. This will help ensure your soil can provide enough drainage for your lilies., Plant a group of three to five similarly-sized bulbs about six inches (15 cm) deep, measuring from the top of the bulbs. Space the bulbs about eight inches (20 cm) apart. Be sure to plant bulbs with their tops facing up.You can tell a bulb’s top from its bottom by looking for the pointed tip at the top and the hair-like roots at the bottom.
Repeat planting groups of bulbs until you’ve planted all of your bulbs. Space each group about three feet (about a meter) apart.

, If you’re planting in the fall, cover your planting area loosely with four to six inches (10 to 15 cm) of mulch before the first frost. A layer of winter mulch will help delay the soil from freezing, giving the bulbs a little extra time to establish their roots. It will also help minimize temperature fluctuations, which will make the shoots stronger come springtime."

Moss roses are succulents, storing water in large, fleshy leaves. This means that they will be fine if you forget to water them.They can grow in poor soil or even rock gardens.However, they might drown in a very rainy climate.
Moss roses are low-lying, rarely topping six inches in height. They are good for borders and pots, but do not command large-scale attention on their own.Moss roses can absorb the carbon dioxide from car exhaust especially efficiently. This means that they are sometimes used to line driveways, or parking lots.Though some varieties of their seeds are edible to humans, moss roses are toxic to pets. Do not plant them where a dog or cat can snack on them.;
, Now that you know you’re ready for moss roses, it’s time to figure out where to put them. Since moss roses love sun, make sure they will get full sunlight for at least part of the day. If you are planning to use them in a flower display, plan to put them in front, as portulaca plants are low-lying.


To know how many moss rose plants you need for a border, measure the length in yards or meters, then divide by three--that’s the number of roses you need to fill the border with plenty of space between the young plants. Don’t worry; moss roses grow fast, so you won’t have gaps for long.You don’t have to plant moss roses outside. They are pretty in pots, too, as long as they get plenty of sunlight., If you are a more confident gardener, you may already be planning to work with seeds. If you would prefer to begin your garden with a little bit of a head start, seedlings may work for you. There are pros and cons to each, so think about it and decide which suits you better.Seeds are cheaper, and you can start growing them (indoors or outdoors) whenever you’re ready. However, it can be difficult to wait two weeks for them to germinate, and then an additional month until they're sturdy enough to move.
Seedlings are convenient and already healthy, but because a greenhouse has done the work of germination for you, they are often expensive.

, You can buy moss rose seedlings at any local greenhouse, since they are popular summer plants, though they may be tricky to find in grocery stores. Seeds can also be found in greenhouses or garden supply stores, or well-reviewed online shops.

, If you're using seeds and experiencing a long winter, you should start growing inside. This will keep the seedlings warm and protected until you’re ready to plant them outdoors. Your specific seed variety will probably have instructions, but in general, moss roses grow in similar ways.


Place seeds uncovered on shallow dry soil (a few inches deep is fine) and keep at room temperature.You can sprinkle them with a little water every few days, but they don’t need much.
The seeds should germinate within two weeks, but wait an additional month before you move them., Moss roses are used to balmy summer climates. As hardy as they are with little water, a cold snap can easily kill them.Keep seedlings inside until you’re certain the ground won’t freeze. Treat them as you would if they were outside--make sure they get full sun and a sprinkle of water every now and then.

, Once the frost is gone for good, it’s time to plant your seeds or seedlings outside. Make sure to space them out (12 inches, or .3 meters, is great) and cover them with minimal soil. They should be thriving in no time.


If you live in a warm area, you can plant seeds directly--just scatter them on the ground and cover with a little seeding soil.If you’re transplanting home-grown or commercial seedlings into the warmed ground, dig a small hole the size of the container the seedlings are in, then lift up the plant by its base and place it into the hole., Plan to baby your moss roses for their first few days outside. For about a week, water them on a daily basis, since the roots have not yet expanded to fill the full area needed to get water to the whole plant.After this first week, you can water them less frequently.

, You should try to mimic desert rain habits by watering the plants thoroughly, and letting them dry out before watering them again. Watering them about once a week will usually work well. Make sure they don’t experience too much runoff from other plants that need more water.

, Not only would it be a tragedy to lose the flowers, but they could poison the animals you know. You probably already planted the seeds where they couldn’t be reached by your own pets--make sure to prevent other pets in the neighborhood from running amok through your garden, too., This is one of the few tasks you will have to do for your portulaca on a frequent basis once your plant is settled. Manually removing blossoms that have gone to seed ensures that your plants replace dead flowers. To deadhead, take a firm hold on a dried-up bloom, and them pull steadily. It will come off, revealing the bud of a new flower beneath it.Save a few of the heads if you want to reuse the seeds next year.

, Moss roses are nearly as versatile as many weeds, but they can still be choked out if you don’t remove invasive plants. Weed weekly at the very least, for the amount of water your garden gets, and its fertility, are both factors in how many weeds your garden will attract.

, Most moss rose varieties are annuals, which means that they don’t live past the autumn. You can replant them next year, even using the seeds you collected when deadheading them. Just crush the old flowers to reveal the seeds, then place them in an envelope and keep it in a cool, dry place until next year."

Make sure to water your Rose Bush adequately.",How to Save a Dying Rose Bush," The first thing you should do is to clear up the area around your Rose Bush. Weeds growing around your Rose Bush may be sucking up all the nutrients in the soil.


Fallen leaves and flowers should be picked up by hand instead of raked. Raking “disrupts” the soil and may expose weed seeds to sunlight, therefore urging them to sprout.
Always remove any dead flowers and fallen leaves from the ground around your Rose Bush. These may look harmless, but if they get wet and do not dry properly, mold will fester and may infect your Rose Bush.;
, Dead flowers and leaves that are still attached to the rose bush can either be plucked off or pruned using shears as closest to the cane as possible.

, Weeds around your rose bush should also be removed. Make sure you have a firm grasp of the weed, as close to the roots as possible and give it a good tug. Roots should be removed or else they will sprout again in as little as a matter of days.

, You should consider pruning your rose bush as soon as the weather starts to warm up—usually right after the last frost so that your rose bush is not at risk of being damaged by another frost or sudden rise in temperature.


You should also prune your rose bush when the buds start to swell. Check your rose bush for signs of new leaf growth and if the buds are starting to grow red in color.
Sometimes, pruning depends on the type of rose you have. There are some roses that require pruning while dormant, whilst other roses require pruning after they bloom. A rose bush should be pruned while it's dormant if you notice that it produces new growth in the spring and the blooms come from this new growth. However, if the blooms come from the old canes, then it should be pruned after it blooms instead.

, You do not want to cause more harm to the canes by using blunt shears. Also try to avoid cutting at a straight line. Instead, try cutting at an angle because it will help the cane heal quicker.


Don't hesitate to cut off the all dead and diseased looking canes in your Rose Bush, before it starts infecting the healthy ones. Also prune old canes to allow new growth

, Prune the center of the bush to allow maximum air circulation to prevent fungi growth due to accumulating moisture. This also allows for better exposure to the sun. Prune the growth on main canes that don't grow to a reasonable thickness. If the growth is no thicker than a pencil, then it should be pruned.


Prune old and dead canes down to where it meets fresh ones. You can tell that a cane is dead or diseased if it has dead leaves and is “woody”, characterized by a dried and brown appearance.

, You can tell if a bush is overgrown if it looks like a huge shrub of intertwined canes—basically a tangled mess. Most overgrown bushes will have dead canes and unproductive canes. Don't hesitate to prune as many canes as needed.

, To get your Rose Bush back to it's healthy state, make sure to provide adequate nutrients to your soil. Water the soil thoroughly before spreading the ingredients evenly around the bush up to the outer perimeter. Afterward, water again. To make a nutrient-rich soil feed:


1 cup bone meal or super phosphate
1 cup cottonseed meal
½ cup blood meal
½ fish meal
½ Epsom salt (magnesium sulphate)

, Most people fertilize their rose bush at the start of spring, however, if you notice new growth in your rose bush, you can start giving it fertilizer even if it's a bit early. Your rose bush will require more nutrition when it is growing and budding.


During the peak growing season, fertilize your rose bush every 4-6 weeks.

, Watering it before applying fertilizer prevents the fertilizer from burning your plant.

, If the fertilizer is allowed to come into contact with your plant’s leaves, the fertilizer will burn the leaves and cause them to wilt. Because of this, make sure that you keep the fertilizer at the base of the plant.

, This will allow the soil to retain more moisture for the roots and discourage weed growth, which will compete with your Rose Bush for nutrients and moisture.


If the area around your rose bush has a good drainage, you can apply 2–4 inch (5.1–10.2 cm) layer of mulch. If the drainage is poor, a thinner layer should be used. This is to make sure that your rose bush does not drown in too much water.

, The newspaper or cardboard mulching technique is highly recommended for those with extreme weed problems. This is done by placing a layer of newspaper or cardboard the whole area of soil and adding a top layer of mulch. This is to prevent any weed seeds from being exposed to the sun as to avoid allowing them to sprout.

, During the summer or if you live somewhere where the temperature reaches 90 degrees, it is recommended that you water your rose bush for 15 minutes straight, daily. During the winter, you can just water your Rose Bush every other day.

Prune lilacs regularly to increase flowering and air circulation.Cut off some of the oldest, largest branches as close to the ground as possible at the end of winter.,
Cut lilacs when their blossoms are mature.,
Dry lilacs hanging upside down.",How to Grow Lilacs," Visit a nursery to pick out a variety of lilac to grow. In addition to color, pay attention to the full-grown height of the plant. Some plants, such as Palibin' and Superba lilacs, grow into 5 to 6 - foot bushes. Others, such as Syringa reticulata, become 20 to 30 - foot trees.


You can purchase bare-root or container-grown plants from a local nursery or mail order plant supply company. Your local garden center or nursery should be able to recommend lilac varieties that do best in your area.You can also transplant saplings, runners from a friend or neighbor's lilac bush. Dig up and transplant saplings from a friend or neighbor's lilac bush in the spring, just as leaf buds begin to form or when the newly-opened leaves are still small. Choose saplings that are at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall. Use a shovel to dig the saplings out of the ground with as much of a root base as possible. Cut the runners with the shovel blade to separate the sapling from the parent plant.;
, Lilacs need full sun, so find a spot that receives at least 6 hours of sun each day and has good air circulation. Lilacs grown in damp stagnant air or without enough sunshine are prone to disease. Lilacs also need well-drained soil. If drainage is a problem, create a mound or raised bed for them before planting.Avoid planting lilacs too close to a wall or tree. The lilacs' roots need room to spread out., Soak the roots in tepid water for 10-15 minutes. Loosen the root ball by using your fingers to gently separate the roots., Dig a hole in the soil deep enough to bury the roots. The base of the plant should sit at ground level. After setting the lilac in the hole, fill it up halfway with soil, then water it before filling up the rest of the hole. Bring the soil level up even with the natural flare at the bottom of the base. Covering the base beyond this point could smother the roots and kill the plant.


If the soil where you live isn't very rich, add some compost, bone meal, or fertilizer to the hole before planting the lilac.Sprinkle lime on the soil over the roots of the lilac if you have acidic soil. Follow manufacturer's application instructions and reapply every 3 to 5 years. Lilacs prefer a neutral to slightly acidic pH of 5 to 7.
If you're planting more than one lilac bush, space the holes you dig 5–15 feet (1.5–4.6 m) apart, depending on what variety you're planting., Water several times a week throughout the summer, except when your region gets heavy rain. Water deeply from the base of the plants and allow the ground to dry out before you water again.

, Use compost or a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer each year in the spring. Depending on your soil conditions, you may want to fertilize them again when the flowers first begin to open.

, Take branches from different areas, including the center, to open the bush up where needed. Never remove more than 1/4 of the branches at any one time.


Remove diseased or damaged branches and suckers sprouting up from the base as soon as you discover them.
Cut off dead flowers to prevent the plant from putting resources into forming seeds.
Prune the bush again in the fall after flowering is done to shape it or remove branches with low flower production.

, Cut them right at their peak, when their color and scent are strongest. This will ensure they'll last as long as possible in your flower arrangement. Place them in a vase of clean water immediately.

, Gather a bunch of freshly harvested lilacs and bind their stems with a rubber band. Hang them upside down in a cool, dark place for 1 - 3 weeks. Gently remove the rubber band when the lilacs are completely dry.



Dry lilacs using silica gel. Fill a large glass or plastic container with an inch of silica gel. Place a few stems of freshly harvested lilac into the container so that they stand up in the gel. Fill the rest of the container with gel so that it completely covers the lilac. Put a lid on the container and wait a week or so for the lilacs to dry. Remove them from the jar and use them in a flower arrangement.

Build a trellis with the rose’s size in mind.,
Set up the climbing structure.,
Choose the climbing rose you would like to grow.,
Prepare a hole for your rose.,
Plant your rose.,
Water your rose.",How to Train Climbing Roses1," Erect a trellis, or other structure suitable for climbing, near the rose. The trellis must be large enough and sturdy enough to hold the climbing rose when it reaches its mature height. A smaller climbing rose will do fine with a 2- to 5-foot tall trellis.


A larger climber like the Banksian rose will require a large arbor, pergola or other sturdy structure.
Once a climbing rose is established you won't be able to replace the trellis without severely damaging the plant, so try to purchase or build a trellis that will last for several decades.;
, Set up the climbing structure 1 ½ feet away from the rose, if the rose is already planted. If the support structure is a fence with the first rail raised a few feet off the ground, push 2- to 3-foot tall stakes into the ground just in front of the fence.


If the rose is not yet planted, put the trellis wherever you would like your roses to grow.

, For an all-around perfect rose, choose the Meiviolin, or Eden rose. These roses climb quickly, and their large traditional blooms will add elegance to any garden.


If you live in a tricky climate or you are new to growing roses, consider growing the New Dawn variety. It may be hard to find in your local area but it is resistant to nearly everything.
If you have a few roses under your belt and want something different, the Madame Alfred Carrière is an excellent climber that produces large stunning blooms that remain until very late in the season. These are ideal for a large-scale project like a large arbor.

, To begin, secure your trellis or fence and prepare a large hole twice the size of the rose plant.


The hole should be slightly more than a foot away from the support or trellis to allow for air circulation.

, Plant the rose, paying close attention to where the roots meet the topsoil. If you live in warm climate leave about two inches of topsoil over the top of the root. If you live in colder climates, or can experience harsh winters, plant the root four to six inches below the topsoil.


These depths are important to allow the roots to grow without exposure. The topsoil also helps drain water away, reducing the chances that your rose roots will rot.

, Water your rose thoroughly without wetting the leaves of the plant. Introduce fertilizer to the plant as well as bone meal to encourage healthy growth. Roses like well-drained, rich soil so apply organic material such as compost or peat to the area.


Remember to keep the stem clear from too much material to deter disease.

Choose a deep container for healthy plants.,
Place a layer of drainage material at the bottom of the container.,
Fill the container with well-draining potting soil.,
Plant a group of bulbs at least as deep as their height.,
Place your container in a well-lit area.,
Transfer potted lilies to the garden or a cool area for overwintering.",How to Grow and Care for Asiatic Lilies2," A deep pot is essential for growing healthy Asiatic lilies in a container. Go for a container with a diameter of at least nine inches (23 cm) and a depth of eight inches (20 cm) or more.A pot at this minimum size can accommodate one large bulb with a diameter of four to five inches (10 to 12 cm) or three to four smaller bulbs with diameters less than three inches (eight cm)., Before filling the pot with soil, you’ll need to add a layer of drainage material. Spread two inches (five cm) of small rocks, gravel, or another suitably loose material at the base of the pot.If you’ve recently broken a pot, you can use its pieces for part of your drainage layer.

, Asiatic lilies aren’t terribly fussy about their soil, but it does need to drain well. For best results, look for a potting soil labeled for lilies at your local garden center or nursery. If you have soil on hand that feels too moist and dense, mix four parts of it with one part peat moss or horticultural grit., Roughly measure or estimate the height of the bulb or bulbs you’re planting. Dig a hole at least twice as deep as bulbs’ approximate height. That way, you’ll be able to cover each bulb with a soil depth equal to its height, measuring from the top.If you’re planting more than one bulb, space them about two inches (five cm) apart.

, If you’re keeping your container indoors, choose a spot less than three feet away from a window. It should receive six to eight hours of direct sunlight.If you’re keeping your container outdoors, choose a well-lit area that won’t get drenched in rain. Go for a covered area or a spot in a wall’s rain shadow.

, Potted lilies shouldn’t be kept in warm indoor environments all year long. You can keep indoor plants in their pots until the late fall, then plant them in your outdoor garden.If your location doesn’t experience cool winters, consider overwintering Asiatic lilies in a cooler set to a temperature of about 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius).

Fertilize your lilies when shoots and buds appear.,
Water your plants once per week.,
Remove flowers when they start to fade and drop.,
Cut the stems and foliage when they’re no longer green.",How to Grow and Care for Asiatic Lilies3," Lilies planted outdoors will start to send shoots in the early spring. When the last threat of frost has passed, remove the layer of winter mulch. Spread a loose two inch (five cm) layer of high phosphorous, slow-release fertilizer at the first sight of shoots.Fertilize the plants once more when they start to produce buds.

, Water indoor containers and outdoor gardens about once per week. The soil should dry slightly, but you should avoid letting it dry out completely. Avoid completely soaking the soil or letting water pool.Water the plants close to the soil to avoid getting leaves wet. Keeping the leaves from getting wet will help you prevent disease.

, Deadhead fading flowers by gently breaking them off or clipping them. Take care to only remove spent flowers, leaving stems and foliage intact.Deadheading your plants will keep them from wasting energy on producing seeds.

, After your plants bloom, keep their stems and foliage intact as long as they remain green. When they turn yellow or brown, cut the stems back so the plant can overwinter.Leaving green foliage intact as long as possible is vital, as it will keep producing energy that will help it overwinter.

Monitor your rose’s canes.,
Secure your canes from the backside.,
Do not tie your canes too tightly.,
Prune off the old canes when the climbing rose is three years old.",How to Train Climbing Roses2," When the climbing rose grows canes or stems long enough to reach your trellis, tie them to the climbing structure. Use strong twine or plastic tape. Hold each cane up against the climbing structure so that it runs across the trellis, or other structure, horizontally, at a 45-degree angle or as close to an angle as possible.


Begin training the plant by selecting only the largest, healthiest, sturdy canes and fastening them to the trellis in as straight a manner as possible. Use a material such as netting or rose trellis bands to allow the ties to expand when the canes grow.

, Run a piece of twine or plastic tape through the structure from the backside and loop it around the cane. Push the other end of the twine or plastic tape back through the structure and tie it from the backside.

, Leave it loose enough for the cane to continue to grow without restriction. Bend the tips of the canes so that they are pointing down and tie them into place in the same way. As the canes grow longer, repeat the process further up and loosen the lower ties if they have become too snug.


Tie the lateral shoots or stems that grow from the main canes in the same way when they get long enough. Tying the canes and stems in this way will result in a lovely display of flowers.

, Pruning your rose can be done by removing the ties on the oldest, gray, woody-looking canes and cutting them off at the base. These old canes produce few, if any, roses and should be removed to make way for the new canes.


As the new canes grow, attach them to the support structure as you did with the old canes.

Before you go about pruning your rose, it’s helpful to know which kind you have. If you’re not sure, know that roses with flexible canes and blooms from older growth are typically once blooming.
If you still can’t tell, prune the plant as if it were a once blooming rose and keep an eye on it to see if it blooms the following year.;
, Since a great deal more stress is placed on the main canes of a trellis rose, it’s important to follow proper pruning technique from the start.


Cut the plant at an angle right above a junction which is growing in the direction you want the plant to grow.
Always use clean shears. If you have to remove any diseased growth, keep a bottle of sanitizer or alcohol nearby to wipe the blades after you cut each diseased part.

, Here's what you’ll need to prune a trellised rose:


Pruning sheers
Alcohol or disinfecting solution
Rake
Fertilizer
Soft ties

, Water the entire area around the rose the day before you plan to prune the rose back. This will reduce the effect of the pruning and help the plant to heal faster.

, Prepare the rose by removing any dead, dying, diseased, or otherwise lackluster growth from the plant. Remove the ties attaching the rose to the trellis and then disinfect your sheers.

, Begin to re-tie the rose canes to the trellis by selecting the healthiest canes first and fixing them to the trellis as horizontally as possible. The canes should never cross and you you should remove any canes that overcrowd the trellis in order to increase air flow.

, Once your trellis is full, prune the remaining canes close to the ground. On each cane look for lateral branches that produce buds, then prune each lateral branch back to three or four buds.

, Reapply new mulch to the area, making sure to leave the areas directly around the cane clear. Fertilize according to package directions.

, Begin by removing all unhealthy, dying, dead, or diseased growth from the plant. Discard these branches and clean your sheers before continuing.

, Begin with removing the oldest, thinnest, most unhealthy canes. Once-blooming roses need strong old-wood to bloom well each year.


You can train the rose to bloom more vigorously by removing small and flimsy canes that won’t perform well.
Do not remove buds from the flowering wood (if they are present when you prune).

, Once the plant is manageable, remove the ties and regroup and tie the canes to the trellis as horizontally as possible.


It is important that the canes remain well spaced out and that they do not cross.
Prune back any growth that is hard to attach straight or crowds the trellis.

Know when to prune your rose.,
Use the proper tools for pruning.,
Remove any debris that has collected around your plant.,
Cut off dead growth.,
Cut away any diseased parts of the plant.,
Prune your rose to your desired height.,
Prune off branches that are causing problems.,
Remove most old growth.",How to Prune White Meidiland Roses1," Prune the Meidiland rose during the late winter after all of the foliage has fallen from the plant but before the spring temperatures begin to rise and new growth forms.


Prune your plant in January if you live in a warmer region. In warmer regions where it does not get cold enough for roses to shed their leaves, pruning should be done in January and all of the leaves and flowers should be pruned off. This will allow the shrub to have a brief rest before producing new foliage and flowers in late winter or spring.;
, Use bypass or hand pruners that are sharp. Dull pruners will crush the stems and damage the growth buds.


Always wash your pruning shears before and after you prune plants to control the spread of any plant diseases that may be in your garden.

, Remove all dead growth and debris from around the plant to make the pruning process a bit easier. Rake the area around the plant and remove any trash, leaves or other items.


Place this debris in a composter, or in a bag in the trash if you are concerned that the debris might have a plant disease or fungus of some kind.

, Remove any black or dark brown stems because these colors indicate that this growth has died. Dead growth should be cut back in order to help the plant produce healthy, new growth. If no healthy buds remain on a particular stalk, cut the stalk to the ground to encourage the plant to produce new stalks.


When cutting make vertical, angled cuts directly above the first healthy bud.

, Diseased parts of the plant should be removed as soon as you spot the disease. Check your roses through their growing season to make sure that your plants have not developed any diseases. Trim these branches off entirely or back to where the center of the stem tissue is a healthy white.


Remove diseased parts of the plant from your yard. These cuttings will have to be burned or thrown away. You cannot place these cuttings in the compost bin, as the plant disease could still spread from within the compost bin.

, Once you have removed any dead, damaged, or diseased growth, cut your plant back to height that you would like it to be. The height of white Meidiland roses can be reduced by four to eight inches, if a shorter height is preferred, but it is not necessary. Simply trim each branch back to the desired height.

, Prune off any branches that are growing at odd angles and branches that are growing across other branches. If a branch is growing across another branch, it could rub against the other branch, causing injury and opening up the shrub to disease.

, White Meidilands that are more than a few years old should have up to one-third of the oldest, thickest, woodiest branches removed completely.This will open up the center of the shrub to better air circulation and sunlight exposure.


It will also keep the shrub “younger” since the leftover branches will be less than a few years old.

Prune right after the last frost.,
Prune when the buds have begun to swell.,
Prune according to the type of rose you have.",How to Prune Rose Bushes1," Depending on where you live, this might be late January or February, or it could be some time in early spring. Pruning just after the last frost of the season is the best time to clear away dead or diseased rose canes (stems). Since you waited until there's no chance another frost will happen, the rosebush won't get damaged by harsh temperatures or ice.






;
, This is an indicator that the bush is ready to be pruned. When the buds have just begun to swell, you'll be able to prune effectively without causing any damage.









Check the stems for signs of leaf bud growth. If you haven't seen any new growth since the fall, and you don't see tiny new swells, wait a few more weeks before pruning.
The buds should also turn redder in color as they swell, another sign the bush is ready for pruning.

, Some roses actually need to be pruned after they bloom, rather than while they are still dormant. While it probably won't damage the rosebush to prune it at a different time of year, you won't get the results you're looking for. If you don't know what rose variety you have, look for these signs that may indicate when to prune your rosebush:









If the rosebush produces new growth in the spring, and the blooms come from this new growth, that means the rosebush should be pruned while it's dormant, right when the buds have begun to swell. Wait until next spring to prune.
If the rosebush blooms come straight from the old canes, rather than from new growth, the bush should be pruned after it flowers instead.

Gather the necessary tools.,
Cut at an angle.,
Dip pruners into disinfecting solution.",How to Prune Knockout Roses1," You will need a good pair of rose gloves and a pair of sharpened bypass pruners.


Rose gloves need to be thick and tall to protect your hands and arms from any thorns growing on the bushes.
Bypass pruners cut like scissors do, making them preferable to anvil-type pruners, which have a tendency to crush the stems as they cut. Nice, clean cuts are essential to maintaining the health of the plant.
You should also make sure that the pruners are very sharp. Sharp pruners will make cleaner cuts than dull pruners.
If you do not have bypass pruners, you could use hedge clippers or trimmers, instead. Whatever you use, though, make sure that the tool can create sharp, clean cuts.
If cutting canes larger than 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in diameter, use loppers instead of pruners.;
, Regardless of the purpose, time of year, or type of cut you are making, the cut should be made roughly 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) above the leaf bud at an outward angle.


The slant should be away from the bud.
Cutting any closer to the bud could shock it, but cutting any further from the bud will leave too much old stem, and the plant will be directing a lot of lost energy to stem that will no longer produce much.

, As you prune your roses, you should periodically dip them into a cleaning solution to sanitize them, thereby limiting the risk of spreading disease. This should be done regardless of how much you are pruning and during which season.


A common, all-purpose household cleaner is thought to work best.
Alternatively, a solution of 70% rubbing alcohol can be used, instead."
"
Know what a growth bud is.,
Control the direction of your new growth.,
Try to keep your cuts accurate.,
Deadhead your roses to promote new blooms.",How to Prune White Meidiland Roses2," Growth buds are slightly raised, discolored, triangular patches of tissue which can be found along each stem. A leaf that contains five leaflets can usually be found at a growth bud.


Growth buds may be facing outward away from the center of the shrub or facing inward towards the center of the plant.

, The direction of the new stem growth can be controlled by making the pruning cut above an outward-facing bud or an inward-facing bud.


Outward-facing buds will produce new stems that grow out away from the center of the shrub. This is the direction that more gardeners prefer.
Inward-facing buds will produce new stems that grow in toward the center and cut off air circulation from the center of the plant.

, Try to make the pruning cut about one-fourth of an inch above a growth bud or “eye” at a 45-degree angle. Do not make the cut too close to the bud or at too steep of an angle as this could injure the rest of the branch or stem that you are cutting.

, White Meidiland roses need to be deadheaded. Deadheading is the process of removing flowers as they fade or die. Deadhead the flowers as soon as they begin to fade and remove them from around the plant. Doing this will help the plant to put its energy towards new growth.

"
"
Use a good pair of pruning shears and long-handled loppers.,
Rinse shears in alcohol before pruning.,
Cut at a 45 degree angle.,
Cut 1/4"" above outward-facing bud eyes.,
Seal pruning cuts with white glue or carpenter's glue.",How to Prune Rose Bushes2," The shears are for smaller branches, and the loppers are for thick canes. Make sure your tools are sharp so they will make clean cuts rather than causing tears and rips in the stems.








, Rinse them again before moving on to another bush. This step disinfects your shears and prevents the transfer of diseases, such as black spot, between the plants.








, This way water will run off of the ""wound"" instead of collecting there. It helps prevent disease and mold from growing on the rose bush. The slope of the angle should head toward the center of the plant.








, The bud eyes, also called bud unions, are the swelling reddish knobs on the canes of the rosebush. Bud eyes produce the rosebush's branches. Making cuts just above the bud eyes redirects the plant's energy to a bud eye, so a branch will form there. Choose bud eyes that are facing outward so that the branches grow out, rather than into the center of the bush.








, This isn't absolutely necessary, but it's a good idea if you have pest problems in your area. It prevents rose boring insects from invading, and helps prevent stem diseases.








"
"
Remove the dead canes.,
Prune the suckers.,
Prune thin or crossed canes.,
Prune the remaining healthy canes.,
Deadhead the bush.",How to Prune Rose Bushes3," These are the black, shriveled stalks that will no longer produce new growth. The healthy canes are green or brown and firm. Use your pruning shears to cut them as close to the base as possible. If you find a cane that looks like it's still partially alive, make a cut 1/4 ich above one of the bud eyes.








, These are the new plant shoots sprouting from the ground right next to the older rosebush. They're called ""suckers"" because they suck away the nutrients from the older bush, causing its health to fail.









Prune the suckers from their bases, rather than just chopping them down; they'll just grow back stronger if you do it that way.
You might have to push back the soil a bit to get the sucker at its root.

, Canes that are very thin and look to be weak, or canes that are crossed toward the center of the bush, should be pruned at the base as well. These impair the bush's health by getting in the way of good air circulation, and they also make the bush look wild and unkempt.








, Keeping in mind that new branches sprout from the bud eyes, prune the remaining canes to achieve the desired rosebush shape. Prune 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above outward facing bud eyes, so the new branches will grow outward. Decide how high or low you want to keep the bush, and prune accordingly.








, As the growing season moves along, the bush will produce blossoms that eventually fade. Removing these is called deadheading, and is healthy for the rosebush. The energy that went toward the fading blossom will be redirected to produce a new one. Cut the spent bloom off just above the first five leaf cluster.

"
Wait until the second or third season of growth.By waiting until the second or third year of maturity, you can make sure that you are pruning a mature bush.,
Prune the roses after the buds break dormancy.,
Count on vigorous growth.,
Pay attention to height, width, and air circulation.,
Snip away overlapping canes.,
Remove one-third of the growth.",How to Prune Knockout Roses2,"


Mature knockout roses need major pruning in the late winter, but young roses only need to be pruned throughout the growing period to remove dead or dying parts of the plant.
A mature knockout rose bush should be about 4 feet (1.22 m) wide by 4 feet (1.22 m) tall.
Note that you can often go two to three years in between major prunings, depending on how vigorous your knockout roses seem to grow and how small you like to keep your plant.

, The major pruning period for knockout roses is in late winter to early spring, just as the bush begins to break out of its dormancy stage.


Check for bud formation on the stems of the plant. The roses will be ready to prune if the existing buds have swelled up but no new growth has appeared.
You can still prune the plant even if new growth is starting to develop, though. If a winter proves especially mild, growth might start forming notably early. In this case, snip the growth back to the first dormant bud.

, Knockout roses will grow vigorously when you take proper care of them, so you should keep that in mind when you prune them before the start of the growing season. As a general rule, you should prune them down do that they are about 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) (30.5 to 61 cm) shorter than you would like them eventually become during the season.


You can cut healthy shoots back by one-third to one-half of their existing length without damaging the plant. If you cut the shoots back further than that, however, you might stunt the growth of the bush.

, Height and width maintain the appearance of the knockout rose bush, but by cutting out enough inside to promote better air circulation, you can also help prevent the spread of various fungal diseases.


Increase air circulation by cutting away some of the interior growth at the center of the plant, creating more openness at the center.

, You can snip both canes away, if necessary, but you only really need to cut away one.


Cutting away overlapping canes stops them from rubbing against each other, helping the plant look neater and promoting stronger growth.
This also creates more openness in the plant, thereby protecting your knockout roses from disease more effectively.

, Try to maintain an even dome shape. Usually, at the start of the season, you might remove anywhere from one-third to one-half of the growth. Doing so prevents the plant from putting too much energy into maintaining an abundance of foliage, allowing it to maximize flower yield as a result.


At the same time, you do not want to be too over-zealous in your pruning, either. If you trim away much more than this, the plant will spend too much energy trying to regrow lost foliage and not enough toward producing flowers.

"
"
Do corrective pruning in the summer.,
Trim for aesthetics.,
Cut away dead, diseased, and damaged wood.,
Deadhead the flowers.",How to Prune Knockout Roses3," Corrective pruning helps direct more energy toward the foliage. As a result, you will end up seeing more dramatic flower production once the days start getting shorter.


Avoid hard or major prunings during the heat of the summer. Knockout roses are already stressed due to the heat, so a major pruning could only weaken them further.

, Pruning to stimulate growth is not necessary, but if you want to maintain a beautiful rose bush, you might need to do a little pruning for this purpose.


If a few new shoots start growing faster than the others and quickly exceed the length of other surrounding shoots, you can trim the long shoots down so that the plant is uniformly even.
In addition to growing upward, shoots will also grow below the plant and outward. This ""leggy"" under-growth should also be trimmed away throughout the growing season.

, Throughout the active growing season, the majority of your pruning should be for the sake of keeping the plant healthy. This is primarily done by removing parts of the plant that could damage the plant further if left alone.


Diseased parts of the plant should be removed immediately to prevent the disease from spreading. Similarly, dead and damaged wood is an invitation for fungi and bacteria to attack the plant, making it vulnerable, so these elements should also be removed as soon as possible.

, Deadheading is the practice of cutting away large or faded flowers. This can be done for both aesthetic reasons and health reasons.


Cut just above the five-leaflet closest to the flower cluster or the first five-leaflet leaf below the flower cluster.
During extreme heat, only cut back to just above a leaf rather than going further down the stem. Cutting off faded flowers 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.32 cm) below the flower is appropriate.

"
"
Prune before the first frost.,
Remove dead, diseased, and damaged wood.,
Tidy up the bush.",How to Prune Knockout Roses4," Ideally, you should prune at the end of summer or the very early beginning of fall, when the weather is still warm but starting to get a little chilly.


There may still be some active growth on the knockout roses, but you should notice the growth beginning to taper off at this point., Just like in the summer, you also need to give your knockout roses a final trim to remove any potentially damaging parts of the plant. Otherwise, disease could spread throughout the knockout rose bush as a whole, destroying it by the time winter sets in.


Diseased parts of the plant should be removed immediately to prevent the disease from spreading. Similarly, dead and damaged wood is an invitation for fungi and bacteria to attack the plant, making it vulnerable, so these elements should also be removed as soon as possible.

, Fall pruning is not a major ordeal, and many gardeners can get away with skipping it. In general, though, the idea is to tidy your plant up by removing long growth that does not belong and by trimming off a portion of the height.


You can prune up to one-third of the height of your plant, depending on how vigorous your plant grew during the growing season.
If it just barely reached your ideal height, a smaller trim would be better. If it exceeded that height, the full one-third might be preferable for you.
You should also fertilize the plants immediately after this last pruning.
If there are any long stems sticking out from the top or from the side, trim these, as well.

"
Know when to prune.,
Determine whether or not to deadhead the blooms.,
Remove unhealthy stems.,
Prune problematic stems.,
Thin out healthy stems as needed.,
Understand the purpose of renovation pruning.,
Wait until the dormant season.,
Remove any suckers.,
Trim up to one-third of the stems.",How to Prune Rosa Rugosa," Most pruning should be done once the plant enters its dormant season. This can be any point in time between late autumn and early spring.


The best time to prune is in the early spring, after the danger of frost has passed. Pruning makes a plant vulnerable, and vulnerable plants tend to be weaker against the cold frosts of winter. If you live in a fairly warm climate, though, waiting until spring is not as significant an issue as long as the time you do prune is still in the dormant season.
The only pruning you should worry about during the active growing season is deadheading. Deadheading, if performed, should be done on an ""as needed"" basis throughout the flowering season (summer).;
, You can deadhead faded blooms before they drop, but doing so is not strictly necessary for rosa rugosa shrubs.


The rose hips are often considered part of the display or aesthetic appeal of the shrub, and deadheading would remove these hips. As such, you may opt to brush away the spent petals with your hands and leave the hips behind and intact.Deadheading prevents the bloom from going to seed and reduces the risk of disease, however, so you may still wish to do it.
If you do decide to deadhead, snip off the spent bloom just beneath the rose hip, cutting the stem at a 45 degree angle.
Do this continually throughout the flowering season, but stop sometime during the beginning of autumn, around October 1 or so. Stopping the practice will give the shrub enough time to harden itself in preparation for winter.

, Unhealthy stems include dead stems, dying stems, and diseased stems. Weak, thin stems are also considered unhealthy and should be removed each dormant season.


Use a sharp cutting tool and cut stems at a 45 degree angle.
You can usually determine if a cane or stem has died simply by looking at it. Dying canes are usually shriveled and either dark brown or black in color.
Weak stems refer to any stem that is smaller than a standard pencil in diameter size.
Dead canes should be completely removed at the ground level.
Stems that are only partially dead should be cut back to a point just above the crossing of dead wood and live wood. Leave a small amount of the dead wood intact to protect the live wood from harm.
If you are unable to tell where the dead wood ends and the live wood starts, gradually cut back the dead wood until you reach a point where the center of the trimmed stem is completely white, with no brown or black in sight.

, In this case, problematic stems primarily refer to branches that intertwine or grow at abnormal angles.Wood that crosses other branches or rubs against other sections of the shrub can cause problems. Light and air are unable to flow freely in between these canes, and as a result, these sections of wood are more likely to become damaged or diseased.
Cut crossing or rubbing stems down to a point below the problem area. If the stems grow back the following year in the same problematic matter, cut them down to ground level to prevent the problem from recurring the year after that.

, The center of the shrub should be fairly open to promote air circulation and light penetration. If your rosa rugosa plant has grown too vigorously, you may need to trim away some older wood in the center of the plant, even if that wood appears healthy.


Shrub roses like rosa rugosa will flower on both new and older wood, so most of the older wood should be allowed to develop and maintain itself naturally when possible.If the interior of the plant becomes too crowded, however, you may need to trim up some of the healthy growth in the center. Look for older, unproductive wood that did not bloom in the previous flowering season. Cut away two or three of these branches, cutting them down near ground level at a 45 degree angle.

, Rosa rugosa shrubs often remain tidy without much interference, but if the roses start looking messy or overgrown, you will need to use renovation pruning to clean the plant up.


Note that renovation pruning can cause a slight loss of flower production the following year, but it is still beneficial to your plant overall.
Rose shrubs that are too overgrown essentially over-extend themselves and their resources. It may take a few years for the stress to show, but once it does, your plant will be much weaker and may have a hard time surviving.
For the first two or three seasons, you should actually avoid renovation pruning. Doing so can allows the plant to establish itself more securely.
Once the plant establishes itself, consider waiting every other year to do an overhaul on it. Renovation pruning can be performed once every year, but if new growth on the plant is not vigorous enough or if the plant grows weak, you may need to skip every other year., As with essential yearly pruning, you should wait until the plant enters its dormant stage before pruning it down. Waiting until the last frost passes in early spring is often the best option, but you should be able to prune the shrub at any point between late fall and early spring.

, Suckers refer to stems that grow from the rootstock of the plant instead of the main stem. Cut these suckers off at the ground level.


Aside from looking messy, the main problem with suckers is that they tend to grow too well and will deprive your main rosa rugosa shrub of the nutrients it needs. As a result, your main shrub will weaken and eventually die.
Cutting suckers off at the ground will usually be enough, but if you want to be more thorough, dig down to the root from which the sucker originates and tear or cut it off at its point of origin.

, Starting with the oldest stems, cut down between one-quarter and one-third of the stems on the plant. These stems should be trimmed down to ground level.


In this instance, ""ground level"" refers to any height between the ground and 1.5 inches (4 cm) above the ground.
Make each cut with sharp shears and at a 45 degree angle.
Ideally, you should still try to cut the plant down to a bud. If you cannot find a bud that is low enough, however, the shrub should still be able to produce a new bud below the cut once the growing season starts again.
If your plant is fairly weak, you may opt to trim the branches down to its new growth instead of cutting it all the way down to the ground.

Identify the type of soil in your garden.,

Think about the age of your roses.,

Use the right kind of watering can.,
Water the soil to a depth of 18 inches (45.7 cm).,
Water your roses first thing in the morning.,
Apply a thick layer of mulch to keep moisture in the soil.,
Reduce watering by incorporating a water-retaining material into the soil.,
Know that container-grown roses require more water.,
Water your roses immediately if they start to look droopy.,
Don't overwater roses, as this causes root rot.",How to Properly Water Roses," Soil type and drainage will influence how often you need to water your roses. Sandy soil will drain easily and won’t retain water very well. If your garden has clay soil then it will retain moisture better - however, if the soil is very clay-heavy, you’ll need to dig some compost or similar horticultural material to improve it at planting time.;
, Obviously plants need watering during hot dry weather. But you should also be aware that wind can dry out plants a great deal, even in cold weather. Newly planted roses may be at risk of drought during a dry, windy fall or winter.


As a rough guide, in extremely hot weather you should assume rose plants will need watering daily. On a standard summer day with decent heat, you will need to water every two or three days, and in warm dry weather you will only need to water about once a week.
Also consider how windy it is when deciding how much to water your plants: windy weather means more water is required.

, Recently-planted roses still haven’t developed their root structure, so if you’ve planted in the last few months it is especially important to water the roses regularly during dry spells – even if you planted just before winter. Lack of water is the most common reason newly planted plants fail.


Once established, plants will be more adept at seeking water from a wider area of soil, so you can start to ease off your watering regime after six months.

, Larger rose bushes will have roots spread over a wider area of soil than smaller ones. This means larger rose bushes will require more water to ensure the water reaches all of their roots.

, Another way to assess if roses need watering is to dig a few inches into the soil next to the plant, taking care not to damage the roots. If the soil is dry under the surface, then you need to water the rose now. If only the surface is dry, you can wait a bit longer before watering.

, It’s better to give the rose bushes a large amount of water less often, than a small amount of water more often. For example: giving a full watering can of water once a week rather than a quarter can every other day.


This is because it’s better for the plant to develop deep roots in quest of water and it’s also better if the soil isn’t permanently waterlogged.
This is an important consideration, especially on clay soils or other poor-draining soils where waterlogging is more likely.

, Take a large watering can - if possible, it’s best to use a watering can ‘rose’, which is the showerhead-style spout that stops the water coming out in a single stream.


If you use a single spout can it can erode the soil around the roots. Exposure will eventually damage the roots. Roses will always prefer rainwater but this isn’t essential.
If you are using a garden hose, avoid a high-pressure jet as this can also erode the soil from the roots. Alternatively, you could set up an irrigation system - but be careful to monitor it to make sure it is watering the roses the right amount and is working properly.

, Water the ground at the base of the plant fairly slowly, pausing for it to soak in. Your aim is to wet the soil to a depth of about 18 inches (45.7 cm). After very dry spells the earth can bake hard and it can take longer for it to absorb water. Be patient!

, It’s usually best to avoid watering your rose bushes during the heat of the day. Try to get in the habit of watering them first thing in the morning before the sun gets too high.


This lets foliage dry off by the time the cooler evening air gets to them. If a rose has wet foliage it can be more at risk of mildew and blackspot. This isn’t a problem if you are using an irrigation system placed on the soil surface as the foliage won’t be getting wet.
Even if you have an irrigation system in place, some gardeners recommend occasional watering from above using a hose or can, in order to dislodge any spider mites before they become a problem.

, A thick layer of mulch applied around roses will really help to keep the moisture in the soil and reduce the need for watering as often.


Well-rotted horse manure works well for roses – apply after feeding them, ideally in late spring, and on damp earth. Apply a 3 inch (7.6 cm) depth around the rose when the ground isn’t cold or frozen.
Every year, remove the spent mulch and replace it with a fresh layer. The start of the growing season (spring) is a good time to feed your roses and replace the mulch.

, You can also help to reduce watering by incorporating a water-retaining material at planting time. These are available from garden stores and are designed to be mixed in with the soil or compost when planting.


Additionally, some varieties of rose are more drought-tolerant, or will even tolerate shade, so consider choosing one of these varieties to reduce water requirements.

, Container grown roses tend to dry out a bit faster than ground planted ones, so these will need watering more. In hot conditions, be prepared to water container-grown roses every day.


You can help reduce water requirements by mulching. Inorganic mulches such as pebbles or gravel can work well in containers and look attractive.
Also consider using a watering device such as a spike designed to water potted plants gradually over time. These can be purchased from garden stores, or make your own using an old plastic bottle using an online tutorial.

, If your roses start to wilt and get droopy, they probably need watering.


Over the long term the leaves will dry up and wither and the flowers will bloom less and possibly even die.
Smaller blooms and less of them is a sign a rose is stressed, probably due to lack of water.

, Overwatering can cause root rot, especially in poor-draining soils. Signs to watch out for include yellow leaves and leaf drop, and new shoots wilting and dying away.


Take care that container-planted roses never sit in water. Avoid putting containers in trays, bowls or saucers.
Too much water can also make the foliage chlorotic (yellowish and mottled).

Use the proper pruning tools.,
Prune your plant in mid-winter.,
Prune away any damaged parts of the plant as the growing season continues.,
Cut away diseased parts of the plant as soon as you notice diseased growth.",How to Prune Helleborus Winter Roses1," Use hand pruners that are good and sharp. Bypass pruners with a scissor action are best. You should also consider wearing working gloves as Helleborus have thorns that can do some damage.;
, Wait until mid-winter to prune your plant (the new flower buds should just be forming at this time). Cut the old foliage that is growing around the outside of the plant all the way off at the base. These old leaves are usually unsightly and can harbor bacteria and fungal spores that can infect winter rose plants. The new leaves that grow up from the center will open and spread out as they grow.


Always remove the old leaves from the garden after pruning.

, As the season progresses, some of the new leaves may begin to look tattered. These damaged leaves can be pruned off at any time during the season to make the plant look more neat and tidy.


Helleborus is very forgiving, and will allow you to prune it year round without any adverse side-effects.

, If you notice that a section of your plant has become diseased, cut away that section of the rose to stop the spread of the disease. After you have removed the diseased growth, burn it or put it in bags in the trash. Do not put diseased foliage in the compost container, as ding this may still allow the disease to spread.


Once you have cut away all of the diseased parts of the plant, wash your pruning shears with hot water and soap. This will keep your pruners from spreading the disease to other plants the next time you use them.

Rake the old mulch smooth with a dirt rake.",How to Prune Drift Roses," Pruning during this time, while they are still dormant, is less stressful for the rose.In Zones 9 and 10, where roses stay evergreen, they should be pruned in January.;
, This will protect you from getting pricked by any rose thorns., Dull pruners and anvil-type pruners will crush the rose stems.

, Do this by soaking them for 5 minutes in a household disinfectant like Lysol.


Make sure you rinse the disinfectant off with water and dry the pruners with a clean towel before using them.

, Cut each stem ¼ inch above an outward-facing growth bud, which is usually found where a leaf with five leaflets is growing from the stem.


Growth buds look like tiny, triangular-shaped, slightly raised patches on the stems. New stems grow from these growth buds.

, Cutting at a steeper angle will damage the growth bud.

, Do this by making the cut at the base of the dead stem.


If you are growing Drift roses in Zones 9 and 10, snip off all of the leaves.This will allow the Drift rose to grow fresh, new foliage for the coming year and reduce the possibility for diseases that can survive the winter on the leaves.

, Do this throughout the growing season., This will prevent diseases like black spot and mildew, which are rare in Drift roses, from developing.


Make the pruning cut into the healthy part of the stem about 1 inch beyond the diseased area.The pith or center of the stem should be white and full-looking, not brown or tan.

, This will lessen the risk of spreading the disease on healthy stems.

, However, these roses do not need to be deadheaded to grow properly.


When deadheading, make the cut at a 45-degree angle ¼ inch above the first leaf with five leaflets.The first few leaves below the flower will have only one to three leaflets. The leaf with five leaflets will be at a more productive growth bud.
Growth buds where leaves grow with only one to three leaflets will produce weaker stem growth that may not grow flower buds.

, Drift roses grow on their own roots,rather than being grafted onto rootstock like many hybrid roses.

, When left on the ground around a Drift rose, these cuttings can harbor insects as well as fungi and bacteria that could be splashed onto the rose., Doing this can lead to the development of disease and insect infestations.

, However, avoid piling the mulch too deep.


Use a shovel or garden fork to loosen and turn the old mulch.This keeps it from becoming compacted, which restricts air flow and moisture penetration.

, Add just enough new mulch on top to bring the total depth up to 2 to 3 inches.

So avoid using anvil-type pruners and dull pruners to prune roses., They should also have thick rubber or canvas along the palms and undersides of the fingers for protection against rose thorns.

, Clean any dirt off first and then soak them in disinfectant for 5 minutes.


Wipe the disinfectant off the pruners with a clean rag before using them as it will damage the rose stems.
If the roses have a disease that has been causing spots on the leaves, stems or flowers or distorted growth, disinfect the pruners between pruning cuts so that healthy stems do not get infected., If you are removing a smaller branch, take the entire branch off all the way back to the main stem. If a main stem or cane is diseased, cut off only the diseased part.

, Seal the wound on the stem with white glue like Elmer’s glue if it is thicker than a pencil to keep boring beetles out of the stems., They will rub against each other when the wind blows, causing open wounds and an opportunity for disease.


Cut off the weaker of the two branches and seal the wound.

, Suckers are stems that grow from below where the rose with desirable characteristics was grafted or attached to the rootstock.


Most roses, except mini roses, are grafted.
Sucker stems that grow from the rootstock will bloom in a different color, if they bloom at all.

, Deadheading is the practice of removing the flowers as they fade. This procedure allows the rose to devote its energy toward new, healthy growth rather than producing seeds.


When deadheading the rose, the entire flower must be removed., This is where a growth bud that will produce strong, healthy stem growth is located.


If the flower is deadheaded higher up the stem, the new growth will be weak and unable to support the weight of a new flower, if it is even able to produce a new flower.

, There is no need to seal the cut stems as they will not be thick enough for borers to enter.


Flower stems can be cut further down at the next leaf with five leaflets for long-stemmed roses to put in a vase.

, If the growth bud, a small, raised patch of tissue on the stem, is located on the outside of the stem, the new growth will grow out away from the center of the bush. If it is located on the inside of the stem, new growth will grow toward the inside of the bush.

, Put the trimmings in the garbage.Leaving dead flowers and pruned off bits of stem on the ground around a rose bush will promote disease and harbor insects that may attack the bush.

Dip the cutting in rooting hormone.,
Plant and water the cutting.,
Cover the stem with plastic or a mason jar.,
Provide the cutting with plenty of sunlight and moisture as it grows.",How to Propagate Roses1," Planting stem cuttings is one of the most popular ways to propagate roses. The best time to take and plant cuttings is when the temperature outside is warm but not too hot. The ideal time of year for this is late spring or early summer.


It is possible to grow roses from cuttings when the weather is colder, but the process will take longer and your chances of success will be lower.If you don’t have a rose bush of your own that you can use for a cutting, ask a friend or neighbour if they have a plant you can use.
You may also be able to find wild rose bushes that you can propagate.
You can also ask a local nursery or garden center if they let people take cuttings from any of their plants.;
, To propagate roses using this method, you need to select a healthy rose plant and cut off a stem. For this project, you will need some gardening, cutting, and potting tools, including:


Clean two-inch (five-cm) pot
Potting soil
Sharp sterilized cutting tool
Rooting hormone
Clear plastic bag or mason jar

, Fill the small pot with potting soil. For the best results, replace a quarter of the soil with perlite, peat moss, or vermiculite, or a combination thereof. This will increase air flow and draining, giving your cutting a better opportunity to root.If the soil is dry, water it and allow the excess water to drain out, so that the soil is evenly moist.


Instead of a pot, you can also use a small mason jar or the bottom half of a large plastic bottle (cut the top off).

, Choose a healthy and established plant to take a cutting from. The stem should come from the top and side of the plant, and it should have at least three leaves on it. Ideally, find a stem that has flowered recently. Look for a stem that’s young but established and hardy, and that’s about six inches (15 cm) long.


It’s better to take cuttings from the top and side of the plant because they seem to root better than cuttings from the middle or bottom.It’s ok if the stem you select has buds and flowers currently on it, but look for a stem with flowers that are starting to wither. This indicates the stem recently bloomed.

, The best tool for taking the cutting is a pair of sharp pruning sheers or a razor blade. Cut the stem from the plant at a 45-degree angle, just below one of the lower leaf nodes (where the leaf attaches to the stem).Make sure the cutting tool has been sterilized to prevent the spread of disease.
To sterilize your cutting tool, you can heat it with fire until it’s red hot, or boil it in water for 30 minutes.

, With the same cutting tool, cut off any withered flowers and new buds where they attach to the stem. If any hips (fruit) have started to form, cut these off as well.Cut off any leaves on the lower half of the stem. Leave two to three higher leaves to help with photosynthesis.

, Wounding is the process of making slits in the bottom of the stem, and this will encourage rooting. With the same cutting tool, cut one-inch (2.5-cm) slits in the bark at the bottom of the stem.


Make three or four slits in the bark to give the roots more places to grow out from., Insert the bottom two inches (five cm) of the cutting so that the cutting, wounds, and bottom of the stem are covered in the hormone.Rooting hormone is not a necessary step in the cutting and propagating process, but it will increase the chances that your cutting will grow successfully.

, With the tip of your finger or a pencil, make a two-inch (five-cm) hole in the potting soil at the center of the pot. Place the cut end of the stem in the hole. Pack the soil around the stem and use your hands to firm the soil in place.


Water the soil so that it’s thoroughly moist., To cover the stem with plastic, insert two eight-inch (20-cm) sticks or wires into the soil on either side of the stem to prop up the plastic. Cover the pot and stem with a clear plastic bag, and affix the bag to the pot with an elastic or twine. With a mason jar, simply place a large mason jar over the stem.


Covering the stem with glass or plastic will create a miniature greenhouse, and the cover will help keep in the heat, moisture, and ultraviolet rays the stem needs to root and grow., Throughout each day, the plant will need plenty of bright sunlight. But to avoid overheating, place the plant in a bright location that receives lots of indirect sunlight, especially around midday.The mason jar or plastic will help to keep the soil and cutting moist, but add more water any time the cutting or soil starts to dry out.

Deadhead your flowers.,
Manage the seedlings that appear.,
Consider propagating seeds in a greenhouse.",How to Prune Helleborus Winter Roses2," In order to avoid unwanted seedlings, prune off the flowers as they begin to fade or die. This type of pruning is commonly called deadheading. Deadheading also helps the plant put its energy towards new blooms, rather than trying to keep the old blooms alive.Cut the stems all the way off at the base.


Any flowers that are left on the plant will drop seeds onto the soil and new seedlings will emerge around the parent plant the following spring.

, The seedlings that grow from dropped seeds the previous season can be allowed to grow. However, they should be carefully dug up and moved as soon as they are large enough to handle to prevent overcrowding.

, If you remove the seeds from your roses, you can collect those seeds and grow them in a greenhouse.


Keep in mind that the seedlings may not look like the parent plant. Seeds from hybrid plants often produce plants that look like winter roses from a previous generation.

Pick the right time.,
Gather your supplies.,
Select a healthy plant to divide.,
Water the rose bush.,
Dig up the rose bush carefully.,
Cut the plant into equal halves.,
Keep the roots moist.,
Prepare the plots.,
Replant the two halves.",How to Propagate Roses2," The ideal time to divide perennial plants is in early spring or late fall. These are times when the plants are in dormant stages, and this will minimize shock to the plant and improve root growth.It’s also important to divide perennials during periods of dormancy because this will ensure they're not blooming. Avoid dividing rose bushes when they're in bloom.
Dividing roses is less popular than propagating by cuttings because it’s more difficult and time consuming. Dividing requires you to uproot an established plant, cut it in half, and replant the two halves.

, To propagate roses by division, you'll need a healthy and established rose plant, as well as some garden tools and equipment, such as:


Sharp and sterilized knife or razor
Shovel or spade
Gardening gloves
Two large buckets
Damp newspaper
A prepared garden plot
Fertile soil

, To make sure that your divided rose bushes will thrive and produce healthy flowers, choose a healthy and established plant to divide. A healthy plant will:Have plenty of leaves
Have leaves that are distributed evenly around the plant
Produce lots of flowers

, To minimize shock to the plant before you uproot and divide it, water the bush thoroughly. This will also help to loosen the soil around the roots, making it easier to remove the plant from the ground without damaging the roots.

, With the shovel, start digging into the ground in the area around the rose bush. You need to dig up the plant, but must avoid digging into and damaging the roots. Once you’ve cleared the area around the plant, use your hands to brush away soil and expose the roots.


When the roots are exposed and the area around the plant has been dug up, carefully pull the plant up from the ground.

, Lay the rose bush on the ground or place it into a wheelbarrow. With a sterilized pruning saw or knife, divide the plant into two equal halves by cutting the roots down the middle of the plant.


To sterilize your cutting tool, heat the metal with fire until it’s red hot, or boil it for 30 minutes in water.

, Once the plant has been divided, place each half into a bucket and transfer the buckets to a shady place to protect them while you prepare the garden plot. To keep the plants moist, cover them with damp newspaper.


Ideally, you want to keep the humidity around 50 percent to keep the plants moist without soaking them too much., In the area where you removed the original rose bush, replace the soil you dug up with fertile soil or organic matter to make sure there are plenty of nutrients in the garden bed for the new plants. Use your hands or a spade to mix in the new soil and spread it around the garden bed.


Good organic matter to add to the soil include aged compost or manure.

, Dig two holes in the garden bed you’ve prepared to the same depth as the original plant. Make the holes about 24 inches (60 cm) apart. Plant the individual rose bushes in the holes and cover the roots with soil. Pack the soil around the roots with your hands.


Water the plants thoroughly.
Keep the rose bushes moist during the first year that they're establishing themselves."
"
Make sure they get lots of light.,
Water the roses often.,
Amend the soil with fertilizer.,
Prune often.",How to Propagate Roses3," Roses need between six and eight hours of sunlight each day. When choosing a location for your roses, pick somewhere that receives lots of direct sunlight.


In very warm climates, pick a location that gets indirect sunlight when the sun is at its hottest, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. This could include near a tree that provides some shade during the hottest time of day.
In cooler climates, plant the roses in front of a south-facing or west-facing wall or fence to give the roses some extra protection and reflected heat., Roses need to be watered deeply, especially during their first year and during the warmer summer months. Provide deep soakings twice a week in summer to keep the soil consistently moist.


The best way to water roses is with a drip irrigation system or soaker hose that concentrates water at the base and roots of the plant. If the flowers or foliage get wet, it could cause disease, fungus, and rot problems., Along with plenty of water and sunlight, roses also require regular feeding, especially before and during blooming periods. In the spring and summer, between the months of April and July, provide the roses with a monthly application of nutrients, such as:


Granular 5-10-5 or 5-10-10 fertilizerFish emulsions
Seaweed extract
Aged manure or compost
Alfalfa meal

, Roses will thrive when they are pruned regularly, as pruning removes diseased stems, flowers, and leaves, and increases circulation throughout the plant. In the spring, use shears or loppers to remove dead flowers, diseased stems, and old leaves.Throughout the spring and summer, continue removing dead flowers and leaves as necessary.

Choose your prefered blooms and place them in silica gel.,
Remove the flower from the Silica Gel.,
Create a finish.,
Spray on your finish.,
Recover your Silica Gel.",How to Preserve a Rose1," Select blooms without moisture. The rose needs to be dry to the touch but should not be too dry that it loses its brilliance. The drying process magnifies and flaws of your rose especially if it has moisture. Pour 2 inches of silica gel (available at craft stores) into an airtight container. Cut the stems to about 2 inches and place the rose in the Silica Gel stem down. Using a circular motion, gently pour the Silica Gel over the roses. Fill the container and make sure the container remains airtight by using masking tape to seal the lid shut.Keep in mind that the deeper the colour, the longer it will last once preserved.
Use a small container to pour the Silica Gel to give you more control.
Make sure you get Silica Gel between each petal but don’t squish or damage the petals. Use a stick to keep the petals upright and separated as you pour in the Silica Gel.Keep at least one inch of Silica Gel to separate multiple roses in the same container.
Be sure to record the name of the flower and the date on which you sealed it.
Keep the container sealed for at least 2 weeks for standard roses and 1 week for mini roses.Alternatively, you can microwave the gel and flower in a microwave safe dish for 2 to 5 minutes on a low setting. Leave it out to sit for 24 hours before cleaning off the gel.;
, Pour out the silica gel carefully into another container. Hold the rose upside down by the stem and gently brush off Silica gel. Use a small paintbrush or makeup brush to gently remove the Silica gel. You may keep fallen petals and glue them on later.








To attach loose petals, use a glue gun or a toothpick with a drop of tacky glue. Around the outer base of the calyx on the underside of the bloom, attach a fallen petal with just a tiny drop of glue to make sure that it remains inconspicuous. Allow the glue to dry for at least 24 hours., Put on protective gear including rubber gloves, face mask, and protective goggles. Mix 2 ounces of pro-seal 2000 and 3 ounces of denatured alcohol in a bucket.Prior to an ARS rose show, Pro-seal 2000 should not be used.
Pro-seal is a clear, glossy varnish typically used in construction. While it will preserve your rose, make sure that you are careful using it. Always wear gloves and protective goggles.
Denatured alcohol is often used as a house cleaner but is toxic when ingested so be sure to wear protective gear and wash your hands thoroughly after handling.

, Using a 6 ounce preval spray gun, spray your mixture of 2 ounces of pro-seal 2000 and 3 ounces of denatured alcohol to apply a thin coat to all the surfaces of the rose. Apply the finish at 70 degrees fahrenheit with a 50% humidity or less.








Let the rose dry for 24 hours or more. Once dry, repeat the process and add a second coat.

, Remove the moisture from your silica gel by placing it in an oven pan for an hour at 250 degrees fahrenheit. Once you see vivid blue cobalt crystals remove them and cool at room temperature. Once cool, place them in an airtight container and seal the lid with masking tape.

Purchase sunflower seeds.,
Purchase or repurpose containers or pots that are suitable for growing the sunflowers in.,
Put the soil into the container, pot or window/porch box.,
Place the sunflower seeds in the container.,
Be prepared to water sunflowers more often than many other plants.,
Wait for the seeds to germinate.,
If germination has been successful, then well done!,
Put the sunflower container in a nice sunny part of your house, garden or on the veranda (porch) if you prefer.,
Continue to tend the plant with water and general plant care.,
At this point give the sunflowers 75 milliliters (2.5  fl oz) (2.5 fl oz) of water.,
Fertilize if wished.,
In one month the sunflower bud should be still developing for the next two weeks (water regulation should increase to 100ml/ 3.3 fl oz of water).,
Enjoy the sunflower as a decorative element in your home or wherever else you've placed the container.,
If you want to make culinary use of the sunflower, the petals from the flowers make a pretty addition to salads, and both the seeds and the buds can also be eaten.",How to Grow a Sunflower in a Pot," You can obtain suitable sunflower seeds from a local nursery or garden center. Be careful about the variety you purchase, though, as only dwarf sunflowers are really suitable for container growing. Suitable dwarf sunflower varieties include (and as names vary, ask your local retailer for specific guidance in your region):


Pacino: this bright yellow sunflower grows to about 30 cm (12"") in height.
Big Smile: this sunflower has yellow petals and a black center and grows to about 30 cm (12"") in height.
Teddy Bear: this sunflower grows to about 40 cm (15"") in height.
Sunspot: this sunflower has an amazingly large flowerhead (about 25 cm or 10 inches across) but is still a dwarf variety, growing to about 60 cm or 2 feet (0.6 m) in height.
Music Box: this sunflower reaches about 60 cm (2 feet) and has lots of smaller flowers.;
, The containers should be clean and sterile if you're repurposing them and don't forget to add saucers for catching the water. Gauge the size of the container needed according to the height of the flower you're planting, along with any other considerations such as how many sunflowers you'd like to grow per pot but some suggested sizes are:


If you begin in a pot with a very small radius, the sunflower will need to be transplanted fairly early on; some people do this to give the sunflower a head start while garden soil is still cold but be aware that sunflowers aren't very partial to being transplanted.30 cm-40 cm or 12""-16"" width containers for most dwarf sunflowers should be sufficient.Window or porch box - a deep window or porch box can be ideal for a row of dwarf sunflower seeds. You'll need to thin out weaker seedlings early on (explained below).
Large or mammoth sunflowers need containers of at least 18 litres or 5 gallons:

A milk crate can be used – just be sure to line it well or you'll have soil spillage.
Half a barrel for really tall sunflowers. Obviously this will need to sit on a sunny porch or in the garden unless you have a sunny spot free inside the house.



, First add a layer of drainage material, such as pebbles, gravel, terracotta pieces, or small pieces of polystyrene foam. Then pour in quality container soil such as a mix of compost and commercial soil mix. It should come to a level about 2.5 cm / 1 inch from the top of the container. Water it well.


Give consideration to adding water retaining crystals to ease the amount of watering required and to ensure that the sunflowers will get adequate amounts of water.
Adding well rotted compost is important as a source of food for the sunflower, so try to do this if you can.

, Sow 2 to 10 seeds in pairs, depending on the size or length of the container you've chosen. Not all of the seedlings will be kept, so don't worry too much about squashing them in at this stage but do be prepared to discard all the weaker appearing seedlings later. When planting, plant 2.5cm (1 inch) deep and at least 10cm (4"") apart.









It is possible to fit about 8 sunflower plants into a container length of 90 cm (3 feet), so using this as a guide, you'd plant around 16 plants in such a container and expect to thin out about eight., Add about 25ml (0.83 fl oz) of water for every seed planted. Water once every one to two days in the same amount, depending on how moist the soil stays. Ensure that the soil is kept moist until the seeds sprout.








, Germination should occur in the next three to eight days. If not, wait a little longer but by 13 days it is definite that the seed will not grow.








, After germination, thin out the weaker seedling of each pair and remove any diseased or malformed seedlings. If space is an issue, move to additional containers but remember that sunflowers don't thrive on being transplanted.









Keep watering as before until each sunflower is about a foot (30 cm) tall, at which time you should double the amount of water they have been receiving.

, A sunflower should be positioned so that it gets full sun all or most of the day; no sunflower can handle shade for most of the day. If you have the sunflower growing indoors, choose a sunny room but avoid placing it too close to a window because air near windows is often hotter or colder than the room temperature and this can be harmful to the plant.Try to keep the container away from extreme rain.








, In two weeks the sunflower should now be a decent size.








, The sunflower buds should now be just showing.








, While sunflowers don't need additional feeding, giving them extra nutrition can give the flowerheads a boost. Apply a ready-made, branded general purpose plant fertilizer (follow the directions on the container for flowers) or an organic fertilizer like vermicompost or home made kitchen compost.

, The bud should just be ready to bloom.








, In many cases, you will find that the sunflower becomes top heavy and needs to be staked up to hold the glorious flowerhead up high. A simple bamboo or similar stake with plant ties will be sufficient to keep the sunflower's head up high. However, this should probably be anchored to something other than the pot unless you're absolutely certain the pot is strong enough to hold without falling over.You might tie the stake to a wall pipe, a bookcase frame, or similar objects inside the house, or to the drainpipe, wall or other objects if outside. Be aware that not all sunflowers require support – simply observe how your sunflower is coping on its own before deciding.








,









To get the seeds, you have to let the flower die on the plant and just wait. As the flower dries out, the seeds ripen and dry too. While this isn't very pretty, at least the birds can't take the seeds if you've got your sunflower indoors!
If eating the buds, blanch them first to remove bitterness, then steam or boil for three minutes. They are delicious tossed in garlic butter.

Plan to take Rose of Sharon cuttings in summertime.,
Always take more cuttings than you need.,
Take a 5 inch (12.7 cm) cutting from your Rose of Sharon plant.,
Propagate your Rose of Sharon cuttings in compost.,
Alternatively, propagate your Rose of Sharon cuttings in water.,
Change the water regularly until the cutting is ready to plant.,
Be aware that plants grown from seed may not look like the parent plant.,
Look underneath your existing plant for any seedlings.,
Wait until the pods turn brown before harvesting them for seeds.,
Sow your seeds in a seed compost.,
Keep the planted seeds moist and in a bright location.,
Mulch established Rose of Sharon plants in the spring.,
Prune the plant back in the early springtime.,
Consider feeding your Rose of Sharon over the summer months.,
Spray the plant with insecticide if it becomes infested with pests.",How to Propagate Rose of Sharon Cuttings," The best time to try rooting Rose of Sharon cuttings is over the summer months (May, June and July).;
, Be aware that not all cuttings will ‘take’ (successfully develop roots). For this reason, you should always plant more cuttings than you need plants from. You can usually count on between a third and a half of all cuttings developing into viable plants.

, Take about 5 inches (12.7 cm) of strong healthy recent growth from your Rose of Sharon, cutting at a 45 degree angle.


The growth should be soft and green, slightly hard but not woody – it needs to be this year’s growth, not woody old growth. Remove the lower leaves from your cutting.
Dip the cut ends into rooting hormone or powder. Now you have a choice of how to root your cuttings: in compost or in water.

, If you choose to start your cuttings in compost, insert about 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm) of your cutting stem into pre-moistened compost in a pot. It’s best to use cutting compost or to make up a 50:50 mix of regular compost with grit.


Cover the pot either with a clear plastic bag (make sure this doesn’t touch the cuttings – use plant sticks to support the bag away from the stem if necessary) or an inverted clear plastic bottle with the spout cut off to make a mini greenhouse.
Keep the potted cutting moist and away from direct sun – it should root in about a month or two.

, Some gardeners like to start the cutting off in just a clear glass or plastic container of water rather than planted in compost. What’s good about this is you can see the roots form.


Put about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water into a glass or plastic container, put the cutting into its container and leave in a bright place out of direct sunlight. You should cover it with a clear plastic bag and mist the cutting daily with water from a spray can.
Although it's recommended that you take several cuttings to allow for failure, it's important that you put each cutting into a separate container, otherwise bacteria tends to build up.

, If you are propagating your Rose of Sharon cutting in water, you will need to remember to change the water regularly: every two or three days is advisable.


It’s best to use rainwater if possible. If you don’t gather rainwater in your garden, and don’t have access to a stream, you could try standing tap water in a pitcher for 24 hours. This will get rid of some of the chlorine in the tap water. This isn't essential however, and your cuttings may be fine in tap water.
After you see roots of about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) length, plant them into moist compost. Again, keep them out of direct sun for a few months until the roots are a bit more established.

, If you grow Rose of Sharon from seeds you harvest yourself, you may find that the newly grown plant doesn't look exactly like its parent plant. Gardeners say the plants ‘don’t come true’ when this occurs.

, If you want to try growing from seed (regardless of what the new plant will look like), you should try looking underneath the existing plant first, as your Rose of Sharon may have self-seeded.


See if there are any seedlings waiting for you that you can dig up and replant elsewhere. This will save you the effort of growing the plant from scratch.
When you do this, you might like to hoe or pull out the other seedlings so that your garden isn’t overrun with Rose of Sharon!

, If you prefer to plant your own Rose of Sharon seeds, wait until the pods are brown and mature before harvesting them.


Some gardeners plant the seeds outdoors in the fall and let them get going over the winter.
Other gardeners will start the seeds off indoors about a month before they expect the last frost.

, Regardless of whether you are planting the seeds indoors or outdoors, you should sow your seeds in a seeds compost. Moisten the compost, lay the seeds on top and cover with about a quarter inch of dry compost. Spray with water.

, If you start the seeds indoors, make sure to place them somewhere light but out of direct sunlight, such as an indoor window ledge that doesn't get direct sun. For both indoor and outdoor seeds, keep the compost moist until the seeds germinate in about 2 to 3 weeks.

, Once established, mature Roses of Sharon don’t need a great deal of attention. However, they will appreciate a mulch in the springtime.


To do this, remove any remnants of the previous year’s mulch layer. If it has been dry recently, water the area. Apply 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of a mulch material such as well-rotted manure, compost or leaf mold.
Place this under the leaf canopy (the entire area covered by the shrub’s foliage).

, To do this, remove any dead, diseased or decaying growth. Any dead, diseased or damaged stems should be cut right back to the base of the stem.


Cut each branch so it has only 3 buds on it – this encourages larger blooms.
Pruning time is also good time to apply a balanced slow release (granular) or liquid fertilizer.

, Some gardeners like to feed their Rose of Sharon once or twice over the summer flowering period, but this isn’t essential.


Your Rose of Sharon is susceptible to being over fertilized but is pretty resistant to being under fertilized so don’t worry too much about using chemical fertilizers – especially if you are mulching.
Annual mulching will provide good soil improvement so you don’t need to worry too much about chemical fertilizers.

, Rose of Sharon is fairly pest resistant but can be prone to the usual pests, such as aphids. Spray with an insecticide if you notice this is the case.

Keep long, strong shoots that have as much length as possible.,
Tie the long shoots to the trellis or framework against which the miniature climbing rose is growing.,
Keep new shoots in preference to old ones.,
Trim strong shoots carefully.",How to Prune Climbing Miniature Roses," Cut back dead or dying shoots to the healthy wood. All other shoots must be treated as follows.;
, On rose bushes, these are shoots that you would target for removal. For climbing miniature roses, however, these shoots remain important for continued climbing growth. Remove only the tips of these growing shoots.

, Fanning out long shoots is best done when the shoots are young and green (and therefore more pliable).

, Cut back and shorten flowering shoots that have grown along the length of the previous year's branches. When doing this, leave one or two buds of the thinnest shoots. The rest can be removed.

, These can, in the main, be kept. Tie these shoots back into the framework regularly to encourage growth in the pattern that you consider desirable.

Choose the right time of year to divide.,
Know your iris.,
Dig up the iris clump or part of the clump at a time.,
Break off and separate the larger fans.,
Dig an area where the irises are to be replanted.,
Pour the soil in around the root and pack.,
Space rhizomes 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) apart and make sure the fans point in the same direction.,
Water deeply after planting.",How to Divide Bearded Irises," The best time for division of bearded irises is post flowering, at which point re-establishment of each plant will occur quickly. This can be around late spring and early summer, up to early August in the northern hemisphere.Avoid dividing during dormant periods (wintertime) because the plant is trying to survive on the energy stored in its rhizome., Given that division can differ slightly between irises, it is important to know which irises you are seeking to divide. This article applies to the bearded iris, the best known of the irises. If tried on other irises, be aware that there may be delays in flowering as a result. For example, beardless irises have rhizomes (roots) that grow on the same point each season and they do not take well to being moved.If you do move beardless irises, they will probably not flower the season after the move.

, Use a spade or a fork. Note that the clumps can be heavy, so it's a good idea to have a helper on hand. Shake or hose off any excess soil from the roots.

, The rhizome should easily break off at a joint.


Choose firm rhizomes that have both roots and a leaf fan. Discard (and do not compost) rhizomes that seem squishy or limp, as they may be rotten or diseased.
This is a good time to remove spent foliage and larger, older leaves that may cause your plant to tip over before it establishes new roots. Do leave most of the foliage.
You can break off the rhizomes by hand, or use a sharp knife to make the cut cleaner.

, Form a mound in the center and sit the rhizome on top of this. Spread the roots out in the hole.

, The soil should go up to the top of the rhizome. It is fine if the rhizome is partially exposed.


Bearded irises appreciate a limed soil, so provide this if necessary., Some sources suggest spacing of one foot (30cm) or even two feet (60cm), especially for tall bearded iris. When you choose your spacing, decide how dense you'd like your bed to be, and how soon you would like to divide your irises again.

, Water well every week until fall to establish the patch. Infrequent, deep water is better than more frequent, shallow water. Irises are reasonably drought resistant, but too much water can encourage rot.

Remove the dried Christmas roses.",How to Preserve Christmas Roses," The flowers should be in full bloom, in good condition and without flaws.;
, Suitable desiccants include silica gel, sand or borax. Silica gel is probably the simplest, so it's the method used here.

, Grind the gel down before using (place in a plastic bag and roll over with a rolling pin). Clean everything thoroughly afterward.


If you don't want to grind down the gel, mix it with 1 part fine sand to parts of silica gel.

, A shoebox or similar box will work well. Poke holes across the base of the box.

, Make sure that the paper goes up the sides of the box too, as you'll be pulling it out later, while the flowers and gel are still on top of it. Fill the box with a layer of the desiccant to about 1/2 an inch/1.5 centimeter (0.6 in).

, Check that the flowers are completely dry before adding them; the less moisture, the better.

, Place the lid on the box (or cover firmly with brown paper and tie it down). Let sit in a dry, cool place for 5 to 10 days.

, If the silica gel has changed color from bright blue to pink, this is a sign it has absorbed moisture from the flowers. If the flowers are papery, they're dry.

, Let the silica gel fall through the holes into a container for disposal. Make the holes bigger if needed.

, When most of the silica gel is out of the box, pick up the roses. They can now be used for craft, floral arrangement or whatever else you have in mind.

, Protect the pages of your book by using absorbent paper on either side of your rose as pigments in the petals and stem may stain them. Place a rose every ⅛ inch between the pages of the book. Close the book and weigh it down with more books or other heavy items. Let the flowers dry for about a week before checking on them.








Replace the absorbent paper every week and allow the roses to dry for up to 3 weeks or more.
Make sure the roses are as dry as you can make them before pressing them. Do not place them in the book directly from the vase. Shake off excess water.

, Place each rose between absorbent paper and heat an iron to its lowest setting. Make sure that there is no water in the iron because you do not want moisture from steam to ruin the process. Flatten the rose with a book after placing it in between the 2 absorbent pieces of paper. Press the iron on the top sheet for 10 -15 seconds. Wait for 10 -15 seconds and repeat.








Do not use a gliding motion but rather just press the iron down onto the top sheet. Check by gently lifting the top sheet to make sure the flower is dry.

, When the roses are about to open, hang in a dry, dark, and warm area. make sure that there is good ventilation and allow them to dry for about 2 - 3 weeks. Hang them upside down using a string to tie the stems together.








Hanging them upside down prevents moisture from being trapped in the petals. Moisture can lead to mold which can damage your flowers.
The roses will shrink as they dry. You may need to retie them together if the string is no longer tight around them.
Be careful when handling the dried flowers as they can be very brittle.

, Do not expose the dried roses to direct sunlight. Avoid placing them under a table lamp. Display dried flowers in a glass dome or box to avoid handling as they can be extremely brittle."

Use a sanitized vase.,
Water your roses and make note of which blooms you want to cut.,
Cut your roses at the ideal time of day.,
Be mindful of how open you want you roses before cutting.,
Cut and re-cut the rose stems.,
Condition and refrigerate your bouquets.,
Select long-lasting rose varieties.,
Use flower preservation products and change the vase water often.",How to Preserve a Rose3," Thoroughly wash a vase with hot water and soap. Use a bottle brush to scrub out any residue and then soak the vase in a 5% dilution of bleach for a several minutes. 








Create a 5% dilution with one cup of bleach for every gallon of water. You should also use this dilution for cleaning your scissors before cutting your roses.
Bacteria that deteriorate freshly cut roses may reside in vases that have not been clean.

, Water your roses well the night before cutting them. The roses will have more substance thanks to the extra drink of water. While you water, make note of the location of the blooms you want to cut so that you can immediately refrigerate them after you have cut them in the morning.







, Cut your roses in the morning. You may cut them as early as you have daylight, which can be anywhere from 5:00 am to as late as 10:00 am depending on the time of year. Cut your roses earlier if the weather is hot. In contrast, cut your roses later if there is a lot of morning dew.Try not to cut your roses at midday or later as they will have the least amount of substance.
Keep your roses cool. Roses will last longer in cool weather and deteriorate in heat. If the weather is cool, you may be able to cut your roses later in the day.

, The degree of openness you want for your roses depends on their intended use. Cut the roses just after their budding stage as the petals just start to unfurl if you want them to last longer, like in the use of a bouquet. The variety of rose will open determine when you should cut them as some may be cut at a more open stage.For example St. Patrick and Moonstone roses have many petals and can be cut when they are more open.

, Cut the stems at an angle with clean, sharp cutters. The angle prevents the rose from standing flat, blocking any water from being absorbed. Place the roses in lukewarm or cold water as soon as they have been cut. Re-cut the stems when you have them underwater to eliminate air bubbles that can lead to premature wilting and shorten the life of your rose.Remove any foliage below the waterline if you’re using the roses for a bouquet.

, Fill a bucket of water so that the stem of the flower is completely under water but the bloom remains dry. Let the flowers drink the water in a cool and dark room for an hour. Refrigerate your roses at 38 degrees fahrenheit or until you are about to use them.Cut roses will last longer if they are placed in the fridge overnight as you sleep.

, Florists bread roses to last long once placed in a vase. If you are using you own roses, make note of which last longer once cut. Hybrid teas tend to last longer than antique roses.Varieties that tend to last longer in vases are:Crystalline
Secret
Red Intuition
St. Patrick
Veteran’s Honor
Black Magic
Andrea Stelzer
Louise Estes
Moonstone
Elizabeth Taylor



, Floral preservative can be purchased online or at your local flower shop or garden supply store. They can be added to the vase water to extend the life of the roses. Change the vase water often as old water contains bacteria. Softened water may contain salt that is not good for roses.Cut your roses under water every day as you change the vase water.

Allow the blossom and the leaves to completely fade on their own.,
Snip off the blossom (if you haven't done so already) and the withered leaves right at the soil line.,
Dig deep into the soil several inches away from where the bulb is located.,
Clean off the bulb by brushing excess soil away with your fingers.,
Examine the bulbs for any signs of rot, deterioration or damage that may have been caused by nibbling critters.,
Set the bulb aside in open air for a short period of time (usually about an hour) until the last bit of soil has dried.,
Loosely place the bulbs into a well-ventilated bag.,
Hang the bulb-filled bag in an area that will not be exposed to direct sunlight, heat or dampness.,
Allow the bulbs to cure.,
Examine the bulbs again before replanting them.",How to Cure Daffodil Bulbs for Replanting," Avoid cutting them back until they are completely withered. This will usually take about six weeks. Even though it might look scraggly, the foliage collects the sun's energy through photosynthesis and pumps it down into the bulb so it can grow next year. If you want, you can cut the spent flower early, but be sure to leave the stem intact.;
, If you’re going to leave them in the ground, that’s all you need to do. Normal watering of the garden and winter rains will not bring them up to bud until they are “ready”. That’s it. If your preference is to bring them up for over-summer storage, proceed to the next step.

, Try to bring the bulb up with one clean spade full of soil and the bulb. Use care not to damage the bulb. Handle them gently, because bruising them will cause them to rot.

, Any bulbs that are clumped together will probably separate on their own as you brush off the dirt. Leave the ones that are firmly attached to the mother bulb as is. Remove any “caked-on” moist soil that is clinging to the bulb.

, Discard bulbs that do not appear to be healthy.

, Then, with a brush or a towel or rag, remove any additional clinging soil.

, A mesh onion bag or the leg cut from a pair of pantyhose or nylon stocking works very well. Inexpensive tulle from a fabric store can be used to fashion a bag, too. Close up the opening of the bag with twine or string, leaving enough excess to form a loop for hanging. You can also rest them on an old window screen set on two boxes or sawhorses so that air can flow underneath them.

, Far corners (away from the door) of the garage are fine, but avoid placing the bag near a water heater or laundry appliances. Generally, a shady spot with good air circulation is good.

, If you're using a bag and you've hung it indoors, you can simply leave them alone until you’re ready to do Autumn planting. If you used a window screen or if you left your bulbs outside, bring them in and put them in a paper bag for storage in a dark, cool, well-ventilated spot.

, Look for any signs of rot or mildew and discard them if they do not appear healthy. Plant the remaining bulbs and wait for them to bloom in the Spring!

You can also consider the appearance of the roses as well as their size. Here are several of the most popular and beautiful varieties of roses:



Floribunda. These are the most colorful types of roses, and they are bushy shrubs that bloom freely, creating clusters of three to fifteen blossoms instead of just one blossom on a step. These shrubs can be grown individually but look the most impressive when you plant many rows of them next to each other.

Hybrid Tea. These are one of the most popular types of roses, which grow as upright bushes that grow one flower per stem. These may be the roses you're most used to seeing at the florist's.

Grandiflora. This beautiful variety of rose is a mix between a floribunda and a hybrid tea. It grows up to six feet tall and creates classic hybrid tea flower clusters.

Shrub and landscape roses. These roses come in a variety of shapes and sizes and they can suit any landscape. They grow close to the ground, are naturally disease-resistant, and they require less attention than other roses while bearing roses over a long season.

Climber roses. These roses add flavor to any garden and typically grow on a fence or a trellis. They have long, arching canes that have many flowers which can cover pillars, walls, or any structure that offers them support.

Miniature roses. These are the smallest of the rose plants and they can grow anywhere from six inches to two feet tall. These roses flower continuously and are great for container gardening, making borders, and for growing in a small space.

Tree roses. These roses have a hardy rootstock and are grafted to a long stem that is then grafted to a rose bush at its top. The tree rose is visually stunning but it takes more care for it to survive through the winter.;
, This is an important distinction to make because you will have to plant the roses differently depending on whether they are bare root roses or roses that come in a container. Both will need to be planted into the ground to make the roots grow in the earth, but you'll have to choose between the two parts below to find what to do to plant your preferred type of rose. Here's what you need to know about the two kinds of roses:Bare-root roses. These roses will not come with flowers on them, but that's not a bad thing. It means that the bush can expend its energy on developing its roots, not sustaining its flowers. You can plant these earlier in the growing season, as early as six weeks before your region's last average frost date in spring and not any later than two weeks after that date. If you plant them at the right time and using the right method, these roses will grow faster than container-grown roses.

Container-grown roses. These roses have the advantage of already having flowers and therefore looking more beautiful when you plant them in your garden. They're usually sold in 1 gallon (3.8 L) sizes or larger and you'll have to be more careful about growing them in true springtime because they're more likely to get nipped by frost.

, Your planting site will determine the fate of your roses, no matter how beautiful and tough the initial roses may be. You should find a place that gets at least 5-6 hours of direct sunlight each day, especially in the morning. You should also plant your roses near any shelters, such as a wall or a fence, if they're going to be in a particularly windy area. Here are some other things to keep in mind as you choose the perfect site for your roses:Hot climates should have some shade to protect the roses from the hottest sun. Cold climates should have a warm wall or a fence to keep the roses from getting too cold.
Your soil should have good drainage. Before you plant your roses, dig a hole and pour water into it to make sure that it drains after just a few hours. If your soil is too moist, the roots of your roses may rot. If this is the case, then you should consider planting your roses in raised beds.
Make sure your soil isn't too thick or sandy. Adding organic materials such as dehydrated cow manure, shredded bark, or compost can help the soil reach the right consistency.
Avoid planting your roses near trees or shrubs. They will compete for nutrients, water, and light, and they will not win out.
The soil should not only retain moisture easily, but it should have a pH between 6.5 and 7.

, Having your roses and location is a great start, but if you want to plant the roses, then you have to get all of your materials in order. Here's what you will need:


Fertilizer
Mulch
Pruning shears
Gardening gloves
Compost or rose planting mix
A spade
A shovel
A filled watering pot

, This is the best time for planting bare root roses. While you can purchase container roses and continue to water and care for them while they are still in their containers, when it comes to bare root roses, you'll have to plant them immediately after you purchase them, so make sure you have everything you need.

, The hole should be bigger than the roots of the rose and the earth attached to them so that the roots have something to grab on to as the plants grow. This is what you will need to do to plant one bare root rose. However, many plants are sold in groups of three and growing them that way can be a great plan. If you're planting more than one rose, however, then you should make sure they are planted at least 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) apart, so their roots have room to grow., Mix it well until you've formed a mound of the entire mixture at the bottom of the hole you've dug.

, If you're planting in a warmer climate, then you should position the the rose so that the bud union of the rose is just above the level of the ground. If it's colder, the bud union should be about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) below ground level. The roots should be covered, but the stem should be out of the ground.

, This will keep out any air pockets that could harm your roses. Then, pat the soil around the roots a bit more firmly. Keep filling the hole with the mixture until it's about 3/4 full. If you're shoveling with your hands, just watch out for the thorns.

, Let the water soak all the way into the soil and then refill the hole. Trim the canes of the roses so they're about 8 inches (20.3 cm). Do this by making angled cuts that are about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above the outward facing buds.

, This will protect the canes of the rose from drying out. In about two weeks, the buds should sprout, and then you can remove the mound.

, This is an old gardener's trick that will help the plant retain water a bit better and which will also keep it from falling down after the first wind., This is typically the time when you will find the roses for sale and when the frost will be guaranteed to be over. These roses are more prone to frost so you will have to plant them in the right season so you don't risk it., If you've kept the roses in a container for a while or if they're just very moist, wait until the moisture goes down a bit so that you can plant them more easily. If the roses are too moist, the roots won't grow as much and you may lose some of the roses when you transfer them out of the container.

, This is the same thing that you'll need to do if you're planting a bare root rose. Use a spade or a shovel to dig this hole.

, First, remove the bottom of the container, and then remove the sides when you set the container into the hole. Remove the container off the sides as if you were peeling an orange. The container may just look like a pot and will have to be removed at once., This will help expose the roots a little bit and will make it easier for them to grow into the soil in the soil bed. This will also help straighten out any roots that got tangled from growing in the small rose container. To loosen the roots, you can score the rose by making vertical cuts with a sharp knife. The scores should be opened about an inch to let the roots form.

, Fill the hole with simple potting soil when you're done.

, This will eliminate any air pockets and will help your container roses grow strong.

, Water the plant, wait for the water to drain, and water it once more to get off to a good start. If you have organic mulch such as bark, pine needles, or wood chips, then you can add this to the top layer to help retain the moisture of the soil.

, Usually this is when the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil is dry. To stay healthy your roses need a lot of hydration and food., Four weeks after planting, you should start soaking the bed every 2 weeks or so. Do this in the morning for the best results.

, Use 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) of mulch to control the moisture, temperature, and to stops weeds from popping up. Mulch also helps to lock in the vital nutrients your roses need in order to remain healthy. Read How to Grow Roses for more information on how to care for your roses after they've been planted.

, Pruning your roses will keep them from getting crowded and will make them grow healthy and strong. All you need is some pruning shears and a good eye for what you need to eliminate. You can cut off any rootstocks (suckers), which are new plants that grow from the roots of the old plant, as well as any remaining canes that are thinner than a pencil, which rub or cross each other, or which are just not fitting the desired shape you want for your roses.

, In the winter months, or just when it gets unseasonably cold, you may have to take action to keep your beautiful roses alive in the winter. You should cut back your rose plants to about 24 inches (61.0 cm) so they don't get harmed by ice and wind. Then, you should tie the canes together with twine to further protect the roses from winds.Each rose plant should have a nice mound of fresh, loose compost or soil around its base.
You can add another layer of hay or straw over the mound for further protection.
When spring comes around, you can remove the added protection.

Change the water regularly.,
Treat the water.,
Take care of the stems.,
Keep an eye on the temperature.,
Remove excess leaves.,
Cull flowers as necessary.,
Use appropriate tools.,
Use preservatives.",How to Care for Flowers1," One of the things that causes cut flowers to wilt so quickly is bacteria in the water. The most basic thing you can do to preserve cut flowers is to change the water once a day. Use cold water and add ice cubes before adding the flowers to the vase., You can also treat the water to inhibit bacterial growth. Two tablespoons of sugar, apple cider vinegar, or even a penny at the bottom of the vase can keep your flowers looking fresh for longer.A small amount of bleach in your vase water works well to control bacteria growth mentioned before and keep water clear.

, Different types of flowers have different types of stems, and different types of stems require different treatments in order to keep your flowers looking fresh. The most basic way to treat the stems is to trim the ends a small amount each day when you change the water and cut them at a 45° angle but you may also want to:Split the bottom inch of the stem for woody stems like lilacs. This helps it absorb more water.
Sear the stems of milky stemmed flowers like poinsettias. This milk harms other flowers in the bouquet. Daffodils also produce this milk but searing won't work for them, so avoid using them in mixed bouquets.
Fill the stems of hallowed stem flowers, like dahlias. Fill the stem with water, plug the hole with your finger, and then submerge them. This will help them stay upright and fresh.

, If it's too hot or too cold in the spot you've placed your cut flowers, they will wilt much more quickly. Move them to a good, temperature neutral spot.


Some flowers, however, do better at warmer temperatures. If you have tropical flowers, like Bird of Paradise, consider a warmer spot.

, Remove leaves, flowers, or branches which would fall below the water line. Having these in the water encourages bacteria growth.

, Once flowers start to get really wilted, pinch them off. This will help keep the plant from throwing a bunch of energy into maintaining them.

, Don't use household scissors to cut plants. These are intended for paper and can hurt the plant's ability to absorb water. Use tools that are intended for flowers and plants and make sure they're kept sharp.

, You can also add preservatives to the water, like Floral Life, and these will help provide your flowers with the nutrients that they miss out on after they're cut. This will significantly increase the life of your cut flowers.

Use the best possible pot.,
Use the appropriate soil.,
Keep an eye out for pests and mold.,
Give the flowers the right amount of sun.,
Introduce some fertilizer.,
Deadhead to encourage more blossoms.,
Maintain a good watering routine.,
Increase the pot size if necessary.",How to Care for Flowers2," You need to use a large enough pot with good drainage. You might also want to consider pots made out of plastic or resin, since these won't absorb water that should go to the plant.

, Potted plants need a more nutrient rich soil than garden plants, since they don't get the benefit of water circulation like regular plants. Use a high-quality potting soil and pair it with some compost.

, Potted plants, like garden plants, are prone to pests and mold. Even more so because they lack the natural environmental counterbalances. If mold develops on your soil, remove the top layer of soil and replace it. If you end up with a pest problem, deal with it promptly before your flowers are negatively affected.

, Different types of flowers need more or less sun. Carefully plan where you will place your pots so that the flowers get the correct amount. You'll have to keep the light angle, time of day, and directionality of the sunlight in mind when placing the pot (don't just put a sun-needy flower in front of just any window). If you don't have access to enough sunlight, trying using a fluorescent light.

, If the plant doesn't seem to be taking off in the way you'd like, introduce an appropriate fertilizer for that particular plant. Consult your local nursery for a good product.

, When the blossoms get wilted or are simply growing in an unnecessary location (such as under the rest of the plant), you can encourage more and healthier blossoms by pinching off the ones you don't want.

, Check the soil for moisture daily and provide the right level of water to keep the soil damp enough for your particular plant. The temperature of the environment, exposure to natural rainfall, the type of soil, and the type of plant all play a part in how much water your flowers will need.

, Check your plant every now and again to see if it needs a bigger pot. Turn it over and look at the drainage holes. If lots of roots are poking through, you need a bigger pot."

Water flowers regularly.",How to Care for Flowers3," Outdoor flowers are a favorite for bugs and other wildlife (roses are like deer crème brulee). Treat your flowers or build them a removable greenhouse to keep them safe and growing happily.

, Some flowers require full sun, some prefer partial, or even full shade. Make the most of your house to provide these needs - use the sunny side for sun-lovers and the shady side for shade-dwellers.

, Weeds will take away resources from your flowers and keep them from reaching their full potential. Generally, you know this. But what you may not be doing is staying really vigilant. If you can weed every day or every two days, that is best. Don't just occasionally remove one or two really bad weeds. Try to get them all.

, Remove blossoms which have begun to wilt, remove excess flowers before they start to bloom, and cut back dead or overgrown branches. This will help your plant to focus on the blossoms that you want it to.

, You want to save your plants from the risks associated with frost. Carefully time plantings and transplants so that it is not too cold or too hot. They are delicate and often can't handle the shock!

, Some plants bloom better if you prune or cut them back at specific times of year. For example, summer-blooming trees and bushes benefit from a winter pruning. Look up the specifics for the types of plants you have.

, Plant them in good, suitable soil with plenty of compost for nutrition, mulch for water retention and space to grow. You'll also want to pay attention to the pH. Check what is recommended for the flowers you grow and adjust your soil accordingly.

, If you have an entire garden that requires constant high maintenance, then none of your special blossoms are going to be able to get the attention they really need. Mix flowers you don't have to pay as much attention to with those that need more care to help ensure that all of your flowers reach their full potential.

, It is important to get the watering balance right - don't over water or the flowers might rot. Don't underwater or they might not get enough and wilt and die. It is very important to know the requirements of your type of flower.

Look for a combination of mixture elements that will provide good drainage.,
Make a mixture out of any of the following items combined with quality potting mixture suitable for seedlings:


Coarse sand - 2 parts coarse sand, 1 part potting mixture
Perlite or vermiculite - either mix through the potting mixture or mix through the coarse sand mixture
Peat - add peat to any of the mixtures if you have it available; it will greatly improve drainage capacity

Cut off the stalk at 6 inches (15 cm) from the base.,
Line a cardboard box with newspapers.,
Store in a cool, dry climate between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (4 to 10 Celsius).",How to Care for Dahlias," You can’t plant dahlias until the soil in your garden is over 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 Celsius), so planting can occur between April and June, depending upon your location. You can usually plant these tubers around the same time as you plant your tomatoes.


These tubers prefer morning sunlight, and they can benefit from shade in the hottest hours of the afternoon.
Check your hardiness zone at http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov

Dahlias do best in zones 8, 9 and 10, where they do not need to be dug up every winter. They do best in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Dahlias can also be planted in colder zones with long, sunny summers.;
, You must cut off any rot you see before planting.


If you want to combine them with other flowers in your flower beds, it is recommended that you choose small to medium varieties so they don’t compete too much with other plants.

,, They also like slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.5 to 7. Ensure you are amending the soil in a well-drained portion of your garden.Avoid using packaged topsoil that has been pre-treated for weeds., Dahlias with large blooms should be spaced 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) apart in rows. Place a sprinkling of bone meal in the hole for a preliminary fertilizer.


Smaller, bedding dahlias can be planted closer, approximately 9 to 12 inches (23 to 30 cm) apart.

, Cover them with soil. Mound them with 6 inches (15 cm) of soil. , They will rot easily in overwatered soil.


If you live in a very dry climate, you can moisten the soil slightly before planting.

, They should be watered for 30 minutes at a time 2 to 3 times per week. Make sure the water is gentle and drains completely.


The water must reach a depth of at least 4 inches (10 cm).
Some warmer, drier climates may require watering every other day.

, Slugs particularly love small, immature dahlias.

, They will need the support later in the growing season. As they grow, you can tie the stems to the stakes with nylon hose or garden tape.

, Avoid over-fertilizing, since dahlias can be sensitive to this.


Avoid fertilizing late in the season.

, This is the point below the second set of leaves. It will cause the plant to divide and create more blooms.

, Wait until the stem is at least the length of your wrist to your elbow. Blooms come in groups of 3, and you can pinch off the left and right blooms to produce a larger central bloom.


Place the cut flowers in hot water. Then, let them cool over the next hour. They should last 4 to 6 days.
Cut your flowers in the morning for best results.

,, You can spray the plants with insecticidal soap to discourage pests.

, The foliage will begin to blacken when it gets cold. Wait several days after that, so that the tubers can freeze.

, Make sure you have a thick layer of mulch to insulate them over the winter.


Dig up tubers in colder climates.

, This is necessary to avoid killing them in all cold winter climates.

, Rinse them to remove soil and allow them to air dry.

, Set the dahlia tubers in the box so that they are not touching. Pour sand, peat moss or packing peanuts around the tubers.

You can technically plant them in the early fall, as well, but roses planted in the fall may not be as strong the following season.;
, Roses generally prefer full sun, so the spot you plant them in should receive an average of at least six hours of sun per day. A spot that receives early morning sun from the east is generally better than one that gets hot afternoon sun from the west.Choose a spot with plenty of space. Climbing roses tend to overtake the space that they grow in, so they should be positioned away from trees, shrubs, and other plants.
Soil near walls and fences tends to be dry and low-quality. If you want to plant the rose within 1 foot (30 cm) of one, replace the soil with an even mix of quality topsoil and well-rotted compost or manure., Roses suffer from ""replant disease,"" meaning they may struggle or die if planted in soil where another rose plant grew.Remove 6 inches (15 cm) of topsoil and replace it with soil from another part of your garden. For best results, mix the new soil generously with compost and allow to settle for 2–3 weeks.

You may use the displaced topsoil to grow any plant besides roses.

, Roses need light, well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Chop the soil in the plant bed up using a trowel or shovel and mix several handfuls of compost into the soil. Mix enough in that ⅓ to ½ of the plant bed consists of organic material.


Skip this step if you already replaced the soil.

, Climbing roses are often planted as bare root plants, without any container or ball of dirt. Before planting a bare root plant, soak in a bucket of lukewarm water for about an hour. Remove any leaves or hips from the stems, and prune long or damaged roots.



Sanitize pruning shears before each use to prevent the spread of plant diseases.

, A good rule of thumb is to make the hole about twice as wide as the actual plant. Usually, this means that the hole needs to be about 18 inches (46 cm) wide and 12 inches (31 cm) deep.

, Scrape soil from inside the hole to form a small bump or hill.


Some rose growers like to sprinkle rose fertilizer, bone meal, or other nutrients at the base of the hole. Do not use fertilizer on plants with young roots, as it can burn them. Other soil improvements should be based on the specific qualities of your soil.

, Sit the plant on the peak of the mound and carefully spread the roots out down the sides of the mound. (If your plant has a root ball, just spread out the roots growing around the outside.) Check the location of the graft union — the knot or ball where the root system was attached to the base of the trunk. Lay a tool handle flat from the edge of the hole to the trunk, and compare this with the level of the graft union:


If you have dense or clay-heavy soil, plant the graft union about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the soil surface to prevent rotting. Adjust the height of the mound as necessary.
If you have light, loamy soil, plant the graft 1 inch (2.5 cm) below ground level.

, Fill the hole to the brim with water and let drain. Keep an eye on the water level. Continue to the next step as soon as it finishes draining, to prevent the roots drying out.

, Add soil back in the hole, until the roots are fully covered and the soil is level. As you fill, tamp down with your hands gently. Do not tamp with your feet or tools, as densely packed soil could harm the roots or interfere with the rose's growth.


Pay special attention to tamping early on. Make sure there are no air pockets around the roots.
Make sure the crown of the plant is above the soil level. The crown is the point on the trunk where the stems emerge.

Make sure that the roses get enough water.,
Avoid watering the leaves and blooms.,
Check the soil 2-3 times a week.,
Add mulch to your soil.",How to Plant a Climbing Rose2," Roses require about 1"" of rain each week, so make sure that you supplement their water needs if the rain isn't falling. Water them at the base of the plant near the soil., While you can't control where the rainfall lands, if you add water to your plants make sure that you're avoiding buds and leaves. Otherwise, your plant may suffer diseases and rot, which can result from water. Instead, focus your watering on the roots., To make sure that your soil is moist but not soggy, check it 2-3 times a week. If it feels dry, add water. Allowing the roots to get too wet can harm your plant, so if your soil has been soggy, give it time to dry before adding more water., Place a 2-4-inch (5-10 cm) layer of mulch around your rose plants. The mulch will help keep your plants moist, and as a bonus it will also help protect against weed growth. During the winter, mulch can also help keep your roses from freezing."
"
Choose the right climbing structure.,
Position the trellis in the ground.,
Install the trellis in the ground.,
Attach the rose canes to the trellis.,
Avoid major pruning for several years.",How to Plant a Climbing Rose3," Climbing roses tend to be fairly heavy, so you will need more than a pole to support them. Consider using a rose tower or teepee trellis, using the process described in the steps below. Alternatively, use existing structures:


You may grow roses on a pergola or gazebo.
Roses can grow up walls or fences, but the lack of air circulation can cause issues. Using a trellis or horizontal wires near the wall is recommended.
Roses can be convinced to climb up a tree, but they will not cling to it on their own. Try tying sturdy string onto the lowest tree branch and anchoring it in the ground next to the rose.

, Place the trellis about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) away from the roses. If planting the roses near a wall or fence, do not lean the trellis directly against the structure. Instead, allow for at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) of space in between the trellis and the wall to give the roses plenty of air circulation.

, You can often install the trellis simply by pushing its legs about 4 inches (10 cm) into the ground. If the soil is hard, dig a hole for each leg of the trellis instead. Pack soil back into the holes firmly to keep the trellis anchored.

, The smaller stems that carry the flowers are called rose canes. Attach these canes to the trellis as the rose bush grows tall enough to reach the bars. Choose the strongest canes and loosely tie them to the trellis using stretchy cloth, such as nylon or pantyhose.Try to keep the canes spaced evenly apart, gently bending the new canes outward to cover the trellis.

, Other than removing dead branches, leave the rose shrub alone for two or three years. After that time, you can begin pruning side shoots down to two or three buds every winter, when the plant is dormant.


When you are ready to prune your roses, you need to follow a specific process. Make a 45 degree cut about 1/4-inch (6 mm) above a leaf node. Be sure to angle your cut away from the leaf node so that any water on the plant runs away from the node instead of towards it.

"
"
Pick petals from fresh roses.,
Make sure you cut young flowers in the early morning before the day heats up.,
Avoid harvesting roses just after it has rained as the petals will be moist.,
Keep your cut flowers cool until you are ready to pluck the petals.,
Pluck petals from closed blooms.",How to Keep Rose Petals Fresh1," It’s important to use very fresh roses if you are harvesting petals. If you are harvesting your own roses, make sure the bush is hydrated before you cut the flowers. To do this, water the plant the night before you cut the flowers.;
, Use a sharp knife to cut the stem. A clean cut means the stem will absorb water better than if you inflict a crushing cut from a blunt tool.


Try to make a diagonal (slanting) cut rather than a straight, square one. Doing this increases the area of cell tissue exposed to water so that the stem can drink more.

, It’s important the rose petals are dry when you store them. If this is unavoidable, lay the petals out on a clean dry towel after harvesting and gently pat them dry.

, Place your cut flowers in cool water in a clean container such as a vase until you are ready to use them. It’s a good idea to keep the vase in as cool a position as possible. A cool cellar or garage works well; at the very least store the vase away from direct sunlight and drafts.


You should avoid placing the vase near electrical appliances such as TVs as these emit heat. Try to change the water every other day.

, Try to use a young, slightly closed rose bloom for taking petals rather than a fully open one or any bloom that is starting to drop petals voluntarily. However, don’t use buds that are too young and tightly closed. The bloom should be just about to open.

"
"
Keep the roses watered twice a week, soaking the entire root base.,
Lay down mulch around your roses to lock in moisture and promote growth.,
Fertilize your rose bush in the early spring, and once a week if the roses are in containers.,
Prepare the plants for winter by freezing them, not trying to keep them warm.",How to Maintain Roses1," Rose roots run deeply, so make sure you get all of the ground around the roses nice and drenched. Roses tend to do best up to 90 inches of water a year, but they don't like being constantly wet. A good drenching in the summer months 1-2 times a week should be perfect.


Consider getting a soaker hose, which slowly lets water into the soil to drench down to the deepest roots.
Make sure to water the roots and soil, not the leaves. Wet leaves and blooms promote bush-killing fungus.;
, Mulching your roses is highly recommended, as it will make them much easier to keep hydrated. It also chokes out many species of weeds. A 2-4"" layer of garden shavings, or professional mulch, will be perfect.


Leave a small space, about an inch, between the mulch and the base of the roses., This should be done early spring when the buds are beginning to appear but leaves have yet to grow. A general-purpose garden fertilizer added once a month will do wonders. If you have potted roses, you'll need to fertilize more often, and slow-release fertilizers added once or twice a season may be your best bet. Always water the plants before adding fertilizer -- this plumps them up and prevents stress.


Adding fresh compost to the roses can eliminate the need for fertilizer. Otherwise, consider adding it once a month if you feel your soil isn't very nutritious.
Add a tablespoon of Epsom salts to the fertilizer in early June to promote new growth.
You can over-fertilize, harming the plants. Follow the directions on the bottle for the best results.

, Winterizing roses keeps them frozen, instead of trying vainly to keep them warm throughout the long winter. To do so, stop fertilizing the plants 6 weeks or so before frosts come, but keep watering them. Add some fresh mulch, straw, pine needles, or compost as the frosts begin. Once the weather is permanently below freezing, you want to loosely cover the bushes:


Use chicken wire or a mesh cylinder to surround the plant, filling the enclosure with mulch, wood chips, compost, etc.
Covering with specific ""rose cones,"" made for winterizing.

"
"
Know when you should harvest the petals.,
Look your blooms over before harvesting the petals.,
Select rose flowers that are at their peak and have not yet begun to fade.,
Be careful not to bruise the petals by holding them too tightly.,
Make sure to leave some blooms behind.",How to Harvest Wild Rose Petals1," Wild rose petals are commonly harvested to make tea, jellies and jams but they can also be used in sandwich spreads, omelets, syrup and salads. The best time to harvest wild rose petals is early in the summer when roses are in full bloom.


However, as mentioned above, some areas will have roses that bloom at different times throughout the year. Run an internet search to find out when roses generally bloom in your area.;
, Be cautious about where the wild rose petals are harvested. Pesticides and herbicides are often sprayed on wild roses growing along roadsides or other public areas. Automobile exhaust will also contaminate wild roses growing along highways. Be sure to find wild roses in an area that is free of these chemicals.


Avoid blooms from plants that are infested with bugs or diseases. Be selective when choosing petals; a few bad petals can ruin an entire afternoon worth of work.

, Pick your rose petals early in the morning. To pick the petals, simply hold the rose stem with one hand, gather the petals together in the other hand and pull them off.

, Pinch the white tips of the petals between your finger and thumb and tear them off the stem. These white tips where the petal was attached to the flower stem have a bitter flavor. Place the petals into a bag to carry them home.

, Wild roses generally have five petals per bloom. When picking blooms, don’t pick all the blooms from each plant. Leave some to be propagated for next year.

"
"
Remove the petals from the flower.,
Wet a paper towel.,
Put the wet paper towel at the bottom of your bag or container.,
Close the bag using the zip lock or put the lid on the box.,
Take the bags out every other day until you use them.,
Store your petals for three to seven days.,
Consider drying your rose petals after you have used them.",How to Keep Rose Petals Fresh2," Gently shake off any insects and discard any damaged blooms or petals. To remove the petals from the rose:


Grip the closed bud very lightly just below the petals.
Squeeze around the base just below the petals and gently twist the stem to loosen the petals. Grip very carefully to avoid bruising your petals.

, Take a paper towel or paper napkin, fold it a few times, and wet it slightly. It should be able to hold the water like a sponge without dripping. Place the wet paper towel into a clear plastic bag or plastic freezer bag (ideally one with a zip closure or press seal).


Alternately you can use a tupperware container or some kind of plastic box such as an old margarine or ice cream container. Just make sure it’s clean and dry.

, Place the rose petals on top of the paper towel. Don’t cram them into the bag or box as they are likely to bruise and break. Use several bags or boxes if required.


Air should be able to circulate around the rose petals; this will help prevent them from rotting.

, Put the bag carefully into the fridge. Place your contained rose petals on their own shelf so that nothing can fall on them. You can stack the bags on top of each other but make sure nothing heavy rests on them.


Make sure that they don’t touch any part of the fridge that may cause them to freeze. For example, don’t let them touch the back wall of the fridge as this is sometimes icy and will freeze them. Freezing will cause your petals to become mushy.

, It’s important to take the bags out every other day. Give the bag a gentle shake and turn it over. This stops the petals from sticking together and helps air circulate in the bags.

, It’s sometimes possible to keep rose petals fresh for up to a week in a fridge but try to take them out before the seven days are up. Ideally you should use the rose petals as quickly as possible after harvesting them.

Try to use the petals within three days of plucking them from the flower.







, After using your petals for your event, you can try drying them for use in potpourri. Lay them out in a single layer in a dark dry place for about two weeks. Once dry, put the petals in a clean, dry jar. Add some drops of rose essential oil.


Give the jar a shake every few days for about a month before adding it to potpourri.

"
"
Cut the flowers off once the petals are starting to fall off, a process known as ""deadheading."",
Cut away dead branches, growth, and leaves in the fall after blooming is over.,
Prune your shrub to about half of its normal size in early winter.,
Cut at an angle when pruning, just above an outside facing bud or branch.,
Remember that roses tend to grow perpendicularly to where you prune, adjusting accordingly.,
Know that it is almost impossible to over-prune a shrub.,
Note if you have once-bloom roses, which must be pruned only after the flowers bloom.",How to Maintain Roses2," After a flower has bloomed and is starting to wilt, clip it off with a sharp pair of pruning shears right above the leave set closest to it, leaving just the leaves and stem. Flowers cost the bush a lot of energy, and deadheading allows it to save this energy to make new blooms. Stop deadheading in the fall, a few weeks before frosts are forecasted, to avoid letting new shoots freeze to death.Deadheading usually starts in the early spring, with the first sets of blooms, but continues throughout the blooming season. It encourages repeat flowering.
Your goal is to let the stem, or ""cane"" keep developing with more leaves and flowers. Don't cut it right where it meets the bush., Dead canes are easy to spot -- they're all brown, thin, and haven't produced any buds or new leaves. Cut 2-3 inches below the dead spots to stop the spread. Spotted or mottled branches, which may be diseased, should go, too. You can trim these away throughout the season, but you definitely want to get rid of them in the beginning of winter.


Any branch thinner than a pencil's diameter should be cut away right before the bad frosts -- they won't make it through anyway.
Roses need good airflow to stay healthy, and too many leaves and branches crowding the center of the plant can lead to mold issues., This comes as the frost die down, so it can be as early as January or as late as April in colder areas. Simply cut the tops down as you like, rounding the roses into a nice, round bush.


In the roses first 1-2 years, keep this a little lighter. Only remove the top third or so of branches, as the plant is not yet established., Take a look at a cane (stalk) from your rose bush, and find the little bud of a new branch. Using sharp shears, cut diagonally above this bud or set of leaves, leaving the but completely on the stalk. This will promote growth to this new bud while chopping all the ""dead weight"" above it.


Outside bud means one facing away from the center of the plant. This promotes outward and upward growth, which prevents ""clogging"" the center of the plant.

, If you prune a lot off the top, the roses are going to grow sideways. If you prune on the edges, the plant will grow up. This is why a rounded rose bush is often the easiest way to prune roses, as all sides will grow more or less equally. But there are specific instances where this might not be desirable:


Climbers should be tied straight up, with dead growth snipped away. Keep deadheading the tops and keep tying up new major canes to promote climbing.
Groundcover roses shouldn't be snipped at the ends. Instead, follow the cane back to the source and cut it as low down as possible. Cutting the ends promotes upward, uneven shoots.
Multiple roses planted together can be treated as one plant, and cut into a hedge or large single shrub., Roses have the remarkable ability to sprout new buds out of even the oldest branches, meaning you can really hack away at it and still keep the plant alive, though a little bit slow for a year or two of blooming. This doesn't give you carte blanch to start snipping everywhere, but it should remind you to be confident and follow your gut as you cut. You won't ""ruin"" anything permanently if you follow the basic steps above.

, If your roses only bloom once a year, you cannot prune them using the methods discussed below. These roses are usually old, mature plants that bloom around mid-July. Once the roses bloom and the petals start to fade and fall, prune it to your shape and cut away any dead growth.


You can take off about 15"" of growth every other year with once-bloom roses."
"
Only water the ground around the roses, not the leaves and blooms.,
Remove dead leaves, blooms, and plant debris from around the base of the plants.,
Spray the plants with an anti-fungal to fight black spot and powdery mildew.,
Pick off any big beetles or insects by hand, dropping in soapy water.,
Fight aphids, tiny, numerous insects, with a strong stream of water from the hose.,
Plant a little lavender, or another deer-resistant plant, around the edges if you're worried about grazing.",How to Maintain Roses3," Moisture on the leaves is an invitation for mold and fungus, which can severely damage your plants if you're not careful. When watering, aim low and soak the soil, ignoring the leaves. They will get wet sometimes, most noticeably when it rains, but this is okay. The point is not to keep the leaves completely dry, just not to get them wet if you don't need to.

, This material needs to decompose, which brings in all sorts of molds and fungus. To keep the plants safe, make sure to pick out dead foliage from along the garden bed., If you're going to use the roses, don't spray them down with chemicals. However, if they are purely decorative, a fungus spray is often a good idea to keep them clean and beautiful. You can also get ""dormant sprays"" that will work throughout the winter -- a good choice right before you pack the plants up for the cold.Anti-fungals are especially important during cool, wet periods of weather. If you see black spots on the leaves or a light gray, powdery, fuzzy mold anywhere, spray an anti-fungal immediately.
Good air flow and full sunlight are the most effective antifungals, so be wary when these conditions disappear due to the weather.

, The Japanese beetle is the scourge of many rose bushes, and they can eat away an entire plant in just a few days if left unchecked. As soon as you see one, examine and clean the whole plant before they attract more. Luckily, they are easy to spot and deal with, especially if you catch the infestation early. However, for serious cases where plucking by hand is impossible, an insecticide with carbaryl, permethrin, or neem in it should do the trick.


Organic pesticides (with neem) and soaps will kill the beetles effectively. They will not, however, provide ongoing protection.
Japanese beetles are big, black bugs with pointed backsides and thick, ridged wings., These little insects will slowly chow down on your beautiful roses, but they're too weak to handle the blast of a hose. Try to spray them down on a warm, sunny day, allowing the water to evaporate quickly. For difficult or recurring infestations, a standard garden insecticide should do the trick.


The insects can be multiple colors, but most remember lice -- small, round, and numerous.
Flowers like marigolds, sunflowers, daisies, and dill attract insects that eat aphids, bringing in a natural defense system., Marigolds are another good option, and some intrepid gardeners have found that human or dog hair in the garden area discourages deer. The scent of lavender, in general, discourages animals from browsing or grazing on your lovely roses."
"
Know your climate when picking a rose bush.,
Ensure the roses are planted in neutral pH soil with a simple acidity test.,
Be sure to plant in well-drained, fertile soil.,
Keep the roses where they can receive at least 6 hours of sun daily.,
Plant the roses with a layer of manure or rose-specific fertilizer.",How to Maintain Roses4," Talk to your local garden center to help find roses that will survive and thrive in your climate. If you live up north, for example, you'll need to find a hearty, heavy rose that can survive winter. Southerners need a rose that can handle humidity and heat. Since there are so many rose varieties to choose from, it should not be too difficult to find one that matches your needs, but don't just go in believing any rose can survive anywhere -- they are all very different plants.

, Grab a soil test from you local garden store and use it to check out your garden's dirt. It should be at a pH range between 5.5-7.0 for the best rose growth.


If you soil is too acidic (low pH), you can add finely grown limestone to the soil and test again.If the soil is too alkaline, or basic (high pH), you can add ground sulfur to the soil.

, Don't plant roses in sandy, loose soil or firm, hard-packed dirt. Roses need a deep, lightly packed area of soil to really thrive. The dirt shouldn't keep it's moisture for a long time, as this can drown the roots. Make sure your garden can drain excess water out.


Aim for higher ground in your garden, where there is plenty of room for draining water.
If the soil is relatively easy to dig into, without feeling like sand, it is likely fine for roses., Roses are full-sun plants, so put them somewhere they will get ample sunlight throughout the day, which will lead to bigger, better blooms.In general, south facing walls and areas provide the most sunlight.

, This will help them get off on a good foot, providing necessary nutrients as the plant establishes itself in the soil. You can find many fertilizers specially formulated for roses, or you can go the old fashioned way.


Want to avoid fertilizer and manure? Consider planting your roses with a small square of gypsum and an iron nail -- providing two nutrients needed for growth."
"
Put your harvested petals in a container.,
Rinse the petals.,
Place your petals on a paper towel.,
Decide what you will do with your petals.",How to Harvest Wild Rose Petals2," Place the petals you pick into a container or colder, as you will have to wash them once you get them home.


Make sure you use a container that is sturdy enough that it will protect your petals from getting squished.

, If you have not already done so, place your rose petals in a colander or strainer. Rinse your rose petals under a gentle stream of water.


Doing this will help to remove the petals of dirt, pollen, and bugs.

, Place your petals on a paper towel so that they are not overlapping. Spacing the petals out will promote airflow so that the petals can dry more quickly and will not get stuck together.


Press the petals lightly with another paper towel. However, be careful not to crush or bruise the petals.

, If you’re planning to use the petals immediately in your cooking or to create rose water, you can use your petals now. If you would like to preserve them, dry them in a safe place, or use a dehydrator to dry them in three hours.


You can tell that petals are dry when they are no longer soft to the touch.

"
Choose rose varieties.,
Buy bare root or potted roses.,
Get rose gardening supplies.",How to Grow Roses1," Did you know there are 13,000 varieties of roses?Some roses grow better in certain regions than in others. When you're choosing what type of rose to grow, take some time to research the specifics of your growing region, then look for roses that have characteristics you find appealing. Take their shape, size, and color into account when choosing varieties to grow. Roses fall into the following categories:


Hybrid tea roses are beautifully shaped, colorful roses that often make appearances in flower shops and as part of bouquets.
Floribunda roses are the most colorful of all the varieties. Each bush has many blossoms, rather than just one to a stem.
Grandiflora roses are a cross between the hybrid tea and Floribunda roses, and they grow to be quite tall with several rose clusters to a stem.
Climber roses can be trained to stretch vine-like along fences and walls.
Miniature roses are intricate and tiny, perfect for planting in a container.
Shrub and landscape roses are quite hardy, resistant to pests and disease. They come in many colors, shapes and sizes.
Tree roses are roses that have been grafted to a long stem, giving them the appearance of trees. They require a bit more care than some of the other types of roses.;
, Once you've picked out the types of roses you want to plant, decide in what form you want to buy them. Bare roots are the roots of roses that are planted directly into the ground. You can also buy young roses that have already been planted in a small pot, and transplant them to the ground or another pot. Either type may be purchased in a nursery. Rare rose varieties may be found online.


Bare root roses are planted in early spring, giving them time to take root before sprouting several weeks later when the weather warms up.
Potted roses can be kept inside during the winter, then placed outside in the spring.

, Aside from the bare root or potted plant itself, you'll need a few other supplies to get your rose garden started. Go to your local nursery or check out online retailers to pick up the following:


Pruning shears. Pruning roses keeps them healthy, promotes the growth of blooms, and keeps them in a pretty shape. Shears are essential equipment for growing roses. Get small curved-edge shears and larger lopping shears.
Gardening gloves. Protect yourself from thorns with a thick pair of gloves.
Fertilizer. Roses should be fed with fertilizer a few times a season. You can buy fertilizer specifically formulated for roses, but this is not strictly necessary.
Mulch. Mulching rose beds can help keep pests away and distribute more nutrients to the roses. Get wood chips, pine needles, peat nuggets, or another type of mulch suitable for your area.
Compost or rose planting mix. Mixing this with the soil when you plant the roses helps them grow.
A shovel and spade. You'll need these to dig holes when you plant the roses.

"
"
Decide on a planting spot.,
Water the roses to prepare them for planting.,
Prepare a large hole.,
Plant the roses.,
Water the roses.,
Add mulch to the rose bed.",How to Grow Roses2," You'll need a spot that gets at least 6 hours of good sunlight a day. Choose a spot that's not crowded with the roots or branches of other plants and trees.The soil should be loose and have good drainage; if yours has a lot of clay, loosen it and add some gypsum pellets before planting.


Roses do best when the soil has a pH of 6.3-6.8.To determine whether a site has good drainage, walk around it after a good soaking rain. If the soil is damp, but not waterlogged, it should be fine. If you see puddles or large mud spots, you'll need to find another site or work on this one to make it more conducive to growing roses.

, If you're planting bare roots, soak them in a bucket of water for a few hours before planting. If you're planting a rose you bought in a pot, water it thoroughly before you prepare the planting bed.

, You'll need one for each rose bush you're planting. Use a garden spade or shovel to dig a hole 18 inches (45.7 cm) wide and 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep. The measurements don't have to be exact, but a hole this wide and deep will be suitable for most roses. Mix the soil you removed from the hole with compost, and use some of it to form a small mound in the base of the hole. Add some bonemeal or rose fertilizer.


If you're planting more than one bush, allow several feet of space in between, so the roots have room to grow and stretch.

, Place the bare root or potted rose on top of the mound. Use a shovel to fill the hole back up with soil. The rose's bud union should be located about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the surface of the ground. If you live in a colder region, you may need to plant your roses deeper to protect them from low temperatures.If you're planting a potted rose, loosen the soil around its roots to expose them before planting it in the hole.
Make sure the soil is firm around the roots; press down with your hands to remove any air pockets.

, Thoroughly watering the area where you planted the rose helps compact the soil against the roots, stabilizing the plant. Make sure it gets a good soaking right after you're finished planting.

, Place mulch over the area where you planted the rose. If you planted a potted bush, place the mulch around the stem. This will keep the temperature consistent and protect the roses during the early stage of growth.

"
"
Water them frequently in the summer.,
Fertilize the roses.,
Prune the roses.",How to Grow Roses3," Roses need a lot of water to grow healthy. Don't let the soil dry out; when you see it getting dusty give the roses a deep watering. For established plants, and depending on your region, you'll need to do this about once a week., After they are established, roses should be fertilized a few times per growing season. Use fertilizer (either liquid or granule) in early spring, when you see the first few leaves sprout. Use it again after the first bloom, and again if there's another bloom. Stop fertilizing the roses at the end of the summer, just before Labor Day.Some fertilizers are slow-release, so they don't have to be applied as often.
Don't over-fertilize the roses; this can lead to disease.
Try cow, goat or manure made of kitchen waste to help them to grow better.

, Pruning roses keeps them both beautiful and healthy. The goal is to clear away crowded areas to open up the bush, which helps prevent rotting and disease.The pruning strategy differs according to the season, but the cut you make is always the same: prune just above a bud eyes, the areas where branches form. They look like small circular swells and are usually located above a set of mature leaves. Make a down-slanted cut on an outward-facing bud eye.


It's very hard to over-prune a rose, since new growth is always directed to the next closest bud eye. Keep this in mind when you choose bud eyes to prune, as it will affect the shape of your rose bush.Remember that the key is to prune with an eye toward opening the bush's growth up to allow for air circulation.
In the late winter or early spring, trim the dead canes away. Cut away the rootstock, also called suckers, which are smaller offshoots of the main plant that suck away the nutrients from the rosebush. Leave 8 or so canes, trimmed back to 1/3 of their height. This will promote healthy growth as the weather warms up.
In the summer, remove deadheads, which are dead blooms. This encourages new blooms to grow.

"
"
Protect the roses over the winter.,
Spray aphids and spider mites off with water.,
Protect your roses from black spot and powdery mildew.",How to Grow Roses4," Roses that are left tall may be damaged by heavy winds and frosts during the winter. Trim the canes down to 2 feet (0.6 m). Tie them together with twine, to help protect them from inclement weather. Heap a mound of compost around the base of the bush, then top it with a layer of straw. When the weather warms to above 51 degrees, remove the compost mound.

, These mites are quite common among most of the rose varieties. Using water is the most effective way to get rid of these pests. Use the hose to spray them away when you see them on your rose plants. Keeping the roses adequately watered also helps reduce pest infestations.


Use insecticides sparingly. They can end up harming your roses and other plants in your garden, and kill bugs that are actually helping your plants.
Remove leaves that look discolored and shriveled.
If mites continue to be a problem, try making a solution of dish soap and water and spraying that on the rose leaves once a week.You can buy natural rosemary oil pesticide to spray on the leaves; this discourages mites without killing beneficial insects., Choosing varieties that are resistant to these common diseases, such as knockout roses, is your best bet. You can also protect your roses by using a fungicide at the beginning of the season. Go to your local nursery to ask about how to best protect plants from these diseases in your region.

Choose an appropriately sized container.,
Look for a light container if you plan on moving your rose around.,
Use a plastic liner with a clay pot.,
Opt for a pot that provides good drainage.,
Skip the saucer if keeping your roses outdoors.",How to Grow Roses in Containers1," Miniature roses thrive in a 12-inch (30.5-cm) container, while floribundas and hybrid tea roses need 15 inches (38 cm). Larger hybrids and tree roses need to be in containers measuring 18 inches (45.7 cm) or larger.;
, A container made of plastic will probably be the easiest to re-position. Choose a light color, since dark colors heat up faster and dry out the soil.

, On hot days, soil heats up quickly inside of a clay container. A plastic liner will act as a barrier between the pot and the soil, keeping it cooler.

, Plastic and clay pots with holes at the bottom offer better drainage than containers without holes.

, Saucers placed beneath the pot trap the excess water that escapes, holding it in place below the flower's roots. This extra water could lead to root rot.

"
Choose between pre-potted roses and bare-root roses.",How to Grow Roses in Containers2," Pre-potted roses are often easier to work with, especially in warm climates that do not permit roses to reach a completely dormant state.

"
"
Select a potting soil specifically blended for roses.,
Create your own soil blend.",How to Grow Roses in Containers3," Many garden supply stores sell special blends, and you may have more success with a potting mix designed to promote rose growth than with a generic soil.

,


A simple blend includes a sterile non-soil potting medium, like fine bark, mixed in equal parts with perlite to lighten the mixture.
Another common blend includes 40 percent topsoil mixed with 30 percent perlite and 30 percent screened compost.

Place a one-inch layer of medium-sized bark chips or gravel over the bottom of the container.,
Fill your container two-thirds full with your chosen soil.,
Increase the nutrient level by mixing a cup of bonemeal into the soil.,
Place the rose into the soil.,
Fill in the area around the rose with more soil.,
Water until well saturated.,
Provide a stake for larger rose trees and bushes.,
Tie your rose to the stake using soft ties.",How to Grow Roses in Containers4," The chips or stones should be larger than any holes in the bottom of the pot to prevent them from falling through. This layer provides your roses with additional drainage.

, Loosely pack the soil into the pot. Do not pack too tightly, as your rose needs room to breathe.

, Roses need a lot of nutrients, and bonemeal can provide the fertile conditions your roses need to produce many blooms.

, If working with a bare-root rose, spread the roots out comfortably. Rose roots need ample room to spread out horizontally.

, Gently press the soil around the stems. The surface of the soil should match the place where the roots and rose plant meet.


The container should be filled so that the soil almost comes to the top. If the rose is too deep in the container, pull it out of the soil and add more to the bottom of the pot.

, Even though root rot does pose a threat to roses, these flowers also need plenty of moist soil to survive.

, Choose a wooden or metal stake proportional to the predicted size of the plant when it matures. Plant the stake deep into the pot, allowing it to touch the bottom.

, Old nylons, green garden tape, and polyfoam coated wire all work well.

Space containers 2 feet (0.6 m) apart.,
Position the container in a location that receives full sun.,
Water your roses daily, preferably in the early morning.,
Check the moistness of the soil before re-watering.,
Avoid wetting the foliage during watering, as this invites diseases.

,
Spread mulch over the surface of the soil.,
Fertilize your roses for the first time after a month passes.,
Remove suckers.,
Prune your roses a month before the flowering season, from the second year of planting onwards.,
Dead-head your roses, if you are in a milder climate, where the rose does not grow very vigorously.,
Keep your roses together.,
Transplant your rose after two years.,
Move roses to a sheltered location during extremely cold weather.,
Offer container roses a tablespoon of Epsom salts each spring.",How to Grow Roses in Containers5," Doing so reduces the likelihood of spreading fungus-related rose diseases from plant to plant.

, Roses need at least 7 hours of sun daily to thrive.

, On very hot days, water the container twice a day—once in the morning and once more in the evening.

, Stick your finger down into the top inch (2.5 cm) of the soil. If potting medium feels dry that far down, your rose is in immediate need of watering.

,, An inch of mulch, especially in the form of small bark chips, will hold the moisture in the container and prevent it from evaporating out. Mulch also helps discourage weed growth. Remove the mulch at the beginning of the rainy season; as at that time, the soil should be allowed to evaporate in between the showers.

, You may use a balanced liquid fertilizer or a slow release granular fertilizer once every two weeks from that point on. Don't forget to water 6 hours before and immediately after fertilizing.

, If roses are grafted, sucker growth will be a common problem.The best way to remove a sucker is to dig down to the root where the sucker is originating and tear it off where it emerges. Cutting suckers off from a higher level only encourages regrowth of several suckers where there once was one. Don't forget to use gloves, while handling suckers.

, The aim of pruning is to maintain the attractive shape of your rose and to encourage good flowering. Pruning is not a precise science and you can decide its extent according to the plant growth and the desired size. Generally speaking, pruning to 1/3rd to 2/3rd of the original size is recommended, for vigorously growing to moderately growing plants respectively. Make a sloping cut half an inch or less above an outward facing bud, using a clean and sharp instrument and paint the cut end with an antifungal paste to avoid Dieback disease. The cut should slant away from the bud. Also, remove all dead, dying, thin or weak canes while pruning.

, This is the removal of spent flowers during the flowering season. Dead-heading encourages repeat flowering and makes a tidier plant. Either remove just the dead flower or cut the stem down to the first full leaf.

, Rose does not like the company of other shrubs much. Put all your rose containers together at one or more place(s) of the garden, where there are no other plants sited.

, Roses deplete the soil's nutrients faster when grown in containers than they do when grown in the ground. Some roses also outgrow their containers.

, A shed, garage, or basement should work well.

, Sprinkle the salts around the base of the plant. This provides an extra dose of magnesium to spur foliage growth.

Check for the following signs at purchase time:


Fresh, plump roots
Moist plant;
,
If you have a dry bare rooted rose plant, soak it prior to planting.,
Prepare the pot.,
Half fill the pot with potting soil suitable for roses.,
Place the bare rooted rose bush into the pot.,
Gently shift the roots around the pot so that they are sitting evenly around the space and cascade over the mound.

,
Fill in with a little more potting mix and stop to firm the soil around the roots.,
Place the pot into a tub of water to allow it to soak up the water from below.

",How to Plant a Bare Rooted Rose Bush in a Pot,", Put it into a bucket of water for a few hours.

, Select a pot of a suitable size. Cover the drainage hole with shards of broken terracotta or small pebbles.

, Create a slight mound for the rose bush to sit on.

, Ensure that the bud union is level with the rim of the pot: The roots of a bare rooted rose plant will be pruned so that their roots are half the distance of the container when the bud union sits at the rim of the pot. If your bud union and roots aren't aligning this way, your pot is too large or small.

,, Continue to fill the rest of the pot, leaving 2–3 centimeter (1.2 in) of soil from the top.

Give your roses plenty of water when you first plant them.,
Create a watering regimen for your roses once they are established.,
Give roses water in the morning.,
Feed your roses an organic fertilizer.,
Feed your roses in the spring.,
Give your rose the correct amount of fertilizer.",How to Grow Roses Organically1," When roses are first planted, they should be watered often enough to keep the soil uniformly moist for the first year or two. After that, divide the total amount of water required each week into two to three equal amounts spaced evenly throughout the week.


The soil should be dry at a depth of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) before additional water is given.;
, Roses are thirsty plants that require regular irrigation from spring through fall and even throughout the winter in hot climates. The amount of water required by a rose bush depends on its size and the temperature.


When daytime temperatures stay below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, give mini roses 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water each week and medium-sized shrub roses 3 to 4 gallons (11.4 to 15.1 L) each week. Large hybrid teas and climbers should be given 6 gallons (22.7 L) each week.
When daytime temperatures rise up to over 80 or 90 degrees Fahrenheit, double the number of gallons given to the rose each time.

, Do so that the water is available as temperatures rise in the afternoon. Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of shredded bark mulch around the roses to keep the soil moist and reduce the need for frequent irrigation.

, There are many organic fertilizers available that are excellent for roses. They commonly contain kelp meal, bone meal, chicken manure or alfalfa meal along with other ingredients. Select an organic fertilizer with a Nitrogen-Phosphorus- Potassium (NPK) ratio of 5-7-2, 4-6-2 or something similar.


Nitrogen promotes foliage and Phosphorus promotes flowers. The third number promotes overall health.

, Roses should be given their first feeding in the spring when new foliage first appears. Give them their second feeding when the flower buds form and a third feeding around mid-summer.


Do not give roses fertilizer after the middle of August as it will encourage new growth that may not mature in time for winter weather.

, The amount of fertilizer to give each rose varies, depending on the size of the rose and the fertilizer formulation. In general, though, each rose should be given ¼ to ½ cup of fertilizer. Follow the manufacturer’s application instructions carefully.


Never give diluted water-soluble fertilizer to a rose until after it has been watered with fresh, clean water. The fertilizer can burn a rose’s roots if the roots are dry. Dry fertilizer should be worked into the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of soil before watering the rose.

Pinch away faded blooms.,
Prune your roses at least once a year.,
Cut the stems at a 45-degree angle just beyond a growth bud.,
Know how much of each rose to prune away.,
Remove the foliage in January if you live in a hot climate.",How to Grow Roses Organically2," When the roses are blooming, remove the faded blossoms to encourage more flowers to grow. This process is called ‘deadheading’. Make sure to dispose of the dead heads in the compost pile, rather than leaving them on the ground.

, All roses require some pruning in late fall, winter or very early spring. Use sharp hand pruners with a scissor action to prune your roses.


Dull and anvil-type pruners will crush the rose stem, causing serious damage to the bush.

, Growth buds on rose stems are usually located where a leaf with five leaflets is growing. The new stem will grow from the growth bud just below the pruning cut.

, The amount of the rose that should be pruned off depends on the type of rose. Shrub roses and mini’s usually need only light pruning to shape them after they have been planted for two years.


Large roses like hybrid teas should have all of their stems cut back by about two-thirds every year.
If there are any branches growing across and rubbing other branches, they should be removed. Dead branches should be pruned off whenever they are noticed throughout the year.

, In hot climates where roses are not exposed to freezing temperatures, prune off all of the leaves in January so the rose can start fresh each spring. Seal stems that are thicker than a pencil with white household glue to keep insects out.

Watch roses for aphids, scales, mealy bugs and spider mites.,
Use a homemade mixture to kill off pests.,
Use baking soda to fight mildew and blackspot.,
Encourage good insects to live in your garden.,
Trim away diseased parts of the plant.",How to Grow Roses Organically3," These are small insects that often hide on the undersides of leaves and excrete a clear, sticky liquid. Light insect infestations can commonly be eliminated by spraying roses with the hose every two or three days. Make sure to spray your roses in the morning. Use a spray nozzle set for a strong stream to knock the pests off.

, Stubborn pests can be killed with a mixture of 2 tablespoons of baby shampoo and 2 tablespoons of cooking oil per gallon of water. Spray the solution on the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as on the stems until the mixture drips from the rose.


Spray in the morning or evening when temperatures are cooler and rinse the solution off after two to three hours.

, Fungal diseases that cause black spot and mildew can be controlled by adding 2 tablespoons of baking soda to the oil and shampoo mixture.


Spray the rose once per week when the weather is humid and the threat of these diseases is high.
You can also use a mixture of horticultural oil, baking soda, and water can also be used. Use one tablespoon of the first two ingredients per gallon of water. Do not use this mixture in the middle of the day or it could burn your plant.
Under planting the roses with garlic or chives is said to reduce the risk of black spot and certainly won’t hurt the flowers.

, Encourage beneficial insects to make their homes in the garden by adding nectar-rich plants such as dill, fennel, and so on. This will in turn reduce the amount of harmful bugs that decide to snack upon your beloved rose bushes.

, If one’s rose bushes are suffering from black spot, gardener should remove all the damaged or ailing leaves and tidy up around the plant to prevent the spread of infection. Heavily infected specimens may also require a trim to get rid of diseased parts. After that, the shears used will need to be disinfected to prevent the spread of disease.

Decide what type of miniature roses you want to grow.,
Pick a spot for growing miniature roses outdoors.,
Amend your garden soil with organic compost if needed.,
Dig a hole in the garden.,
Put the plant in the ground.,
Water the rose well throughout the growing season.,
Mulch the area around the roses to help the soil retain moisture and control weeds.

,
Fertilize your miniature roses regularly using a fertilizer designed for roses.,
Prune miniature roses lightly in late winter or early spring before new growth starts.,
Prepare your miniature roses for the winter.",How to Grow Miniature Roses," Miniature roses are available in an assortment of colors and varieties, divided into 4 primary types:


Micro-Minis are the smallest variety of rose plants, ranging from 8 to 15 inches (20 to 38 cm) tall. The flowers these plants produce grow to 0.25 to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm).
Minifloras have a slightly larger plant and flower size, with plants growing 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 m) tall.
Climbers are mini-roses that produce trailers. These plants can climb trellises and other supports.
Trailers also produce trailing shoots; but unlike climbers, trailers have a cascading growth habit which makes them a popular choice for hanging baskets. These also work well for growing on tops of walls with trailers cascading down.;
,


Choose a spot where the miniature rose will not be crowded out or overtaken by other garden plants. Miniature roses are commonly used in edgings, borders, and as accent plants in flower gardens.
Pick a place that gets full sun. Some varieties of mini roses will also tolerate partial shade.

, Roses like rich, moist, well drained soil.

, The hole should be around the same depth as the pot that currently holds the plant. However, if you are planting a mini-rose in the garden, dig the hole approximately 1 foot (0.3 m) wider than the pot.

, Remove the rose from the pot carefully and use your fingers to gently loosen its roots. If the roots have become pot-bound, use a knife to score the root ball. Place the plant in the hole, taking care to spread the roots. Fill the hole with soil and pack it down gently to help the roots make good soil contact.

, Water from the base of the plant and avoid getting the foliage wet.

,, The combination fertilizer should include N (nitrogen), P (phosphorous) and K (potassium) in a ratio of 5-9-6. Deep-water the plants before feeding them.


Feed the plants when new leaves are just beginning to grow and again after each heavy bloom.
Stop feeding the roses to discourage new growth 6 to 8 weeks before the first frost is expected if you live in a cool climate.

, Cut off dead wood and remove up to 1/3 of the plant as needed for shaping or to encourage new growth. Unlike full size roses, minis do not require heavy pruning.

, If you live in an area with harsh winters, collar the plants and add mulch to help them survive the winter.

Experiment.,
Choose a healthy stem from the miniature rose from which you wish to propagate.,
Remove the dead flower from the top.,
Make a bottom cut just below a leaf.,
Plant the cutting in a pre-prepared container already filled with free-draining mix.",How to Grow Miniature Roses from Cuttings," Not all forms of miniature roses will take as cuttings, and unfortunately there is no foolproof list of which can be grown in this manner and which cannot. It depends on the soil, the climate, and the rose in question. So be prepared for some successes and some disappointments -- but do keep trying.;
, Do this just after the flower has faded, and be sure that the stem has a minimum of three to four leaves.

, Do this by cutting just above the leaf closest to the dead flower.

, Remove any excess dead leaves from the stem, ensure that at least three leaves remain on the stem. Dip the cutting in some honey; this helps protect the cutting from rotting, dying, or going moldy.

, Gently pat into place and keep well-watered as it strikes. But make sure that the compost is not wet, as over-watering can kill the cutting; keep the cutting in moist compost.

Plant rose varieties that are best suited to produce homegrown long-stem roses.,
Read the care instructions very carefully for the rose variety you select.,
Use garden shears to prune away all but the topmost bud on each stem of your rose bush.,
Use your shears to cut off any surrounding or supporting branches on each stem.,
Select a fertilizer specifically made for roses to nourish your flowers.,
Water the rose bushes every 2 days.,
Spray the buds with a misting bottle once they form, and continue to mist them every time you water.",How to Grow Long Stem Roses at Home," Some of the best options include, but are not limited to, Bridal White, Antique Silk, Kardinal, and Aalsmeer Gold. These rose bushes are hardy enough to withstand garden living, yet are still capable of producing longer stems if well maintained.;
, Choosing the right location for your rose bush is essential to success. As a rule, select a spot where the roses will be out of direct sunlight. If necessary, create a shaded spot using a tarp or other human-made shelter placed above the bush.

, Most rose bushes will initially produce several buds per stem, and you'll have to gently remove any additional buds in order to help your 1 long-stem rose grow larger. Take care as you snip during the pruning process to avoid damaging the main bud or the stem it sits on. When done properly, your stem should resemble those sold in florist shops.

, Only the stem, leaves, and central or topmost bud should remain. Prune the branches carefully, so that you don't cut into the tender meat of the flower stem.

, If you cannot find such a specific option, choose a humus fertilizer, which you can find at a local garden shop.


Follow the manufacturer's guidelines very carefully when applying the fertilizer to your roses. Using too little means you aren't feeding the roses enough and too much will burn the flowers and cause them to die.

, Rose bushes and their blooms need at least 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of water every week, split up between waterings, to thrive. If you live in a hotter climate, you may need to water more frequently or in greater amounts. An ideal test is to check the soil your roses are planted in. If it's dry to the touch, your roses are thirsty.

, This process keeps dust and dirt away from the flower and helps to moisturize the petals.

Choose a dark rose variety.,
Plant in a greenhouse if possible.,
Consider watering with floral dye.,
Wait until buds starts to swell.,
Experiment with temperature as the buds grow larger.,
Experiment with light.,
Protect the open bloom from sunlight.",How to Grow Black Roses1," There's no such thing as a 100% black rose, although breeders and genetic engineers are trying to make one.However, the right growing techniques can make an extremely dark flower, with just a hint of red or burgundy. Start with a rose variety that produces dark flowers with a velvety texture.Ask a florist for more advice, or track down one of these varieties:


Black Jade is one of the most popular dark roses, but can be vulnerable to pests and disease.It turns dark in hot weather.
Black Baccara is likely the darkest commonly available rose, but the flowers are small and unscented. It appears darker in cooler weather.

Midnight Blue is one of the darkest purple roses available. It has an unusual clove scent.
Other options include Nigrette, Black Magic, Black Pearl, Black Ice, Black Beauty, Blackout, and Taboo. Before buying any rose, check climate requirements and size.;
, The exact color your rose ends up can depend on chance factors such as temperature and light. For best results, plant it in a greenhouse where you can control these factors precisely.









Always look up your variety or ask a garden nursery for information on space requirements, soil type, and sun levels.
For general information on planting and growing roses, read this article.

, Some online sources recommend adding black food coloring to the water used to care for the roses. This is unlikely to work, since the roots will not absorb most dyes. If you want to try this, your best bet is to ask a florist for a professional florist dye. These are usually intended for cut flowers, not living plants, but they are less likely to harm your rose.








, When the closed buds first appear, the plant is still focusing its energy on growing the flower stems. When the stem has stopped growing and the bud begins to swell, the plant has reached a critical stage of development. 90% of the pigments that determine flower color are created after the bud is ¾ size, but before it opens.








If you have a rose variety that blooms multiple times a season, note the bud development on a calendar and use it to track the development of the next round of flowers. This final stage of bud growth will usually take place about two weeks before the flower opens., During this stage, temperature can drastically affect color. Most rose varieties have not been researched in this way, so you'll have to be a pioneer. If possible, try different techniques on different buds or bud clusters. Here are some guidelines to get you started:









Cool temperatures tend to increase the amount of pigment produced, which usually means darker flowers. One study of Crimson Glory roses produced purplish roses at 73ºF (23ºC), and darker, redder roses at 50ºF (13ºC).This is more likely to work in summer.Heat stress usually leads to faded or more orange flowers, but there are exceptions. For example, Baccara roses may end up deepening to a bluer shade.This is a risky technique that can cause flower or plant death; if possible, ask a florist to help you choose temperatures that will stress the plant without killing it. One study of (orange-colored) Jaguar roses exposed buds to three days of 102ºF (39ºC) daytime / 64ºF (18ºC) nighttime temperatures., During bud development, keep Baccara roses shaded for a darker, bluer color.Other varieties may require sunlight in order to develop any color at all.When in doubt, try shading a few branches but keep the rest of the plant in sunlight.








, The darker the flowers, the more heat they will absorb from the sun. After the living flowers are open, keep them in partial shade. Alternatively, cut them and try one of the methods below to make them even darker.









Some roses will bloom dark red in spring and fade to black during summer.If you're unsatisfied with the appearance of your roses, you may want to risk exposing them to sunlight.

"
"
Start with cut, dark roses.,
Try aging your flowers in water or preservative (optional).,
Dry the flowers upside down.,
Spray with floral preserving spray (optional).",How to Grow Black Roses2," This method describes how to preserve dark roses, and encourage them to fade to a darker near-black shade. The rose varieties mentioned above are good choices.









A partially opened flower may remain darker and better-preserved than a fully open flower.If you're buying the roses from a store and can't find any dark varieties, choose roses with velvety petals. This texture will make them appear darker., If your flowers are already quite dark, skip to the next step. If they're much lighter than you'd like, you can try keeping them in water for a few days instead. The effect is usually small and can be hard to predict, but this will usually make your flowers slightly bluer and darker. Water usually has a darker effect than flower preservative, but this can vary between flower varieties.Try one vase of each if you have plenty of flowers to spare.









Flower preservative is available from florists and nurseries. Homemade solutions involving acid and sugar may have a similar effect.For more advice on keeping cut roses in water, read this article.

, Whether or not you kept your flowers in liquid, air drying them can often lead to darker colors. Hang the flowers upside-down in a warm, dry place away from light. It may take two weeks or more before the flowers are fully dry.








, Once the flowers are dry, a florist spray will help keep them around longer. Apply to the dry blossom according to label instructions.









Do not try to dust the flower first, which can easily damage the petals.

"
"
Choose your roses.,
Find the dye.,
Leave the cut flowers out of water.,
Mix warm water and dye.,
Leave the roses in the liquid, maintaining heat.,
Remove the roses.",How to Grow Black Roses3," A white or light-colored rose is usually the best choice. Since these have little color to begin with, it will be easier to get the color you want. This is especially true of dyeing, which can be difficult to detect in a dark rose.









If cutting the roses yourself, use disinfected gardening shears. Scissors may crush the stem, preventing uptake of water and dye.
Cut roses at a 45º angle to allow for more surface area for water and dye uptake., Although some people have tried black food coloring in water, a professional floral dye is safer for the plant. You can order these online, or ask a florist to order it for you.








, Wait at least three hours after cutting the roses or bringing the back from the florist. Stressed flowers will draw up more water, and therefore more dye.








, Check the label on your dye for a recommended concentration. When in doubt, go with 1 tbsp (15mL) floral dye for 1 quart (1L) warm water. The water should feel hot but not uncomfortable, about 100ºF (38ºC). Mix the ingredients thoroughly in a heat-safe container large enough for your roses.









Add flower preservative as well for a longer lifespan.

, Since roses have thick, woody stems, they can take several hours (or even a full day) to change color. To prevent blotchy, incomplete dying, keep the temperature at around 100ºF (38ºC).You can periodically add warm water to achieve this, or put the whole container in a slow cooker set to this temperature.








, Once the roses have turned black, remove the bouquet. Rinse the dye off the stems and transfer to an ordinary vase of water.









If the flowers are blotchy, leave them in plain, warm water overnight to spread the color more evenly."

Choose a location for the Knock Out rose that gets at least three hours of direct sunlight each day.,
Check to see if your soil drains quickly.,
Test the soil pH.,
Mix lime into the soil to raise the pH or add aluminum sulfate to lower the pH.,
Troubleshoot if you need to change the pH when your plant is already in the ground.",How to Grow Knockout Roses1," While these roses are not picky, they do need sunlight to stay healthy.;
, You can do this by digging an 18-inch deep hole and filling it with water. Check the hole after 24 hours.


If there is still water in it, find a planting site with better drainage or build a 1 to 1 1/2-foot high raised bed and plant the Knock Out rose there.

, Knock Out roses grow best in soil with a pH of 6 to 6.5.Soil test kits are generally available at garden centers. Take the soil test sample from 4 inches deep and do not touch it with your hands. If you do touch it, your skin could change the pH of the sample.


Let the sample dry, break it up into fine pieces, place it in the pH test chamber and add distilled water along with the test chemical.
Shake it up and check the color of the water against the color chart provided with the kit.

, The amount of lime or aluminum sulfate required depends on the soil type. Sandy soil will require about 12 ounces of lime to raise the pH of 25 square feet of soil from 5.5 to 6 or about 2 ounces of aluminum sulfate to change the pH from 7 to 6.5.


More lime or aluminum sulfate must be used to change the pH of loamy or clay soil. Sprinkle the aluminum sulfate or lime evenly over the soil and mix it in thoroughly with a tiller before planting the rose.

, If the rose has already been planted but the pH needs to be changed, mix the aluminum sulfate or lime into the top 2 inches of soil with a dirt rake or hand rake. Spread it all the way around the rose in an area that extends 3 feet away from the base of the shrub.


If the soil pH is too high, the rose may develop chlorosis which causes the leaves to turn yellow."
"
Plant your rose at least 3 feet away from nearby buildings or other plants.,
Give your young plant plenty of water.,
Consider using a watering can.,
Water your rose less as it ages.",How to Grow Knockout Roses2," This is to ensure that your plant gets plenty of air circulation. Increased air circulation will make it even more difficult for fungal and bacterial diseases attack the rose.

, Water it generously immediately after planting and whenever the top of the soil begins to dry for the first two years. They can be watered slowly with a soaker hose or simply with a garden hose with the water turned down to a slow or medium pressure. Giving them water more slowly allows it to soak into the ground around the rose rather than running off into the surrounding area.

, These roses can also be watered with a watering can. Just pour the water slowly so it can soak in right where the rose needs it. Distribute the water over the soil around the rose and extending out about 1 foot beyond the outer edge of the branches.


The root system will extend out into this area as the shrub grows., After the first two years, it will survive long periods without water but it will wilt and the leaves will turn yellow. Water it once every week or two during dry spells to keep it looking its best.


If it is being watered too much, the leaves will turn yellow and drop.
Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of organic mulch like shredded pine bark around the rose to help conserve moisture.

"
"
Give your Knock Out rose fertilizer in the spring when it begins to put on new leaves.,
Fertilize at several different times throughout the growing season.,
Watch for signs that your rose is getting too much or too little fertilizer.,
Prune the Knock Out rose only lightly in late winter or very early spring.Use sharp bypass-type hand pruners to remove dead or damaged stems completely at any time of the year.,
Do not pick off your rose’s dead blooms.",How to Grow Knockout Roses3," Use a fertilizer designed for roses with a 5-10-5 or 4-8-4 ratio..


Spread 1/4 to 1/2 cup of fertilizer over the soil around the rose just before watering it.

, Give your plant another dose of fertilizer when the new flower buds appear and again at about the middle of summer.


Do not give Knock Out roses any fertilizer after the middle of summer as it will produce lots of new, lush stems that will not mature in time to withstand the cold winter weather.
Even in mild-winter climates, they should not be given fertilizer in late summer or fall so they can still have a bit of a dormant season to rest up for spring.

, If the Knock Out rose does not get enough fertilizer, it will grow slowly, bloom less and the leaves may become pale.


Too much fertilizer may cause the edges of the leaves to turn brown.

,


Cut out any stems that are growing across other stems as they will rub when the wind blows and damage each other.
After the rose is a few years old, trim each stem back by one-half to one-third their height. #Hold the pruning shear correctly. Make the pruning cuts at a 45-degree angle about 1/4-inch above a growth bud which is a small, raised area of plant tissue on the stem, usually right where a leaf with five leaflets is growing.
New stems will grow from the growth bud just below the pruning cut.

, Deadheading, the process of removing faded blooms, is not required with these roses. They will drop their blooms to the ground as they fade. Rake up and remove any trimmings after pruning the rose. The dead flowers should be raked up and removed every few weeks as well.


When left in the garden, dead flowers and trimmings provide an environment for bacterial and fungal infections.These rose shrubs are resistant to such diseases but other nearby plants may not be. The other plants will be less likely to contract these diseases and the garden will look nicer when it is cleaned up.

Look for signs that your rose is being attacked.,
Recognize different pests.,
Control pests as they appear.,
Rub away pests.",How to Grow Knockout Roses4," Check the Knock Out rose for pests like aphids, mealybugs, scales and spider mites a couple times each month. Knock Out roses are rarely bothered by them but they may do some damage. One tell-tale sign that these pests are making a meal out of a Knock Out rose is a sticky clear liquid called honeydew that they often secrete on the rose leaves while they are feeding.


Look under the leaves and along the stems for the pests.

, Aphids are small, oval insects that are usually green or red but can be nearly any color.


Mealybugs and scales are flat, oval insects that attach themselves to the leaves or stems and rarely move.
Spider mites are very tiny pests that are usually first noticed when they spin a very fine web between the leaves or branches.

, If these pests are detected, spray the Knock Out rose thoroughly with a strong spray from the garden hose in the morning to knock the pests off and wash off the honeydew.


Aphids usually can’t get back on the shrub and spider mites hate moisture.The rose may need to be sprayed once or twice each week to keep the pests under control.

, Mealybugs and scales can be rubbed off with a thumbnail or a cotton ball soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol.

Monitor the plant's growth for the first few years.,
Prune the plant in summer and fall.",How to Grow a Cherokee Rose," The Cherokee rose is a plant very similar to a natural wild rose. It has five petals and grows like a shrub.


Unlike the wild rose, however, the Cherokee can reach impressive heights, towering more than 30 feet (9.1 m) in the air, if given the right tree to climb.
You should be prepared to prune the plant each year and give it space to grow.;
, You’ll find the rose either under its common name Cherokee or under its Latin name Rosa laevigata. Several varieties exist and choosing the right one for your area is a must.


Cherokee will not grow in areas cooler than zone 7a so the species as a whole is a bad choice for areas which experience harsh winters. Any hardware store, box store, or garden house in the correct regions will have this beautiful plant.
For more information on identifying which plant hardiness zone you live in, see this article.

, Choose a plant with a thick base stem and healthy green growth. If any spots, dark areas, or mold appears on any of the plants be wary of purchasing from that store. Cherokee rose is not hardy to diseases and will succumb quickly even during a brief contact.

, The Cherokee rose is a wonderful grower, with the capacity to grow over 15 feet (4.6 m) in a single summer.


You should plant the rose near a trellis or support (you could allow it to climb up the side of a garage, for example.)
Do not plant this rose plant near a tree you don’t want overrun with roses. This plant loves to use the branches of trees and will quickly overtake a slow growing tree.

, The Cherokee rose plant blooms during warmer temperatures, with the first blooms emerging after the days remain reliably above 50 degrees. The rose will continue to grow until later fall frosts force the plant to drop their leaves.


If you want to grow the rose in a colder area; plant the rose indoors or in a planter where it can be moved to covered areas— any temperature below 0 °F (−18 °C) is dangerous to the plant.

, This is what you'll need to plant the Cherokee rose:


A shovel
Heavy duty gloves
Rose fertilizer
Peat
Organic Compost or Manure

, You’ll need to dig down several feet and you don’t want accidents to occur, such as hitting a pipe. Your hole should be one foot from the structure you plan to support your rose with, and be in an area with full sun, and have good air flow.

, The hole should be at least 2 feet (0.6 m) deep but may need to be bigger for more mature roses.

, Place a mixture of peat and organic manure into the hole until the pot is level with the ground. The plant needs this rich soil for developing roots and will suffer if placed in un-altered soil.


Fill the remainder of the hole loosely with the peat and manure mixture and then place 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of topsoil above the plant and hole. Cover with an inch or two of mulch and water completely.
This structure will protect the roots of the plant in case of extreme temperatures, will provide drainage during wet times, and conserve water during droughts.

, After a few days, water with the rose fertilizer, mixing according to package directions. Continue to fertilize according to the schedule provided on the package.

, Other than infections the plant will need nearly no maintenance. If you wish, weave canes into your support and secure with soft, stretchy ties.


The Cherokee rose will not need much pruning during the first years but feel free to remove canes near the ground when they grow in areas you don’t want.

, The Cherokee rose grows quickly, so be sure to prune the plant in the summer for size and shape, and then again after the leaves die back in the fall to remove the smaller canes for increased air flow.

, It can be a whole branch or a stem.


With your knife, gently scrape off 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of the outer covering of the clipping at the bottom. This will allow the rooting hormone to get into the stem.

, Tap it a few times to remove the excess.

, If everything goes right, it should start to put out roots within the next week or so!

Make a hole with the knitting needle.,
Add the hormone powder.,

House the cutting.,
Keep a summer cutting well watered.",How to Grow a Rose Bush from a Single Stem or Cutting," Place the tip of the large knitting needle in your selected spot and hammer it all the way into the ground. Pull the knitting needle out of the ground. This makes a nice, neat hole for your rose cutting or stem to be placed.;
, Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands from thorns and to protect your cutting from germs. Make several small cuts along the stem of your cutting. Keep the gloves on while you cover all the fresh cuts with the growth hormone powder.

, Immediately place the cutting into the hole you prepared with the knitting needle.


If you are propagating from a rose stem, push the stem all the way into the hole until the bottom of the flower head touches the ground.
If you are propagating a cutting with leaves, push the stem down far enough that at least five of the leaves are not in the ground. It will look like a tiny plant.

, Place the jar over the cutting and water. In approximately nine months, the cutting will have taken root and will be a new baby rose bush for your garden.

, If you are propagating during the summer, it’s important to water the cutting regularly, as you would a normal rose bush. However, if you are propagating in the fall, simply leave it alone until spring and remove the jar when you see new growth and there is no more threat of frost.

Trim the first buds from the scion.,
Let the tape fall off on its own.",How to Graft Roses," Graft your roses in mid-summer, because this is when the sap inside the plants is flowing. If the sap and nutrients are flowing, there's a better chance the graft will take and the new rose will thrive.The best time for grafting is after the mid-summer bloom cycle, which usually occurs in August.;
, The scion, or the bud, is the plant you are going to be grafting onto another plant. With roses, a scion is often chosen because of its beautiful flowers, because those flowers will continue to grow after the graft.The best scion is a young stem from the plant. The stem should have established leaves, should have flowered recently, and should have some hardwood starting to develop on it.
For the best results, choose a stem from which the bloom has just faded.

, The rootstock is the plant to which the graft will be fused. Rootstocks are often chosen because they're healthy and hardy, but they may not have the prettiest flowers. In order for the graft to take, the rootstock must be another rose plant.


Two of the most popular rose varieties for rootstock are Dr. Huey and Fortuniana., Roses need plenty of water to thrive, and the graft will have a better chance of taking if both the scion and rootstock plants are well watered before the procedure. Ideally, start giving both plants daily waterings in the two weeks leading up to the graft.


Make sure the roses are watered thoroughly two days prior to the graft, and the night before., Plants are susceptible to viruses, bacteria, and fungi just like humans are. You can prevent the spread of disease by working with sterilized gardening tools, especially when you're carrying out a delicate procedure like a graft. Not only will this help ensure the graft takes, but also that the plant survives.


The easiest way to sterilize your budding knife is with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol.
Get a clean rag or cloth damp with the alcohol. Wipe the blade thoroughly, making sure you get the tip, sides, and base of the knife. Be careful not to cut yourself in the process. Set the blade aside to air dry for a few minutes., With clean pruning shears, prune your rootstock plant to remove dead foliage, blooms, and stems. Select a healthy stem with many well-developed leaves for the actual graft site. Use the budding knife to remove all the buds and prickles from the middle section of the stem.Removing the prickles isn't strictly necessary, but it will prevent you from cutting yourself during the graft.
Removing the buds is important because you want the buds from the scion to grow, not the ones from the rootstock.
When pruning or taking cuttings, cut on a 45-degree angle to reduce damage and increase circulation.

, With the bud knife, cut an inch-long T shape into the bark of the rootstock. Make sure you do not penetrate the cambium layer, which is a wet, pale green color.Use the tip of the knife to gently open the flaps you created in the bark.


The best place for the T cut is near the middle of the stem, between two nodes. Nodes are where leaves and buds grow out from the stem.

, Cut off the stem you want to use for the scion. Cut off the top and bottom from the stem, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) section in the middle. Make sure that section of stem has at least one bud eye, where a new leaf could grow from the stem.


Use the budding knife to cut off any prickles, buds, and leaves from the piece.
Trim the stem an inch (2.5 cm) below the lowest bud eye., Place the knife on the stem above the bud eye. Insert the blade deep enough into the stem to penetrate the bark and the cambium layer. This is the layer just behind the bark that carries nutrients.


Cut out the bud eye, making sure you take the bark and cambium layer as well.

, Make sure the bud eye is facing upward, as this means the stem is facing the right direction. As you insert the scion into the rootstock, the bark flaps will open around the scion. Push the scion all the way in to the bottom of the T, leaving the bud eye exposed at the top of the flaps.


The cambium layers of the scion and root stock will now be in contact, and this is what will allow the graft to take., Close the bark flaps over the scion. Wrap a few layers of grafting tape around the graft. Wrap the area above and below the bud eye, but leave the bud eye itself exposed.


Don’t be afraid to pull the tape gently to stretch it out, as this will ensure the cambium layers stay in contact., Grafted plants need lots of water. For the next two weeks, water the rootstock daily to ensure the soil stays moist. You don’t want the soil soaking wet, but make sure it stays damp., Once the scion starts to create new growth on the rootstock, it will begin to grow new buds. But while the scion is still establishing itself, the buds can be too heavy and can damage the bud union. To reduce stress on the bud union, trim off the first three or four buds that grow until the graft is fully healed.


Trim the buds with a sharp knife or scissors as soon as they emerge.To help give the new plant the best chance, you can also prune the rootstock above the graft.

, Grafting tape is a special kind of tape, and over time it will naturally decompose and fall off. Do not remove the tape from the rootstock. When enough time has passed, the tape will come off on its own, and this will ensure it stays on long enough for the graft to heal."

Know what goes into fertilizer.,
Look for a fertilizer specially formulated for roses.,
Buy a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer.,
Try a fertilizer with high phosphorus for new roses.,
Opt for an organic fertilizer.Organic fertilizers are chemical-free and preferred by many gardeners.,
Try a liquid fertilizer for newer roses.,
Begin feedings in the spring.,
Water the roses before applying fertilizer.,
Add the fertilizer directly to the base of the roses.,
Do not fertilize when the roses are stressed.,
Feed your roses every four to six weeks during the peak growing season.,
Fertilize container roses more often.,
Watch your roses for signals.,
Stop applying fertilizer after mid August.",How to Fertilize Roses1," Fertilizer formulas are measured by the amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium they contain. These amounts are labeled numerically, according to proportion. For instance, a 10-20-5 fertilizer is made with 10% nitrogen, 20% phosphorus, and 5% potassium.


Nitrogen promotes the growth of above-ground foliage.
Phosphorus strengthens both roots and flowers.
Potassium contributes to overall plant health, and works the same way that an immune booster would work for humans.
Fertilizers also contain other nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. The amounts of these nutrients vary from fertilizer to fertilizer, but they are relatively small compared to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.;
, The simplest way to get what your roses need is to buy a commercial, inorganic fertilizer labeled for use with roses. These fertilizers will also come with instructions on the label for proper application.
.While this is a generally accepted concept, one should realize that marketing intelligence suggests that a package labelled specifically for roses and carrying a rose picture on the package commands a higher price than another plain package containing a fertilizer with virtually the exact, same contents. But the plants can not tell any difference between the two! So whenever possible, it makes sense to buy a fertilizer in plain package with similar fertilizer content.

, Fertilizers that contain equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium generally work for most plants, and roses are no exception. By applying a balanced fertilizer, you can ensure that the roots, flowers, foliage, and overall plant get proper nutrition.

, Young roses have not yet had the opportunity to establish a root system. Since phosphorus is used to strengthen roots, it is especially valuable to new roses.

, They offer a lower dosage of nutrients, but this lower dosage can be helpful when you are still in the process of discovering how much your roses need and how often they need it. Lastly, organic fertilizers also condition the soil for future use. You can opt for a single organic fertilizer, or you can mix a few different types.


Alfalfa meal is a slow-release fertilizer, and when used at a formula of 2-7-0, it provides ample amounts of phosphorus.
Bone meal provides roses with rapidly available phosphorus to promote root and bloom growth.
Cottonseed meal, fish meal, and blood meal provide high doses of nitrogen for full foliage growth.
Epsom salts contain no nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium, but they do contain magnesium sulfate, making it a good additive to use on top of another fertilizer.

, Liquid fertilizers are absorbed more rapidly, making them the best option for plants that are newly developing. In addition, roses that are suffering from deficiencies can also benefit more from fast-acting liquid fertilizers than from slow-release granular fertilizers.

, A granular or organic fertilizer usually works better for this feeding than a liquid fertilizer. You should usually begin around mid April, but as soon as the plant has 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of new growth, you should feed it even if it is a bit earlier.

, This is especially important for water soluble fertilizers, which require water to be activated, but the practice is good to be in even with fertilizers that are not water soluble. Watering the soil prevents the fertilizer from burning the soil or the plant.

, Adding fertilizer to the leaves of the rose can cause the leaves to burn. Likewise, letting the fertilizer get on the petals of the rose will cause wilting. The nutrients in the fertilizer do best when absorbed through the roots of the rose. This is especially true for organic fertilizers, which have the added benefit of amending the soil.

, Roses that are going through a drought or that are exposed to extreme, parching heat are likely to burn if fertilizer is added to them. Roses that have been put through extremely dry conditions should not be fertilized until moisture levels are improved. Even healthy roses should be fertilized in the early morning or evening, and not during the heat of the middle of the afternoon.

, Do not use slow-release granular fertilizer for these summer feedings. Instead, use a faster acting fertilizer, like a liquid inorganic fertilizer or organic fertilizer. If using an organic fertilizer, you can increase feeding to every three or four weeks. Many inorganic fertilizers do well when applied every six weeks, though.

, Roses grown in pots and other containers are generally watered more often than garden roses. As a result, fertilizers are washed out more frequently, especially granular fertilizers. For best results with container roses, you should apply a water soluble liquid fertilizer ever four weeks.

, Your roses will give you clues when they suffer from nutritional imbalance. For instance, iron-deficient roses lack chlorophyll, causing the leaves to become yellow and veiny. Roses that lack manganese also have pale leaves. If the leaves, flowers, or overall plant health of your rose suffers, odds are, it can be traced to a problem with fertilizer.

, Fertilizer produces new, soft growth that can be damaged by frost. As a result, you should end your fertilizing regimen about eight weeks before the first predicted frost date of your region, to allow this grown time to become hardier.

Choose roses with the best blooms for drying.,
Trim the rose stems.,
Tie rose stems together with a rubber band.,
String a clothesline in a cool, dark place.,
Attach your roses to a hanger.,
Hang the roses on the line for 2-3 weeks.,
Preserve the roses with hairspray.",How to Dry Roses1," You want a rose which has a nice bloom, but also no moisture or flaws. The moisture will cause molding and the flaws will be exaggerated in the drying process.You can use blooms which have opened a bit, but don’t use a rose which is already beginning to fall apart and lose its petals., You want to trim the stems, but not too short. Leave 6 inches or more of the stem for drying. Remove the foliage from the stems. The leaves will not dry nicely and should be removed.









Leaves also hold water and will slow the overall drying process., Bundle all of the roses you will be drying and wrap a rubber band around the stems. Leave at least 2 inches of stems beyond the rubber band. Continue wrapping the rubber band around the stem until the roses are secure.








You can arrange the roses into a nice bouquet before drying so they are already prepared to be displayed.

, Find a room which you don’t use often, like a laundry room, attic or a utility closet. The space should still have good ventilation to allow the moisture to escape. Stretch a clothes line or rope between 2 points in this room and tie it securely. Make sure it is sturdy enough to hold your roses.You want to choose a dark space. The color of your roses will darken in the drying process, but exposing them to light will increase this color change, while using a dark space will reduce the alteration in the rose color.

, Pull some of the rubber band used to wrap the roses together over the hook of a hanger. If you have a hanger with an extra hook under the hanging hook, you can strap the roses there. Otherwise, pull some of the rubber band over the hanging hook of the hanger.







, Hook the hanger onto the line in the dark room and leave them to until they are dry. It can take several weeks before your roses are completely dry.







, Once the roses are dry, they will be brittle. Remove them from the hanger and spray them with hairspray to reinforce and protect them from damage.








Use an unscented hairspray when spraying your roses.
Spray the roses lightly to avoid saturating the roses you have just dried.

Choose your desiccant.,
Trim your rose stem to about 2 inches.,
Place the rose in the desiccant.,
Cover the rest of the rose with desiccant.,
Leave the rose in the airtight container for 1-2 weeks.,
Remove the rose from the container and shake off the desiccant.,
Bake silica desiccant for reuse.",How to Dry Roses2," Desiccant is a sandy-textured product which absorbs moisture from the rose encouraging it to dry quickly and evenly. There are several products you can choose from, including borax, cornmeal, alum, and the popular choice, silica gel.









This method is also effective using sand.

, You want to be able to place your rose with the bloom facing up inside your air-tight container. Trim the stem to 2 inches, then test it in the container and make sure that it fits with room to cover the bloom with the lid.








If the rose is too tall, trim more of the stem to fit the container.

, Pour 2 inches of desiccant into the container. Push the rose stem into the desiccant so that the rose stands in place with the bloom facing up.








If you are drying more than one rose in a container, make sure there is at least one inch of space between the roses.

, Using a small cup, pour more desiccant over the bloom to cover the rose. Be sure that the desiccant fills between the petals. If the rose falls to the side, use a spoon to right it until it is balanced again.







, Cover the container with an airtight lid. You may also want to run some masking tape over the edges for extra security. Let the standard roses sit for 2 weeks. Mini roses should dry after 1 week.








Write the date you sealed the container on the side of the container with a pen.

, Gently pour the container out into an oven pan. Pick up the rose by the stem and shake off the excess desiccant until the rose is clean. Gently brush the petals off if the dust persists.








If some residue is still stuck to the rose, pour a stream of desiccant over the trouble areas to drive the residue from the rose.
Pouring the silica desiccant into an oven pan preps you for baking the silica for reuse.

, Silica desiccant shows signs of moisture by fading or changing in color. If it has faded, blue is turning into pink, or orange is turning green, you will want to dry it out by baking the desiccant.








Pour the desiccant into a microwave safe bowl. Set your microwave to medium heat or defrost. Cook the desiccant for 2-3 minutes or until the color has returned to signify it is ready to use.
Remove the bowl from the microwave using an oven mitt. Both the bowl and desiccant will be very hot. Allow it to cool on a heat-safe surface for 24 hours.
If the desiccant is showing signs of moisture from a humid environment, you can bake it before the first use.

Change the water frequently.",How to Cut Roses," In order to lengthen the life of your cut flowers, you need to make sure that the container you keep them in is as clean as possible and free from any bacteria that might kill off your flowers early. Usually, scrubbing the vase with warm water and mild detergent is adequate, but if you know that previous flowers in the vase had a disease or if the vase looks especially dirty, use bleach. Scrub the inside using a bottle brush and follow by soaking it.


If your vase is dishwasher safe, you can also run it on a normal dishwashing cycle. You should verify that the vase can withstand such hot water before attempting it, however.;
, Your garden shears will be the first surface to come into contact with the delicate interior of the freshly cut stems, making it essential that they are clean and free from harmful bacteria. Wipe the blades using a rag soaked in a little bleach or alcohol. Rinse the sterilized blades under hot water.

, Roses last longest when they are cut immediately after the bud stage, when the petals are starting to open. Rose varieties with many petals, such as the Moonstone variety, should be cut at a more open stage, while rose varieties with fewer petals, like the Silverado, should be cut closer to the bud stage.

, Then, that night, give the rose bush a thorough watering, drenching the soil completely so that the roses have plenty to drink. The more water your roses absorb by the following morning, the longer the roses will last after being cut.

, Anytime from daybreak to 10:00 AM should work, but after that point, the weather begins heating up too much. Hot, sunny weather deprives your roses of substance, drying them out and making them weaker. On especially hot days, you should make it a point to cut your roses as early as possible.


Alternatively, you can also cut your roses in the evening. If the roses are watered in the morning or if they receive a great deal of morning dew, cutting them in the evening, after the weather has cooled and the roses have had a chance to recover, can also work sufficiently well.

, Using your clean shears, cut the rose stems at roughly a 45 degree angle. Cutting the roses at an angle prevents the stems from resting flat in the vase, which could prevent them from drinking all the water they need, resulting in an early death. Cut the stems low to the ground, leaving plenty of stem to work with for you to resize appropriately later on.

, This does not need to be your vase. Instead, you should use a bucket with a large enough opening for you to work inside. All further cutting should be done inside this bucket of water to prevent air bubbles or embolisms from emerging inside the stems.

, Bacteria and rot can fester in leaves the sit in still water. You still need to leave the foliage above the water line, approximately the top half to the top third, intact. Otherwise, the roses will be unable to draw up water.

, Make an angled cut underwater, similar the first. This cut will determine the final length of the stems and the final height of your roses. Temporarily remove the flowers from your bucket of water and measure them against the side of the vase to determine where to make the necessary cut. Once you have chosen the spot, return the flowers to the bucket and cut them beneath the water.

, Use warm water. You can either use commercial rose food or make your own plant food by using 1 Tbsp (15 ml) vinegar, 1 tsp (5 ml) sugar, and 3 to 5 drops of household bleach per 1 liter (1 quart) of water.Bleach is especially useful in preventing harmful bacteria from attacking the freshly cut roses. Thoroughly dissolve the plant food before adding the roses.

, Transfer the roses into your vase and sit the vase in a cool, dark room so that the water can thoroughly nourish the roses. Do not allow the blooms to get wet, however.

, The roses must chill at approximately 38 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) for at least two hours or until you are ready to gift them or display them.

, If possible, change the water daily to rid the roses' environment of bacteria. Frequently changed fresh water will help make the roses last longer.


Avoid using softened water that contains salt since salt can hurt your roses.

Spent roses. When roses complete their bloom, they will start to wilt or sag down towards the ground. Their petals will also become extremely loose and fall off even in the gentlest winds. These shoots will need to be deadheaded.

Competing roses. Some roses may cross paths or be entwined together. These roses are essentially competing against each other to grow in the same small space, stunting their growths and their appearances. By deadheading these roses correctly, you can change the direction that they’ll grow next time they bloom.Roses that grow inwards. You always want the union or the bottom base of your rose bush to have plenty of sun and water. A rose shoot that grows inwards will obstruct sunlight and water from reaching the union and possibly cause bacterial fungi to fester. Essentially, you want a rose bush with all shoots growing outwards and a clear path that leads to the union., Observe your rose shoots and you’ll probably see sets of 3 or 5 leaves. The correct way to deadhead a rose is to cut just above a leaf set that has 5 or more leaves. The 5-leaf set (sometimes called a true leaf) should be facing the direction you want your shoot to grow. For example, if you want your rose shoot to grow outward, cut at a 5-leaf set that is pointing outwards as well.


Cutting at the 3-leaf set level can result in a non-flowering shoot called “blind wood”.This means, the shoot can no longer flower or grow anymore roses. However, the blind wood may flower the next season.
You do not have to cut your shoot at the first 5-leaf set you see. Sometimes, a leaf set might be facing the wrong direction and you’ll need to cut further down.

, At the joining point of the leaf set and the shoot, you may see a dark dot just above it. This is called the bud eye and will be the point from which a new stem will grow into a rose. You should make your cut just above the bud eye.


If you need to prune or deadhead many rose bushes, you may not have time to look for each and every bud eye. Fortunately, the bud eye is located very close to its leaf set. Just make your cut about ¼ inch (6 mm) above the 5-leaf set.

, You never want to make your cut straight. The 45-degree cut will help water from your sprinklers or rain to run off of the shoot and avoid bacteria or fungi from growing on the shoot.


There are conflicting opinions on whether gardening shears should be used at a 45-degree angle when pruning roses. Many sources claim the angle at which you cut does not affect how well the plant heals or how many blooms it produces.
Consider placing a dot of white glue on the edges of the freshly cut shoot. It can reduce the risk of disease getting into the base of the plant.

Decide on color.,
Consider size.,
Think about climate.,
Consider maintenance.",How to Choose the Right Roses for Your Garden," How will the color of your roses affect your garden? Look at different catalogs, as well as your neighbors' gardens, to get an idea of the colors you like best.;
, In addition to color, the size of the roses you choose is very important. Consider the height of your roses at full-growth. If the roses grow fifteen feet in height, will they look unattractive in your garden? Remember, the size of roses vary. While some roses may grow up until eight feet, other can grow up to twenty feet in height.

, In order for your roses to grow healthy and mature, they have to be adjusted to your climate. For example, if you live in an area where it snows six months out of the year, you'll want to make sure you purchase roses that can withstand cold temperatures. If you have humid summers, choose roses that are resistant to diseases such as black spot and powdery mildew.

, How much time are you willing to spend maintaining your roses? Do you live to be in the garden, or are you more of a low-maintenance type? There are several types of roses which are very high-maintenance. Although they will look beautiful in your garden, they will require a lot of your time. The classifications known as hybrid teas and floribundas are very beautiful, long blooming, and highly fragrant; however, many of them are disease-prone. Older varieties, ""landscape roses,"" and many others are easy and rewarding to grow.

Also identify them by their size. Look for berries that are anywhere from ¼″ (6.35 mm) to 1¼” (31.75 mm)., Uncut rose stems will form rosehips. Don’t remove all flowers when you prune your rosebushes. Leave some flowers in place so they can form rosehips after they mature., Roses that grow in the wild also form rosehips. Forage for rosehips on rosebushes in the woods. You can also find wild roses growing on the side of the road in some areas. And look for the very large and juicy rosehips from Rosa rugosa or rock roses along coastlines and near water, even along irrigation ditches., Look for rosehips after roses bloom in July. You can find them beginning in August. Continue foraging for them through the winter.

Locate rosebushes when they are in bloom, and plan to return at least four weeks later to begin harvesting your rosehips.

, Harvest rosehips after the first frost of the season passes. Plan to forage them in late fall. You can harvest them earlier, but they will have less juice and be more bitter.Make sure the rosehips are soft to the touch when you harvest them after the frost.
Recognize ripened rosebushes by the fact they are easy to pull off of the bush.

, Don’t wait too long for rosehips to mature, or they will begin to shrivel. Don’t use older, shrivelled rosehips -- they will not process well. Be careful that they aren’t too soft either -- very soft rosehips are also over ripened. Identify these over ripened rosehips by the fact they will fall apart easily when you touch them., Wear gloves to protect your hands from rosebush thorns. Wearing gloves will also make the harvesting go faster. Try leather gloves or gardening gloves for the best protection. Also wear long sleeves.Wear long pants to protect your legs from nettles, thorns, and even poison ivy or poison oak when foraging wild rosehips.

, Harvest rosehips from pulling them directly from the rosebush. Grab entire clumps of ripened rosehips at once. Remember that ripened rosehips will pull away from the stem very easily., Before you use your rosehips, remove the tiny hairs surrounding the seeds. Watch out for those hairs, because they cause itching and can irritate the throat. The best way to remove them is to strain the hairs out while cooking rosehip syrups or jellies."

Select healthy rose plants that have sturdy-looking leaves and stems and don’t show any signs of disease or pests.


Look to see if any of the leaves have black spots, red leaves, or chew marks. These are all signs of disease or infestation.;
, Despite their name, Midnight Blue roses actually prefer sun to shade. They need about 6 hours of direct sunlight a day to be at their best, though they will still survive in very bright shade.Container rose bushes should receive a minimum of 4 hours of direct sunlight a day.

, Roses have an easier time growing in soil that drains easily and does not hold water. Avoid planting them anywhere you’ve seen puddles form.

Midnight Blue roses are not particular about soil type or pH, so there's no need to perform any soil tests., If you’ve purchased a rose bush that isn’t in a container of soil, soak the roots overnight in a bucket of water. This will rehydrate the root system before you plant the bush., The hole needs to be wide enough and deep enough to hold the roots when they're all the way spread out. Aim for a size of about 2 feet (60 cm) wide and 2 feet (60 cm) deep.If you come across weeds or stones as you’re digging, use a garden fork to turn the soil over and remove them. Pull up anything that won't allow the roses’ roots to venture freely.
If planting multiple shrubs, space them at least 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) apart to allow space for growth.

, Roses love soil that is enriched by manure, so incorporate some into the soil where you intend to plant your rose bush. You can purchase well-rotted manure at your local garden store.


Be sure the manure is at least 3-4 years old, since new manure can burn the roots of roses.Try to incorporate roughly a bucket full of manure per square meter of soil.

, The graft union, which is the little swollen area between the roots and the stems, should be at or just below the soil level. If it’s too high, you’ll need to dig the hole deeper. If it’s several inches below the soil line, add more soil and manure below the roots. Then spread the roots out in all different directions and refill the displaced soil.Placing a long stick across the top of the graft union will help you see if it’s level with the soil line before you begin to fill the hole back in.

, Saturate the area around the rose bush to remove any air pockets, settle the soil, and get water to the roots immediately. Stop when you see a puddle of water starting to form at the base of the plant., Organic mulch should be spread over the dirt around a Midnight Blue rose bush to help retain moisture in the soil and keep weeds from growing. Apply a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7 cm) layer, and maintain this level throughout the plant’s life.Use shredded bark mulch that has been properly processed to remove insects and diseases. Pre-packaged mulch that is sold at garden centers is the safest bet. It should state right on the bag that it has been composted or sterilized.

, To water your roses, wait until the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. Then give it a good, long soak to encourage your Midnight Blue rose bush to develop deep water-seeking roots that will help it survive drier periods in the future.In a hot, dry climate where temperatures rise to 80 or 90 °F (27 or 32 °C) or higher, your roses should be given 6 to 8 gallons (22 to 30 L) each week. You may need to water your roses every two or three days.
In a more moderate climate, you will most likely find that you only need to water your rose bush once a week. Three to four gallons (11 to 15 L) should be sufficient.
To prevent fungal growth, water in the morning to allow the leaves adequate time to dry out during the day.

, Foliar feed is a liquid plant food that is sprayed directly onto the leaves. In addition to providing the plant with nutrients, it also helps protect against disease. Begin feeding your Midnight Blue rose bush as soon as it’s established in the spring (about 3-4 weeks after planting, or as soon as you see new growth on an older plant). Feed it a couple more times during the growing season – once after the first blooms form and then a final time around midsummer.Water your rose bush before giving it fertilizer. Do not give fertilizer to a thirsty plant.
Follow the dosage guidelines on the product packaging. Excess doses can damage the plant.You can opt to sprinkle a slow-release granule feed on top of the soil instead. The nutrients will be taken down to the roots the next few times you water the plant., Give container roses a feeding every 2-3 weeks through the spring and summer with a foliar feed or granule feed. Check the top inch of soil for moisture several times a week, and if it feels dry, saturate the soil with water. Ensure good drainage by putting the container up on feet.A layer of gravel at the bottom of the container can also help with drainage.
If the rose outgrows the container it will need to be repotted into a larger one. Look for matted roots at the surface of the soil or roots growing out through the drainage holes.

, Consider hand-pulling the weeds, as this is the gentlest and safest way to remove weeds without damaging your rose bush. You can also put mulch down around your plant to help stop weed growth.Try to avoid hoeing weeds around your roses, as rose roots tend to be close to the soil surface and can be damaged by the hoe.
Avoid chemical weed killers as well, since these can also harm your rose bush.

, Wait until the leaf buds begin to swell, then use a sturdy, sharp blade to ensure a clean cut. Prune by cutting at a 45-degree angle, just above a growth bud. Growth buds are small raised or discolored triangular shaped areas on the rose stem. They are where the new stem will grow.Avoid pruning your new rose for the first two years after you have planted it. Your rose bush will only need to be pruned after it has developed old growth or mature stems.
If you wish to maintain the same size rose bush each year, trim back about ⅓ of the plant. If you want it smaller, trim more, and for a larger plant, trim less., Cut this back until you see a healthy white center to the stem. Your aim is to have a plant where growth is well spaced out to encourage the flow and circulation of air. Remove close growing stems and any that cross or are tangled.On older plants you can cut back any old wood growth that no longer produces any new stems.

, In mild winter climates where shrub roses retain their leaves and bloom throughout most of the year, prune off all of the flowers and strip the leaves off the stems in January. When you do this, the shrub will be forced to take a brief rest and will grow fresh, new foliage and flowers in the spring., One criticism of the Midnight Blue Rose is that the flower heads don’t last very long. To promote the growth of more flowers, remove the spent flower heads regularly during the flowering season. 'Deadheading,’ as this is called, will encourage the plant to produce more flowers rather than put its energies into producing seed heads (also known as hips).Only cut the spent flower heads back to the first leaf in order to preserve as many leaves on the bush as possible.

, Suckers are shoots produced from the plant’s roots. They appear from the ground and often have leaves that look different from the rest of the foliage: they may be paler in color or shaped differently. Trace any suckers back to the roots from which they grow and gently pull these away. If you just remove them at ground level they will regrow., Never leave any trimmed blooms, leaves, or stems on the ground around the bush. The debris can contribute to disease on your plant, so pick up all clippings and throw them away. Do not add them to compost since this could end up back in the soil around your rose bush., Blackspot is a fungal disease that causes leaf loss and stunts plant growth. Left untreated, it can kill a plant. While Midnight Blue rose bushes are typically resistant to blackspot, large amounts of rainfall could still trigger an attack. To treat blackspot, spray the tops and bottoms of all leaves with a fungicidal spray.Remove any leaves or parts of the plant that are infected with blackspot and throw them away.
Pruning to promote air circulation, only watering in the morning, and keeping the area below the plant free of debris are a few ways to keep the leaves dry and free of blackspot.

, A systemic spray will enter the plant’s system and prevent pests from being attracted to your rose bush. Use this once early in the growing season, just as leaves are beginning to form, then reapply every few weeks., Inspect your rose plant regularly for signs of aphids, scales and mealybugs, and spider mites. Aphids are tiny, soft-bodied insects that are commonly green or white and look like miniature moths. Scales and mealy bugs are small, flat or rounded insects that are usually immobile and look like tiny cotton balls.Spider mites are barely visible to the naked eye, but they cause tiny dots or stippling on the leaves and a fine web between the leaves or branches.

, A mild infestation can usually be controlled by simply spraying them off with a strong stream of water from the garden hose in the morning a few times each week. However, if the pests become a serious problem, spray the rose in the early morning with insecticidal soap, being careful to coat the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems.This type of soap is commonly sold in ready-to-use form and comes in a spray bottle at garden or home improvement stores.
Spray the entire shrub and stems until the liquid is dripping from the leaves and running down the stems. Wait about an hour, then wash it off with a stream of water.

Care for your roses.",How to Grow Roses from Seed," The flowers are typically pollinated by insects, or pollinate themselves in some varieties, so there is no need to pollinate by hand unless you are breeding specific plants together. Leave the flowers on the rose plant without cutting them. After they wither, small fruits known as rose hips will develop in their place.



Note: The seeds you harvest may grow into a plant with different characteristics. This can occur if you are harvesting from a hybrid rose variety, or if the rose is pollinated with pollen from a different, nearby rose variety.;
, The rose hips will start out small and green, then change color as they grow until they are completely red, orange, brown, or purple. You may pick them at this point, or wait until they are just beginning to dry out and wrinkle. Don't wait until they are fully dry and brown, as the seeds inside may have died by this point., Cut open the rose hips with a knife, revealing the seeds inside. Pull these out with the knife tip or any other utensil.


The number of seeds in each rose hip varies greatly between rose varieties. There may only be a few per rose hip, or several dozen.

, If the pulp is left on the seeds, it may prevent them from germinating. One quick way to remove the pulp is to place the seeds in a sieve or mesh, running water through it as you rub the seeds against the sides.

, A mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide may reduce the growth of mold on the seeds. Stir 1.5 teaspoons (7 mL) of 3% hydrogen peroxide into 1 cup (240 mL) water.Keep the rose seeds in this solution for at least one hour.


Some studies suggest that a little mold growth can actually help break down the casing surrounding the seed, but this treatment is still recommended to prevent mold growth in larger amounts.
A light dusting of anti-fungal powder for plants is an alternative to this step.

, Rose seeds typically won't sprout unless they are kept in cold, wet conditions, mimicking a winter environment. Place the seeds between two layers of lightly dampened paper towels, or in a container of dampened salt-free river sand, peat moss, or vermiculite.


This is the first step in a process called stratification. If you are using store-bought seeds and the label says they are already stratified, skip to the planting seeds section below., Put the seeds and moist material in a plastic bag or seedling tray in a plastic bag or seedling trays, and keep them in a cold area of a refrigerator, such as an otherwise empty crisper drawer.


Do not keep them in same area of the refrigerator as fruit or vegetables, which can release chemicals that prevent the seeds from developing.
Keep the seed medium slightly damp. Add a few drops of water to each paper towel whenever they begin to dry out.

, Try to do this around the time that the seeds would normally start to germinate, such as in early spring. Make sure that the environment outside of the fridge is about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.The seed will not sprout until you take them out of the fridge. Depending on the rose variety and individual seeds, the seeds could take anywhere from four to sixteen weeks to germinate. Often, 70% or more of the seeds never sprout at all., Small seedling starting trays make it easy to care for many seeds at once. Alternatively, use plastic drinking cups with a hole punched in the bottom, to make root growth easier to view.


Regular soil is not recommended, as it may not drain well enough and cause the seedlings to rot.

, Some store-bought seeds can be planted immediately. If you germinated your own seeds as described above, plant them as soon as they begin to sprout. Plant with the sprout pointed downward, as this is the root. Lightly cover them with soil, about 1/4 inch (6 mm) deep. Space seeds at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart to minimize competition.Sprouted seeds should emerge as seedlings within a week. Store-bought seeds that do not require home stratification may take several weeks.Seeds that have not been stratified, using the germination process above, may take two or three years to emerge.

, Keep the soil damp, but not soggy. A temperature between 60 and 70ºF (16–21ºC) is ideal for most rose varieties.The seedlings typically thrive on six hours of sun or more each day, but you may wish to research the parent rose's variety to get a better idea of what your rose's prefer., The first two leaves visible are usually ""cotyledons,"" or seed leaves. Once the seedling grows several ""true leaves,"" with a more typical rose leaf appearance, it is more likely to survive transplanting. It is also easier on plants if they are transplanted to a larger pot for a year or two, and then transplanted outside.It may be a good idea to transplant the seedlings soon if you notice the plant is root-bound, with its roots encircling the container.
Do not transplant it outside until after the last frost.

, Once the transplanted seedling is looking healthy again, you can start watering it as normal. Fertilizing a few times during the warm growing season may help your plant grow and bloom if you follow the fertilizer instructions, but keep in mind that some varieties of rose will not bloom at all during their first year of life.

Keep the roses cool.",How to Keep Roses Fresh," If you're cutting roses from your own rosebush to display indoors, cut them as early as possible in the morning, before it gets hot outside. Cutting them while it's still cool will keep them from wilting just after cutting. Immediately after cutting the roses, put the stems in a clean bucket of fresh water.


The night before cutting your roses, water the rosebush. Well-hydrated roses will stay fresher longer than roses cut from a bush that hasn't been recently watered.Cut the stems at a 45 degree angle using a clean pair of hand pruners.;
, If you're not cutting your own roses, try to buy them from a well-reputed florist, preferably one with whom you have a relationship. That way you'll be able to get your hands on roses that were very recently cut, rather than roses that may have been sitting there for a week.


Ask the florist which flowers arrived that very morning, and try to select the very freshest roses possible.
Choose roses from the refrigeration unit, since roses that are kept cool last longer than those that have been sitting out at room temperature.

, This is a sure way to tell whether roses are still fresh. When you're examining roses before making your purchase, gently squeeze them at their base, where the petals come together at the stem. If it feels loose and squishy, the roses are old, and you should avoid them. If it feels firm and taut, the roses are fresh.

, Look for roses with well-formed, colorful petals. Examine the tips of the petals to make sure they aren't bruised or brown. When you bring the roses home, you can remove a few outer petals that have been damaged, but there's not much you can do to improve the appearance of damaged tips on the inner petals. Intact petals are more attractive and will stay fresh longer than bruised ones.








, If the roses are out of water even for a few minutes, they'll suffer for it, and they won't stay fresh as long. When you go to the flower shop, you might want to bring along a bucket filled with a few inches of water so you'll have a place to keep the roses watered when you take them home. If you don't have a bucket, ask the florist to package them with water.








, Trimming the stems underwater helps to keep them fresh by preventing air from entering the bottom of the stems. When air gets in, it immediately starts to cause flowers to deteriorate, the same way it turns apples and avocados brown and mushy. You can trim the stems under running water or submerge them in water to do the trimming.







, A sharp knife or a pair of sharp hand pruners are the best tools to use to cut rose stems. Using a standard pair of scissors squeezes the stems, which can prevent them from taking in water as effectively and cause them to die more quickly. Cut off 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) of length from the bottom of the stems, or more if you're arranging them in a short vase.









Cut the stems at a 45 degree angle, which enables them to take in water more easily.
Make sure the cutting tool you use is extremely clean. Hand pruners should be cleaned with hot, soapy water or a mild bleach solution after every use, since bacteria can remain on the pruners and affect the next flowers you cut.

, The portion of the stems that will be submerged in water should be completely free of leaves. This is because leaves left underwater will start to rot, causing bacteria to accumulate in the vase and making the flowers die a lot more quickly. You can leave a few leaves attached toward the top of the stems, but remove anything that would be underwater in the vase.








, Trimming the stems every couple of days will help the roses take in water more effectively, since after awhile the tips of the stems will become a little mushy and damaged. Use the same technique you used to trim them in the first place, making sure your tools are clean and cutting underwater at a 45 degree angle.








, If you simply rinse your vases between uses, bacteria can live inside the vases and damage your fresh roses. Clean the vase you plan to use with hot, soapy water, making sure to scrub the inside with a bottle brush. Rinse it thoroughly before proceeding.

, Roses take in a lot of water after they're cut. Fill the vase 3/4 full with fresh, cool water from the tap, then arrange the flowers in the vase so that the stems are within an inch of the bottom of the vase. This way they'll be able the reach the water they need to stay fresh.









Consider adding some flower food to the water. Commercial flower food will provide nutrients the roses need to stay fresh for a longer period of time. Ask for a few packets of flower food when you buy roses at the flower shop.
Add 1/4 teaspoon of bleach per quart of water. This keeps the bacteria level low. Just be sure not to add too much bleach to the water, or the roses will be damaged.Adding a penny or an aspirin tablet to the water is also said to help control the bacteria levels.

, Every two days or so, change the water to ensure that bacterial growth doesn't damage your flowers. Fill the vase with fresh water, more flower food and the right amount of bleach. Trim the stems of your roses and arrange them in the vase once more.








, Roses will stay fresh for many days if you keep them in a cool spot in the house. Avoid placing them near sunny windows or in rooms that tend to be on the warmer side. You can even store your roses in the refrigerator overnight to keep them cool while you sleep, then set them back out on the table during the day.

Standard food coloring will also work, but you will get better results with a professional florist’s dye.
The flower preservative will make your roses last longer, but isn’t necessary to the dyeing process.;
, Either use a de-thorner or a sharp gardening knife (a kitchen knife will also work) to remove the thorns. You can also cut the thorns away using scissors. Avoid scarring the stem unnecessarily.Set the roses aside in an empty vase.


You do not have to remove the thorns for this technique to work, it is more for your general safety.
You can wear gardening gloves to protect your hands if you’d like.

, Combine the powdered dye and warm water according to the directions on the packaging.Adding more powder will intensify the color and bring extra richness to the final product.


Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure all of the powdered dye is dissolved.

, Using the scissors, trim the ends of the stems at an angle. Let them soak in the dye for 30-60 minutes. As time passes, the uptake of dye will progress and begin to saturate the petals, infusing them with a blue hue that intensifies over time. Leave them in longer for a darker color.If you don’t see any color change, remove the stems and let them dry out a bit. They will absorb more water if they are “thirsty”.
You might also need to add more powdered dye to the solution.

, The fresh cuts will remove the healing tissue created to seal off the wounds, allowing quicker, more complete uptake of the dye. Again, trim the ends at an angle.


To avoid making a mess, wipe the stems off with a paper towel before cutting them.
Return the stems to the dye solution to continue the absorption process.

, Within half a day, the blue dye should have spread, evenly coloring the rose petals. At this point, throw out the dye solution and replace it with clear water.Rinse the dye off the bottoms of the stems before placing them into the fresh water.
You may want to add a flower preservative to the water for longer-lasting blooms.
Use your blue flowers to make a nice floral arrangement.

Water your roses.,
Add mulch around the base of your roses.,
Feed your rose.,
Cut away any diseased or dying leaves.,
Prune your roses in the winter months.,
Deadhead your rose’s old blooms.,
Consider your environment when pruning your roses.",How to Care for a Lenton Rose1," During the first season after planting Lenton roses, they should be watered once or twice each week. From the second season on, they can be watered much less often. These are highly drought-tolerant plants after they become established.


If the weather is particularly dry, though, they will look better with a good, deep watering once every week or two.;
, Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of bark mulch on the soil around the Lenton Rose to help retain moisture. Sprinkle slow-release 10-10-10 fertilizer around the plants when new buds form in mid-winter.


A 6- or 9-month slow-release fertilizer should give the Lenton rose all the nutrients it needs.

, Provide a light fertilizer if the area struggles with growth. Lenton roses do not need large amounts of fertilizers and will do fine with plain rainfall if required.


If the plant is struggling, mix your rose fertilizer at half strength and feed once a season.
Rose specific fertilizers are available at most stores

, During the summer months, trim back any diseased or dying leaves by cutting the stem as close to the ground as you can. You can also remove small plants that have formed under the base of the plant.These small plants are new healthy Lenton roses and can either be composted or transplanted further away from the parent plant.

, Prune the old leaves off of Lenton roses in the winter when the new buds begin to emerge. Use sharp bypass pruners and snip the leaves right off at the base of the plant. This will improve the plant’s appearance, will help make room for new leaves and will reduce the possibility of bacterial and fungal disease.


Throw the leaves in the trash. Do not leave old leaves and debris on the soil around Lenton roses.

, Trim the flowers off at the base of the stems as they begin to fade. If they are left on the plant, they will go to seed and produce new Lenton roses all around the parent plant.


Prune off the newer leaves at any time during the growing season if they begin to look ragged.

, In mild climates you may prune the Lenton Rose completely to the ground to give a unique look to the new blooms. In harsher areas, you’ll need to leave some of the leaves surrounding the plant to protect it against harsh winds.


If you prefer to leave the evergreen leaves, even in mild winters, this will cause no harm to the plant.

Obtain a cut purple rose from a florist.,
Trim the stem for freshness.,
Make a cutting from an existing purple rose bush.,
Encourage the cut rose to take root.,
Keep the cutting moist and away from direct sun.,
Plant more cuttings than you need.",How to Breed Purple Roses1," If you want to grow purple roses, the easiest way is to get a ‘parent’ purple rose and use it to make more purple rose plants. The first step is to find a florist who can provide you with a fresh purple rose. Then, if you are very lucky, you may be able to get this rose to take root and grow into a viable plant.;
, It’s best to plant a cut rose when the rose is freshly picked. As the cut rose you obtained from the florist's may not be freshly picked, it’s best to trim off the last inch and a half of stem. This freshens the cut surface of the rose.


Always make the cut at a 45 degree angle, using a clean sharp blade such as garden secateurs (pruning shears).

, Alternatively, if you know someone who grows purple roses, you can request to make a cutting from their plant in order to grow your own purple rose bush.


To cut from an existing plant, take about 8 inches (20.3 cm) of healthy green growth in the late summer or fall, cutting at a 45 degree angle.

, Once you have obtained your freshly cut rose, remove the leaves and dip the end of the stem into a rooting compound. Insert 2/3 of the stem into a cutting compost mix (or regular compost mixed with grit).

, Under the right conditions, the cutting will take about a year to develop enough root growth for replanting elsewhere.

, Not all cuttings will ‘take’ (i.e. develop roots) so always plant more cuttings than you need. Gardeners can usually count on between a third and a half of all cuttings developing into viable plants.

"
"
Purchase some white roses.,
Cut the stem under water at an angle with shears or a sharp knife.,
Place the rose in a vase filled with plain water.,
Prepare your dye bath.,
Set the rose into the water, then wait for it to change color.,
Place the rose into a vase filled with fresh water.",How to Dye Roses1," Dye will show up the best on white roses. If you use colored roses, the dye will add to whatever color is already there. For example, if you try to dye a yellow rose blue, you will get green.;
, Hold the stem under water as you cut it down to 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 centimeters). Cutting the stem at an angle will prevent it from sitting flat against the bottom of the cup. Cutting it under water will prevent air bubbles from forming. Both of these will help the rose absorb the dye better.Take this time to trim off any thorns and leaves as well.
Cut the stems shorter if you want the roses to soak up the dye faster. This will also help the roses turn out brighter., Leave the rose in the water as you prepare the dye bath. If you want to make a bouquet, you can cut more roses. Work one rose at a time, and place it into the vase as you finish cutting it., Fill a cup with ½ cup (120 milliliters) of warm water. Stir in 20 to 30 drops of food coloring or liquid watercolor.If you want something more subtle, use 5 to 10 drops and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water instead., This will take at least 4 hours, so be patient! The longer you wait, the deeper the color will become. After 4 hours or so, the rose will take on a pastel color. If you want it to be a deeper color, you will have to wait 1 to 2 days. Keep in mind that the roses will be streaky and speckled.Rose petals will have small veins. They will look darker after you finish dyeing the rose. If this bothers you, leave the rose in the dye longer.For an interesting effect, dye the rose in one color for about 3 hours, then put it in a different color for 2 hours, then a third color for 1 hour., Once the rose is the color you want it to be, take the rose out of the dye, and place it into a vase filled with fresh water. If you want to help the rose last longer, add some floral preservative into the water.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Remove the thorns from the roses.,
Pour the dye into the bucket.,
Dip the whole flower into the dye for 2 seconds.,
Rinse with water to remove excess dye.,
Repeat dip-dye to darken the color, if desired.,
Let flowers dry fully before arranging.",How to Create Blue Roses2," To create blue roses through the dip-dyeing method, you will need some blue floral dip-dye, a bowl or bucket, white roses, water, and scissors. The dip-dye can be purchased at your local florist or online.The bowl or bucket needs to be deep enough for the flower blossom to be completely immersed in the dye.
The process can be messy so you might want to wear plastic gloves as well to protect your hands from staining.

, Before beginning, it is recommended that you remove the thorns from the stems. It is not necessary, but it will make it easier to handle the roses and arrange them later. You can use a thorn stripping tool, a knife, or even scissors to get rid of the thorns.Use caution as the thorns are very sharp and can cut you.

, Pour enough dye into the container so that you can easily immerse the flower blossom wholly into the dye. The dye should already be in liquid form, you just need to pour it directly into the container.


The dye will stain your clothes, so wear something old that you don’t mind getting dirty. Cover your workspace with old newspaper or plastic bags.If you want a lighter color, you can dilute the dye with water before you begin.

, Hold the end of the rose by the stem and dip the blossom into the dye.Completely submerge the blossom in the dye for about two seconds. This is plenty of time to get a nice even coat.


Shake excess dye off the flower back into the container. The dye is reusable.

, Gently rinse the rose blossom thoroughly with water. Rinse until the water runs clear. Shake the rose over the drain to get them as dry as possible.Allow flowers to dry completely before doing anything else with them.
Flowers with wet dye can stain your hands and clothes.

, Once the flower has completely dried, you can add another coat of dye if you’d like a darker coloring to your petals. Repeat the same process: submerge the rose in the dye for two seconds, gently rinse with water, and let flower dry.Remember the dye is reusable so you can dye as many flowers as you’d like in the same dye.

, When wet, the dye can stain your fingers and clothes. Once the dye has dried, the flowers can be handled and put together in beautiful floral arrangements. It will take at least an hour for blossoms to fully dry. Impress your friends and family with your wonderful hand-dyed blue roses.


This same process can be used to make the roses any color you’d like as long as you have the right color dye for it.

"
Gather the necessary materials.,
Setup a proper workspace.,
Trim the thorns from the roses.,
Spray the flower, rotating as you go.,
Add another coat to darken the color, if desired.",How to Create Blue Roses3," To spray paint the roses blue, you will need blue floral spray paint, fresh white roses, a drop cloth, and a well-ventilated workspace. Spray paint can get messy so you will want to wear clothes that you don’t mind getting paint on.Floral spray paint should be available at craft stores, your local florist, or online.
Regular spray paint is not recommended for this as it will kill the rose quickly.

, To protect your work area from getting painted as well, you will want to cover everything with newspaper or painting cloths. Your workspace must also be well-ventilated to protect you from the fumes of the paint.For best results, do this on a moderate temperature (70°F) day with low humidity.
Working in the garage with the door open or even outside on a nice day would be the best place to do this.

, It is recommended to remove the thorns from the roses before beginning to avoid injury. Although not necessary to the dyeing process, the thorns can be very sharp and make the roses difficult to handle especially when arranging them at the end.Take care not to damage the actual stem of the rose when removing the thorns.
Thorns can be cut away using scissors, a knife, or a de-thorning tool.

, Shake the can well before starting to spray. Hold the can about 15–18 inches (38–46 cm) away from the flower and make sure the nozzle is pointing towards the flower blossom. Spray the blossom while rotating it to evenly coat.Make sure you get the insides of the petals as well as the outside.
Set the flower aside and let it dry completely.

, Once the paint has dried completely, you can paint them again until you get the color to the darkness that you’re looking for. Paint should take about an hour to dry. For best results, make sure you let the paint dry between coats.Let all flowers dry completely before arranging them.

Consider your environment.,
Select a site that gets moderate amounts of sun.,
Test the pH of your soil.,
Add lime to the soil to make it more alkaline if the pH is too low.,
Add organic matter to your soil.,
Dig a hole for your rose.",How to Care for a Lenton Rose2," How to care for your plant will depend on what climate you live in and how you wish the plant to look. Roses in zones 4 and 5 (where temperatures dip to -30 degrees F and -34.4 degrees C) may need protection during the winter. Consider planting your roses near covered areas and bushes.


Roses in the hotter zones will need shade to protect them from wilting in the summer heat.

, Plant your rose in a sheltered area with moderate sun. Since Lenton roses prefer alkaline soiland areas near trees and large plants, look for a spot where shrubs and bushes grow naturally. Such spots may be near a large tree, in the corner of the garden, or near a pond.

, Alkaline soil with a pH of 7.6 to 8.5 is ideal for Lenton roses. Buy a soil pH test kit at your local garden center and test the pH of your soil. Be sure to use soil that you dig up from 4 inches (10.2 cm) below the surface to get a good sample. Wear gloves while collecting your soil. Touching the sample with your hands could influence the pH. Break up the soil and allow it to dry.


Put the dried soil into a clean container. Put distilled water and the chemical that comes in the test kit into the container with the soil. Shake up the container then and then let the soil settle. Check the color of the water in the container against the chart that comes with the kit to determine what the pH of your soil is.

, The amount of lime necessary depends on the texture of the soil and how much the pH needs to be changed. If the soil is sandy, 1 ¼ pounds of lime will be required to change the pH of 25 square feet of soil from 6.8 to 7.8. Heavy clay soil will require 2 ¾ pounds of lime to make the same change.


Work the lime into the soil to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm) if the Lenton rose has not already been planted. If it is already growing in the garden, gently work the lime into the top few inches of soil around the plant.

, Lenton roses grow best in organically rich, fertile soil that drains quickly. If the Lenton rose has not yet been planted, work a 3- to 6-inch depth of organic matter like well-aged cow manure, compost, sphagnum peat moss or leaf mold into the soil. Work it in thoroughly to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).


If the Lenton rose has already been planted, gently work the organic matter into the top 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of soil around the rose. Be careful not to damage its roots. The organic matter will improve the texture, fertility and drainage capabilities of the soil.

, Dig a hole twice the size of the plant. Place a layer of peat moss in the hole and then place the roots directly above the moss. The plant have at least three inches of topsoil over its roots to help it survive during the winter months.


Leave the stem clear when returning the soil to the hole. This will encourage growth while discouraging diseases from affecting your rose.

Understand that growing purple roses from seed can be tricky.,
Allow your existing rose bush to develop hips.,
Prepare the seeds for planting.,
Plant the purple rose seeds in moist compost.",How to Breed Purple Roses2," Although it is possible to grow purple roses from seed, it is a slow way to get new rose plants. In addition, garden roses aren't always fertile, even if they grow hips.


It’s also possible to get very disappointing results when growing from seed, as the child may not match the parent (that means that the new plant may not grow purple flowers, even if the parent plant did).
Although this isn't the surest or the fastest route to take, here’s some advice if you want to try growing purple roses from seed:

, After the growing season, avoid deadheading your purple rose plant and allow the plant to develop rose hips. From the point when the hips emerge, wait about 4 months before harvesting them. At this stage, the seeds should be ripe for planting

, Use a knife to cut the hips in half, then pick out the seeds – tweezers are pretty useful for this fiddly task.


Rinse the seeds in a cup of water to which a dash of bleach has been added, then soak the seeds overnight in a solution of 3% peroxide.
Finally, use a brush to agitate the seeds and remove any remaining hip pulp which may cause them to rot later.

, Once the seeds are ready, scatter them over moist compost, cover with a clear plastic bag, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 weeks.


Remember to sow far more seeds than you need in case the resultant plants are a disappointment, or fail to grow.

"
Gather the necessary materials.,
Prepare the rose cutting.,
Insert the cutting into the potato.,
Care for the cutting until roots develop.,
Don’t allow the soil to dry out.",How to Breed Purple Roses3," Although it seems unlikely, you can grow new roses out of potatoes. All you need is a potato, some rooting compound, a small pot of cutting compost and a fresh cutting from a purple rose plant.

, Use a nice clean blade to snip about 8 inches (20.3 cm) off a green rose shoot. Cut off any dead leaves or flowers.

, Dip the end of the cutting into rooting compound, then insert into the potato.


You may need to make a hole in the potato first to avoid snapping or straining the rose stem as you drive it into the potato.






Bury the potato into the pot of cutting compost, allowing the stem to emerges.







, Keep the pot in a light place, away from direct sunlight until roots and fresh growth start to develop.


Cover the plant with a transparent cloche or cut the top off a clear plastic soda bottle and invert that over the plant to make a mini greenhouse.

, Water the cutting just enough to keep the soil moist. It will take about a year to develop enough root growth for replanting elsewhere.

Understand that cross-breeding roses is a difficult task.,
Cross-pollinate two ""parent"" plants.,
Attempt to cross-pollinate the roses in late spring.,
Learn how the cross-pollination process works.,
Wait for hips to develop, then plant the seeds.",How to Breed Purple Roses4," Trying to cross-breed rose bushes to obtain a new variety is not for the faint-hearted. This may be something best left to commercial nurseries that have huge resources at their disposal as it can take many thousands of attempts over many years to obtain a new variety.

, If you want to try creating a new variety of purple roses, you will need to cross-pollinate two ‘parent’ plants. This means taking the pollen from one rose plant and applying it to the stigma of another plant in the hope the two plants will breed together to create an offspring (‘hybrid’) with some of the preferred characteristics of the parents.

, Late spring is the time to cross-pollinate roses. It should be done on a day when rain is not expected. Select two plants you want to try crossing.

, Remove the petals from a bloom on the plant you have chosen to bear the seed of the new hybrid. Remove the anthers from the plant to prevent it from self-pollinating.


Using a paintbrush, remove pollen from one parent and apply to the stigma of the other.
It's a good idea to label the flower you have just pollinated with details of which plant it is crossed with and the date, for your future reference.

, Wait for hips to develop on your cross-pollinated rose bush. After four months harvest the seeds and plant them, using the method in Method 2 above. If you are lucky, these seeds will develop into purple roses.

Fill 2 to 4 cups with warm water.,
Stir your desired dyes into the cups.,
Place the split rose stem into the cups.,
Wait for the rose to change colors.,
Transfer the rose to a vase filled with fresh water.",How to Dye Roses2," Dye only adds to what color is already there; it does not replace color. If you want the dye to come out true to its color, you should use white roses.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the stem down until they are 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 centimeters) long. Make sure that the bottom is cut at a slight angle. Take this time to trim off any leaves, thorns, and buds as well., Set the rose down on a cutting board or cutting mat. Use a sharp craft blade to cut the stem in half lengthwise. Stop when you are halfway up the stem.If you are using shorter glasses, you can split the stems only 3 inches (7.6 centimeters).If your rose had a very thick stem to begin with, you can cut the stem into three or four sections instead.If you snap the stem by mistake, cut the entire stem down to 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.2 centimeters), and dye it a single color., At this point, you can cut and split more roses, or move onto the next step., You will need ½ cup (120 milliliters) of warm water. How many cups you use depends on how many sections you cut your rose stem into. You will need one cup per section. Use cups that have straight walls.Roses drink up warm water more quickly than cool water.

, You will need 20 to 30 drops of food coloring for each cup. If you can't find food coloring, you can use liquid watercolor instead. Use a different color for each cup., Move the cups close together first, so that the rims are touching. Carefully spread apart the split rose stem. Place each section into a separate cup. Make sure that the stem is submerged in the dye as far as it will go., The longer you let the rose sit in the dye, the deeper the color will become. If you want a pastel color, wait at least 4 hours. If you are a deeper color, wait several days.These roses won't end up with each petal a different color. They will be dyed in sections, like a pie chart.Rose petals have veins in them, which will look darker. If you want them to be less visible, leave the rose in the water for twice the recommended time., If you want to, you can trim down the split end until the stem is whole again. To help you rose last even longer, still some floral preservative into the water first. Keep in mind, however, that some of the dye may leak back into the water and make it change color.

Choose a white rose.,
Trim the stem, leaves, and thorns.,
Prepare the dye bath in a bucket.,
Dip the rose into the dye for 2 to 3 seconds.,
Lift the rose out.,
Rinse the rose under clear water.,
Set the rose into a vase so that it can dry.,
Use the rose(s) in your floral arrangement.",How to Dye Roses3," Dye only adds to the color that is already there. If you use a colored rose, the dye may end up a different color, or it may not show up at all. For best results, use a rose that is fully open.This method is suitable for both fresh and dried roses., Use a sharp knife to cut the base of the stem off as an angle. Next, trim off any leaves, thorns, and buds. Place the rose into a vase filled with clear water while you prepare the dye in the next step.

Hold the stem under water while you cut it. This will help prevent air bubbles, which can clog up the stem and prevent the rose from drinking.

, How you prepare the dye depends on the type of dye you are using. Ink, food coloring, and fabric dye are all suitable options. If you can find floral dye, such as Dip It, you will get even better results. Choose your preferred dye, then prepare it in one of the following ways:Mix ink or food coloring into 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Stir in 1 tablespoon (13 grams) of alum.
Mix fabric dye in 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Use enough dye to get the color you want.
Prepare floral dye according to the instructions on the package.

, Hold the rose upside-down by the stem, then dip the flower part into the dye. Swirl it around so that every petal gets coated. You only need to leave it in the dye for about 2 to 3 seconds.This method is different from the typical dyeing methods. You are only dipping the flower part into the dye, not the stem

, Hold it upside down over the bucket so that the excess dye can drip back. Give the rose a gentle shake, if you need to, but be careful not to get droplets of dye on anything that might get stained., Give it another shake to get rid of any extra water. If the color came out too dark, rinse it under water a little longer. Keep in mind that the color will lighten as the rose dries., If the rose didn't turn out dark it enough, let it dry completely first, then repeat the dyeing process.While the rose dries, you can dye more roses, if you need to. Don't get impatient, however; if you use the rose while the dye is still wet, you will risk staining your skin, clothing, and other items in your arrangement.

If you dyed a fresh rose, make sure that you fill the vase with water so that it doesn't wilt. Dried roses do not need water, however.

, If you are using fresh roses, be sure to add a packet of floral preservative into the water. This will help the roses last longer. Because you only dyed the flower part, you do not have to worry about the dye leaching back into the water. This means that you can use a clear vase without worrying about the water changing color."

Study which types of orchids do well outdoors in your climate.,
Make sure freezing temperatures and frost are done for the season before moving your plants outdoors.

,
Situate orchids in an area with just slightly more light than the orchids got indoors.,
Water outdoors orchids more frequently than indoor plants because the orchids will be open to air and sunlight, which dry orchids and potting medium faster.

Take precautions after potting.",How to Grow Cymbidium Orchids," In the Northern Hemisphere, cymbidium orchids typically grow ""flower spikes"" starting in February, bloom for three to eight weeks, then lose the last of the flower stem in August.In the Southern Hemisphere, this period lasts from August through January instead.;
, Orchids thrive on many hours of sunlight a day, but can burn if exposed to direct afternoon sun. An east- or south-facing window is a good choice in the Northern Hemisphere, or an east- or north-facing window in the Southern Hemisphere. If at least four hours of sunlight is not regularly available, consider using full spectrum grow lights to encourage growth.


Healthy leaves are light green or yellow-green. If they are bright yellow or spotted, the plant receives too much sun. If the leaves are dark green, it receives too little sun., Keep the plant in temperate conditions, but expose it to night temperatures cooler by at least 10ºF (or by 5.5ºC) if possible. In ideal conditions, the budding plant should experience night temperatures of 40–55ºF (4–10ºC) and day temperatures of 65–75ºF (18–24ºC).Once the plant has bloomed, it can withstand significant summer heat, but should be kept above 35ºF (1.7ºC) at all times.Some cymbidium orchids are hardier than others. While some sources claim a USDA hardiness zone range as wide as 5–10, most cymbidium orchids will be much easier to grow in zones 9 and 10, where winter temperatures are mild enough to keep the plant outdoors at night.

, Keep the soil moist, but not soggy, by watering about once a week for most of the flowering period. During summer weather, watering once every 3–5 days may be required.Each watering session, pour water until it runs through the flowerpot. If the water does not drain through immediately, you may need to repot your orchid plant to prevent rot.


Rainwater or reverse osmosis water are great options, especially if your tap water is hard. However, do not use water ""softened"" by other processes, as it may contain salts that can damage the plant.Water early in the day if possible, so the water on the leaves evaporates before nightfall. Water left on the plant during cool night temperatures may increase the chance of infection., Although you may use an ordinary balanced fertilizer, more nitrogen may encourage the plant to produce bigger, longer-lasting flowers. Dilute a high-nitrogen fertilizer, such as a 22-14-14 or a 30-10-10 mix, to 50% strength with water. Apply according to the fertilizer's instructions once every 10–14 days, or use a slow-release fertilizer that only needs to be applied once or twice during the season., Once the stems supporting the flower spikes grow to a few inches (several centimeters) long, loosely tie each one to a small stake to prevent breakage and guide the buds upward. You may use twine, twist-ties, or gardening clips, and any type of stake or skewer.Do not reuse stakes from other plants, as this may transfer infections.

, Cymbidium flowers often fall in spring, but they can last into the summer. Once all the flowers are gone, and the stem is completely brown, cut the stem off at the base. For the rest of the growing season, the plant should focus on growing its leaves.


Once cooler autumn weather begins, continue on to the section on dormant season care.

, This section covers cymbidium care during the season when no flower stem is visible. This typically lasts from August through January in the Northern Hemisphere, or from January through July in the Southern Hemisphere.

, While cool night temperatures are recommended for orchids year round, they are vital during the autumn, when the plant is developing new flower spikes internally. Cold night temperature triggers this development. Around 45–55ºF (7.2–12.8ºC) is ideal, but at this stage the plant can withstand a few hours of exposure to temperatures as low as 30ºF (-1.1ºC).Daytime temperatures may be somewhat warmer, but hot temperatures could disrupt its development.

, In the autumn, move the plant to a location where it will receive less sunlight, but not to complete shade. This will also help the plant develop flower spikes for next year's blooms. Try a north-facing window in the Northern Hemisphere, or a south-facing window in the Southern.

, During this period, the plant is not visibly growing, and does not need as much water. To prevent root rot, which is a common problem for orchids, only water just enough to stop the soil drying out, or even let the soil barely dry out between watering sessions., While some gardeners use a balanced fertilizer all year round, many find that their orchids respond better to different fertilizers at different times. During the dormant season, try using a low-nitrogen fertilizer such as a 0-10-10 or 6-6-30 mix, which will encourage the development of roots and flowers in preparation for a strong growing season. Dilute the fertilizer to 50% strength and apply according to the packaging instructions, no more than once a month., Orchids prefer a crowded pot, so you do not need to transplant an orchid just because it has expanded to fit its pot. However, if the orchid is sending shoots dangling over the edge of the pot, it may be time to repot.If water pools at the surface rather than running quickly through the pot, the potting mix may have deteriorated and needs replacement.Repotting is usually only necessary once every two or three years.

, Orchids thrive in small containers, with the edge of the container about two to three inches (5.0–7.5 cm) from the roots of the orchid.For young, small orchid plants, use a pot with only one inch (2.5 cm) of space.


If you plan to divide the orchid plant, as described below, you will need two or more smaller pots, one for each piece.
Terra cotta pots are preferable to plastic pots, because their more porous material reduces the risk of water pooling around the orchid's roots., If you plan to keep your new flowerpot on a saucer, a one inch (2.5 cm) layer of gravel at the base of the pot is recommended. This will prevent excess water from pooling around the roots of the orchid and causing rot.This may also help prevent sand or other components of the potting mix from working its way out of the drainage hole.

, You may purchase cymbidium orchid potting mix from a specialized flower nursery, or mix your own. A fast-draining mix such as 40% orchid bark, 40% coarse peat moss, and 20% river sand is recommended.Medium orchid bark is best suited for smaller cymbidium orchids, while coarse orchid bark is preferable for plants in pots larger than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.Many gardeners have their own preferred mixes, and you may wish to ask a local expert for advice. In a humid area, sand may not be necessary to retain moisture.

, As they grow, orchids produce additional bulb-like organs at the base of the plant, called pseudobulbs.If these have formed a large cluster, you may split your orchid into pieces and plant them separately. Each piece should include plenty of roots and at least four hard bulbs with leaves attached. If leafless bulbs called ""backbulbs"" are present, do not remove them, as they store extra energy for the plant.You may be able to divide small orchids by hand, but mature cymbidium orchids typically require cutting with a knife.


In order to reduce the risk of infection, sterilize your knife or shears before dividing the orchid, wear disposable gloves, and work on a layer of clean newspaper. Change gloves and newspaper, and clean the knife again, before handling another plant.You may plant smaller pieces as well, but these may take two or three years to bloom for the first time.

, Use a long sterilized knife if necessary to separate rootbound orchid plants from the edge of the old pot. It often takes a considerable amount of force to pull out an orchid, since they grow tight against the container's walls. Once the plant is loose, transfer it gently to the new pot.


If you are planting a divided piece of an orchid plant, carefully spread out the roots so they are evenly spread throughout the pot, but avoid breaking them.

, Add the prepared potting mix to the pot until the lower 1/3 of the bulbs are covered. Pressing the mix down around the roots will provide more support for the roots, but is not recommended if your mix includes peat moss., Keep the newly potted plant in a shadier area for the next few days, while it adjusts to the new pot. Water the plant as usual. If growing divided orchids, keep them slightly drier and cooler than usual for a few weeks, to encourage the growth of new roots."

Pot your orchid.,
Know when to re-pot your orchids.",How to Grow Orchids1," Some orchids are easier to grow than others. Cattleya, Phalaenopsis and Paphiopedilum orchids are amongst the easiest to grow and are recommended for most beginner gardeners and orchid growers. There are, however, believed to be over 20,000 species of orchid species — that's 2 times the amount of existing bird species and 4 times the amount of existing mammalian species. There's almost literally an orchid for any type of person.


Perhaps the most common genera of orchids found for sale include Phalaenopsis, Dendrobium and Oncidium. Phalaenopsis is known as the ""moth orchid"" and is extremely popular among beginning growers; the genus Dendrobium contains about 1,200 species of orchids and is the classic epiphyte of orchids; Oncidiums are characterized by column wings and a callus at the lip of the flower.
Different genera of orchids have different ideal humidities, growing temperatures, watering schedules, and light requirements. Talk with your local nursery or visit the local chapter of your orchid society to find out what makes your genus of orchid grow best.;
, Some first-time orchid growers make the mistake of assuming that orchids need to be potted in soil like other blooming flowers, choosing potting soil as a conduit. That would be a grave mistake. Most orchid roots need far more air than potting soil would give them, and so benefit from a looser, more porous mix.Many people use bark chips, sphagnum moss, coconut husks, charcoal, perlite, and even styrofoam pellets as potting mix, often in combination. Experiment with porous, breathable mixes that you have on hand, or ask an expert for his or her special recipe.

, For simplicity's sake, you can make two basic kinds of potting mixes that will work for most kinds of orchids.


Make a fine potting mix, suitable for slipper orchids, most oncidiums, miltonias, and orchids with small roots that enjoy moisture more than most:
4 parts fine (grain) fir bark or fine (grain) coco husk
1 part fine (grain) charcoal
1 part perlite


Make a medium potting mix, suitable for cattleyas, phalaenopsis, and other mature orchids. If you're unsure of which mix to use, try the medium-grade potting mix before the fine-grade mix:
4 parts medium (grain) fir bark or medium (grain) coco husk
1 part medium (grain) charcoal
1 part perlite



, Many orchids are comfortable being root-bound. Choose a smaller pot to place your orchid in, making sure that there are plenty of holes in the pot itself for drainage. Remember, the enemy of orchids is often over-watering. Some orchids, such as cymbidiums, will require longer pots to accommodate very long root systems. The following types of pots offer a break from the traditional clay pot (which is perfectly acceptable):


Net pots, which have wire mesh and allow for a breathable environment. These can be hung in advantageous locations for better sunlight.
Clear plastic pots, which get better sunlight to the roots. These allow the grower to inspect the root systems without disturbing the orchid.
Wooden pots, which are constructed of rot-resistant wood. Line any wooden pots with sheet moss before adding your potting mixture.

, Make sure your hands and your environment are sterile. Scatter just a few seeds immediately beneath the surface of each pot. Add environmentally-friendly fertilizer, if necessary. Again, use the best soil available.

, Remove the orchid from its original pot, making sure to cut off any dead or rotting roots. Divide the root matter into several different sections, if needed, before placing the plant in its pot.The most mature section of growth should be positioned against the wall of the pot. Lightly add the potting mix, barely covering the root system.

, Different orchids benefit from being re-potted accordingly:


Yearly: Dendrobium, Miltonia, Paphiopedilum and Phalaenopsis (and hybrids)
Bi-annually: Cattleya, Dendrobium, Oncidium, Odontoglossum (and hybrids)
Once every three years: Vanda, Cymbidium

Go to a garden center to choose an orchid plant.,
Choose an orchid plant that will do well in your home environment, looks healthy, and doesn't show any sign of disease or spider mites.",How to Choose an Orchid Plant,"


Consider how much natural light the orchid will have. You can keep it close to a window or further away.
Note the usual temperature of the area where you want to keep the orchid. Though your living room is probably quite warm, your screened-in porch might be much colder.
Examine the humidity of the room. The bathroom is probably the most humid spot in your home.;
, If it requires a more humid environment than your home, you will need to make time to provide additional water by means of misting.

,


A Dendrobium orchid needs lots of bright light and yield plenty of pretty flowers.
Miltonia orchids flourish in environments with medium light.
The more compact Paph orchid plant functions well on just a little light.
Bright areas provide good environments for oncidium orchids.
Consider an odontoglossum orchid for a cold place with bright light.
Both Vanda and Brassia orchid plants function well in sunny, humid conditions.
A Phalaenopsis orchid doesn't need much light and yields a lot of flowers.

, They come in a wide variety of prices, from as little as a couple of dollars to as much as over $500. If you're a first-time orchid owner, it's better not to spend too much on an orchid plant until you're used to caring for one.

, Though you can buy orchids at the supermarket, the staff there is unlikely to know very much about orchid care, whereas a garden center's staff will know at least the basics.

, You can tell if it has a viral infection by checking for yellow or brown spots on the leaves. Spider mites leave a silky white web on the plant.

Consider the variety of rose sizes out there.,
Take some measurements.,
Select a rose bush variety that will not outgrow its space.,
Make sure there will be at least 6 to 8 inches of space all the way around the rose bush after it reaches its mature width.",How to Buy Rose Bushes1," Rose bushes come in mini, small, medium and large sizes. They can be shrubs or climbers and some can even be trained to grow either way.


Take a close look at the space the rose bush will occupy to determine what size bush to buy.;
, Measure the space between the plants that will be on either side or, if the rose will be next to a building, measure the area from the building to the edge of the garden or next plant.

, If the area measures only 2 feet wide by 2 feet deep, buy a miniature rose like “Live Wire” (Rosa “Savawire” “Live Wire”) that grows to only 6 to 12 inches tall and wide.“White Meidiland” (Rosa “Meicoublan” “White Meidiland”) is a popular ground-cover type rose for larger landscapes that grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and width of 4 to 6 feet. It would require a 7-foot wide area in the garden.
“Peace” roses (Rosa “Peace”) is a very popular hybrid tea rose that takes up a little less space than “White Meidiland.” With a mature height of 3 to 4 feet and width of 2 to 3 feet, it needs about 4 feet of garden space.

, Roses are commonly susceptible to fungal and bacterial diseases that flourish if air circulation is restricted.


Leaving at least 6 to 8 inches of empty space around the rose bush will reduce the frequency and severity of these common diseases.

Learn which orchids are easiest to begin growing and what special conditions they need in order to thrive. Many beginners start with the Dendrobium or Phalaenopsis hybrids. These are available at many local stores and are not expensive.
As you improve your skills, you will want to buy plants from professional growers. Perhaps you might branch out into the more exotic species which will reap greater profit.;
, This will provide you the greatest chance of success in growing your orchids.


Give bright but indirect sunlight.
Water well once or twice a week, but never let the orchid stand in water. The roots will rot. Good drainage is essential to grow orchids.
Fertilize with specially formulated orchid nutrients while the plant is growing.
Orchids do not grow in soil. Instead, their root must be anchored to materials which allow air to flow freely around the roots. Tree bark, moss, perlite, or vermiculite are commonly used.
Provide adequate humidity of 50 to 75 percent.
Ensure the temperature remains between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius). Lower the temperature at night. Some orchids need the temperature to be lowered by only a few degrees, while others need a bigger drop in temperature in the evening hours.
Choose the correct pot size and pot material. Pots smaller than 8 inches (20cm) are often the optimum choice. It is important to make sure the roots have enough air flow and moisture without the chance of becoming water logged. Use rocks to help keep the plant securely supported. Clay pots are porous and let air and water through, but can also dry out more easily. Plastic pots keep moisture in but restrict air flow. Balance is the key.

, For example, some orchids go through a period of dormancy, while others do not.

, Scale, aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites are common problems orchids might encounter. Snails can also attack orchids along with viral disease and destructive animals.


Try using helpful insects such as ladybugs and preying mantises to control destructive insects.
Apply insecticidal soap on tops and bottoms of leaves. Use only the most natural insecticides and only as a last resort.
Use rubbing alcohol to control scale and mealy bugs. Wipe bugs off with cotton dipped in alcohol. Rinse after applying alcohol.

, You can begin to earn money by selling your orchids at farmer's markets, gardening shows, local nurseries and shops. Larger vendors sell to chain stores, broader based nurseries and florists.

Grow terrestrial orchids, which grow in the ground, in your garden.,
Cultivate orchids outside year-round, if temperatures allow, by hanging orchids on trees.,
Cultivate some types of orchids outside year-round in pots, too.",How to Grow Orchids Outside2," First first change the soil to a mix of sand, bark, gravel and fibrous loam. Terrestrial orchids of the Pleione, Sobralia, Calanthe, Phaius and Bletia genuses can be grown in a well-drained area with a lot of shade.

, Place some moss on the tree and set the orchid on the moss. Gently tie the orchid to the moss and branch with a nylon or fishing line. In time, the roots will cling to the tree.


Place orchids in baskets or with their roots exposed on trees if you live in an area with constant rain.

, Roots may rot if there is too much water in a pot. Make sure water can drain out of the pot through a hole in the bottom. Also, do not place the pot in a secondary pot.

"
"
Choose rose growing locations carefully.,
Water your roses appropriately.,
Prune regularly.",How to Control Black Spot on Roses2," The best tactic to control black spot is to plant roses in locations that benefit the rose and thwart the fungus.


Roses should get 6-8 hours of sunlight daily. Morning sunshine is best: it quickly dries out nighttime dew.
Growing locations should get plenty of air circulation. Space rose bushes far enough apart to allow for good circulation and prune out some center branches to allow internal air circulation.
Prepare the soil well. Ensure that it is rich in broken-down organic matter and that it drains well. Well-rotted compost is a good soil enhancer.

, Excess moisture encourages black spot, so it's important to water with care and to not over-water rose plants. When it's cooler, water weekly with a deep soak at the base. For hot, dry weather, more frequent watering will be required, without wetting the leaves.


Use soaker hoses or drip irrigation at the roots of roses for more frequent watering.
Take care when watering––black spot spores get moved about by splashing water. Using soaker hoses or drip irrigation is always better than using hoses with spray watering devices.
Water roses only in the morning so that the leaves can dry out by nightfall.

, Remove any weak or damaged branches and leaves as part of regular pruning.

"
"
Know what you're looking for.,
Remove and place in trash bag any infected leaves and branches as soon as you see signs of black spot.,
Spray roses every 7 to 14 days with a fungicide during growing months.,
Prune canes back to wood uninfected by black spot before the growing season.",How to Control Black Spot on Roses3," Black spot has the following indicators:


Circular black spots with fringed margins on the leaves.
The lower leaves tend to be infected first, after which it spreads quickly.
Upper leaves often turn yellow and fall off.
The plant becomes weaker and it either blooms less or not at all.

, This helps to slow down any further progression of the fungus.


Clean up and safely dispose of black spot infected leaves that have fallen to the ground immediately. If left to lie below a rose, the spores of the fungi will start climbing the rose again as soon as the temperature and moisture are right in the spring.

, Even without signs of black spot, this is an important part of good rose preventative maintenance. Fungicides include trifloxystrobin, Ziram, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, Thiophanate-methyl, and several others. For advice on an appropriate spray or powder for your local area, discuss directly with your local garden center.

, In severe cases black spots can be seen on the stems of the roses. Be sure that these are removed as quickly as they are noticed.

Create the right temperature for your orchid.,
Make sure your orchids get enough sunlight, but not too much.,
Water your orchid once every 5 to 12 days.It's easier to kill an orchid by watering it too frequently than by watering it too seldom.,
Care for the orchids diligently.,
Do not over-fertilize your orchids.,
Keep the humidity level up.,
Understand that each orchid is different.",How to Grow Orchids2," Most orchids originate from a tropical climate, meaning good air, plenty of light, and 12-hour days (365 days a year). The temperature (depending on the species of orchid) should range between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 to 23.8 degrees Celsius).


Make sure that there's about a 20 degree F (6.66 degree C) difference between day and night temperatures. This must be implemented as soon as you begin.

, Many orchids enjoy indirect sunlight: direct sunlight cases them to burn, while not enough creates a plant that doesn't flower.


Check your orchid's leaves if you want to diagnose whether it's getting too much light or not enough. Orchid leaves should be a light, even green if healthy. If the leaves are dark green, it means that the orchid isn't getting enough light. If the leaves are yellow, brown, or reddish, it means they're getting too much.Low-light orchids ( Paphiopedilum, Phalaenopsis, and Oncidium) do best if they get northerly or easterly light. Moderate to high-light orchids (Cattleya, Dendrobium, and Vanda) prefer getting westerly or southerly light.
Orchids love being behind curtains or window blinds. This way, they get plenty of light, but the light that they do get is indirect.

, During the summer months, longer days and more heat might necessitate a shorter watering period.


Keep the following genera moist (although not soggy) at all times: Paphiopedilum, Miltonia, Cymbidium, and Odontoglossum.
Keep the following genera moist during active growth, but allow to dry in between waterings otherwise: Cattleya, Oncidium, Brassia, and Dendrobium.
Allow the following genera to dry out in between waterings: Phalaenopsis, Vanda, and Ascocenda.

, Orchids require much more attention than your average plant or flower. The thicker your leaves are, the more likely your plant requires a larger dose of water. If your plant has bulky faux-bulbs, less water is better. Orchids are not resilient in most occasions, but are when it comes to their water intake. Again, they actually deal with a lack of water better than a superfluous amount of water.

, Typically, expect to fertilize your orchid once a month, but rarely more. Fertilize too often and you'll chance burning the roots and hampering flowering; fertilize not often enough and you'll chance hampering the flowering process.

, Because of orchids' natural affinity for humidity, keep the humidity of your growing room — wherever it may be — at about 60% to 80% at all times.

, Each strand of orchid has different caretaking needs and rules. No one orchid is the same; all require a different temperature, lighting situation and watering schedule. So when you choose an orchid plant to grow, you must be flexible when growing orchids.

Consider the difference between bare root and container roses.,
Plant bare root bulbs right away.,
Plant your container rose when you wish.",How to Buy Rose Bushes2," Bare root rose bushes are sold without any soil on their roots. They are sold online, through the mail and at garden centers. Container plants are sold in containers with soil around their roots.

, Bare root bulbs are usually sold in the spring and should be planted immediately. Make sure the roots do not dry out. Buy only healthy bare-root roses that have some weight to them when you pick them up and have stems that are green and smooth.


If a rose bush feels very light and the stems appear shriveled, it has dried out and is most likely dead. Even if it is not quite dead yet, the rose bush has been severely stressed and is not likely to survive after being planted.

, While they should be planted in the spring or early fall, they can be planted at any time throughout the year as long as they get plenty of water after they are planted. Buy only container roses that are planted in 1- or 2-gallon containers.


If the container is smaller than 1 gallon (3.8 L), the roots have probably been severely pruned to make the rose fit which can leave the bush with too few roots. A rose bush with heavily pruned roots will probably not have enough of a root structure to thrive after it is planted.

"
"
Consider the rose’s grade.,
Take maintenance into account when picking your rose.,
Keep hardiness in mind when selecting a rose.",How to Buy Rose Bushes3," Rose bushes are graded by growers according to their size and vigor. They can be graded at 1, 1 ½ or 2. Grade 1 rose bushes are the healthiest. They are the size they should be at 2 years old, they have good healthy stems and foliage and are growing vigorously. Buy a rose bush that is graded at 1 or 1 ½ for best results.


Grade 1 ½ rose bushes have healthy stems and leaves but they are not growing as vigorously as they could be.
Grade 2 rose bushes are generally low-quality, small for the species or cultivar and growing more slowly than they should be.

, Roses, in general, are high-maintenance plants. They are highly susceptible to bacterial and fungal diseases as well as insect infestations and must have their flowers removed as they fade.


If you are too busy to check the rose bush once or twice each week for these maladies and prune flowers off regularly, buy a rose bush that doesn’t require so much attention. “Knock Out”™ roses like “Radrazz” (Rosa “Radrazz” “Knock Out”™), for example, are highly resistant to common rose diseases. They also do not need to have their flowers removed as they fade., Roses are generally hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 9 (meaning they can stand temperatures that dip to -25 degrees F -34.4 degrees C)but this varies, depending on the species and cultivar. Look up which Hardiness Zone you live in on the USDA Hardiness Zone Map (you can find this online) and purchase a rose bush that is hardy in your area. It is better to buy a rose bush that is hardy to one zone above and below your zone to allow for unusual temperature extremes.


For example, if you live in USDA Hardiness Zone 5, the “White Meidiland” rose would do very well. It is a white-blooming shrub rose that is hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 9 and blooms from spring to fall. It can grow in zone 4 but may need some extra soil or mulch piled over the crown and lower stems to protect it from the cold.
Rose bushes sold at a nearby garden center or nursery should do well in your area as they are not likely to sell roses that are not hardy in that zone.

Identify that you have a Phalaenopsis orchid (Phals for short).,
Do not over water your phal!,
Pot your orchid correctly.,
Do not put them in direct sunlight.,
Keep your plant warm.,
Don't forget to feed them.,
If your first flower doesn't make it, try again!",How to Care for Phalenopsis Orchids (Moth Orchids)," Different types of orchids have very different care.


Phals usually have 3-6 very broad, somewhat floppy leaves that alternate. The flower spike comes from between these leaves.
The flowers on phals can be any color, including white, pink, yellow, striped or splotched. Flowers are usually 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) in diameter and bloom on a spike that may be 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) in length.
There may be more than one spike on a large plant and it may have anywhere from 3-20 flowers. If you aren't sure you have a phal, check the internet for images.;
, This is the number one cause of death and you may not even know you are doing it until one day the plant is dead.


Phals are epiphytic plants, meaning in the wild they attach themselves by their roots to a tree or rock and get their nutrients from detritus that accumulate around their roots.
This means that their roots aren't sitting in wet soil under natural conditions. Frequently, orchids from big box stores are either over watered or under watered. Over watered plants get root rot and eventually die b/c they can't absorb water.
Under watered plants have hard, brittle roots. Healthy roots should be thick, a silvery green with bright green tips.
It's a good idea to check the roots on a new phal when you bring it home. If all the roots are brown and squishy, trim them off and repot the plant.
Keep it on the dry side until you see new roots forming.
When you do water(typically once a week works well in most homes, but you should put your finger into the substrate to feel it before watering, if wet, hold off), allow water to run until it comes out of the holes in the pot.
Do not get water on or in between the leaves, as this can cause rot, which can kill the plant.
Generally, under watering is a lot less likely to kill a phal than over watering.

, Proper potting of the orchid will help keep you from over watering!


During this time, you may want to keep the orchid in a more humid area, like a bathroom (as long as it gets some light).
Phals can be potted in a variety of substances, but the most important is that the potting substrate allows the roots to get some air and drys relatively quickly.
This means never, ever use potting soil for houseplants on phals. One of the easiest thing to use is a bark mix for orchids.
To re-pot your plant, get a plastic or clay pot (plastic holds water better and you water less with one than clay-if you have tendency to over water, go with clay).
Go with a pot size that fits the roots the best, not the leaves. Smaller is always better, as it dries faster.
Position your flower in the middle of the pot and fill in the pot with the bark mix. As you fill, you should bang the pot against the floor to help settle the bark.
It helps to soak the bark beforehand in water. Pots should always have holes in the bottom to allow good drainage.
You can put a plastic pot with holes into a more decorative container if you want to and then just take it out when you water it.
Orchids don't like to have wet feet! Not all roots may fit in the pot and that is normal

(Phals have aerial roots, you can mist them with a spray bottle when you water the plant).



, Phals are a lower light orchid. They do not like to be in direct sun and this can burn their leaves easily.


Diffused light or early morning light in an east window works well.
Overhead lights in your house are probably not enough though, so you should keep it near a window where it gets some natural, diffused light.
Not enough light will keep the plant from re-flowering. If it's been 6 months since you've seen signs of a flower spike, try putting the plant in a little more light.

, Phals do not like to get too cold. Temps at night shouldn't get below about 62 degrees. Daytime temps in the mid 70's to 80's are good.

, Phals need plant food at some point.


Once a month diluted in water works well.
You should use about half the recommended amount on the label and avoid food that use urea for the nitrogen, as it can burn the root tips.
A 10/10/10 or 20/20/20 formula works well. There are several formulas especially for orchids, but they are all pretty much the same.

, Starting with a healthy plant is easier than trying to revive one that wasn't cared for properly in the store. Look for a plant with big thick roots and nice shiny leaves that don't droop too much."

Slowly pour the growing media around the mini orchid's roots.,
Check the sturdiness of your re-potted mini orchid.,
Refrain from watering your freshly potted orchid for the first 10 days.,
Repot your mini orchids every two years.",How to Care for Mini Orchids1," Mini orchids have fast-growing roots, and one of the main reasons you need to periodically repot your orchids is to provide the roots with plenty of room. The new pot only needs to be large enough to fit the roots; you do not need to choose a pot that is significantly larger to anticipate further root growth.;
, Media with a base of moss and bark is superior to standard potting soil.

, For best results, let the drenched media sit for a full 24 hours so that it thoroughly absorbs the water.

, Snip off green spikes 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the top node. Trim yellow or brown spikes 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the bottom node.

, Gently grab the base of the orchid with one hand and the pot with your other. Tip the mini orchid to its side or upside-down, and slowly squeeze or rotate the sides of the pot until the clump of roots comes free.

, Media breaks down as time passes, and old, decomposed media is more likely to cause your orchid's roots to rot. As a result, you need to remove as much old media as possible.

, Dead roots with look brown and wilted. Healthy roots, on the other hand, are white or green and relatively firm.

, You only need a little, since the mini orchid's roots should fill the majority of the container.

, Hold the orchid up so that the base of the lowest leaf dips below the rim of the pot by 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters).

, Press down on the media gently to force it into the bottom and around the sides of the container. Periodically tap the side of the container to help settle it. Continue adding the media until the entire root system is covered, leaving the plant exposed from the bottom leaf up.

, Lift the plant up by the stem. If the pot starts to slip, you need to add more media to make the orchid more secure.

, Instead, sit it in a warm location and mist it with a little water each day. The leaves should stay dry at night.

, Mini orchids may need re-potting as often as every one year, but some can even go as long as three years without any damage occurring. If your media starts to smell or if the roots of your flower look choked, you know it is time for you to repot.

Observe not just where they grow, but where they flourish.,
Picture now the areas where the dendrobium can grow.",How to Care for a Dendrobium Orchid1,"

The dead branch with a lot of light is the best for growing.



 


The second best growing area would be on a branch far out from the tree. There is will get mixed light, however more light than not.






The orchid will still grow if it breaks and part falls from the tree. The only requirement is that is still has enough light.






They grow in a wet forest, where humidity is high, showers are almost daily but also where they get a great deal of air circulation.

Water your mini orchids by placing one standard-size ice cube in the pot every week.,
Check the growing media for dryness every few days.,
Allow your mini orchid to sit in a sunny spot, but avoid direct sunlight.,
Supplement artificial lighting when you cannot provide enough natural light.,
Keep an eye on the foliage.,
Maintain a room temperature between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (18 and 29 degrees Celsius).,
Do not place the flower in a drafty area.,
Periodically mist the leaves of the mini orchid.,
Fertilize your mini orchid once a month.",How to Care for Mini Orchids2," Orchids, in general, have sensitive roots that are prone to rot if allowed to sit in too much water. Watering your mini orchid with ice cubes provides a measured amount of water that gradually melts and sinks into the media, reducing the risk of over-watering. While standard orchids can take up to three ice cubes, mini varieties only need one.

, Under ideal conditions, one ice cube once a week provides enough water. In excessively hot or dry conditions, you may need to add an additional sprinkle of water in the middle of the week. Allow the media to get partially dry, but add more water once it feels dry even 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) below the surface.

, Place the flower in an eastern window that only receives muted sun, or block out some of the direct sun by placing it behind a translucent shade or screen in a southern window.

, Fluorescent lights or High Intensity Discharge lights offer the best alternatives. Place the lights 6 to 12 inches (15.24 to 30.48 centimeters) away from the top of your mini orchid to prevent accidental over-lighting.

, You can usually determine whether or not your orchid receives the right amount of light based on the way its leaves look. Too little light will result in dark green leaves with no flowers. Too much light will cause the leaves to turn yellow or red. Some leaves may even develop brown ""sunburn"" spots.

, Mini orchids thrive in warm, humid conditions. For best results, keep the temperature on the high end of the scale during the day and drop it by about 15 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius) at night. Never allow the temperature to drop below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius), however.

, Avoid letting it sit near open windows and air vents.

, Orchids like humid conditions, and misting the plant every day or two will mimic humidity. If this does not work, run a humidifier in the same room during the day.

, Use a balanced fertilizer and mix it with water, diluting it down to half its recommended strength. If this fertilizer does not seem to do well for your plant, you can also try a high-nitrogen fertilizer, especially if you use a bark-based growing media.

Imitate the conditions of the natural habitat.,
Let the dendrobium dry in between misting.,
Keep high relative humidity.,
Adjust the orchid container.,
Move the plant outside during the summer.,
Move the plant gradually.,
Ensure that the orchid receives nutrition.,
Fertilization must be done artificially if grown indoors.,
Water outside only if there is a drought.,
Disturbing the orchid is detrimental.",How to Care for a Dendrobium Orchid2,"

Use dead wood chips, much sunlight and good air circulation as optimal growth conditions for your plant.






Remember that the tree does not retain water, and has plenty of air around it.
Provide lots of drainage and holes (if in a pot) for air flow.







,

Use any spray bottle for misting.






Avoid using chlorinated or “softened” water. These do not exist in the natural habitat and are both harsh on the plant.







,


If your house in winter uses heat, use either an orchid cage or terrarium to increase humidity.

,

Do this several times per year as the sun changes position throughout the year.






Remember, the dendrobium needs natural sunlight.

,

Use a basket and hang towards the outer part of a tree or overhang on a porch.







,

After being indoors, they, like people, can burn if moved too quickly into a great deal of natural light.







,


In their natural habitat roots are used to collect dead insects, dust, rotting tree matter as a food source.

,

Use orchid fertilizer in a mister once every three months.






Too much fertilizer will burn the roots, so fertilize only as directed.






Do not attempt to push your orchid with too much fertilizing.

,

Two to three times per week of rain or mist is normal and the average.







,

Do not change how your orchid is planted more than absolutely required.




Too much “fussing” about the orchid is how most people kill them.






Give the orchid simulated optimal conditions and except for misting, leave it alone.

Make sure the light intensity is correct for the species.,
Provide the right amount of water.,
Maintain a humid environment.",How to Get Orchids to Bloom1," There are many species of orchids, but moth orchids (Phalaenopsis) are the most common and easiest species to grow.This is the kind that is sold in most florist shops and nurseries. Placing them on a sunny windowsill will usually make them happy. They like bright light, but not direct sun.Some of the less common orchid varieties have different needs for light exposure. For instance, lady’s-slippers (Paphiopedilums) and Miltonias dislike direct light. A north facing window is a great spot for these orchid types.
Cattleyas, Dendrobiums, Oncidiums and cymbidiums, on the other hand, need a lot of sun exposure to thrive. A south or west-facing window is better for these species.;
, The Phalaenopsis orchid likes to be watered once per week during its resting period (when it experiences no growth or blooms) and twice per week during active growth. It prefers to be kept dry between waterings. This means you should only water it when the potting material (which is usually a free-draining blend of fir bark) appears dry, or else the orchid could die.If the bark looks damp, it’s too soon.


Make sure that there are drainage holes in your orchid’s pot. Orchids do not grow well when they sit in water.
Water your orchid early in the morning.Most indoor orchids should be watered every 5 to 12 days, depending on the species and season:Vanda and Ascocenda have the same watering needs as the Phalaenopsis orchid.
Paphiopedilum, Miltonia, Cymbidium and Odontoglossum varieties like to be kept evenly moist at all times.
Cattleya, Oncidium, Brassia and Dendrobium varieties like to be kept evenly moist during periods of active growth. At all other times, they prefer to be kept dry between waterings.



, Most orchids are tropical plants, so they prefer a humidity level that they probably aren’t getting in the average living room.During the winter, a 30 percent humidity level is average for a home. The Phalaenopsis orchid likes 40 to 70 percent humidity.Most other orchids prefer 60 to 80 percent humidity. By adjusting the humidity for them, all orchid species will grow a little better. If you group your plants together in one growing area and mist them frequently, this will create humidity.


Consider getting a humidifier for the winter months. You can also buy special trays at most nurseries that can help you create humidity around the orchid.
You can also try keeping your orchid in your bathroom. It will love the humidity. Make sure it's on a windowsill that gets plenty of light, but not direct sunlight."

Construct a tall greenhouse or hothouse.,
Try growing several types of orchids before you attempt to grow a vanilla orchid.,
Purchase a vanilla cutting.,Immerse your cutting completely in a tray of water for 10 minutes.,
Remove the cutting from the water, but reinsert the ends in the tray.,
Ready a space in your hothouse or outdoor tropical garden next to a tree or a trellis.,
Pour orchid potting soil into a pot.,
Cover these nodes with 0.8 inches (2 cm) of orchid potting soil.

,
Tie the remaining plant to the trellis or a stake.,
Keep the soil slightly drier for the first month, but never allow it to completely dry out.,
Water the plant regularly as time goes on.,
Add mulch to the soil every few months.,
Move the plant as needed for the next nine to 12 months to ensure it gets sunlight for approximately 50 percent of the day.

,
Allow the vanilla orchid to grow and mature for several years.,
Mist the orchid daily with soft water.,
Watch out for clusters of vanilla orchid flowers.,
Wear rubber gloves to avoid problems with orchid sap.,
Push the anther up.,
Watch to see if the stem turns downward.,
Continue caring for the plant and pollinating the flowers.,
Pick the pods when they are green and begin to turn yellow at the bottom.

,
Cure your vanilla beans before using them.",How to Grow Vanilla," Vanilla orchids require a tropical environment, so you will need sunlight, heat, space and humidity for it to grow. If you live in the South of the United States, Australia or another warm climate you may be able to cultivate vanilla outside.


Your environment should be 65 degrees (18 Celsius) or warmer all year to successfully cultivate an orchid. Warmer temperatures are preferable.;
, You can improve the greenhouse conditions until they are ideal for this type of orchid that requires heat, humidity and partial shade.

, If you don’t have a local florist or garden center that sells these, you may need to order them online. Ensure each cutting is at least one foot (30 cm) long.


If you are ordering cuttings online, you may want to purchase several to improve your chances of having a vanilla crop.
Cuttings are usually taken from mature plants that are 20 feet (6 m) or more in length.

,, The ends should remain immersed for five days. Notice which end is the top and which is the bottom.

Add a pinch of liquid fertilizer to improve results.
The top is the direction in which the plant has been growing. The leaves will point down toward the bottom of the cutting., It will need shade 50 percent of the time, as well as constant support to grow vines. If you are using a trellis, you will need to create a shaded area above the plant.

, Lay the bottom two nodes of the plant horizontally on the top of the soil. Nodes are vine intersections.


Orchid soil is usually a combination of pine bark, perlite and mulch.

,, It must be trained to grow vertically. You can purchase ties or clips online or at a gardening store.

,, Never allow the soil to dry out, yet don’t allow it to get too saturated or it can rot.

, The mulch is its food so it should be rich in organic matter.

,, Air roots will attach upward to the support and others will reach down to the soil. It will take between two and seven years for the plant to grow large enough to bloom.

, It will encourage roots to grow and the plant to grow larger., It only flowers for a six week period per year and the flowers only last approximately one day.During this time, you will need to hand pollinate the flower in order to grow the vanilla beans.

, Consider asking a local orchid grower to help you hand-pollinate the first few times. It is a very delicate process.

, Push the pollen mass out and hold it up with your right thumb and index finger. Use your middle finger to push the anther back and expose the cam underneath it, which serves as a shield.


Place the pollen on the ridge. Push the ridge back into place with your left hand and pull the cap back down.
Repeat with all the flowers.
Pollinate in the morning. Some sources suggest 11 am is the best time., If it begins to elongate instead of point up, it is pollinated.

, Pods should appear within two months; however, they take nine months to mature.

,, Spread your beans on trays and place them in direct sunlight for three hours. Fold them inside cloth to sweat overnight.


Repeat each day until the pods turn a deep brown.
Hang them or place them in drying rooms for two to four weeks.

",How to Care for Orchids," The proper care of orchids starts with choosing plants that are suited to your particular environment. Consider the orchid's adaptability, ease of growing, ready availability, and their beautiful flowers. If you do find yourself wanting to extend beyond the easier varieties later, it's recommended that you do plenty of research into the specific needs of the more delicate and fussy varieties of orchids. Some things to bear in mind when choosing an orchid include:

Will the orchid have enough space when fully grown? Or will it need to be moved somewhere else? Some orchids can be massive when fully grown and are best placed in a greenhouse.
Can you provide the temperature requirements that the orchid needs? Orchids can be divided into three types by temperature requirements––cool, intermediate and warm, meaning that orchids require certain minimum night temperatures in order to grow successfully.
Do you have a greenhouse or conservatory if needed? Many orchids will thrive best in such an environment than simply sitting in the house or on a back porch. If you don't, prefer the orchids that like being indoors (see list below).;
, The plants that already have flowers are a great buy, because it can take up to five years for a seedling to produce a flower. Unless you're exceedingly patient, or already have a greenhouse full of orchids, you probably don't want to wait that long.

, Select an orchid based on the growing conditions in your home. This matters because each type of orchid has different requirements, dependent on the orchid's origins. Always read the label accompanying the instructions to make sure the plant is suitable for your home and garden conditions. Here are some common species of orchids that usually grow well in the basic home environment:


Phalaenopsis: Usually referred to as moth orchids, these are elegant orchids for indoor use. Their long sprays of colorful flowers stay fresh for months. Flowering begins in winter or early spring. This orchid generally needs less light than cattleyas (see next) and does well in most indoor conditions.






Cattleya: These orchids are most easily recognized for their use in corsages and for having a flower that can last from two to six weeks. They usually flower once a year during spring or fall, but need twice the amount of light than moth orchids to do well inside the home.






Dendrobium: These beautiful orchids produce long, graceful sprays of flowers that are typically white, lavender or a combination of the two, during fall and winter. Their flowers can remain open about three to four weeks, and they are one of the easiest plants to care for.






Paphiopedilum: The popular name for this orchid is Lady's Slipper, because the third petal is modified to form a pouch that looks similar to a lady's slipper. The pouch functions by trapping insects so that they are forced to climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit pollen. The leaves are quite often attractive with green or mottled green and white colors. These orchids require bright light, but no direct sun. At home, an east, west or shaded south window is best (for the northern hemisphere). Foliage should be naturally semi-erect and firm, not drooping. Room temperature is ideal for their growth.






, Orchidaceae are one of the largest families of flowering plants, and as such there are many sub-families, or variations, and they have different watering requirements. What might be parching to one species risks drowning another. Generally, water your orchids every five to 12 days depending on what type of orchid you have, what the temperature is, and the time of year — or more in summer, less in winter. While your nursery adviser or florist will be able to give you specific information, here is a general guide to help you determine the best watering course for your orchids:


Keep these varieties evenly moist (not wet) at all times:






Paphiopedilum
Miltonia
Cymbidium
Dontoglossum


Keep these varieties evenly moist during active growth, but let them dry out between waterings when they are not:






Cattleya
Oncidium
Brassia
Dendrobium


Keep these varieties almost dry between waterings:

Phalaenopsis
Vanda
Ascocenda


Take care to avoid wetting the leaves when you water your orchids. If they do get wet, gently dry them with a tissue or cotton swab.

, Remove the inner pot from the decorative one, place in the sink or in the bathtub. Add orchid food to a watering can or container, and completely water the base. Allow the water to completely drain before replacing it into the decorative pottery planter. Never allow it to sit in water, as it will kill the plant.


Note: Epiphytic (branch-growing) orchids are not planted in earth like the terrestrial orchid varieties, but in the shell of a coconut, bark or cork. Or, they can be grown in slatted baskets or on rafts of wood. Their roots grow from the top, and not the bottom as usually found in terrestrial plants.

, In general, once a month is recommended for most fertilizers. Look for fertilizers that contain nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K), plus trace elements like iron (Fe). Use fertilizer with a higher nitrogen percentage when new shoots are coming out, and fertilizer with more phosphorous and potassium later in the season. Do not overfeed orchids –– this can damage them.


If you're growing your orchid on bark, use a fertilizer that's significantly higher in nitrogen (in a ratio of 30(N)-10(P)-10(K)). The bacteria in the decomposing bark will consume a lot of nitrogen.
Water your orchid thoroughly before feeding.

, Many orchids are epiphytic (tree- or branch-growing) and require very different growing media than terrestrial orchids; indeed, orchids are commonly killed by being planted in soil when they're not a soil type orchid. Epiphytes have thick, fleshy roots used to attach themselves to trees or bark and to absorb water and nutrients; others have aerial roots that will grow unattached. Epiphyte orchids grow best in soilless mixtures or attached to pieces of bark or cork. Epiphytic orchids require a growing media with extremely good aeration and drainage.

, Common growing media includes fir bark, coconut husks, sphagnum moss, tree fern fibers, perlite, or a mixture of any of those. However, the growing medium will depend on the orchid type––terrestrial orchids should have a medium formed mainly of loam with equal parts of such substances as sphagnum moss, damp peat or sharp sand. Epiphytic orchids should have a growing substance that consists of equal parts of sphagnum moss, finely ground bark, vermiculite and moist peat. It's easiest to buy readily mixed media suitable for the orchid type, and always know the specific needs of the variety of orchid you're growing, as these can vary quite a bit.


Commercially prepared orchid potting mixes are available or a mixture can be prepared containing chopped tree fern fiber, volcanic stone, charcoal, a little peat, fir bark or combinations of these.

, You will need to repot on occasion, both to refresh the media, and to account for growth. Spring is the usual time for repotting orchids. Here are some things to consider:


Orchids planted in bark should be repotted every 18 to 24 months, in general.
Select the pot size based on the size of the root mass. Orchids tend to prefer smaller pots. With a pot that's significantly larger, the orchid will expend most of its energy rooting, and show no real new growth or foliage for months, so keep the containers small. All orchids prefer being somewhat root-bound with their roots protruding from the top of the media (or aerial roots should simply hang free). However, as plants produce more new canes or spikes, they can eventually outgrow their pot.
The pot will affect how you water. An orchid potted in a porous pot such as clay (good for orchids) will need more frequent watering than an orchid in a plastic container.
Always use a pot with a drainage hole. Sitting in water will rot the roots and the orchid will become mulch.
In larger pots, media in the center may take much longer to dry out––a condition that will harm your orchid. To alleviate this, use broken clay pots in the bottom of the container to increase drainage.
If using a clay container, enlarge the drainage hole or make additional holes on the sides (near the bottom) of the pot.

, Carefully replant your plant into a slightly larger pot or suitable container, using the suitable porous media suggested above. Always ensure good drainage.


For a terrestrial orchid: Remove the plant from the original pot. Carefully tease off the old medium. Place the plant into the clean pot, sprinkle in fresh medium around the roots. Firm into place using a dibble or small stick. Leave a small space between the compost and rim to allow watering space. About 12mm (1/2"") space is adequate.
For an epiphytic orchid: Remove the loose, old medium. Cut away dead roots and discard them. Hold the orchid upside down and pack new medium around the roots to create a firm ball. Turn the orchid right side up and place back into the chosen container. A repotted epiphytic orchid should not be watered for about one week after, as this allows the roots to re-establish. Water sparingly after this, to ensure the new roots are not damaged.

, This is especially important from late spring through summer.

, Peak blooming time starts from late winter, primarily February and March in the northern hemisphere. Blooms normally last from four to twelve weeks. When the blooms fade, cut off the spike 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) (12mm) above where it projects from the foliage. Also trim off any dead leaves and tissue, including old flower stems, old leaves, anything rotting, dead roots, etc.


In the event of fungal rot or disease, cut a little past the infected tissue to help stop the progression of the infection.

, If you cut part of an orchid leaf, the rest of the leaf may die, and cutting into a live pseudobulb will severely damage your orchid.

, This will help prevent the spread of diseases from plant to plant. It's recommended that you soak the tools in bleach between uses, or use a disposable razor blade.

, This will be in the form of a new cane growing from the base of the old ones. Under correct conditions, the new cane can be larger than the mother cane before it is ready to bloom again.


Cool nighttime temperatures help to initiate blooms. With proper care in accordance with the variety's particular needs, the orchid plant should grow and bloom annually.

, 65–85ºF (18–30ºC) is best. For brief periods, they can withstand temperatures ranging from 60–100ºF (16–37ºC) but they dislike sudden temperature changes. Cold temperatures will cause the leaves to turn yellow and eventually drop off. If this happens, remove the yellow foliage and continue caring for the plant normally.

, Having good air circulation can make all the difference for the health of your orchid. This will help your orchid heal if you do experience a fungal or pest infestation that must be treated. Air circulation is also a big part of the prevention of these types of infestations by keeping the leaves and flowers dry.


In the summer, open windows so that the natural airflow will circulate the air. This promotes water evaporation and lots of fresh carbon dioxide. A gentle breeze will also help orchids handle bright sunlight without scorching the leaves.
In the winter (or in the summer, on still days), use an oscillating fan to gently stir the air. Move it around occasionally so that one spot isn't being over-blown.

"
Consider using full-spectrum lights.,
Use a fertilizer formulated for orchids.,
Fertilize your orchid once per month during the active growing season.,
Drop the temperature by 10 degrees at night.,
Ventilate the area where your orchid is kept.",How to Get Orchids to Bloom2," When an orchid refuses to bloom, the reason is usually because it isn't getting enough light. If you are unable to provide the right amount of natural light for your orchid, look into setting up full-spectrum lights indoors. You can purchase these lighting systems at nurseries or order them online.There are sizes and shapes available to fit any space in your home.
You can adjust the lighting to meet the needs of your particular orchid species.

, Feeding an orchid the right fertilizers can stimulate it to grow faster and bloom sooner.Look for orchid food that contains nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). It should also include trace elements like iron. Always read and follow the instructions of your orchid food carefully. Orchids should be watered thoroughly before fertilizing them.Some types of orchid food are granulated or dry. You must dissolve this kind of fertilizer in water before using.
Dry orchid food is highly concentrated. Never use it directly on the plant. Once the granulated orchid food has been dissolved in water, pour it directly on the plant.

, The active growing season for orchids is approximately March through November. Don’t fertilize from mid-December until mid-February. If you fertilize it less than that, its growth may become stunted and blooms won’t appear. If you fertilize it more frequently than that, you risk burning the roots and leaves of the plant. Burning an orchid’s roots with fertilizer will also prevent blooms from appearing.Read the instructions for your particular orchid food carefully, since they may vary slightly from product to product.
Make sure you fertilize just after the flowers fade to stimulate additional blooms. Fertilize again when new leaves or shoots appear and begin growing.

, Moth orchids (Phalaenopsis) are temperature sensitive. In nature, their blooms are triggered when fall arrives and the temperatures drop at night.If an orchid doesn’t experience a period of cooler nights, even an indoor orchid, it may refuse to make buds or bloom. If your orchid is sitting in a window, it’s probably experiencing natural temperature drops coming from outside to some extent. However, this may not be enough to trigger blooms. Before you go to bed each night, turn your thermostat down by 10 degrees.One to two weeks of nightly temperature drops will usually trigger an orchid to bloom, as long as it’s the right time of their growth cycle.
For Phalaenopsis orchids, provide night temperatures of 60°F (15.5°C) and day temperatures of 80°F (25°C).

, Stale, dry air will prevent an orchid from blooming. Orchids thrive in an environment where fresh, moist air circulates freely. While humidity is a necessity, it can also become destructively heavy if not ventilated well. Make sure the air around the orchid is fresh by opening windows or keeping a fan in the area on a low setting."
"
Pay attention to the season.,
Check the leaf color.,
Check the stems and leaves for signs of dehydration.,
Evaluate the potting material.",How to Get Orchids to Bloom3," Each species of orchid has a growth season – a time of the year when it will naturally bloom. If it currently isn’t the orchid’s growth season, it isn’t going to bloom. Most orchids, including the Phalaenopsis orchid, will experience the growth of new leaves during the summer months. Spikes and flower buds will appear in late fall and soon after it will bloom. It will continue to bloom until spring. The blooming season usually ends around mid-February.The Phalaenopsis orchid usually blooms once every year. The blooms can last for several months.
When the flowers fall off, a few more flowers might bloom from the same spike, but not always.

, If an orchid isn’t blooming, the reason is almost always because it’s not getting enough light. One of the best ways to figure out if your orchid is getting enough light is to check its leaf color. A healthy orchid getting the right amount of sun exposure will have bright green leaves. If the leaves are dark green, your orchid isn’t getting enough light. Move it to a brighter spot, like a south-facing window. If the leaves are reddish-green, the orchid is getting too much light. Move it to a less sunny spot, like an east or north-facing window.You will probably need to filter the light with a shade or curtain if you put a Phalaenopsis in a south-facing window. Moth orchids like a lot of light, but not direct light., If the stems and leaves appear wilted or shriveled, your orchid needs more water. You will always need to water more frequently when the orchid is actively blooming.During the resting period (when there are no blooms), water your orchid about once per week. During the active blooming phase, water it twice per week.


Increase watering when you see new shoots and roots appear on your orchid.
Too much water can kill an orchid quickly. Never allow your orchid to sit in a soggy, water-logged pot., Most orchids, including Phalaenopsis, do not grow in regular soil. They need a growing medium that provides fast water drainage and good air circulation. A free-draining blend of fir bark (sometimes referred as fir bark nuggets) is the most popular potting material for moth orchids. If you can’t identify your plant’s current growing medium, re-pot it in fir bark.Without adequate air circulation and drainage provided by an appropriate potting material, an orchid will suffocate and die.
Most orchids will also grow in peat moss, dried fern roots, sphagnum moss, rock wool, perlite, cork nuggets, stones, coconut fiber, lava rock or a blend that combines several of these materials.

"
"
Choose the right kind of orchid.,
Choose the right pot.,
Use the appropriate potting mix.,
Find the right light source.",How to Care for an Orchid Indoors1," There are lots of different types of orchids, which makes choosing one dependent on the type of environment you can offer them. Things like the temperature of your house, how much light you get, how much attention you can give will decide which orchid is best for you.The easiest type of orchid to grow indoors is the moth orchid (Phalaenopsis orchids). These orchids last for months and grow best in medium-grain bark mix, warm temperatures, and low to medium light. They are good for first-timers, and are pretty forgiving of mistakes.
If you tend to over-water your orchids then you'll want to go for the slipper orchids (such as Phaphiopedilum, or Phragmipedium). On the other hand, if you tend to ignore your orchids Cattleya, Oncidium, or Dendrobium are the best choices.
If you don't get much light in your house then Jewel orchids (Paphiopedilum) are the best choice. For those with only a small windowsill mini-cattleyas (Pleurothallis) or miniature moth orchids are the best choice.;
, The most basic and common pot is the terracotta pot (in clay or plastic). There are many different kinds to choose from. Some considerations: if you're a heavy waterer use a clay pot with a coarse potting mix; if you tend to let your orchids dry out use a plastic pot and a fine potting mix.Clear plastic pots let light reach the roots and allow you to keep an eye on the orchid's root growth. These can be good if you don't have a whole lot of time.
Pots with a net basket insert or with bi-level drainage make for great drainage and air circulation, which is good if you over-water.
Wooden baskets tend to be constructed of a rot-resistant wood, like teak. If you do use a basket then you'll need to first line it with sheet moss and then put in your potting mix.

, The roots of orchids need more airspace than dirt provides, so orchid mixes tend not to have potting soil. The mix tends to have things like fir bark, coconut husk, sphagnum moss, tree fern fibers and perlite, and is frequently a mixture of two or three of these materials.A fine mix is best for smaller types of orchids and ones that have small roots and need to stay on the damp side, like slipper orchids, most oncidiums, miltonias. Make a fine mix from 4 parts fine-grade fir bark or coco husk chips or redwood bark, one part fine charcoal, one part horticultural-grade perlite or small-grade Aliflor.
The medium mix is good if you aren't sure which mix to use. It is particularly good for cattleyas, phalaenopsis, and most mature orchids. Make it out of four parts medium-grade fir bark or medium-grade coco husk chunks, one part medium charcoal, and one part horticultural-grade perlite or medium-grade Aliflor.
If you don't want to make your own, you can find good orchid potting mixes at most home improvement and garden shops. There are plenty of mixes that serve a wide range of orchid types.

, Orchids need lots of light and depending on the type of orchid, they need filtered light or full on light. Pick a window facing north with direct light that is partially filtered (like through filmy/sheer curtains).


Check your orchid to see if it needs more light or less light. That will determine whether you use sheer curtains or whether you use no curtains.
Use fluorescent lights to supplement the natural light. Gardeners have found that just plain, normal fluorescent lights can do the trick very nicely. The light that comes in through your window may not be consistent enough, especially on cloudy days or if you place your orchid near a window that only lets minimal sunlight through. Investing in a couple of 20 watt fluorescent tubes or other similar lighting can simulate more ideal conditions.

Water in the morning or afternoon.,
Mist your orchid.",How to Water Orchids," No orchid variety needs to be watered every day. In fact, overwatering can cause an orchid's roots to rot and eventually die.Unlike many houseplants, orchids should only be watered when they begin to dry out. Watering only when they're almost dry mimics an orchid's natural environment.


Some orchids have water-storing organs, and some do not. If you have a type of orchid that has the ability to store water, such as cattleyas or oncidiums, you should allow the orchid to completely dry out before watering. If you have a type of orchid that does not have water-storing organs, such as phalaenopsis or paphiopedilums, you should water the orchid before it is entirely dry.
If you're not sure what type of orchid you have, plan to water the orchid when it is almost dry, but still has just a bit of moisture left.;
, The frequency with which you water orchids is affected by the level of humidity in your climate, as well as the amount of sun the orchid gets and the temperature of the air. Since these factors vary according to region and household, there's no rule for how often to water an orchid. You'll have to develop a routine catered to your specific environment.


If the temperature is cool in your home, your orchid will need to be watered less frequently than when the temperature is warm.
If the orchid is in a sunny window, it will need to be watered more frequently than if you place it in a shadier spot.

, This is the first indication that it might be time to water the orchid. Orchid potting mix is usually composed of bark or moss, and if it looks dry and dusty, it might be time to water. However, just looking at the potting mix won't give you an accurate enough indication as to whether it's time to water.

, The pot will feel lighter when it's time to water the orchid. If it's heavy, that means there's still water in the pot. Over time, you'll get a sense of how heavy the pot feels when the orchid needs water versus how heavy it feels when it still has moisture inside.


A pot that still contains moisture might look different, too. If your orchid is in a clay pot, it will look darker when it's still wet. If it's light in color, it might be time for a watering.

, This is the best way to determine whether an orchid needs more water. Stick your pinky finger into the potting mix, taking care not to disturb the orchid's roots. If you don't feel any moisture, or you feel just a little, it's time to water the orchid. If you feel moist potting mix right away, give it more time. When in doubt, you should wait an extra day.

, You can't properly water an orchid unless it has holes through which the water can drain. Water sitting in the pot will cause the roots to rot, so it needs to be able to drain through the bottom. If you bought an orchid that came in an ornamental pot without holes, repot the orchid in one with adequate holes in the bottom. Use an orchid potting mix instead of regular potting soil.


Look for special pots designed for growing orchids. These pots are usually made out of terracotta clay and have extra drainage holes in the sides. You should be able to find them in the same section as other planters.
If you just want a quick way to water your orchid without having to transplant the orchid, you can use the ice cube method. Put the equivalent of 1/4 cup (59 ml) of frozen water (usually about three medium ice cubes) on top of the potting mix. Make sure that the ice never comes in contact with the orchid itself - it should only touch the soil. Let the ice cubes melt into the pot. Wait about a week before you do it again. This method is not optimal for the long-term health of the orchid, so only use it as a temporary solution., The easiest way to water an orchid is to hold it under a faucet and run it under room temperature water. If you have an attachment that allows you to diffuse the water, rather than just running it in one strong stream, that's better for the orchid. Water the orchid this way for a full minute, allowing the water to seep through the pot and come out the holes in the bottom.Do not use water that has been softened or treated with harsh chemicals. If you have a special orchid species, see if you can use distilled water or rainwater.
The water should pour rapidly through the pot. If it seems to be getting stuck in the pot, the potting mix you're using might be too dense.
After watering the orchid, check the weight of the pot so you'll be able to tell the difference when the pot gets lighter and the orchid is ready to be watered again.

, That way the excess water will have plenty of time to evaporate before it gets dark. If water sits on the plant overnight, it can cause rotting to occur or leave the plant prone to diseases.


If you see excess water sitting on the leaves, wipe it off with a paper towel.
A few minutes after watering, check the saucer and empty it out so no water sits near the orchid.

, Since orchids thrive in humidity, misting your orchid is a great way to keep it healthy, especially since it prevents the roots from drying out. Fill a spray bottle with water, then spritz the plant a few times a day. How often you mist the orchid depends on the environment where you live. Drier environments will require more misting, while damp climates may require misting daily.If you don't know if your orchid needs another mist, check to see if it feels dry.
Don't let water collect on the leaves.
You can find a spray bottle in most department stores or online.

Maintain the right temperature.,
Maintain good air circulation.,
Water your orchid properly.,
Fertilize about once a month.,
Trim the stem to allow for new growth.,
Repot your orchid.",How to Care for an Orchid Indoors2," Find out if your orchid is a ""cool growing"" orchid or a ""warm growing"" orchid. The two types prefer temperatures that fall into a slightly different range. Warm growing orchids include vanda, phalaenopsis, and oncidium breeds. Cool growing orchids include phragmipedium, miltonia, and cymbidium breeds.


Drop the temperature approximately 15 °F (−9 °C) at night. Within nature, orchids grow in locations that experience a similar drop in nighttime temperature. As a result, manually dropping the temperature this dramatically in your home, at least in the room where your orchid grows, will encourage your the plant to flower and thrive.
Keep warm growing orchids at a temperature between 75 to 85 °F (24 to 29 °C) during the day. At night, allow the temperature to drop somewhere between 65 to 75 degrees.
Keep cool growing orchids at a temperature between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. At night, allow the temperature to drop somewhere within the range of 50 to 65 degrees.

, This is especially important during warm weather. Open the windows on hot, muggy days or place a small fan nearby. Stale, stagnant air will stunt the orchid's growth.

, The type of orchid requires slightly different amounts of watering. In general it's best to water your orchid every 5 to 12 days, depending on time of year and temperature. If you're going through a heat spell you may need to water your orchid more frequently.


The roots need to remain evenly moist throughout the entire year, but the plant will not need as much water during cooler months, when growth is naturally reduced, as it does during vibrant warm months.
Orchids that need to be moist at all times are Paphiopedilum, Miltonia, Cymbidium, and Odontoglossum, to name a few.
The orchids that need to be moist during active growth, but nearly dry between waterings are the ones like Cattleya, Oncidium, Brassia, Dendrobium.
For some orchids you will need to allow them to dry out between waterings. These include Phalaenopsis, Vanda, Ascocenda.

, This is only a general guideline, because it really depends on the orchid type. When the orchid is actively growing it can be best to actually fertilize it weekly or bi-weekly. However, you want to make sure that you're watering it without fertilizing at least once a month so that the water can flush excess fertilizer salts.Avoid fertilizing too frequently. If you do this you're going to overwhelm the plant and have an adverse effect on its growth, especially during its dormant periods.
Some orchids don’t need fertilizer at all. In fact many orchids are perfectly happy to bloom year after year without any fertilizer at all.

, When all the flowers have fallen off, trim the orchid's stem to just above the very lowest node (little triangular etch that is a potential new bloom). Cut diagonally.This will encourage new growth. As long as you keep watering weekly you should be able to see new flowerings appear.

, A good way to determine whether or not your orchid needs to be re-potted is simply by checking its growth. If an otherwise healthy orchid does not bloom even if the levels of light, temperature, and humidity are all sufficient, you may need to re-pot it. Avoid repotting when it is in bloom.Select a pot size based on the size of the root mass, so you won't necessarily be repotting into a bigger pot. Orchids like being a little tight in their pots and a too-large pot will make them not yield as much foliage or flowers. Choose a new pot, new potting mix and transfer the orchid over.
Orchids that require annual repotting are: Dendrobium, Miltonia, Paphiopedilum and Phalaenopsis and their hybrids.
Orchids that require every other year repotting are: Cattleya, Dendrobium, Oncidium, Odontoglossum and their hybrids.
Orchids that require every third year repotting are: Vanda and its allies, and Cymbidium.

Deal with an orchid that won’t bloom.,
Care for an orchid with limp leaves.,
Deal with pests.",How to Care for an Orchid Indoors3," There are a few different reasons why an orchid might not be blooming. The most common reason is that it doesn't have the right light level, so make sure that you check that first. You can look at the color of the leaves. Leaves should be medium-green. If they are a dark, lush green,the plant is likely not getting enough light. If that isn't it, there are a few more things to consider.The orchid might simply be too young. Plants have to be mature enough to bloom and then only during their natural cycle.
Your orchid might be overpotted. For best results with orchids, you'll need to make sure that they are tight in their pots. Pots that are too big for the root mass put the orchid in danger of not growing or blooming.
Another problem could be that you're using the wrong fertilizer. Orchids typically aren't heavy feeders, but will try to absorb as many nutrients as they can. One particular problem could be too much nitrogen, which suppresses blooming. You want a nitrogen ratio in your fertilizer of 3:1:3 or 4:1:4.

, If you're dealing with limp leaves you will want to unpot the orchid and check the root system. If the roots are mushy then a significant root loss has occurred and there are several likely culprits.Overwatering can do this. You can safely water an orchid about once a week, depending on the type and only as long as they are healthy and potted properly. Check the mix to see if it is drying out properly before you re-water.
The pot is too large. This can also cause problems with your orchid's roots, because they are expending too much energy trying to maintain their root system rather than caring for leaves and new flowers.
Potting mix has degraded. Potting mixes are only good for a certain amount of time before they need to be replaced. Make sure yours hasn't gone past its deadline.

, While pests are less likely in an indoors orchid, you can still get them in potting mixes and just out of nowhere. Make sure you know how to deal with these nuisances so you can keep your orchid alive and healthy.Aphids target bloom spikes and buds so if you see holes in these areas you might have aphids. Fortunately most insecticides will control these little nuisances.
Snails and slugs can get into the potting mixes, so make sure you check the mixes that you're putting your orchid in. They tend to chew on the roots, or on leaves and stems. Again, insecticides can usually take care of this problem, or getting a new potting mix.
If your young leaves are getting discolored, and white masses are appearing on your orchid, then you probably have mealybugs. Use insecticides or remedies that contain an oil of some sort because this coats and suffocates the bug. It's also a good idea to repot the plant once you've eradicated the menace.
For a home-made insecticide you should mix 9/10 quart of warm water, 1/10 quart of rubbing alcohol, 1 tsp of lightweight oil (Neem Oil is an excellent choice), a few drops of gentle dishwashing detergent. Mix these in a spray bottle and shake vigorously (make sure the cap is on). Spray the orchids.

Cultivate the soil via your preferred method.,
Add your choice of organic matter to your organic garden plot.,
Ensure that there is adequate space for all of your plants.",How to Prepare Soil for an Organic Garden," This provides a number of benefits for your plants, including drainage, proper root movement to obtain the necessary water and nutrients, and aeration. Properly aerated soil ensures that roots obtain the oxygen needed to thrive.


Ensure the soil is not too dry. If it is too dry, it will not only appear dry but also be brittle or hard to the touch. Water the ground well and return the next day to check it again.
Ensure the soil is not too wet. Obvious signs include instances in which the ground is flooded is muddy.
Remove weeds and debris. Tilling under green matter will require waiting about a month until planting.
Pay a local farmer to cultivate a large garden, or use a rotary tiller to turn the soil.;
, While plants need sunshine and water to survive, they also need the vitamins and minerals provided by decomposing organisms to thrive.


Place a layer of organic compost over the entire area. Approximately 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of compost, worked into the first 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of soil is one of the most commonly used methods to prepare organic soil.
Request leaf mold from the town leaf dump, if available. The leaves should be decomposed, as fresh leaves will harm your organic garden.
Ask a local farmer for manure. Most family farmers will gladly offer it for free, particularly if you do the work to obtain it. Use only aged manure or it may burn your plants. If only fresh manure is available, compost it for at least 6 months before applying.
Raise your own organic matter by planting buckwheat, hairy vetch, or rye. Either compost these or turn them under, waiting a month before planting.

, Planting too close together can drastically increase the susceptibility to illness of your fruits and vegetables, as well as reduce their productivity in general as they fight for the same resources.


Stake or cage tomato plants to prevent them from touching the soil.
Follow the recommendations on the seed packets or purchased plants as to spacing.
Transplant to another area if seedlings grow too close together.

Warm the soil.,
Test the soil's pH level.,
Evaluate the nutrients in the soil.,
Add compost.",How to Prepare Garden Soil for Tomatoes,"


The first step to prepping garden soil for tomatoes is to warm up the soil. Tomatoes grow well in warm soil. Once the temperature of the air starts to rise, it will still take the dirt a while to warm. You can help the warming process along by covering your soil with black plastic to help absorb the sun's heat. Secure the plastic using rocks, bricks or anything else that is heavy and sturdy.;
,


You can purchase a soil test kit at any garden store. Test your soil according to the test directions. The lower the number you get, the more acidic your soil is, with 7.0 being neutral. Tomatoes will grow best in soil that is just slightly acidic with a pH level at about 6.0 to 7.0. You can adjust your soil's pH if needed. If it is too high, mix some sulfur into the soil. If the pH is too low, add lime to the soil.

,


The test should also tell you the nutrient and chemical makeup of the soil. Your soil should have a good balance of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus to yield good tomatoes.
Nitrogen will help your tomatoes grow healthy leaves. Tomatoes with yellowed leaves may have a nitrogen deficiency. If your soil is lacking nitrogen, you can add more with fertilizer. Organic sources of nitrogen include: alfalfa meal, compost, fish meal, feather meal and leaf mold. Some inorganic sources are: ammonium sulfate, anhydrous ammonia, calcium nitrate and sodium nitrate.
Potassium aids in disease resistance and helps the tomatoes grow. A deficiency in potassium may result in slower growth and weakened plants. If your soil needs potassium, you can use wood ash, granite dust, rock sand or potassium sulfate to boost the potassium level.
Phosphorus will help the tomatoes' roots and seed formation. Soil that lacks enough phosphorus can produce tomatoes that have reddened stems and stunted growth. If your test results show that you need more phosphorus, you can add some by adding bone meal, compost, super phosphate or rock phosphate to your soil.

,


Compost is a great way to improve gardening soil. It helps to improve the structure, cultivability and nutrition retention. It also attracts earthworms and increase microbes. Compost is made up of broken down organic matter. You can purchase some in a gardening store or you can make your own using yard clippings, leaves and fruit and vegetable wastes.

Wait until the plants in your garden have grown to a height of 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) before placing organic mulch in the garden.
Spread organic mulch in the garden before the weather becomes hot.;
, Use materials such as leaves, straw, sawdust, pine needles or compost as organic mulch. Grass, wood chips and peat moss also can be used as organic mulch.

, Remove all of the weeds from the garden. Ensure that you pull the roots of the weeds out of the ground.

, Use a garden hose to soak the garden thoroughly with water.

,


Place the mulch in between the plants in the garden.
Place enough mulch around the plants so that the ground is thoroughly covered.
Apply a thick enough layer of mulch so that light cannot penetrate into the ground beneath the mulch.

, Use a garden hoe or tiller to turn up the soil of the garden.

, Use a garden hose to soak the garden thoroughly with water.

,


Lay the cardboard, paper or plastic in rows in the garden.
Bend and bury the ends of each piece of cardboard, paper or plastic in the ground. Burying the ends of the material will secure the mulch.

,


Use scissors or a knife to cut holes or slits into the mulch where you will place your plants or seeds in the ground.
Use a garden trowel to hollow out areas in the ground beneath the holes or slits for your plants or seeds.
Cut extra slits into the mulch to allow water to reach the ground beneath the mulch.
Place your plants or seeds into the hollowed-out ground beneath the holes or slits.
Cover the seeds or the roots of the plants with dirt.
Water the plants or seeds thoroughly.

"
Fence in the composting area.,
Start a pile for composting.,
Purchase a compost bin.,
Dig a composting trench.",How to Prepare Garden Compost1," Determine how big you want your composting area to be and dig holes at the four corners of that square area. Insert 2x4's of solid wood into the holes and fill the holes in with tightly packed soil. Fence in the area by building sides out of wood (preferably a weather-resistant wood such as redwood), leaving at least a 1/2 inch (approximately 1.25 cm) between the boards for aeration.


Your composting pile should be at least 3 ft by 3 ft by 3 ft (approximately 91 cm by 91 cm by 91 cm) for the decomposition process to take effect properly.A sealed compost bin can be placed inside the fenced in area, or a compost pile can be made directly inside of it.;
, Start building on bare soil to allow organisms like worms to aerate the compost. Make a bed of straw or twigs as a base (a few inches thick) to allow for drainage and air flow. Prepare covering for your compost pile, such a plastic sheeting or wood., Composting bins are used to collect and store compost ingredients in a secure and sanitary way. If you do not wish to build your own compost bin, purchase one from a hardware store or online. You can also contact your local government office to see if your municipality has a program in place to provide citizens with composting bins, or sell them to them.Choose between a stationery model and a tumbler, which will allow you to turn the composting materials easily.

, To prepare garden compost without unsightly bins or piles, dig a trench in your garden approximately 12 inches (approximately 30 cm) deep. Fill it halfway with your kitchen scraps, then cover the rest with soil. Trenches can be placed between plants, along shrub borders, or virtually anywhere else in the garden.Composting trenches should be moved to different locations in your garden every year.

"
Add nitrogen compounds.,
Include carbon compounds.,
Cut up your composting material to make it decompose faster.,
Water the compost pile.,
Mix up the matter.,
Check for heat.",How to Prepare Garden Compost2," An integral part of the composting process are the green materials which also known as nitrogen compounds. Add scraps like raw vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, cut grass, and crushed egg shells to your compost receptacle. Avoid adding meat, bones, or fish scraps to your compost as they will attract pests or rodents., Dry, brown materials combine with green nitrogen compounds to form the base contents of garden compost. These include cardboard (e.g. cereal boxes paper towel rolls, newspaper, hedge clippings, twigs, sawdust, wood shavings and old leaves. Mix the nitrogen and carbon compounds as evenly as possible, but have a greater concentration of brown materials for the best results (approximately 2:1)., To accelerate the composting process, cut all the scraps to be included in it into the smallest possible pieces. Twigs and branches should be clipped into small parts, eggshells should be crushed, cardboard should be shredded, and fruit and vegetable scraps should be cut up as finely as they can be., Water the compost pile as needed to keep it moist. As a general rule, the materials should be damp and not overly wet. If you live in a rainy climate, cover your compost area with a tarp or plastic sheeting to prevent it from becoming waterlogged., If you do not have a compost tumbler, use a shovel or garden fork to mix the contents of the compost bin thoroughly. Move contents from the bottom to the top and vice versa. This aids in the decomposition rate by adding oxygen, the last ingredient needed to compost., After the first few days of adding compost ingredients, the pile should heat up as a result of the decomposition process. This heat will subside when the process is done and the compost is ready. Use a thermometer or simply reach into the middle of the compost pile with your hand to test how warm it is.


When the compost is done ""cooking"" and cools down, it will be ready to use.

Incorporate 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.52 cm) of mulch into the garden dirt.,
Break up large dirt clumps in the garden.",How to Prepare Dirt for a Garden,"


Determine the type of dirt in your garden with a home testing kit or by sending a soil sample to an agricultural lab. Figuring out the pH levels of your soil can help you ascertain what type of plants will thrive in your soil as well as the kinds of additives you should consider when preparing your garden.;
,


Pull out all weeds before adding anything to the garden soil. Make sure to grab each weed as close to the root as possible and tug upward rapidly to unearth it. Weeding is important to perform both in the fall to prepare your soil for planting later as well as during the spring when your plants are growing.

,


Choose manure that has been sterilized. You can purchase this type of manure from agricultural outlets and most home improvement store garden departments.
Spread a thin layer of manure atop the garden dirt and till it with a gardening fork. Adding manure in the fall is better than the spring because the chemicals in the manure can be too harsh on growing plants. If added to the soil before planting, the manure has a chance to fade as it enriches the soil over the winter.

,


Add a couple inches of composted material in with the soil. If you have your own compost pile, use the material from the bottom to add into the garden. Compost taken from the bottom is the most decomposed and highest in nutrients.
Pick up compost from your city or township if your locality offers composting services to residents.

,, Scatter this material on top of the soil. You can mix it in, but it is not necessary.

,


Buy mulch from a local garden center. Mulch can be purchased in large bags. It is a substance that conserves moisture and prevents erosion. It is usually the last layer on top of garden soil.

,


Fork over the soil to burst apart any clumps of dirt. Tilling the soil in this manner promotes aeration and prevents the dirt from drying out.

Put up barriers around the plot, if needed.",How to Prepare a Garden Plot," Vegetables and flowers require at least six hours of full, continuous sunlight a day to thrive. Find a spot in your yard where there is a lot of direct sun for the majority of the day.You will want the plants to face south so they can get as much sun as possible. Make sure there are no obstructions like fences, posts, or trees blocking sunlight from the south.;
, The garden plot should be on flat, even ground. This will ensure water is evenly dispersed in the plot and every grows evenly.


If you have to choose a spot that is sloped, you will need to terrace the beds by building them up with boards, flat rocks, or wood slabs.Make sure the spot is at least ten feet from trees and shrubs. You do not want the roots of trees or shrubs to get into the garden plot, as this can disrupt the plants. The shade of trees and tall shrubs can also negatively the garden plot.

, Raised beds are boxed in wood above the ground. Raised beds are good for colder climates because the soil warms up faster in spring and you can plant sooner. This type of garden bed usually results in a higher yield of crops, especially vegetables.You can buy raised beds made of cedar or recycled plastic at your local hardware store.
You can also build your own raised garden beds.

, In-ground beds are more common than raised beds and are ideal for warmer climates. In-ground beds require less watering than raised beds. They also do not cost anything but they do require you to bend down to weed and maintain.In-ground beds are more susceptible to weeds and pests than raised garden beds. They also usually yield less crops.

, Usually a garden plot will have several beds. Multiple beds allows you to grow several different plants in one plot. You can then rotate the different beds to have healthy crops every year. A smaller plot of 100-200 square feet can fit four to six beds. A larger plot can fit eight to ten beds.The beds should be 4 feet or less wide so they are easy to weed and tend. You should also include 21 inch (53 cm) pathways between the beds so you can roll a wheelbarrow through it.
If you buy a raised garden bed box, you may not need to worry about having a pathway between the beds. Instead, make sure you place the boxes with enough space between them to walk through.

, If you are putting the garden plot in your yard, you will likely need to remove existing top soil and grass. Slice under the sod with a spade and cut it into small handfuls. Then, take off the sod and put it in your compost or use it to patch up bare spots in your yard., Use a weed whacker or your hands. Look for common weeds like Japanese knotweed, bindweed, couch grass, and ground elder.You should also remove any surface garbage in the plot. Dig out any inorganic matter in the plot like bottle caps, plastic, or newspaper.

, Use string and stakes to mark where the plot is going to be in your yard. This will make it easy for you to clear the area to prepare the plot for planting. Put stakes on each corner of the plot and attach string to each stake.

, Having the soil tested will ensure the soil has the right balance of pH and nutrients to grow plants well. You can use a home testing kit to test the soil. You can find home testing kits at your local hardware store.You can send a sample of the soil to your local cooperative extension service or bring it to a garden center for testing.

, Use a pickaxe or a pitchfork to double dig the soil so the new garden beds grow well. Dig to a depth of 12 to 18 inches (31 to 45 cm). Remove rocks and roots in the plot., Depending on the pH of the soil, you will need to add organic matter to improve the soil’s fertility. Add organic matter like compost, animal manure, plant manure, and sea soil to adjust the pH so the plants grow well in the plot.Layer 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of organic matter over the plot. Dig or hoe the organic matter into the top 6 inches (15 cm) of the soil so it reaches the root systems of the plants.

, Use a garden fork or a rototiller to turn the soil once more. Break up any large chunks of soil and get rid of any stray rocks or roots. Turn the soil when the it is dry and not too wet. It should crumble easily when squeezed in your hand.

, Once the soil has been turned, it is prepared and ready for planting. If you are planting tall vegetables or plants like tomatoes and cucumbers, you will need to put up barriers around the plot to protect them from wind. Use fencing panels, hurdles, or a hedge to protect the plot."

Sample the soil makeup.,
Test for nutrients.,
Evaluate how wet the soil is.",How to Prepare Soil for a Garden1," Use a shovel to dig into the soil, and grab a handful of it. See what the soil seems to be made up of. It might be sandy or have a lot of clay, or it may be good rich dirt. Soil with too much sand or clay will not usually grow garden plants very well.


The soil should feel fluffy, like it is full of air, because this means it gets plenty of oxygen.
This is also a good time to see if there are lots of worms and insects in the soil, as this usually means the soil is fairly rich.
Depending on what the soil is like in your area, you can add soil amendments later to get it to the proper makeup.
Generally, dark brown or nearly black soil is best because it tends to mean the soil has a lot of decomposing organic matter and is rich in nutrients. Pale brown or nearly yellow soil tends to be less nutrient rich.
You can get a better understanding of the makeup of your soil by taking samples from several places. Place the samples in a mason jar and mix them together. When the soil settles, you'll be able to better see the soil's makeup.;
, For the best results, take a sample of the soil to a garden store or county extension office so they can test it to see what nutrients are lacking, and see what the pH level is. You can also buy a home test kit, but this will not be quite as thorough.Ideal pH for most vegetable plants is around 6.0-7.5.Adding lime is a common way to adjust the pH of soil, but it is a long process that take about six months to fully take effect in the soil.
You can make up for other lacking nutrients with fertilizer and compost, which will be discussed more later.

, When you are first starting a garden, especially if you’re starting it at the beginning of Spring, you need to wait until the soil has dried out enough. If you squeeze a handful of the soil and it stays packed together, it’s probably still too wet.You can perform this test once a week or so until the soil is dry enough to begin garden preparation.
Soil that has a high clay content will pack more, but this does not necessarily mean the soil is too wet.

Use fallen leaves for organic gardening.,
Use bark, shredded wood or wood chips to prevent weed growth.,
Avoid grass clippings in your vegetable garden.,
Use crushed stones for xeriscaping.,
Try river rock in windy and forest fire prone regions.,
Choose rubber mulch for playgrounds.",How to Pick the Right Mulch1," Leaves are by far the best type of mulch for organic gardens, by virtue of the fact that they improve soil health as they compost into your garden soil, allow water to get through, and prevent weeds from popping up. They are also freely available if you have deciduous trees in your backyard. If you do not have any deciduous trees in your yard, you can always ask your neighbor for a bag of fallen leaves in the fall., If you are making a pathway in your garden and want to prevent weed growth, you can try wood chips or shredded wood. These mulch types will do a pretty good job stopping weeds and are quite cheap or even freely available. They decompose more slowly than other types of organic mulch, so you don’t need to replace the mulch as frequently. The downside is that they may compact the soil, since they are a little heavier.Bark and wood chips are typically low in nitrogen, which can result in a nitrogen deficiency in your garden. As a result, you may have to add more fertilizer to your garden, which could be costly.Bark tends to be low in nutrients and high in toxins, so it is not a great choice for improving soil quality.Wood chips are somewhat superior to bark in terms of improving soil quality., Grass clippings tend to get clumped together quite tightly, which will reduce air circulation to your garden soil. Also, they provide benefits to your lawn soil, so it is best to leave them where they are., If you are doing xeriscaping to conserve water in your backyard or making a rock garden, crushed stones are a great option. They let water into your soil and reduce the amount of grass in your backyard, which will reduce your overall water consumption., If you live in an especially windy area that is prone to forest fires, river rock is a great option. It does not blow away and is a good home landscaping strategy in these kinds of regions., If you need to cover your backyard playground area, rubber mulch offers the advantage of softening falls. It is typically made from recycled tires. The disadvantage is that it may smell a bit on hot summer days and could get tracked into the house. Choose a reputable manufacturer to avoid overly smelly or even toxic products."

Stake off the perimeter of your garden.,
Dig up the top couple of inches of sod.,
Turn over the soil using a shovel or motor driven rotary tiller.",How to Prepare Soil for a Garden2," Before you start digging, make a decision about the size and shape you want the garden to be. If it will be three or more rows, make sure you account for extra space to walk between the rows. For only two rows, you can tend the garden from the outside of each row.


Stick four stakes into the ground to form the rectangle of the garden plot.

, You need to use a shovel to slice up under any grass, moss, or weeds that are currently growing where you have planned your garden. Make sure to dig deep enough to get weeds out at their root. You may want to go about four inches deep for this step.All of this can go to the compost pile for later use, but shouldn't be incorporated back into the soil until it has composted.You may also want a bin ready just for composting this layer outside of other composts you might have.
If you have a tiller, you don't have to dig up the existing plants; instead, till in whatever is currently growing. After you till, you should be able to remove the plants, roots and all, from the broken up soil. This is better for the soil because the remaining dead plants and roots will break down and contribute organic matter to your soil.

, For new plots, you’ll want to turn the soil over about 12-18 inches deep. You may want to dig that deep into the soil with a shovel, and then go over the plot a second time with a tiller to break the soil up.As you dig through the soil, remove any large stones, along with any roots or debris (eg, bits of metal, plastic etc) you encounter. You may need to make more than one pass to break up very compacted soils.
This may be the most time consuming part of the project, especially if you end up finding a lot of rocks or other debris. It’s good to have a garbage can nearby in which you can throw anything you find in the soil.

"
"
Add lime or sulfur if necessary.,
Add other soil amendments as necessary.,
Add organic matter to the soil at a ratio of 1:1.,
Turn the soil over again with shovel or tiller.,
Rake the soil smooth.,
Create rows.",How to Prepare Soil for a Garden3," Soil pH is one of the most important aspects to healthy soil that will grow healthy plants. Since you tested the soil earlier, make sure to use this information. Lime will help raise the pH level if it is too low, while sulfur will help lower it if the pH is too high.A garden center will help you figure out the exact amount of lime you need for your garden. It depends on how large the garden is and how much you need to change the pH. Spreading lime requires a specific method, so don’t assume you just throw some on the soil.
You’ll also want to seek guidance regarding sulfur use that is specific to your garden’s needs.

, When you check the soil composition and have it tested, you can find out if you need to add sand, clay, or other topsoil to make the soil the best possible mixture for your garden. This is something that a garden center can be exceptionally helpful for.Base any amendments on the results of your soil test.
You don’t want to overdo it with adding sand or clay, so try to add a little at a time to even out the overall texture of the soil.
You may want to add gypsum or perlite which help to aerate the soil if your test reveals low oxygen content.
Sphagnum peat moss is a helpful amendment if you can tell the soil is pretty dry as it helps retain moisture and slowly release it into the soil.
You may need to add some basic fertilizer which can help balance the nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which are all vital to healthy plant growth.

, This means, try to add as much organic matter as you can so the top layer of your garden is half the soil that was already there and half added organic matter.Organic matter can include shredded brown and green leaves, horse manure, wood chips, or compost, such as fruit and vegetable scraps. You don’t not need to add organic matter to the entire 12-18 inches you previously dug, but add it to the top 6-8 inches.
Do not add meat, fish, or dairy as organic matter into the soil. Likewise, if you choose to maintain a compost bin or pile, never add these types of scraps to it.

, Since you have added multiple materials to the soil, you want to make sure it is all mixed through the soil evenly. This may take going over the entire garden plot 2-3 times to ensure that it seems mixed thoroughly.


Don't mix your compost in too deeply. Till the soil lightly to mix the materials into the top few inches of soil, where a majority of the plants' feeder roots will be looking for nutrients.
It might be a good idea to lightly water the soil after turning it again so that everything can soak together.

, You want the soil to stay loose, so don’t walk all over the new plot as you rake. If you have included room for walkways between plant rows, you can walk on those areas as you rake. Gently pull the rake over the soil so the whole plot is as even as possible.

, Starting at the end of the area you've marked off for your garden, shovel the soil from your planned rows onto the planting bed. This will raise the beds a little, which helps with drainage and helps warm the soil. You can then line your pathways with newspaper or cardboard and top that with mulch."
"
Choose a spot for the garden that has good exposure to sunlight.,
Avoid root systems.,
Pick a spot with good drainage.",How to Prepare Soil for a Garden4," For the best results in your garden, six hours of sunlight is suggested. So it is best to avoid putting the garden too close to your house or in areas where it will be covered by the shade of a tree.If you have lots of trees, houses nearby, or other things that would block the sun, you may need to pay attention to your yard for a week or so to find the spot that gets sunlight for the longest time each day.

, A tree’s root system can spread far out underground, even if you can’t see the roots. If you try to set your garden up too close to a tree, the root system will cause problems with your plants. Try to go at least 10 feet away from the furthest point out that the branches reach.


As you start to dig later on, you’ll be able to tell if the soil has a lot of tree roots or not. If the spot you chose ends up having too many roots, it may be best to move to a different spot if possible.

, You need to find a balance between a spot that will not hold any water in the in soil, and a spot that will flood every time it rains. Look around your yard for spots where the grass seems to grow best, as these spots probably drain well. Ideally, your garden should be in a flat, even part of the yard.


To find a spot that gets good drainage, wait until a few hours after a heavy rain and then go look around your yard for places where water is pooling. Avoid placing your garden in these spaces.

Purchase mulch in bulk.,
Pick up the mulch yourself.,
Choose cheaper mulches.,
Rake fallen leaves into your garden in the fall.,
Use twigs and small branches to save money.",How to Pick the Right Mulch2," Instead of purchasing mulch by the bag, you should purchase it bulk. Pick up some mulch in bulk from your local garden center or get them to deliver it for you. If you purchase mulch by the bag, it will cost you more money. Of course, small bags of mulch are a little easier to transport. However, you will end up paying a little more for this convenience.For instance, you could save $15 dollars by purchasing a yard of hardwood mulch instead of the equivalent in bags.

, Instead of paying someone for delivery services, you should pick it up yourself. If you or a friend has a pickup truck or a trailer, go and pick up the mulch from a garden center., A nice hardwood mulch will cost you about three times the price of mulch from shredded logs. To save money, choose the cheaper shredded log mulches instead of hardwood, colored or other expensive varieties., Instead of putting your leaves on the curb, you should rake them into your organic vegetable garden. This practice will save you money, since you won’t have to purchase as much organic mulch in the spring. It will also improve the soil quality in your garden., If you live in a rural area and there are a few fallen trees around, you could gather some twigs and small branches. Chop them up and add them to your garden for a cost-effective option. It will cost you some hard work but is otherwise free.Twigs and branches tend to have more nutrients than bark and wood chips, so they may be better for improving soil quality."
"
Try organic mulch covered with vegetable dyes.,
Choose straw.,
Use landscaping fabric with hoses and decorative mulches.",How to Pick the Right Mulch3," If your mulching priorities include adding color to your garden bed, as well as slowing weed growth, improving soil quality and water absorption, you should choose a colored organic mulch. This type of mulch will add a nice earthy red, brown or other color to your garden, as well as a nice, soft texture. It is easier to spread this mulch around plants because of the fine texture, in contrast to wood chips or shredded wood. The dye will fade eventually, so you will need to add another layer at the start of the next gardening season.

, Straw is a nice choice for mulching because it adds contrast to your garden. It is also easy to spread around small plants, since it has a fine texture in comparison to wood chips. It is a good choice for organic gardening. However, you should keep in mind that it needs to be replaced more frequently than wood chips or bark mulches.You should avoid using hay, which is similar to straw but contains seeds which may just produce more weeds.
You should avoid hay from areas where roundup is being used, especially if you have an organic garden. You don’t want to get pesticides into your garden inadvertently.
You should avoid hay from ryegrass because it has toxins that can harm your plants.

, You can use landscaping fabric in vegetable gardens, but you should take precautions such as placing hoses underneath and adding a decorative mulch on top. Since landscaping fabric does not let water through very well, placing perforated hoses underneath will improve soil hydration. And since it is doesn’t look great, you will want to add another layer of colorful mulch on top. If you use this system, landscaping fabric can be a good option.For instance, you could put a colored organic mulch on top.

Rake up pine needles for your mulch.,
Repurpose shredded paper.,
Mulch in summer and winter.,
Remove old winter mulch.,
Pull out weeds.,
Add several inches of mulch to your gardens.,
Make a well around the base of the plants.",How to Make Mulch," Many homes have leafy trees and plants that provide a great mulch source, and leaf mulch is a good all-purpose mulch for your garden. You can either gather leaves by raking up ones that fall in the autumn, or collect the leaves that you prune off plants.

Avoid using the leaves from walnut and eucalyptus trees, as these can prevent other plants from growing.;
, Use a rake or leaf blower to amass all your leaves into a large pile. To prevent damage to the lawnmower blades, pile the leaves on a flat section of lawn. Spread the leaves out into a layer that’s no more than 2 inches (5 cm) thick.


Use a shovel and wheelbarrow to collect all the leaves if you don’t have a rake or leaf blower.

, Once the leaves are all piled together in a thin layer, turn on your lawnmower and mow over the pile a few times to chop the leaves into smaller pieces. Continue shredding until the pieces are dime-sized.Shredding the leaves will help them to decompose in the garden, and this will provide the soil with nutrients.
You can also use an electric leaf shredder to chop the leaves. Use hedge trimmers to manually shred the leaves if you don’t have anything else.

, Once the leaves have been shredded, they're ready to use as mulch in the garden. Extra mulch can be stored in a ventilated barrel, a large bag with air holes, or spread out on a tarp and covered from the elements.

Once the leaf mulch is ready, you can also combine it with other mulch materials from around the yard.
The longer the mulch is stored, the more nutrients it will lose.

, Wood also makes great mulch, and you can make wood or bark mulch from organic matter from around the yard. Go around your house and collect fallen branches, bark, or tree trimmings that you pruned from your plants. Put on safety glasses and process the wood and bark through a wood chipper to make a mulch.Bark and wood mulch can be used on its own or combined with leaf mulch.
Wood mulch is ideal for established gardens and plants, but shouldn’t be used with young plants.You can rent a wood chipper from a hardware store if you don’t have one of your own.

, Grass clippings make an ideal addition to leaf mulch, though they aren't as effective when used alone. After mowing your lawn, rake up the grass clippings.Mix the clippings in with the leaf mulch and use a spade or pitchfork to mix them together.

If your mower has a bag to collect grass, simply pour the contents of the bag into the leaf mulch when you're done.

, Like grass clippings, fallen pine needles can also be mixed with leaf mulch. Pine mulch is best used with acid-loving plants.Rake up needles from around your yard and combine them with the leaf mulch using a shovel or pitchfork., Newspaper and other types of paper from around the house can also be recycled and turned into mulch.Collect the paper and use an electric shredder or scissors to shred the paper into small pieces. Combine the paper shreds with the leaf mulch and use as normal., In summer, mulch will help your gardens retain moisture and keep the roots cool. In winter, the mulch will protect the plants from frost and help to keep the soil warm. Summer mulches will decay over time, but winter mulch should be removed in spring.Ideal summer mulches include leaf mulch, leaf mulch mixtures, and compost.
Ideal winter mulches include pine needles, straw, and bark.

, In the spring when you start gardening again, remove the winter mulch that protected the gardens during colder weather. You can add the removed mulch to your compost pile.

Winter mulches don’t decompose as quickly as summer mulches, so it’s important to remove them in summer so you can add more nutrient-rich mulches to the soil., Before adding mulch to the garden, go around and pull out all the weeds you find in the bed. Otherwise, the mulch will protect the weeds and allow them to thrive. This will also create unwanted competition for the plants you're actually trying to grow., Apply the mulch after you’ve finished planting in spring, or when you finish preparing the garden for winter. Use a shovel or rake to spread a 2- to 6-inch (5- to 15-cm) layer of mulch over the garden bed:In shadier areas, use 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) of mulch
In sunny areas, use 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10 cm) of mulch
In really hot and sunny areas, use up to 6 inches (15 cm) of mulch.

, After you spread the mulch out over the garden bed, use your hand or a spade to pull the mulch away from the base of the plants. This is especially important in shady areas, because it will protect the plants from mold, rot, and insects.

Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between the mulch and the base of the plants, or enough room so the mulch isn't touching the plants."

Mulch vegetable gardens with grass and lawn clippings.,
Use leaves to prevent weeds.,
Choose wood chip mulch for its pleasant appearance..,
Try plastic mulch to warm the soil and avoid decomposition.,
Spread pebbles and gravel around desert climate plants and xeriscapes.,
Layer black-and-white newspaper to stop weeds.,
Use pine straw to promote acidic conditions.,
Choose sand for plants that need fast-draining soils.,
Cover the ground with straw if you’re looking for a cheaper option.",How to Make the Most of Mulch1," These nutrient rich materials are especially beneficial to vegetable gardeners,but the downside is that they decompose quickly and are not very good at keeping out weeds. Lawn clippings should be used in conjunction with newspapers where weed prevention is needed.;
, Leaf mulch works well for keeping out weeds initially but after the leaves start to decompose, they may lose some of their effectiveness. Therefore, it’s a good idea to add newspaper under leaf mulches.


Consider running the leaves through a lawn mower a few times before using them as a mulch because this makes them easier to handle and less likely to form impenetrable clumps.

, Widely considered to be one of the more aesthetically appealing options available, woodchips can be found at a number of retailers. While this biodegradable material does eventually decompose, it won’t vanish as fast as grass clippings, newspapers, or leaves.Those who plan on using woodchips in their gardens should take care to get the untreated kinds, because otherwise the dangerous chemicals on them could leach into your vegetation.

, This mulch is useful for vegetable gardeners because it warms the soil quickly and does not decompose. A number of colorful plastic mulches are available and each one serves a specific purpose in the garden. Those who are concerned about the environment should look for the biodegradable types, but even those plastics do not disintegrate with any rapidity.

, If not confined in some fashion, these lightweight stones tend to migrate. They do, however, allow water to drain and make good pathway markers in your yard. The stones also absorb heat and make a good mulch for desert climate plants and xeriscapes.


However, gravel and pebbled areas can be hard to clean and expensive to install.

, When used in layers that are three to six pages deep, ordinary black-and-white newspapers make a good defense against weeds. These lightweight sheets should be dampened with water or sprinkled lightly with soil to keep them from flying all over your yard.


However, colored newspaper should be avoided as a mulch because it may contain potentially toxic chemicals that you most likely don’t want in their yards.

, This inexpensive option works well for acid-loving plants but may not be good for those plants that prefer alkaline conditions. This sort of mulch also tends to migrate from place to place so it should not be used in gardens that have a slope to them.

, Horticultural or washed playground sand makes a relatively inexpensive mulch for Mediterranean herbs, cacti, succulents and other plants that need fast-draining soils and warm growing conditions. It can also be used to mark pathways, but it does tend to migrate.

, This long lasting material is generally cheaper than pebbles or gravel to install. However, it does tend to attract vermin and it is relatively ineffective at keeping out weeds. As with pine straw, straw does tend to move around and does not work well in yards that have a slope to them.

Avoid making mulch from contaminated or diseased materials.,
Apply mulch to a depth of approximately two to four inches.,
Avoid mulching too close to tree trunks.,
Don’t mulch too close to the foundations of your home.,
Prevent the mulch from becoming compacted.,
Refresh the mulch every two to three years.,
Mix the mulch with soil to improve texture and drainage.",How to Make the Most of Mulch2," Mulch should be aged or composted properly to eliminate bacterial and fungal diseases, and to kill weed seeds. If it is not composted properly and has been made from diseased trees, the diseases can be spread to landscape plants. This could be disastrous for your garden.


Not only could the plants be killed but the soil can be contaminated, making it difficult to grow landscape plants in the area. Verticillium wilt, for example, is a common tree disease which also kills shrubs, perennials and annuals. It lives on in the soil for years after the tree or diseased plant material is removed., There is no need to heap a huge layer of mulch over the soil around landscape plants. A depth of 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) of mulch applied in early spring is enough to keep plant roots cool, retain moisture and help reduce weeds. A thicker layer can actually be detrimental as it may suffocate plants.


Shredded bark mulch should never be deeper than 3 inches (7.6 cm) and chunks or chips should never be deeper than 4 inches (10.2 cm).

, Avoid piling mulch too thickly or too closely to tree trunks because this will make them more susceptible to fungal infections. Mulch should be lightly spread about half a foot away from the tree trunk to prevent any illness from occurring.

, Homeowners should avoid using mulch near their home foundations because this can cause termite infestations. One should keep all mulch about a foot away from the sides of their home.

, Organic mulch should not have a high percentage of fine particles. Fine particles of bark can easily become compacted. Once this happens, water will roll off the mulch in rivulets, depriving the plants of moisture.


Compacted mulch will also deprive the plant roots of oxygen which is just as important to them as water. Select shredded bark mulch that is not very finely shredded or bark chunks. A medium grade or chunk size works well.

, Because the mulch is organic, it does break down and must be refreshed, but only every two to three years. When it does need to be refreshed, use a garden fork to fluff up and turn the old mulch over. Add only enough new mulch over the top to bring the total depth back to 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm).

, Mulch mixed into the soil improves soil texture. Mix a 3- to 6-inch depth of aged or composted shredded bark mulch into the top 12 inches (30.5 cm) of clay soil to improve drainage. Mix the same amount into sandy soil to help improve water retention. Always mix it into the soil thoroughly with a rototiller.

Place the compost into a hessian sack. Suspend this sack over a drum of water. Agitate the liquid two to three times on day one then every day or two for a week. It is ready for use after a week of soaking in this manner, or you can hasten the process by stirring it more frequently.
Consider more frequent stirring prior to use. Some gardeners believe that this provides more suspension of the nutrients.In either case, never leave the compost tea brewing for longer than a month., To use the compost tea, decant it into a watering can or a spray bottle/unit. The colour of the compost should be light amber; if it is darker than that, dilute it with water.It can be used safely on all of the garden and is especially useful for plants that have been newly planted or transplanted, sick plants that need a tonic, potted plants during their growth season, lawns, and the vegetable patch.Don't use compost tea in very cold or hot weather conditions. In summer, apply the compost tea in the early morning or afternoon. This is because the plant's stomata are open at these times.It should only be used during the growing season for the plants in question.
Plants such as broadleaf and tree crops have stomata on the underside of their leaves, so you'll need to ensure the entire leaves are covered., If wished, the compost can be resoaked to create more compost tea. You will need to add a little more new, matured compost each time though. When you no longer wish to use the compost that has been soaked, it can serve as mulch or as a soil additive."

,
When you're ready to use the compost tea, allow the liquid to be used to settle for 10 minutes (leave the pump on, just don't stir it), before draining liquid into your sprayer or watering can.",How to Make a Compost Tea4," This means it must have been turned and aerated a lot during its creation. It should have plenty of ""brown"" carbon source materials such as leaves, sawdust and clean cardboard in it.Adding some forest soil also adds beneficial fungi according to Marc Remillard.When digging to aerate, be careful not to harm the hedgehogs.

,, Fill the rest with water.

, Stir this into the compost tea thoroughly. You'll need a little more molasses in cooler weather.

, During this time, stir now and then with a wooden stick. This will bring the compost solids up from the bottom and let them float around the liquid. As well, connect an aquarium pump that has three air stones in it. This will do the trick of maintaining the oxygen levels in the brew.


At this stage, if it is all sounding too complicated, it may help to point out that you can hire/rent commercial brewers if you're still keen. However, the aquarium pump is cheap and pretty easy to set up.

, It should have a sweet odor with only slight mustiness. If it smells unpleasant or too alcoholic, this means that you need to add another air stone to the aquarium pump and some a little bit more of molasses.

Purchase your compost tea.,
Do some reading on the various methods of making aerobic compost tea commercially and the basics of soil microbiology.,
If you're going to buy this extract instead of creating your own basic productions as outlined above, then do some research first before spending your hard-earned money.",How to Make a Compost Tea5," It is possible to purchase compost tea from enthusiastic nurseries and organic gardener gurus with diplomas in organic gardening. Going this far really may not appeal to the average gardener without a diploma in organic gardening and an organic product business to market but if you're keen, here are some of the things to consider.

, They can be quite complicated because, besides the insistence that human pathogens are about to leap out at you every move you make unless a commercial method is fully put in place, there is a belief that different nutrients and protective benefits can be concocted at various temperatures, as a result of different feeds, oxygen concentrations, the initial compost used, and brewing times.Research has shown that aerobic microbes provide the best results.You should understand the methods used commercially to ensure they meet your requirements and make the price worthwhile.


Commercial production of aerobic microbes occurs using rapid oxygen-rich fermentation under controlled conditions.This highly concentrated extract requires dilution before applying to plants.

, Talk to a local nursery that knows about the process and perhaps is even participating in it and ask plenty of questions. Follow the label closely and only keep as long as the label says, in no case beyond 6 months."

Choose a container for your compost.,
Select a location for your indoor composting.,
Drill holes into your container.,
Place your compost bin onto a shallow tray.",How to Make Compost for Houseplants1," You will need an opaque container that has a lid; the capacity should be around 1 to 3 gallons (4 - 11 L). Small metal garbage cans are ideal for this, as are plastic storage bins with lids.;
, You will want to keep your compost bin close to the kitchen, as this will prevent you from having to trek across your home with your vegetable scraps. Placing the bin under your kitchen sink is an option, but a more attractive compost container could be prominently displayed as part of your décor.

, Use an electric drill to create small holes throughout the sides and bottom of your container. These holes will allow fresh oxygen to circulate into the container, which is essential for the aerobic bacteria that drive decomposition.

, Finally, you'll need to position the bin on top of a shallow pan or tray that will collect any excess water that drips out of the holes in the container's bottom.

"
"
Scoop a layer of potting soil into the bin.,
Add your organic scraps to the compost bin.,
Add torn newspaper to your compost bin.,
Turn the compost weekly.,
Monitor the moisture level of your compost.",How to Make Compost for Houseplants2," Begin by adding a few scoops of potting soil to your compost bin - enough to create a layer a few inches (a few cm) deep. Potting soil is helpful for composting indoors because it helps regulate the moisture level of the mixture, which can prevent insect infestation or unpleasant odors.


Do not use soil collected from outdoors instead of potting soil. If you intend to use the finished compost for houseplants, the consistency and drainage ability of the soil will be compromised if you introduce outdoor soil.

, Whenever you can, collect organic scraps for composting. This can include vegetable peels or cores, coffee grounds, dead flowers, grass clippings, and leftover cooked foods like rice. Cut these scraps into small pieces to increase the available surface area for decomposition, and then place them in the bin.

, Each time you add kitchen scraps to the compost pail, you'll need to add a handful of shredded newspaper or cardboard as well. The nitrogen-rich kitchen scraps balance with the carbon-rich newspaper to create a balanced environment for bacteria.

, About once a week, use a small trowel or other tool to mix your compost around. This incorporates fresh oxygen throughout the mixture and keeps the compost from getting too compacted. You can also add a small handful of potting soil each time you do this.

, For decomposition to proceed efficiently, the compost should be moist, but not soaking wet. You can increase the moisture content of your compost by spraying some water into the bin with a spray bottle. Aim for compost that feels like a wrung-out sponge when handled.

"
"
Allow the compost to decompose once the bin is filled.,
Add the finished compost to your houseplant pots.",How to Make Compost for Houseplants3," Once the bin is nearly full, you'll need to stop introducing new scraps and let the compost finish decomposing. You can leave the bin in any location during this process, and you should continue to turn the compost once a week. The compost should be finished in a few months, when it will appear as a uniform, rich, black mixture called humus.

, To work the compost into your houseplants' soil, simply sprinkle a small amount of it onto the top of the soil and then work it into the soil with your fingers.

, Whether making your own by composting or buying some at a store, this is a great way to replace lost soil and nutrients and return to the soil.

, Avoid buying plots and and around hills or other steep inclines. Water will rush down them and wash the nutrients. Plant trees around your lawn to prevent wind erosion.

, This can pollute the soil, and kill needed insects like bees and ladybugs. Use a softer formula like mild soap and water.

, Avoid killing bees or swatting at them, they are not normally aggressive unless threatened. They also pollinate plants so that they can grow.

, If you plant a lot of the same flowers or plants for lots or years conservatively, the nutrients for that plant may have been used up. Switch plants every year or two.

Include plants that bloom in the evening.,
Try plants that become more fragrant at night.,
Include light coloured fragrant flowers.",How to Plant a Moonlight Garden2," Some plants only bloom during the evening and attract nighttime pollinators, such as moths. You should include nighttime bloomers in your moonlight garden because they will add both colour and fragrance to the garden. If possible, purchase night blooming flowers in white or other cool hues. A few night bloomers to consider include:Evening Primrose
Moonflower
Night Phlox
Evening Stock
Night Blooming Cereus
Four O’Clock

, Some flowers that bloom all day become more fragrant in the evening. These flowers will give your moonlight garden a beautiful fragrance and will make walking through your garden in the evening a sensory experience. Some fragrant evening flowers include:Petunias
Japanese Wisteria
Jasmine
Lilies
Honeysuckles

, There are also a variety of flowers that are fragrant throughout the day and come in light colours. These floral varieties are perfect for a moonlight garden. For example, lavender has a cool purple hue and is also extremely fragrant."

Border your garden path with white booms and silver foliage.,
Spread nighttime plants throughout your garden.,
Try a climbing plant to give a backdrop.,
Add a water feature for moonlight reflections.,
Use white pots and planters.",How to Plant a Moonlight Garden3," One way to use nighttime foliage is to border your garden beds and garden paths. This way, the white flowers and bright foliage will help light your way through the garden in the evening., For the best effect, you want to spread out your nighttime plants. Try not to confine them to one section of the garden or one garden bed. This area will look monochrome and washed out during the day and will not have as impressive of an effect in the evening.For example, you could plant a rose garden with a variety of different colours. Include some white as well. These ones will stand out at night, giving a pop of colour to an otherwise dark garden.

, You can also use nighttime plants to give depth and texture to your garden. For example, try planting a white flowering vine that can climb up the side of your house or fence. Use a trellis of jasmine as a backdrop for colourful flowers. This will look appealing during the day and at night., Water features, such as small ponds, will reflect the moonlight and the white flowers found within your moonlight garden. This reflection will provide additional light and will make your moonlight garden stand out., You can also use white planters and pots to add more brightness and light to your moonlight garden. You can fill these pots with cool hued flowers or silver foliage."

Select a sunny area.,
Check for buried utility lines.,
Mark off the area.,
Kill existing vegetation.,
Cover the area in newspaper.,
Assess the soil that you have to work with.,
Adjust your soil’s pH.,
Turn the soil.,
Fill the area in with organic matter.,
Rake the surface.,
Apply a thick layer of mulch once the bed is planted.,
Opt for a raised bed if your soil will be difficult to maintain.",How to Prepare a New Garden Bed," If you have a lot of land options, you can select the vegetables you want to grow and find the perfect spot. If you are limited with land, then the spot will determine what will grow there. Ideally, you should opt for a location that is sunny for at least six hours a day. Evaluate your options and select your crops accordingly.Your location in the world also determines the type of plants and/or vegetables you will grow. Look for plants that are ideal for your climate.;
, Once you have chosen a spot, make sure it can be used. It would not be fun to have your freshly planted garden dug up by your county. Look to see if there are any buried utility lines underneath the area. There should be a phone number available to check for the location of utility lines in your area. If not, call your local government to ask for the location of the utility lines.You should also ask about irrigation lines.

, Once you have made sure the area can be used, mark off the exact location of the bed. Spend some time planning the exact dimensions of your garden bed. Consider how much you will be planting, and how much space the plants will need. Then, go to your local hardware store and purchase paint that is made specifically for painting lines on the ground. Use the paint to mark of the location of the garden bed.You can also use cans of spray chalk, but paint usually holds up better with moisture.

, You will need to get remove and then kill all of the existing vegetation in the area you have marked off. You should begin doing this during the fall and winter so that the bed is ready by spring. If you have woody material in the area, you will need to remove it with pruners or a chainsaw. Grass and chickweed are easier to handle because they can be mowed. Weeds can be pulled, but there are easier ways to take care of weeds. You can kill the weeds and any other existing vegetation with newspaper., To completely kill the existing vegetation, cover the marked off area in newspaper. The newspaper kills the vegetation by blocking out sunlight. Most newspaper ink should not be harmful to the soil, but make sure not use glossy, slick newspaper that is covered in advertisements. Cover the newspaper with a thick layer of compost. Leave the newspaper until spring.Four or five sheets of newspaper should be enough.

, You will need a combination of mud, sand, and clay. You should be able to squeeze your soil into a ball and then crumble it easily. Soil with too much clay will not crumble, and a soil with too much sand will not squeeze into a ball. To check your soil’s pH, you can test it on your own, or send in a sample to a laboratory.Test the soil’s pH on your own by using a commercial test probe, red cabbage, or with vinegar and baking soda.

, You can do this by adding a few inches of beneficial topsoil to your new vegetable garden. If your existing soil is not capable of growing a healthy vegetable garden, then you will need to mix in some compost and topsoil. Add the mix to the top of your garden a few inches deep, and then mix it into the existing soil.You can amend the acidity or alkalinity of soil by adding limestone or sulfur, depending on what results you are seeking.

, Use a tiller, spade/shovel, or garden fork to turn the soil over. A spade or shovel may be the best to use for a very new and firm bed. The soil should be damp, but not wet when you are working with it. It should break apart, look moist, and not stick to your tools. If the soil is not moist, you can add water with a garden hose. Turn over about twelve inches of soil, though eighteen inches is ideal if you can dig that far.Soil that is too wet will clump when it is turned over.
Soil that is too dry will be difficult to dig into.

, Once the bed has been turned, fill in the area with organic matter or compost. Spread two to three inches over the bed. Then, turn the soil again in order to mix the soil with the compost. Do not use compost that is too fine or has a sand-like consistency because it will break down too quickly. The ideal compost has large chunks and small particles.Organic matter or compost is used to add nutrition and improve soil structure.

, Once you have added the compost, rake the area. Rake the surface until the soil is level. There shouldn’t be any large rocks or branches left in the soil., Once the bed is done and the garden is planted, you can add a layer of mulch or compost. This will keep the weeds from growing in your garden, and it will help the soil retain moisture. It will also keep the area looking neat., If the bed doesn’t work out as planned, you can make a raised bed instead. This is a good option if your soil is too moist and heavy. A raised bed will allow the water to drain well. You can use a wooden border or rocks constructed a few inches high around the parameter of the garden so that the soil is packed securely inside. With a raised garden, you don't have to dig out the area and till the soil first.

Arrange the compost to make an indentation in the top of the pile to hold water.,
Turn the compost regularly to ensure proper air circulation which speeds the decomposition process by encouraging beneficial bacteria and fungi growth.,
Shred or otherwise cut materials into small pieces before placing them on the compost heap whenever possible.,
Learn which items can be composted.,
Add straw, pine needles, grass clippings, or plant cuttings if you notice an unpleasant odor.,
Add dry chopped or mulched leaves or shredded paper to soak up the excess water if the compost pile is soggy.,
Keep a container with a lid and handle under the sink or in the refrigerator.,
Cover any exposed pieces of produce with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of grass clippings to discourage flying insects.

",How to Maintain a Compost Heap," Sprinkle water into the hole with a garden hose when the pile appears dry. It is important to keep the compost pile moist, but not wet because the beneficial organisms that cause the compost to decompose properly cannot survive in a soggy environment.;
, More frequent turning will help if you need to speed up the process or if your compost pile has a strong odor.

, Smaller pieces will decompose more quickly.

, The more items you are able to add to your compost pile, the more compost you will be able to generate. Commonly available items that can be composted include many kitchen wastes, lawn clippings used in thin layers, mulched leaves, disease- and pest-free plants as long as they are not weeds, and shredded paper.

, Aerate the pile well.

, Aerate the pile well.

, Chop or cut large chunks of kitchen waste before adding them to the container. When the container is full, empty it into the compost pile. If you don't generate large amounts of kitchen waste regularly, purchase biodegradable compost pail liners that can be tossed in the compost bin as well to make keeping the container clean much easier.

Establish a soil pH between six and seven.,
Create a small section of acidic soil.,
Use an area with loamy soil.,
Find a sunny location.",How to Plant a Cocktail Garden1," Most herbs, fruits, and vegetables thrive in soil with a pH level between six and seven. Test your soil's pH level using a testing kit, which you can buy online or from a greenhouse. After getting a reading, adjust the soil as necessary.You adjust soil pH by mixing organic materials into the ground. To raise pH, use limestone. To lower it, use sulfur. You can purchase limestone and sulfur in powder or pellet forms and mix this into your soil.
Limestone and sulfur should be mixed in with the top six inches (15.24 centimeters) of your soil. The precise amount you use depends on the soil you're treating, so refer to package instructions.;
, Berries, such as blueberries, are often planted in a cocktail garden.Blueberries thrive in acidic soil with a pH between four and six, so provide a small patch of acidic soil somewhere in your garden to grow berries.Remember, limestone is used to raise soil pH levels, so mix in limestone in a powder or pellet form to raise your soil's pH level., Dig into the ground in various parts of your yard searching for loamy soil. Loamy soil should be easy to dig up. Stay away from areas where the ground is hard. In addition to being easy to dig up, loamy soil holds it shape when squeezed. Pick up a handful of soil and try to squeeze it into a shape when searching for loamy soil. Look for this type of soil in your garden when planting a cocktail garden, as it's ideal for gardening., Most fruits, vegetables, and herbs require plenty of sun to be healthy. When choosing an area for your herb garden, find an area not blocked by shade from tall trees, bushes, or other plants.Most plants need anywhere from six to eight hours of sun exposure a day, so avoid shady areas. Make sure the sun shines down solidly on the area you choose for much of the day."

Clear out an area for your garden.,
Using a shovel, hoe, or a cultivator, break up the ground.,
Dig holes for your plants ahead of time.,
Buy your plants.,
Lay out your plants in your garden while still in the pots - this way you can decide ahead of time what to put where before they're placed in the ground.

,
Plants that grow taller should be placed in the rear of your garden, add them in order of height so your view of all your plants are not obstructed.

,
Roll the potted plants on the ground to loosen the soil.,
If the plants are larger than you'd like, now is the time to divide them.,
Give your plants room to grow.,
Water thoroughly to eliminate any air pockets around the roots.,
Add fertilizer to your plants.",How to Plant a Picture Perfect Garden in Under 30 Days,";
, Add some fertilizer and peat moss to loosen the soil and add nutrients, and mix it in well.

, Always dig a hole that's bigger than the plant's root ball.

, Stores like Home Depot offer a fair selection of plants and flowers at reasonable prices.

,,, (If the soil is dry, water it so it comes out of the pot easily.) Holding your hand on the top of the soil ball, knock out the plant and the roots; gently loosen the roots with your fingers before you place them in the ground.

, Take a sharp clean knife and cut off a section of the plant with attached roots.

, The tag on the plants will tell you the size of the plant when it's fully grown, so leave some space around them so they won't be too crowded.


Once you've placed your plants in the ground, fill in the space around them with fresh soil and tamp down the ground with your foot.

, Be sure to water them daily for a week or so until the roots are established.

, This is especially important for flowering plants. You should soon have a beautiful, radiant garden all your own! You can use water soluble fertilizer that you mix in with the water, or attach directly to your garden hose when you water. There are also timed release fertilizer you mix in with the soil - they will last for an entire season. You can also use plain cow or sheep manure, which is inexpensive and a good all-around fertilizer for all types of plants.

Choose moist soil for basil and mint.,
Choose drier locations for rosemary and sage.,
Plant your seeds with proper spacing.,
Pick a sunny location.,
Water your herbs regularly.,
Harvest your herbs when ready.",How to Plant a Cocktail Garden2," Basil and mint are both used in cocktails and are an excellent addition to a cocktail garden.Both thrive in moist soil, so choose damper areas of your garden to plant them.

Basil tends to do better in soil that is both moist and well-drained.Well-drained soils are usually fairly wet and brownish in appearance.Mint tends to do best in covered soil, so you should cover your soil with a small amount of mulch after planting mint., Rosemary and sage are other herbs frequently used in cocktails and a great addition to a cocktail garden. They do well in loamy soil that is not overly moist. Plant these seeds in areas of the garden with loamy soil, saving the moister parts of the garden for herbs like basil and mint., Herbs need different amounts of space to thrive. When planting your seeds, make sure you give each herb proper spacing.

Basil seeds should be planted 12 to 24 inches apart (about 30 to 60 centimeters).Mint spreads, so only plant one or two mint plants. Keep them about two feet apart (about .6 meter).Rosemary grows in thick hedges, so plant your seeds about three feet apart (about one meter).Sage grows in bushes, so plant your seeds about 24 to 36 inches apart (about 60 to 91 centimeters)., Most herbs benefit from medium to full exposure to the sun.When choosing a location to plant, make sure your herbs have adequate sun exposure so they can thrive.

The amounts of sunlight vary, but most herbs benefit from around six to eight hours of daily sunlight.An area with little shade is optimal for herbs.
Basil can thrive on slightly less sun than other herbs.If you have limited sunny space in your garden, save the sunnier areas for other herbs and plant basil near the shade. If you care for your basil plants otherwise, they should still thrive.

, Sage, rosemary, and basil only require watering when the soil becomes dry to the touch.Monitor the soil of these plants and water as needed. With mint, however, water every day so the soil stays consistently moist., Most of your herbs can be harvested as necessary once they begin to grow. For best taste, harvest herbs just before they begin to flower.

You harvest basil and mint by snipping their stems just before the point where two large leaves meet. Do so just before flowering and harvest as much of the plant as you need.Clip off the pine needle leave portions of rosemary as necessary. Make sure never to clip an entire rosemary stem away.Clip sage in the morning, just after the dew as dried. Take sage leaves as needed, clipping the leaves at the point where two leaves meet."

Start growing cucumbers and tomatoes indoors first.,
Start planting in the spring.,
Plant cucumbers and tomatoes in neutral soil.,
Plant blueberries and watermelons in your acidic soil.,
Provide mulch.,
Water your plants properly.,
Harvest your fruits and vegetables properly.",How to Plant a Cocktail Garden3," Cucumbers and tomatoes should be planted as stalks outdoors. If you're planting cucumbers and tomatoes in your cocktail garden, start off growing them indoors in pots with loamy soil. After a few weeks, you can transport these plants into your garden., The vast majority of fruits and vegetables should be planted in spring, after frost has passed. For the most part, aim to plant your fruits and vegetables in early spring after the frost has passed.Tomatoes, however, are the one exception. If you're growing tomatoes in your cocktail garden, plan to plant them about six to eight weeks before the last frost date. This means you'll be planting your tomatoes a little earlier than your other fruits and vegetables., Cucumbers and tomatoes are both frequently used in cocktails or cocktail mixers and are a great addition to a cocktail garden.These plants tend to do well in pH levels from five to seven.As these levels are closer to a neutral range, plant tomatoes and cucumbers in these areas of your garden. Save the areas with acidic soil for fruits and vegetables that require acidic soil to thrive.

Cucumbers require a lot of space, so make sure to plant seeds between 36 and 60 inches apart (about 91 to 45 centimeters)., Watermelon and blueberries tend to thrive in soils with pH levels between four and six. Therefore, plant your blueberries and watermelons in the small, acidic portion of your garden.Watermelon does better with a slightly higher pH, so try to find a portion of your garden with a pH level hovering around the six range. Watermelon seeds should be spaced around two feet apart (.6 meter).Blueberries thrive better in lower pH levels, between four and five. They should be planted about five feet apart (about 1.5 meter)., Most fruits and vegetables require a layer of mulch kept on the ground nearby. Provide a two to four inch (5 to 10 centimeter) layer of materials like wood chips, sawdust, or pine needles to protect your plants., Regular watering will help your fruits and vegetables grow to maturation. Make sure to water your fruits and vegetables according to their type so they thrive.

Blueberries and tomatoes need two inches of water per week.Watermelon thrives with one to two inches of water per week.Cucumbers should be watered each day in the morning or afternoon., Once fruits and vegetables begin to grow, you can begin harvesting your plants. When you harvest your plants, you can then use the fruits and vegetables in a variety of cocktails.

Watermelons are ripe when they feel hollow when tapped and there is little color contrast between the stripes near the top. Remove watermelon from the branch by cutting it off from the stem with a sharp knife.Harvest cucumbers once they're four to six inches long. You can simply pick cucumbers from the branch to harvest.Tomatoes should remain on the vine as long as possible. For best results, wait for tomatoes to fall on their own and then transport them inside as they fall.Blueberries are usually ready to pick between July and August. Pick the berries a few days after they turn blue."

Tie the two ends of string to the pieces of wood.,
Use the string compass to map out a circle for the alpine wheel.

,
Dig over the alpine wheel area.,
Place the circular object of choice at the center of the wheel.

,
Make the spokes.,
Complete the circle's edge.,
Plant about three alpine plants per division, spaced evenly apart.,
Fill the dirt in neatly around the newly planted plants.,
Place gravel on each division.,
Add pebble or rock features.,
Admire the finished alpine wheel.",How to Plant an Alpine Wheel," The string should be the length that you want the radius of the alpine wheel to be, from its center to one edge. This forms a simple compass, where one stick stays in the center while you pull out the other stick to make the string taut and walk around marking a circle, keeping the string taut at all times. Drop marker rocks or similar to define the circle as you go, or simply draw the circle in the dirt with a stick if the soil allows for this.;
,, Add compost, fertilizer, etc., to improve the soil as you'd do normally. Depending on the plants you're adding, adjust the soil improvers as required.

,, Divide the circle into 8 even divisions. Using the bricks, place them in lines from the center to the circle's edge. Push the bricks down about halfway into the soil, leaving a tiny edge to form a mini wall alongside each division.

, Place a ring of bricks around the outer edge of the circle to define its end. Again, only push about halfway down, leaving the rest sitting up above the soil.

, Or, if you're adding herbs, plant as many as will be suitable for the amount of herbs you have. Go for variety, planting a different kind of plant in each division; it will look more interesting when it has grown.

, Pat down gently. Water as needed.

, Take care not to tip gravel onto the actual plants. If wished, you can skip this step if you don't think it'll help the plants.

, Place interesting pebbles or rocks in and around the plants to add a final touch of interest to the alpine wheel. Don't overdo this; less is usually best.

, Tend to it regularly to prevent weeds from taking over. Keep adequately watered.

Trim, primarily for aesthetics.",How to Plant a Bamboo Fence," The recommended distance from any underground structure is 1.5 ft. This prevents the root from causing any problems.


Always call (811) before any project that involves digging more than 6"" below the ground.
Bamboo typically prefers partial to full sun.
Bamboo needs a similar amount of water as your average lawn grass.
It needs a well drained soil. Avoid swampy places.;
,,


Running bamboo grows quicker and easier, but is likely to spread to undesired areas. Due to this, running bamboo should be potted or surrounded by well built, underground barriers.
Clumping bamboo grows slower but is much easier to control, and therefore the advised choice.

, Bamboo can reach a max height anywhere from 2 ft - 100 ft. Websites and other databases typically provide a maximum growth height for each species.Maximum height is only reached in ideal conditions and after many years. Typically, your bamboo will not reach maximum height, only ~70% of maximum height.

, Bamboo comes in a variety of stem and leaf colors.


In some species of bamboo, leaves turn color in autumn and fall off. Others maintain their leaf color year round.
Different shapes are found in different species. The largest factor in determining the shape is whether it is a clumping or running bamboo, though among each type variation does exist.

, You may wish to search local nurseries or visit an online retailer.

, Younger plants are much cheaper, though will require at least 3 years before they near a mature height. Bamboo plants do not often produce seeds, so this article will focus on using potted plants.

, Understanding how all of these factors come into play for your chosen species can be easier if you look at an example. Here are the necessary details to consider for the bamboo species Fargesia denudata:It is a shade loving species
It is hardy in USDA zones 4-9. Detroit is in zone 6b.
It is a clumping variety, so there is much less worry of spread to neighbors' yards.
It has a maximum height of 15 ft, which means an expected max in Detroit of 6-9 ft
The foliage stays green year round
It is common, and therefore cheap ($20 for 1-3 ft tall plant)

, Younger, shade-loving bamboo are sensitive to strong sunlight. Plant these in spring to allow time to grow.


Recently planted bamboo will fall victim to the summer afternoon sun and bamboo needs time to establish itself before enduring the winter.
In warmer climates, bamboo may be planted in the fall.

, Planting bamboo too close together is not a big issue. For a dense fence using young bamboo, allow 1-3 ft between each potted plant.The hole diameter will be 2x the diameter of the root ball.


Try to keep the bamboo 1.5 ft away from any permanent underground structure. Bamboo roots are very strong and can go through most things.

, *The diameter of the hole should be 2x that of the root ball. The depth of the hole should equal the height of the root ball plus a few inches.

,,, Use a mix of both the compost and local soil. Overall, 50% compost or organic material will make for a very happy bamboo plant. Top of root-ball (root-mass) should be level with surface.

, 2 or more inches is best. This helps retain moisture (bamboo loves water).


Unlike trees, you may put the mulch up to the stem of the bamboo plant. Bamboo is a forest plant, it likes to have it's roots covered by more than soil.

, Average growth is 1-3ft per year. Some species can grow up to 10ft in a year.


For each shoot that now exists, expect a new one to sprout next year. If your bamboo plant has 5 shoots, expect to have 10 next year.

, Use a well-balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) like that used for grass.

, Water more when it is becoming established, 1-2 times weekly for the first 3-6 months.


Provide similar volume of water to lawn grass.
Make sure soil is well drained.
Mulch - like leaves, grass trimmings, or wood chips - help retain moisture and reduce need for watering.

,


Check running bamboo roots 2x per year; trim if necessary.
Check clumping bamboo every other year; trim if necessary.

,


Make sure roots are covered with a thick layer of mulch (~3"")

, If you want a bushy plant, trim less. If you want a thin plant, trim away. Wherever cut is made, growth is permanently halted.


Trim in late summer or fall.
Cut above nodes.

You could do a rainbow garden of matching color plants in rows. Or, a salsa garden with all of the ingredients needed to make salsa, such as cilantro, tomatoes, and peppers. Or, a tire garden where the plants are grown inside old tires.You can even do an ABC garden where each row of plants starts and continues with a certain letter, such as A. The A row could contain arugula or asparagus stalks.
You can also create an herb garden with plants like rosemary and sage. Or, a flower garden with daises, roses, and other beautiful blooming plants.;
, Think about how much spare time you have to devote to the care of the garden. Try to estimate how long it will take to care for a particular space. For example, weeding a large garden is a time commitment that many people underestimate. Also, for a family garden, make sure to calculate the time spent teaching your kids about the plants and how to care for them., Your garden will need both partial and direct sunlight. You should aim for at least 6 hours of sunlight exposure for all parts of the garden. You will also want an area with adequate drainage or you could have flooding every time it rains. You can determine the quality of drainage in an area by watching what happens when it rains. Does the rain pool in certain areas or does it wash away slowly?Make sure that your garden does not fall under the drainage areas of your gutter or in a lower area in your yard.

, When you have chosen your initial spot, go out a take a soil sample from that area. You can then take this soil to a local gardening store and ask them to test its quality. They will be able to tell you if the pH balance is too high, for example. They can also offer you suggestions as to how to improve the soil via the use of compost materials.For a healthy garden, you want to aim for a pH balance between 6.0 and 6.8.

, Before you’ve even selected the plants, get out a few pieces of paper and ask your children to draw out what their dream garden looks like. You can suggest that they use “X” to mark where the plants will go. You can then sit down as a family and talk about how you want the garden to look when finished.For example, do your children prefer a garden with clean, spaced out rows or something a bit more natural and overlapping?
You could also do a more organic design, such as a circle-shaped garden or one with wavy-line rows.

, Go with your family on a tour of a local garden center or arboretum. Give everyone small journals so they can take notes of what they like or dislike. Get online and browse through pictures of gardens with your kids. You can even clip out pictures from magazines for inspiration., For two weeks, keep a running list of every piece of produce that your family consumes. You can write down the names of the produce and the amount eaten per day. Then, go back through the list to see how much of each item you’ll need to plant if you plan to eat from the garden over time. This will also allow your kids to choose their favorite foods for inclusion., You can either buy partially or full-grown plants from your local nursery. Or, you can buy seeds from a store or online dealer. Your children may enjoy the process of physically choosing larger plants, but it is also fun to watch plants grow directly from seeds. It is often a good idea to go with a mix of both mature plants and seeds.If you will have children in the garden, then you may want to choose plants that are capable of surviving the curious little hands of kids. You will also want plants without thorns and ones that are not poisonous. Some great options are lavender or thornless roses., If you find discount seeds online, you may want to hesitate before you buy them. These seeds may be discounted for a reason and it would be disappointing to plant them with no success. Instead, try to buy your garden materials from an established online seller or nursery or gardening center. They may even offer a replacement policy if the plant dies., A garden can also be a great area for general play. Look into placing a slide or swing on the grounds. Perhaps consider building a fort in the branches of one of the larger trees. See if there is a place for a small swimming pool or splash pad area. This will guarantee that your family spends more time out of doors and in the garden space., Try to incorporate a fish pond or perhaps a bird bath. A birdfeeder is another low-key option. You can even place an owl house or birdhouses up in the trees. All of these modifications will brings birds and other animals into the area, making for great entertainment for kids or birdwatching for adults.You can make a pond or water space kid-safe by adding a fence around it or by installing a metal grille or mesh system on top of it. Consult with a pond safety specialist for more guidance.

, Otherwise, you could risk losing your plants to cold temperatures. If you are planting in the spring, this could mean waiting until April or later. Pick a day when the temperatures are warm and moderate to place your plants. It is okay if there are light showers in the forecast, but avoid any heavy storms as they could wash your plants out., When your plans are in place and you have your plants, the time has come to plant. Mark off the four corners of your garden with stakes. Then, run string between these stakes to show the boundaries of the space. Place the plants in their proper locations within the space right away if the space is prepared, or afterwards if it needs to be tilled.Placing the plants is a great way to involve kids in the process. They will enjoy laying everything out and seeing the garden take shape., Your soil may already be in good shape and you can choose to skip this step if that is the case. Otherwise, after you mark down the boundaries and before you place your plants, you’ll want to go over the ground with a tiller or hand tool. Try to loosen up the soil and incorporate fertilizer or compost as well., If you are working in a smaller space, you might want to consider creating your garden with raised beds. You can use deep wood planters or even wooden rectangular ones. Raised beds have the benefits of requiring less frequent weeding and having better drainage., After your garden has been planted, your work has just begun. Get a paper calendar and post it in your family room or kitchen. Write down the care that your garden needs and when. This will let everyone know that you’ll need to be in the garden 2-3 times a week to keep it going.For example, you might mark down “weeding” on certain days. To make this activity fun, you could wear coordinating outfits or have everyone put on large, floppy gardening hats.
You could also note how often certain sections of the garden need to be watered.

, There are many colleges and recreation centers that offer programs for families who are interested in learning more about gardening. In these programs, you will be instructed regarding how to plant, water, fertilize, and so on. This is a great way to prepare your family for a garden undertaking.When your family ‘graduates’ from the program you can also get your children their own garden tools to keep the excitement going.

Find out your zone.,
Determine your soil conditions.,
Check the light conditions where you’ll be planting.,
Consider space limitations when planting.",How to Pick Low Maintenance Perennials for Your Garden1," Different kinds of perennials, much like most flowers, do best in certain climates. These different climates are divided into “hardiness zones” in gardening. The best way to figure out your zone is by looking it up on the National Gardening Association homepage.


Many websites offer a color coded map where you can check your zone. This is usually supplemented with a zip code lookup feature, where you can type in your zip code to find your zone.There are a total of 12 zones, each of which is subdivided into “a” and “b” (e.g. zone 1b, zone 4a, zone 7b, and so on). This scale is used internationally.;
, Although there are many contributing factors that influence your soil condition, you can generally break soil down into six categories. When choosing your perennials, keep these categories in mind. Each plant will have a soil condition in which it thrives. This will be listed on its care instructions or tag. The six categories are:



Clay soil, which will feel clumpy and sticky when wet. It is very hard when dry, and drains poorly.

Sandy soil, which has a gritty feel. It drains and dries easily. This soil takes little effort to cultivate.

Silty soil, which has a soft, slimy feel. It absorbs moisture easily, is high in nutrients, and is easy to cultivate.

Peaty soil, which is generally darker with a spongy feel. It is acidic, and may require pH balancing.

Chalky soil, which will be grainier and stonier than other soils. This soil will likely also need pH balancing.

Loamy soil, which has a fairly even mix of sand, silt, and clay. It has a fine, slightly damp feel. It’s ideal for gardening., Just as some plants do best in certain climates and soils, so too will certain perennials thrive in different amounts of light and shade. This information can be found on the care instructions of most plants or their tags.


Full sunlight is generally defined as a total of 6 to 8 hours of sunlight throughout the day.
Partial sunlight requires less than 6 hours of sun throughout the day. This includes light that filters through cover, like branches or leaves.
Shade generally means there is no direct sunlight.
Direct sunlight, especially during the hot afternoon hours, can scorch less resilient plants even if the plant is only receiving partial sunlight., Your plants will need room to grow. Not having enough room can stunt your perennials or cause them to die. Use a tape measure to determine how much space you have in your garden, and keep this in mind when selecting plants so they have plenty of room to grow.


For larger garden plots, it might help to draw out a simple diagram of your garden on graph paper. Use one square on the paper equal to one square foot (.093 square meters).
The size requirements for most plants can be found on their care instructions or tag. If your plant doesn’t have this information, look up the plant online.
The size of your plant may be slightly larger or smaller depending on your situation. Soil, climate, and other factors can influence the size of your plants."

Select plants that are drought and heat resistant.,
Prioritize plants with restrained growth.,
Choose plants with long bloom cycles.",How to Pick Low Maintenance Perennials for Your Garden2," Plants that are drought and heat resistant will be less likely to wither or die when you miss a watering. Heat resistant plants will be less sensitive to differences in light in your garden and will likely still thrive with a little direct sunlight during the hot parts of the day, which can cause more sensitive plants to wilt or die.


Plants native to prairie or semi-arid environments are oftentimes drought and heat resistant. You can find a more complete list of plants like this by doing a online keyword search for “drought and heat resistant perennials.”

, Some plants keep on growing, getting bigger and bigger. These generally require pruning and weeding to prevent them from taking over your garden. This creates more work for you, so for the lowest maintenance garden, you should avoid plants with unrestrained growth cycles. Some plants to avoid include:


Wisteria
Magnolia grandifloraWinter Creeper
English Ivy, Plants with short bloom cycles often, though not always, require specific conditions to be met for a good bloom. Plants that bloom throughout the season or for long spans during its growing season are generally less sensitive to shocks.


Even if you forget to water or you’re not the kind of gardener who can fertilize regularly, plants with long bloom cycles will, in many cases, keep on blooming.
Some common long-blooming perennials include Black-eyed Susan, Moonbeam, Husker Red, Astilbes, and Hellebores."

Terracotta pots and plastic pots are typically the most affordable types of pots that you can get. Cast iron, concrete, and glazed ceramic pots are often the most expensive. Determine how much money you have in your budget, and look for pots that you can afford., Many terracotta pots are ornate and can add to your interior decor. The subtle colors of the material match well with many different plant types. On the downside, the material is also somewhat more fragile than other pots and has to be brought indoors during the winter., If your primary goal is to add to your decor, you should choose a ceramic pot that matches with the scenery. Glazed ceramic pots come in a wide variety of colors and shapes. Select a container that matches the aesthetic of your apartment, garden, or house., If you are housing plants that are meant to be permanent outdoor fixtures in your landscaping, concrete and cast iron pots are the best options. These pots will be able to withstand harsh weather and won't degrade or break down quickly., Regardless of the type of plant, improper drainage or overwatering can cause water to build on the bottom of the pot which can lead to rot or mold. To avoid this, look for pots that have drainage holes and remember to buy a saucer with the pot at the time of purchase. This will ensure that your plant receives the right amount of drainage., If you are looking for pots in person, make sure that you take a look at the pot to make sure there are no chips, cracks, or imperfections.

, The pots needs to be small enough so that you can place them upside down inside the large and medium terra cotta pots without going outside the rim. You can use more terra cotta pots instead, but plastic pots are much cheaper. They can be any color since you won't see them in the end.

, You will need to drill some holes along the top edge/inside rim of both plastic pots. Space each hole a few inches/centimeters apart. If the pots don't have any drainage holes along the bottom, you will need to drill some as well., Wipe the pots down with a damp cloth, then mask off anything you don't want painted with painter's tape. Paint the pots with 2 to 3 coats of outdoor-quality paint; allow each coat to dry before applying the next one. Do not paint the inside of the pots.Seal the paint with a clear, acrylic sealer to make it last longer.
You can paint the pots a solid color, or you can do designs, such as strip, zigzags, or polka dots.
You can make the pots all the same color, or you can paint each pot a different color.
Remove any painter's tape before the paint dries.

, Choose a stencil, such as a monogram, word, or house number. Secure it to the pot using painter's tape, then apply outdoor-quality paint over the stencil using a paintbrush or a foam brush. Work your way from the outer edges of the stencil inward. This will prevent the paint from bleeding under the stencil. Carefully peel the stencil away, then let the paint dry.


If your paint is sheer, you may need to apply another coat or two. Allow each coat to dry before applying the next one. Keep the stencil in place until you apply your last coat of paint.
You can apply the stencils to an unpainted pot or to a painted one. If you are applying the stencils to a bare pot, be sure to wipe it down with a damp cloth first.
If you are adding house numbers, aim to make them about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) tall and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide. This will make them more visible from the street.

, It would be a good idea to add 3 to 4 spacers under the pot so that it doesn't actually touch the tray. ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) thick pieces of wood work great., This will help prevent the soil from falling through the drainage soil. If you can't find any window screening, you can use a lid from a plastic Tupperware container and poke lots of tiny holes into it., This will be your base layer. You only need 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of soil.

, The bottom of the plastic pot is now the top. Make sure that it is below the rim of the terra cotta pot. If the plastic pot is too far below the rim, take it out, add more soil, then put it back in. Gently press it into the soil to create a seal., Place the medium-sized terra cotta pot on top of the plastic one, right-side-up. Insert another plastic screening into the bottom, then a thin layer of dirt. Place the second plastic pot upside-down into it, and make sure that it is below the rim.

, Place the small terra cotta pot on top, right-side-up. Insert a piece of window screening into the bottom. You do not need to add another plastic pot into it, unless you wish to save soil., Flowers and herbs are popular choices for these types of planters. You can also use trailing filler plants, strawberries, vegetables, or even succulents. You can buy young plants from your local nursery or gardening shop, or you can try to start them from seed.

, The soil should feel damp and springy, like a sponge. If your soil is too dry, mix some water into it.Make sure that your soil is suitable for the type of plants you are using.

, Use a trowel to scoop the soil into your planter. Stop when the soil is 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the top rim of each terra cotta pot., Remove the plants from the plastic containers that they came in. Dig holes for them into the planter, leaving at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) between each one. Insert the plants into the holes, then gently pat the soil around them. Make sure that the base of the plant is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) below the rim of the pot., This will help settle the soil and the plants.You will need to water each tier separately. Keep watering until the soil is damp and water comes out of the bottom of the largest pot.

Choose potting soil that is formulated for indoors.,
Make sure the plant gets the right amount of light.,
Water your plants according to their needs.,
Prevent pests.,
Choose the right pot.",How to Keep Your Plants from Dying1," It can be tempting to use dirt from your yard or the same potting soil that you use outside; however, indoor plants have different needs than outdoor plants. Make sure that your soil is made for indoor plants because it will be lightly packed enough for the plants to grow while still tight enough to hold in the water.


Change your soil every year or two.You should also check to make sure that your plant does not require special soil, such as clay, loam, sand, or peat. These soils hold different amounts of water to meet the needs of plants that may struggle in traditional soil.Additionally, you can find soil with added nutrients for your indoor plant.;
, Some indoor plants require a lot of light and need to be placed in a window that gets full sun, while others would wilt under all those rays. Check your plant's needs to ensure that they are being met.Don’t assume that a plant needs to be in a window. Some plants thrive in low light.
Check to make sure that the window you choose for your full sun plant gets several hours of sunlight. Sometimes windows are sunny for part of the day but in shade for the majority of the day. Choose a day when you’re home all day to check back at regular times to see how the light levels are.
If your home doesn’t get adequate light, you can try a UV lamp., Some plants need daily watering, while others need weekly, biweekly, or monthly watering.Check the care information for your plant to find out how much water it needs. Many people think that they can’t go wrong by watering frequently, but you can overwater a plant just as easily as not water it enough. Overwatering drowns the plant., You may think that your plants are safe from pests because they’re inside, but that is untrue. Think about all of the times that bugs have found their way into your house. Pests that can harm your plants can easily come in as well.


To prevent pests, spray your plants once or twice a week with neem oil to keep them safe from mites and mealybugs.You can also purchase a commercial pesticide formulated for indoor plants.

, As your plant grows, you should transplant it into larger pots that better suit the size of the plant so that the roots don’t twist in on themselves, suffocating the plant.Additionally, the pot that you use should be the right material and the right size for your plant because the pot size can determine the amount of moisture that the plant receives.When transplanting your plants, always shake the old dirt loose from the roots. If the inner roots are twisted, gently loosen them so that they are able to grow in the new pot.For example, plastic pots hold onto water, while clay pots don’t. It’s best to use a plastic pot only if you have a plant that needs a lot of water, because one that doesn’t will drown.
Choose a pot that is 2-4 inches (5-10 centimeters) larger in diameter than your plant because extra soil will mean extra moisture, which could overwater your plant."

Place them in the sun.,
Choose a good potting soil.,
Add fertilizer.,
Prune the dead parts off of your plants.,
Avoid sudden transitions from indoors.,
Protect from pests.",How to Keep Your Plants from Dying2," Plants need sun in order to convert carbon dioxide and water into their food and energy. While potted plants are often easy to arrange on porches and balconies, they still need access to proper sunlight. To keep them healthy, your plants need at least five hours of sunlight per day.Check your plant’s insert or information to see if it needs full sun or can thrive in the shade. Remember that shade-friendly plants still need indirect sunlight to stay alive.

, Your plant will need soil that is formulated for potted plants because they are growing in a different situation than plants that are in the ground. One of the ingredients that your soil will need is decaying organic matter, which is in most good potting soils. Organic matter will break down into the nutrients that your plant needs to absorb to be healthy., Potted plants require more added nutrients than plants that are in the ground, so regularly add fertilizer to your soil.Supplement your soil by adding organic matter either through a commercial fertilizer or your own composting.


Some fertilizers are liquid and can be added directly to the watering can you use to water your plants, making it an easy part of your plant care routine.

, If your plant has wilted leaves or buds, remove them from the rest of the plant. This will encourage new growth instead of allowing your plant to shrivel up., If you start a plant indoors or have moved it inside over the winter, don’t move it permanently outdoors without a transition period. A plant that is accustomed to living indoors is not equipped to survive outside. The environment is different and can cause the plant to wither; additionally, the rain levels can cause overwatering., Choose a chemical-free pesticide treatment that’s formulated to protect your plants. Different plants attract different pests, so read the label to make sure that you pick the right product.


Don’t try to kill all bugs, as some can be friendly to your garden."

Check the pH of your soil.",How to Keep Your Plants from Dying3," Spend a day tracking the sun as it travels over your garden or the spot you’d like to use. Many plants thrive with lots of sun, so look for shady trees or overhangs that may limit the sun. Additionally, notice if the shadow of your house or other large structures falls across your garden for part of the day, as this can limit the amount of sunlight that your plants receive. Once you know where the sunny spots are, you can ensure that your plants get enough sun.


If the plants you choose require full sun, make sure that your garden will get at least five hours of direct sunlight each day.Consider choosing a new spot for your garden if it doesn’t get proper sun.
Alternatively, you can try adding more plants that thrive in the shade or in part sun.

, Your plants need dead plants and other rotting organic debris to break down in the soil so that the plants can absorb the nutrients. In addition to allowing dead leaves to stay in the garden, you can also buy fertilizer or compost material, or you can create your own compost pile with dead leaves and food scraps.If you clean up your garden, consider adding back some fertilizer or compost.

, You need to give your plants enough water to meet their needs. Since the plants are outside, they may also be getting rain water. Adjust your watering schedule to account for the rain. Your soil should be moist but not soaked.


With an outdoor garden, you can get a sprinkler system to ensure that they are thoroughly watered.
Don’t water your garden if it rained that day. If a heavy storm comes through, allow the soil to dry some before you resume watering.
Plants need more water when they’re freshly planted. If it’s dry outside, newly planted plants need about a half a watering can each per day., Pruning a garden should be minimal. Large, barren plants should be trimmed during the winter, while flowering plants should be trimmed after the first buds form. Otherwise, you should not be pruning your plants., Plants grow best in slightly acidic soil that has a pH of 6.5. Test your soil to see if it’s in a good range for plant growth.If not, you can amend the soil by adding compost, manure, or alfalfa meal to your soil, which all contain nitrogen. The nitrogen will lower the pH to 6.5 over time."

Walk on the lawn to see if it feels firm or spongy.,
Press the lawn with your hand.,
Measure the depth of the thatch with your finger.,
Grab a spade or trowel shovel.,
Dig out a wedge of turf.,
Use a ruler to measure the thickness of the thatch.,
Run a convex rake through the grass to thin out the thatch.,
Rent a power dethatcher to use on your lawn.,
Hire a professional dethatching service.",How to Know if Your Lawn Needs Dethatching," The first thing that gives you a hint at whether or not your lawn needs to be dethatched is the feel of it. Walk around for awhile and see if the ground feels firm. If it feels spongy, or almost bouncy, that’s a sign that the thatch has gotten too thick.

If you don’t mind the feeling, walk around barefoot to get an even better feel of the firmness of the ground.
If the ground feels firm under the grass, then the thatch is probably about the right thickness and doesn’t need to be dethatched.;
, If walking around the lawn doesn’t give you a good idea about the firmness, use your hand to check it. Push the grass down until you feel the thatch. Your hand is more sensitive to the spongy feeling than your feet are, so judge whether it feels too thick.If your hand reaches the top of the thatch layer and you can obviously push down more, you might want to dethatch the lawn. If it feels firm, don’t worry about it for now.

, While you are bent down, gently push your finger through the thatch layer. Pay attention to how far up your finger the thatch goes. Pull your finger out and measure the depth. Less than half an inch (1.3 cm) is the ideal depth.If you don’t feel comfortable sticking your finger into the thatch, use a stick or even a ruler to penetrate the thatch layer.
If the thatch is obviously thicker than ¾ inch (1.9 cm), it’s definitely time to dethatch the lawn.

, A quick and easy test is to dig up a chunk of the lawn turf and actually look at a side view of the thatch layer. Grab whatever kind of shovel or hoe that you have and take it to the portion of lawn you want to check.If you have a trowel, this works fine because you only need to look at a small wedge of turf.

, Work the shovel into the ground making sure you get down to the soil level. Cut a circle of turf out of the ground so you can pull it up completely out of the ground. There is no need to take out a large chunk, just enough to see the grass, the thatch, and the soil., Hold the chunk of turf up so you can see it. Pull it off of the shovel by the grass or simply examine it on the shovel. Hold a ruler or measuring tape up to the thatch. Hold the zero mark right at the top of the soil. If the thatch goes past ¾ inch (1.9 cm), it’s a good idea to dethatch the lawn.If you have a large lawn and some time, it’s worth checking a few distinct sections of the lawn. You may not need to detach the entire lawn, and doing a few tests will save you time in the long run.

, Go to the local hardware or garden store and buy a convex rake used for dethatching. Ask an employee if you aren’t sure which rake to buy. Rake the lawn to pull up most of the thatch layer.Have a basic plastic lawn rake on hand, as well, to rake the thatch into a pile for disposal. The dethatching rake is really only to pull it up from under the grass.

, For thicker thatch and larger lawns, rent a mechanical dethatcher. It’s a powered machine that digs into the soil to remove thicker thatch. Ask your local equipment rental center to set the machine up before you take it home.It’s not too hard to run a dethatcher. You just push it in lines through your lawn. However, the blades need to be set to a certain depth, which is best left to the professionals at the store.

, If your thatch is obviously an inch (2.5 cm) or more thick, you’re better off getting a professional to come work on your lawn. If it is in your budget, professionals are able to do a more thorough job than you.

These services may cost around $250, depending on the size of your lawn.

However, you can also plant it in later summer when the weather starts to cool.You can also grow lemon balm indoors. Choose a large pot that’s at least 6- to 8-inches (15- to 20-cm) deep and wide, and keep it in a location where it will receive significant sun during the day.;
, You can plant lemon balm from seeds or seedlings, which are young plants that have already sprouted stems. In most cases, you’ll have easier time using seedlings, though lemon balm seeds are fairly hardy and usually sprout without much trouble.It typically takes six weeks for lemon balm seeds to develop into seedlings.
If you or a friend has an existing lemon balm plant, you can harvest a shoot from the plant and place it in a glass of water. Change the water daily, and once the shoot begins to root, you can plant it outdoors or in a container.

, Lemon balm grows best in a location that receives full sun. However, it is partially shade-tolerant, so it can do well in a spot that receives some shade in the afternoon.Even if you plan to grow the lemon balm outdoors, you may want to plant it in a container. That way, you can easily move it around your yard or deck to find the ideal spot.

, When it comes to choosing soil to grow the lemon balm in, opt for a rich, well-drained clay or sandy loam. Ideally, you want the soil to have a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.Soilless potting mixes, vermiculite, perlite, coco peat, and rockwool are also ideal mediums for growing lemon balm.

, Lemon balm doesn’t require a lot of fertilizer for healthy growth. However, it’s still a good idea to mix in some slow-release fertilizer into the soil when you plant to ensure that the plants receive a steady supply of nutrients over time.A slow-release fertilizer with a 19-19-19 ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is ideal for growing lemon balm.
Be sure to read the fertilizer label to determine the proper amount to add to your lemon balm plants and how often you need to reapply it.

, When it comes to time to placing the lemon balm in the soil, proper spacing is key because it can spread quickly as it grows. Place seeds ¼-inch (6-mm) beneath the soil and seedlings at the same depth that they are in their containers, and space the plants so they’re at least 12- and 15-inches (30-cm and 38-cm) apart.You may need to thin the seedlings as they grow so there is enough space between the plants.

, Lemon balm requires soil that is consistently moist for healthy growth. It’s best to water it on a weekly schedule, making sure to water the plants evenly so the surface is moist but doesn’t have any puddles.If you live in a dry climate or are experiencing particularly hot, dry weather, you may need to water the lemon balm twice a week. Check the soil daily to ensure that it is still moist.
Be careful not to overwater the lemon balm or powdery mildew may develop.

, To keep the soil moist and provide additional nutrients, it helps to add mulch around the lemon balm once a year. Opt for an organic mulch, and spread approximately 2-inches (5-cm) of it around the base of the plants.Organic mulch includes compost, leaves, grass clippings, wood, and bark.
You can add mulch to your plants each spring or each fall.
Keep an eye on the mulch around the plants. If it’s washed or blown away, you may need to add it than once a year.

, Lemon balm can be vulnerable to diseases such as verticillium wilt and powdery mildew. To keep your plants healthy, cut away any dead flowers or leaves when you spot them. It’s also a good idea to keep healthy leaves trimmed to ensure effective air circulation around the plants.Lemon balm rejuvenates itself well, so whenever the plants have gotten too large, cut them back to ensure that there’s still space between them.

, To harvest lemon balm for tea and other uses, simply pinch off sprigs from the plant. You can remove sprigs as soon as the plant starts growing, though it’s usually best to wait until it’s grown at least a few stems., Fresh lemon balm leaves can be tasty in salads, smoothies, and dishes, but you may want to dry some for longer-term storage. To dry the leaves, gather 5 or 6 stems together and tie them with kitchen string. Hang them in a warm, dark location for 1 to 3 weeks.You’ll know that the leaves are ready when they feel dry and brittle to the touch.

, After you take the leaves down from drying, untie them from their bundles. Remove the leaves from the stems, but keep them in large pieces to retain their flavor. Place them in an airtight jar or other container for storage.Avoid plastic bags for storing the leaves because they are prone to condensation that can damage the lemon balm.

Understand that Dichondra is a type of morning glory, and it is often considered a weed.,
Choose an ornamental Dichondra called “Silver Falls” or “Silver Dichondra” if you want a cascading groundcover.,
Ask your local landscape company or garden center whether it is good for lawns in your area.,
Decide if you will start the Dichondra from seed or purchase bedding plants.,
Wait until late spring or early summer to start your Dichondra grass.,
Consider laying down a weed killer, like Roundup, across the entire lawn if you have a lot of competing plants or weeds.,
Roto-till your lawn to a depth of six inches (15cm).,
Rake the surface free of any rocks or sticks.,
Broadcast the seeds at a rate of 1 lb.,
Rake the soil.,
Sprinkle the seedbed with water three to five times a day.,
Wait about two weeks for the Dichondra lawn to sprout.,
Fertilize the lawn with a nitrogen-rich compost or product every winter.,
Mow every two weeks.,
Choose an area that has full sun or partial shade.,
Plant the seed when temperatures are in the 70s or start them inside ahead of time.,
Ensure your soil is well drained.,
Plant the bedding plants to soil level.,
Water to a depth of one to two inches (2.5 to 5cm) the first time.,
Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizer.,
Don’t water too frequently.",How to Grow Dichondra," It’s invasiveness is what makes it ideal for filling out beds or growing as lawn. However, you should be prepared to contain it if need be.;
, It will look great overhanging retaining walls and stones.


The Silver Falls variety is light green to gray, while other Dichondra plants are a Kelly green color.

, Flea beetles attach this plant in some areas, making it a poor choice.As is, it can be a difficult to maintain, yet, drought resistant type of lawn.

, If your ground freezes, it is a good idea to choose bedding plants. Seeds should only be started outdoors when the temperature is at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius).

, It will need steady temperatures over 70 degrees.

, Wait the amount of time indicated on the package before you seed your lawn.

, Feed lawn with an all-purpose lawn food.

, Make sure that all areas are level, so that they drain well.

, (0.5kg) per 500 to 1000 square feet (46 to 93 square meters). The heavier you seed, the faster it is likely to take root.

, Cover it in a shallow layer of peat moss to hold moisture in and keep weeds out.

, It should be moist, but never have standing water. Make sure you use a fine mist setting.

, After 10 days, let the surface dry out more before watering. Gradually reduce the frequency with which you water.


Start to water deeply, but infrequently to develop the root system. The roots should receive at least one inch (2.5cm) of water each time.
Dichondra is sensitive to over-watering and it can cause disease.
Don’t allow the soil to become completely dry between watering.

, Use a pre-emergent for weed control.


Don’t use broad-leaf herbicides on the lawn, since it will kill the plant. You may need to apply insecticides if heavy rain causes disease or bug problems., Set your mower height to 1.5 to 2 inches (4 to 5cm). You can cut it closer in the winter, but you should avoid cutting too much at once if the plant grows long.

, Apply a weed killer if the area is overrun by weeds. Wait several weeks to plant the Dichondra.


You can also plant Dichondra in hanging baskets or use it in cut flower arrangements.

, You can also buy bedding plants if you want them to fill out even faster.

, Rake the area to loosen the soil.

, Fill in the area with dirt. Press them lightly to ensure they are firmly implanted.

, Then, wait until the soil is drier, but not completely dry to water again.

, Try to avoid getting the fertilizer on the leaves of the plant or it may burn them.

, This plant should be watered deeply but infrequently. It will grow from season to season and fill out the beds. They can trail up to six feet (1.8m)."

Pick tomatoes in the summer when they are most flavorful.,
Look carefully at the outside of the tomato.,
Feel the tomato for firmness.,
Test the weight of the tomato in your hand.,
Smell the tomato to check for ripeness.",How to Pick Tomatoes,"

Your climate will determine the best time to pick summer tomatoes from the garden.



 


Tomatoes are generally ready to pick 55-to-100 days after planting the seeds, depending on the variety.






Tomatoes can be harvested when they are still green and allowed to ripen off the vine.






Pick tomatoes from the vine before the first freeze.






Pick tomatoes often (every 1-to-2 days in some cases) during the peak growing season to prevent over-ripening on the vine.





;
,

Most ripe tomatoes are a bright red color, although tomatoes that ripen in hot weather may be yellowish-orange.






Different varieties of tomatoes will have different mature colors. Tomatoes can ripen to colors of red, orange, yellow, pink and purple. Check the bottoms of the tomatoes for the mature ripe color of the variety you are picking. This is where tomatoes begin to ripen first.






The skin of the tomato should be smooth and slightly shiny without any dark spots or bruises. Even a small spot can indicate that the tomato is rotten on the inside.







,

Tomatoes that are appropriately ripe should feel slightly firm when you lightly squeeze them. A hard tomato needs additional time to ripen.






If the tomato has soft spots, it usually means the soft areas will turn to bruises and the tomato may rot.
A tomato that is too soft all over is over-ripe and should be removed from the vine and discarded.

,

Lighter-weight tomatoes are not quite ripe.






Tomatoes that are heavy and dense are usually ripe and ready to pick and eat.







,


The tomato should smell sweet and earthy at the stem. A strong sweet smell indicates that the tomato will be more flavorful.

Mark your calendar.,
Pick when it is coolest outside.,
Measure central head growth.,
Monitor floret and leaf growth.,
Check the florets for a deep green.,
Use proper broccoli picking tools.,
Remove the heads below the head base.,
Cut below the heads at a slant.Cutting at an angle will allow any moisture to slide down the side, whereas cutting flat causes water to pool on top and rot the center.If the plant's center rots, you will not be able to re-harvest later on and will need to pull your plant early.








,
Remember the side shoots.Besides the main head, you should see smaller broccoli heads along the sides of your broccoli.,
Collect your broccoli harvest.,
Don't harvest your entire broccoli plant at once.,
Re-pick several days to a week later.,
Store your broccoli indoors.,
Pull your broccoli plant and put it in the compost.",How to Pick Broccoli," Schedule an approximate picking time months in advance so you get the most out of your broccoli plant. If you live in a colder climate, plant your broccoli in the spring so you can pick in the early to late summertime. In warmer climates, you have more freedom and can harvest into autumn.In general, expect to harvest broccoli about 55 to 60 days after planting.Plan to harvest two months ahead of your planting day. Mark the days on your calendar or set a phone reminder if needed.
Broccoli is a cool-season crop that harvests best in most climates during the spring or fall. Remember this in advance so you can pick during an optimum season.;
, In the morning, your broccoli will be least exposed to sunlight and fresher from a night of rest. In the evening, your broccoli plant will be least wilted from the sun's heat. Either times are the best option to pick, as the middle of the day is when your plant will have least moisture.









For best taste, pick strictly in the morning before the soil heats up.
If you live in a colder or less sunny climate, you can pick in the middle of the day without major concerns. Just take care to pick when your broccoli is not wilted.

, Head growth is the surest sign that your broccoli is ready to pick. The head should be firm and tight, and it should grow to around 4 to 7 inches (10.16 to 17.78 cm). Any larger than 7 inches, and you risk waiting until your plant is overripe.









Your central head will cease to grow when it is ready. If you have not noticed head growth in more than 4 to 6 days, your plant is ready to pick.

, Floret (or flower) size is another reliable indicator that your harvest is ready. When florets at the outside edge of the broccoli head is around the size of a toothpick, your broccoli is ready for picking.Leaf growth correlates to your harvesting yield. Broccoli plants with big, healthy leaves will have big broccoli heads. Plants with stunted leaves will have small, weak heads. Wait until your leaves look larger before you pick.

, Pay close attention to the plant's color when deciding whether to pick it. Your florets should be a deep green. If you see hints of yellow in the florets, your plant has begun to bloom or bolt. Harvest the broccoli immediately if it begins to turn yellow, as your plants may become overripe in several days.


If your broccoli flower sprouts, it is no longer edible. Ideally, pick your broccoli the day your plant begins yellowing.

, When choosing a knife or clipper, make sure your tools are sharp. Clean your tools before you use them, and avoid harvesting your broccoli with any rusty tools. Precise cuts are important when picking broccoli, which will help your plant heal and prevent it from withering before you can re-harvest later on.


Use gardening gloves or buy a pair, if you haven't already. Gardening gloves can keep your hands clean and protect them from garden insects.
Do not literally ""pick"" your broccoli with your hands. Without using tools, your cuts will be uneven and will not allow your broccoli to grow side shoots later on.

, Using a sharp knife, cut around 5 inches (12.7 cm) below the broccoli heads.









Try to remove the head in one clean cut so your plant can heal and produce more side shoots later. Avoid using sawing motions or cutting with multiple hits, which can decrease your broccoli harvest.,, Trim these at an angle, too, using either your knife or a pair of sharp clippers. More, smaller side shoots will grow over the next two to four days.

, Bring a bucket, basket, or bowl to collect your broccoli in after you have picked it. This will help keep your picking organized and allow easy storage later on.









Throw away any any broccoli that has gone bad. Broccoli heads that smell pungent, is a vivid yellow color, or feels limp to the touch may have rotted before picking.

, If you harvest all the heads and pull your plant at the same day, you will not get the most out of your plant. If you cut at an angle, your plant will grow more side shoots within a few days. Because fresh broccoli needs to be eaten within a small window, you may want to harvest over the course of a week rather than all at once.








The exception to this is if your plant has yellowed considerably and you suspect it will soon flower. Preferably, plan on harvesting before your plan shows yellow streaks. If it already has, harvest as much as you can immediately but check the stalks in several days for more shoots.
Picking over several days can seem inconvenient, but you are less likely to waste your harvest.

, Two to four days later, you may notice one or two smaller heads growing where you cut the first heads.Slice these off at an angle again (using either your knife or clippers), then check again in two to four days for more smaller heads.









If you do not see any additional shoots, the first harvest may have caused too much damage to the plant. After a week of no shoot growth, pull the plant and compost it.
This process should continue over the next few weeks, with the heads becoming smaller and smaller each time, until the end of broccoli harvesting season for your climate.This will be around July or August for cooler climates and up to October for warmer climates.

, Wash and dry your broccoli before storing to remove any dirt or potential insects. Store your broccoli in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Blanch or freeze your broccoli if you plan to use it later, as it will wilt after a week.








Cold and moist is preferable for cut broccoli shoots. Because your refrigerator is dry, put your broccoli in a perforated plastic bag in your crisper.
Frozen broccoli can be stored in your freezer for up to a year. If you had a heavy broccoli harvest and cannot use all your broccoli in a weak, freezing is your best option for long-term usage.

, After the first frosts in your area occur, pull your broccoli plant before it begins to rot. Make sure you pull the broccoli plant from the roots to ensure it has been fully removed.









If you have created a compost pile, you can add the broccoli plant to the pile with other carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials such as leaves, egg shells, coffee grounds, and grass clippings. You can then mix or layer it into your garden when planting later for richer soil.

Add aspirin to the water in the vase.,
Add copper.,
Add bleach.,
Add flat soda.,
Add vinegar.,
Add alcohol.,
Spray the flowers.",How to Preserve Flowers1," Crush one tablet of aspirin into a powdery mixture. Add to the water the freshly cut flowers are sitting in and gently mix to dissolve. This will keep the flowers fresh longer.;
, If you have a copper coin (cent, penny) or a small piece of copper, add it to the water the freshly cut flowers are sitting in. Add a cup of sugar as well. The flowers will last longer as the bacterial growth is inhibited.

, Mix 1/4 teaspoon bleach per liter/quart of water added to the freshly cut flowers. A little bit of sugar can also be added if wished.

, Pour about 1/4 cup unwanted soda into the vase of freshly cut flowers, along with the usual water. Use clear soda unless you want cola colored water!

, Mix 2 tablespoons quality vinegar with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of sugar. Add to the water the freshly cut flowers are sitting in. The water should be changed every few days, re-adding the vinegar mix.

, Place a few drops of any clear spirit, such as vodka, in with the water the fresh flowers are sitting in. Add a teaspoon of sugar as well. This will curb the growth of bacteria that starts the flower rot. The water should be changed every two days and the drops of spirit and sugar re-added to the new water.

, This method helps the flowers top-end. Simply point hairspray about 2 inches/5cm away from the flowers and spray underneath both flowers and leaves (leave the upper sides unsprayed). This is good when combined with one of the water-added solutions above.

Hang the flowers to dry them.,
Use a flower press.,
Ask a florist to dry the flowers for you.,
Find other drying methods here.

",How to Preserve Flowers2," Select the flowers. String them up upside down over an empty space such as high up in a closet doorway (provided you don't need to close the door). The spot chosen should be in a dry area of the house (definitely not in your bathroom). If it's warm that is helpful but not too humid. Leave the flowers strung up this way for two to three weeks. This will ensure that they are dried in an upright position and that the bloom isn't falling over.


The knots on the stem will also become looser due to water loss so you may want to check them and carefully tighten them every 5-7 days or so.
Take down when dry. Use in dried floral arrangements, potpourri or for craft projects.

, A flower press is a traditional method of pressing flowers, petals and leaves flat, drying them in the process. This method is only good for when you want flat flowers for artwork or scrapbooking. More information on using a flower press or pressing flowers generally (with a book, etc.) can be found here and here.

, Florists can use modern techniques, such as silica gel, hot air drying, freeze drying and using a molecular sieve. The end results will be very professional, which makes this approach a good one for preserving wedding flowers and other flowers with important memories.

Gradually pour the remaining warm crystals down the side of the glass.,
Microwave at ""high"".,
Cool the buds for 20 minutes.",How to Preserve Flowers3," (The gel crystals are available at craft stores). Heat on ""high"" for three minutes to dry the crystals as much as possible.

, The glass must be wide enough to accommodate the flower you're drying.

, Cut enough so that only an inch (2.5cm) remains attached to the flower. Stick the stem into the crystals so that the blossom stands upright.

, Keep pouring until the flower is completely covered.

, Cook for 1 minute 45 seconds for rosebuds or up to 4 or 5 minutes for larger blossoms.

, Gently pour off the crystals once cooled. Clean the flower petals carefully with a fine paintbrush, then mist lightly with an acrylic spray. The flowers can now be used for display or artwork.

Cover the base of the box with a sheet of newspaper or tissue paper.,
Pour the sand over the paper.,
Place the flowers on the sand.,
Let the flowers dry.,
Carefully pull the newspaper or tissue paper up one side of the box.",How to Preserve Flowers4," If you pick it up from nature, wash it first, then bake dry in the oven. Sand purchased from retail suppliers is usually ready for use.


Sand can often be purchased at hardware stores or garden/landscape centers. Explain that you only need a small amount and see if they'll sell just a small amount to you for a small price.

, A shoebox or similar is ideal. Poke holes along the bottom of the box with a skewer, pencil, or similar object.

, The paper should come up the sides of the box, both sides, with enough for you to pull on when the drying is completed.

, Fill the box to about 1/2 an inch/1.5cm.

, Face them downward. Stems and leaves can also be dried at the same time, in the same fashion. Sprinkle with more sand to cover.

, They should sit for at least one week to 10 days. Check that they have dried enough before proceeding.

, Do this over a container or outside, to allow the sand to drain through the holes you punched at the beginning. If you use a container to catch the sand, you can reuse it.


Do not attempt to pull the dried flowers out until the sand has drained; doing so can destroy them––they're fragile!

Use shellac if there are large buds, berries or seed pods that you need to keep solidly in place.,
Thin the shellac.,
Brush the shellac mix onto the heavier buds, seed pods, berries etc.",How to Preserve Flowers5," Shellac can be purchased from hardware stores and some craft stores.

, Add a little denatured alcohol to the shellac before painting it on. While doing this is likely to work best, if you wish, you can use just plain shellac.

, Allow to dry, preferably by hanging or sitting on a wire drying rack.

If preferred, the shellac can be sprayed onto the items. This can be useful where they're very delicate.

Keep cool and covered.,
Put fragile produce into appropriate containers.,
Use refrigeration.,
Keep herbs and green vegetables standing in water.,
Consider how you display your fresh produce.",How to Keep Homegrown Produce Fresh for Market," The freshest will be that which is picked the latest.;
, Muddiness will detract from the appeal of the produce in the eyes of many consumers. Don't dig or scrape the fruit, however; gently wash off what will come off easily.

, All fresh produce appreciates being kept cool and if you have soft fruits, this is especially important. Keep covered from insects.

, Make sure to provide buffers between your fragile produce and the knocks and bumps of transportation. Keep items in plastic bags, crates, small plastic punnets etc. as needed.

, If the climate is hot and the turnover is not fast, refrigeration is essential. Investing in suitable equipment can be a long-term savings if you plan on selling fresh produce frequently in a hot climate. If you don't have access to electrical refrigeration, innovate with ice chests or a pot-in-pot refrigeration system.

, Keeping the roots or stems in water helps to keep such produce fresh.

, If you at a market stall in hot weather, it is worth investing in a canopy to give shade over your produce during the day. If you are indoors, you might want to consider the backdrop that you use to highlight your produce - keep it simple, clean and bright to encourage customers to look at your produce.

Get at least 20 to 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per day.,
Do abdominal marching to strengthen your core muscles.,
Do squats to prepare your body to squat, rather than bend over, to pick things up in the yard.,
Do bicep and triceps exercises to strengthen your weed-pulling muscles.,
Get into a gardening stretching routine, in order to limber up and avoid injury.",How to Get in Shape for Gardening1," Most people who work in the garden work for at least 45 minutes to an hour at a time, walking, raking, weeding and more. In the off season, find a way to walk, swim, use an elliptical or bicycle to keep your heart and lungs trained for gardening.;
, These are the abdominal, oblique (side), transverse abdominis (underlying) and back muscles. They support you as you bend, twist, pick up or complete almost any gardening activity.

Lay on your back with knees bent. Tighten your core muscles. The curve in your back should flatten slightly toward the ground. Pick up 1 knee at a time and put it back down. Pick up the opposite knee and put it back down. Repeat this motion for 60 seconds and add your opposite arms when you are ready. Do this every other day in the gardening ""off-season.""







, To get into the practice of bending at the knees, rather than at the waist, do the following every other day.

Put on athletic shoes that have some grip. Keep your back straight and your weight in your heels. Bend your knees and squat as low as you can without breaking form, and then repeat 10 to 12 times. Do 2 to 3 sets, increasing repetitions as your gluteal, hamstring and quadricep muscles get stronger.






Another way to do this, if you have any lower back problems, is to use a medium to large resistance ball. Place the ball on the wall, behind your back. The curve of your back should fit into the curve of the ball. Flex your core muscles and lean back into the ball as you squat. Do 10 to 12 repetitions and 2 to 3 sets.







, Get a resistance band of light resistance, which is available in most sports stores.

To do a bicep curl, put on your athletic shoes. Place the middle of the band beneath 1 of your feet. Curl the ends around your hands until the band is taught when your arms are straight. Raise your forearms until they are at a 90 degree angle and slowly lower them. Do 10 to 15 repetitions in 2 to 3 sets.






To do a tricep curl, hook the resistance band around a doorknob or shut the band into the low part of the door itself. Curl the ends of the band around your arms so they are taught with your arms at your sides. With legs at hip-distance apart, step forward with 1 foot (0.3 m) and flex your core muscles. Keep your arms straight and bring them up as high as you can, and then slowly bring your arms down. Do 10 to 15 repetitions in 2 to 3 sets.







, Gardening uses biceps, triceps, quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, abdominal and more muscles. Developing a stretching routine that you will continue into the gardening season will help you to avoid muscle strain and arthritic pain.

Do a hamstring stretch. Lay on the floor with your back straight. Lift each knee individually and hug it into your chest for 10 seconds. Repeat with the other knee. Stay on the ground and hook a towel underneath your foot. With the help of your arms, bring 1 leg as straight up as possible with your back and head on the ground. Repeat with the opposite leg.






Do a quadricep stretch. Stand next to a wall. Bend 1 knee back and grasp it with your hand. Pull lightly on your foot and you should feel a pull in your front thigh. Hold for 10 seconds and then repeat with the second side.






Do a chest stretch. Stand in a narrow doorway. Bend your elbows and place them on the inner sides of the door. Step forward 1 step. You should feel a pull in your chest and armpit. Hold for 30 seconds. Raise or lower your arms to stretch more of the muscle.






Do a gentle twist. Lay on your back with your knees bent and arms out to the sides and let your knees fall to the left side. Bring your arms to your right side. Rest in this position for 30 seconds. Bring your knees and arms back to a neutral position and then switch sides.

Take a 10 minute walk and stretch before you begin gardening.,
Replace any old tools in your gardening artillery.,
Stop from twisting while you rake.,
Practice your squats with pots in your hands.",How to Get in Shape for Gardening2," This will help to warm up your muscles. After a few weeks, you may no longer need to do this because your muscles will be strong enough to handle the strain. .

, Trade in short-handled tools for long handed tools and learn to use them with a straight back. Engage your core muscles before any pulling or pushing motions.

, Bend your knees and plant a foot either right or left in the direction you are raking. Devote the same amount of time to raking from the right side as raking from the left side.


Raking from 1 side only can create muscle imbalance. You are much more likely to develop postural problems and muscle soreness.

, This is a great gardening training exercise for all the work you will be doing potting, planting and watering. The extra weight will add extra strength to your muscles.

Common locations include woodlands, riverbanks, and country lanes., Wild garlic will have a cluster of flowers at the end of a single stem. The flowers look like white stars with six petals each. Lily of the valley is closest in appearance to wild garlic, but can be distinguished by careful observation. Lily of the valley flowers are bell-shaped and droop downwards from the stem.Lily of the valley is poisonous, so take your time while harvesting to make sure you pick the right plant.

, Wild garlic has clusters of stems coming out of the ground. The stems are green and white. Leaves grow near the ground and are long, flat, and have a single vein down the middle. The leaves grow one per stem.Lily of the valley has one stem colored green and purple with two or three leaves.

, When you are near wild garlic, you will likely already detect a garlic and chive smell. You can double-check by picking up and rubbing a garlic leaf between your fingers. This will release the same odor.Lily of the valley and other plants won’t have this odor and may smell sweet instead.

, The leaves will be near the ground. Pick or cut off mid-sized and large ones that look full and green. Leave the small leaves to replenish the plant.The entire plant can be used, but the underground bulbs tend to be small. Removing the bulb should only be done if you have the landowner’s permission or don’t mind removing your own plant.

, Try to cut the stems close to the ground using a knife or scissors. If you have a difficult time removing them, they will also be tough to eat unless cooked for a long time., Unopened flowers can be used, but flowers that have bloomed have an even stronger taste than the leaves. Pluck them or snip them off with scissors. As spring passes, the flowers turn into seed pods which also have a strong flavor and can be eaten., Wild garlic clippings are delicate and leave a strong smell when damaged. While you can stuff them into a jacket, it is better to give them space. Line them in your basket and don’t press down.You may also put clippings into a plastic bag or water bottle. Keep them loosely packed and don’t squish them.

, Shake flowers to remove insects. At the very least, wash off the plant under cold, running water. You can fill a bowl with cold water and submerge the clippings for five minutes to prepare them for refrigeration., Anything you won’t use immediately can be stored for about a week. You may wrap the washed clippings in a damp paper towel first to help them stay preserved. Place them in sealed plastic bags or covered containers., Boil a pot of water. Add the garlic. After a minute, remove the garlic to a bowl of ice cold water. Once the clippings are all in the water, begin moving them to freezer bags. Squeeze out as much air from the bags as possible. This garlic will last for months but will not be crisp.You can remove more air from the bag by using a soda straw. Close the bag around the straw. Suck out as much air as possible, then quickly remove the straw and close the bag.

, Spread the leaves out on baking sheets. Set the oven to the lowest possible heat setting. You may leave the oven door open if you are worried about them drying out too quickly. After about four hours, or when the leaves feel brittle, place them in airtight jars., Oil-preserving is good for sauces such as pesto. Simply chop or blend leaves in a food processor. Place them in jars, making sure they are covered by olive oil. Alternatively, cover the leaves with vinegar mixed with your favorite spice combination.Oil-preserve garlic should be refrigerated and will last up to three weeks. Raw garlic pickled in vinegar can be left at room temperature but will last almost indefinitely in the refrigerator.

The color of the pod will phase to a dull yellow-green and when the seeds are fully mature, the pod will turn light brown. (About the color of a paper bag.)
At this light brown stage, they may be pinched from the plant. Place the pods on a plate and allow them to dry indoors for several days. (Adjust timeframe for the humidity in your own environment.)

, The pods will begin to split open at their seams as they dry. You can encourage the pod to open by running the edge of your fingernail along the pod seam, and then spreading the pod open with your fingers to reveal the seeds.

, Allow them to dry on the plate for a few more days.


Dry indoors away from drafts.
A tray will work just as well as a plate. The item should have edges, to help keep the seeds in place.

, Store them until you are ready to plant them.

Preserve leaves by pickling.",How to Harvest Wood Sorrel," Wood sorrel enjoys growing close to the ground. It springs up in woodlands and on shaded slopes. One type of wood sorrel is also considered a weed that grows commonly on lawns in eastern North America., Sorrel is quickly recognizable by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers cluster near to the ground and have five petals apiece. White and yellow are its common colors, although there are pink and violet variants., When you are unsure, look at the leaves. Sorrel leaves grow in clusters of three. The leaves look heart-shaped with a fold down the center. The leaf veins branch off from the middle of the main vein, unlike in clover leaves, where many veins split off in parallel lines from each other., The outer leaves are mature. Leave behind the small leaves, which are near the stem. The leaves can simply be picked off by hand or cut using a knife.You can take some of the leaf cluster stems, but most of them will be too tough.

, As spring progresses, the edible flowers will begin to bloom. Once they have grown, cut them off for use as a garnish. You may also cut them off before they blossom so that the plant's leaves grow quicker., You’ll see tiny pods growing on separate stems underneath the leaves. They look green and resemble pea pods. When they are small and immature, they can also be cut off and eaten., Place what you’ve picked under cold, running water. Remove any rotten parts as you go. Set the sorrel aside and allow it to dry. When used immediately, sorrel will taste best, but you can keep sorrel for several days in a sealed plastic bag., Excess sorrel can be dried out and crumbled over food. Line the sorrel on a pan in the oven or in a dry area under sunlight. When using an oven, set the heat as low as possible. Once the sorrel is dried out, store it in a sealed jar., Boil a pot of water. Drop the leaves in and leave them there for two minutes. Remove the leaves and immediately place them in a bowl of ice cold water. Drain off the moisture, seal the sorrel in a freezer container, and then store it in the freezer. It will last up to a year.The leaves can also be blended into a liquid and added to an ice cube tray. Freeze and then move the sorrel blocks to a freezer container.
Another way to do this is to steam the leaves, roll them up, then move them to a sealed container inside the freezer.

, Finely chop or blend leaves. Place the leaves in a jar and mix them with vinegar and sugar. You’ll have a green sauce that will last indefinitely when refrigerated.You can also keep the leaves whole and cover them in olive oil. Push down on the leaves in the jar to remove air. Store them in the refrigerator for up to three weeks.

Watch for tulip growth in early spring.,
Increase watering when you see new growth.,
Watch for the advanced bud stage.,
Pull tulips up by the stem.,
Cut off the bulbs.,
Wrap the tulips in paper.,
Trim the tulips.,
Place your tulips in water.,
Dry your tulips.,
Replace the water and trim the tulips daily.,
Keep tulips in a cool room.,
Discard tulips after three to seven days.",How to Harvest Tulips," Tulips usually start to grow in early spring. When you notice the bulbs of tulips poking through the ground, it's time to prepare for harvest. As soon as tulips begin to emerge, care for them to encourage a quality harvest., Once tulips begin to poke through the ground, water them extra. This encourages them to mature into strong plants, giving you a strong harvest. Water tulips with about two inches of water a week. This will keep the soil wet enough to provide you with quality tulips.Sunlight is also important, especially if you're keeping tulips indoors. As they start to bloom, tulips need exposure to direct sunlight for six to eight hours a day.

, For best results, tulips should be harvested during what is called the advanced bud stage. At this point, blossoms should still be closed. However, the stems should have risen sufficiently out of the ground and the blossoms should be a dark, strong color., Start low to the ground when picking tulips, grabbing onto the base of a tulip's stem. Reach as close to soil level as possible and grasp the stem. Pull upward to remove the stem from the ground., In some cases, the bulb found underneath the soil is uprooted with the stem. If you pull up the tulip's bulb, this should be removed. Cut off the bulb using a pair of gardens shears., Use floral paper wrapped into a funnel shape to secure the upper two thirds of the flower. Stems can sometimes bend after tulips are picked, so wrapping the tulips in paper can keep the stems straight. After wrapping your tulips in paper, place the stems in water and leave them for a few hours to encourage proper stem growth., After bringing your tulips home, take a pair of garden shears. Use these to cut about one quarter of an inch (about .6 centimeters) from the tips of each tulip., Just after trimming your tulip stems, immerse the stems in water. You do not need to add any fertilizer or other additives to the water. Simple tap water should be enough to keep tulips strong., If you want to dry your tulips to preserve them, strip away any unwanted leaves and cut the tulips to your desired length. Hang your tulips from a flower using unscented dental floss in a dark area with good circulation, such as an attic or closet. Hang the tulips from their stems so the flowers point downwards. Tulips take two to three weeks to dry., Each day, pour out the old water and replace it with fresh water. Trim another half inch off the tulip's stem during this time. This will help the tulips stay strong longer., Tulips thrive in colder temperatures. To keep your tulips fresh longer, store them in a cold room in your home. Keep them away from sources of heat, such as ovens., Once tulips bloom, they have a shelf life even with proper care. Tulips will begin to wilt in three to seven days. After this time has passed, discard your tulips."

Rub your hand across the seeded area of the sunflower.,
Rinse the seeds.,
Dry the seeds.,
Salt and roast the seeds, if desired.If you plan to consume the seeds soon, you can salt and roast them now.,
Store the seeds in an airtight container.",How to Harvest Sunflower Seeds," Sunflowers are ready to harvest once the heads become brown. If you have a particularly wet season however, they can go mouldy . You should prepare them for the drying process once the back of the head begins to turn yellow to yellow-brown.In order to harvest the seeds, the sunflower head must be completely dry. Otherwise, the flower will not surrender the seeds. A sunflower will reach this state naturally after a few days of beginning to wilt.
It is easier to dry sunflowers on the stem if you have dry, sunny weather. If you live in a moist climate, you may want to consider drying them off the stem, instead.
At least half of the yellow petals should have dropped before you start preparing the sunflower for harvest. The head of the flower should also begin to droop. It may look dead, but if it still has its seeds, then the sunflower is drying out in a healthy manner.
Examine the seeds. Even if they are still stuck on the flower head, they should begin to plump up. The seeds should also be hard and may have their trademark black-and-white striped shell, or purely black, depending on the type of sunflower.;
,


You could also use cheesecloth or similarly breathable fabric, but you should never use a plastic bag. Plastic will restrict the air flow, causing moisture to build up on the seeds. If too much moisture builds up, the seeds may turn rotted or moldy.
Tying a bag over the head prevents birds, squirrels, and most other wildlife from sneaking in and ""harvesting"" your sunflower seeds before you do. It also prevents the seeds from dropping to the ground and being lost.

, If the bag gets wet or torn, carefully remove it and replace it with a fresh, intact paper bag.


You may be able to prevent the bag from getting wet during a rainstorm by temporarily placing a plastic bag over it. Do not tie the plastic bag onto the flower head, though, and remove it as soon as the rain lets up to prevent mold from setting in.
Change the paper bag as soon as it gets wet. A wet paper bag is more likely to be torn, and mold may even develop on the seeds if they sit in a wet bag for an extended period of time.
Collect any seeds that may have dropped off into the old bag when changing it out. Examine the seeds for signs of possible damage, and if they are in good shape, store them in airtight containers until you are ready to harvest the remaining seeds.

, Once the back of the flower heads turn brown, cut them off and prepare to harvest the seeds.


Leave roughly 1 ft (30.5 cm) of stem attached to the flower head.
Make sure that the paper bag is still securely tied onto the flower head. If it slips off as you remove and transport the sunflower head, you may lose a significant number of seeds.

, Sunflowers are ready to be dried once the back of the head begins to turn a deep yellow to yellow-brown.


The sunflower head must be dried before you collect the seeds. Sunflower seeds are easy to remove when dry, but nearly impossible to remove when still moist.
Most of the yellow petals should have dropped off by this point, and the head may begin to droop or wilt.
The seeds should feel hard when tapped and should also have a black-and-white striped appearance, or perhaps all black, depending on the type of sunflower.

, Secure a brown paper bag over the head of the sunflower using twine, yarn, or string.


Do not use a plastic bag. Plastic will not allow the flower head to ""breathe,"" so moisture may build up inside the bag in excess. If this happens, the seeds could rot or develop mold, making them unfit for consumption.
If you do not have brown paper bags, you could use a cheesecloth or other similarly breathable fabric.
By drying the sunflower off the stem, you do not need to worry about animals eating the seeds before you can get to them. You still need to place the bag over the sunflower head for the sake of collecting loose seeds, though.

,


Leave roughly 1 ft (30.5 cm) of stem attached to the head.
Work carefully so that you do not knock the paper bag from the head as you remove it.

, Let the sunflower head continue drying in a warm location.


Hang the sunflower by tying a piece of twine, yarn, or string to the base of the head and attaching the other end of the twine to a hook, rod, or hanger. The sunflower should dry stem-side up and head-side down.
Dry the sunflower in a warm, dry location indoors. The area should have good ventilation to prevent moisture from building up. You should also hang the sunflower head high above the ground or floor to prevent rodents from nibbling at them.

, Carefully open the bag on a daily basis. Empty the contents of the bag to collect any seeds that fall off early.


Store these seeds in an airtight container until the remainder are ready to harvest.

, The sunflower seeds are ready to harvest once the back of the head turns dark brown and very dry.


The drying process takes an average of one to four days, but it may take a little longer depending on how early you harvest the flower head and the conditions in which the flower dries.
Do not remove the bag until you are prepared to harvest the seeds. Otherwise, you may drop and lose many of the seeds.

, Move the sunflower head to a table, counter, or other work surface before removing the paper bag.


Empty the contents of the bag. If there are seeds inside the bag, transfer them to a bowl or storage container.

, To remove the seeds, simply brush them with your hands or a stiff vegetable brush.If harvesting seeds from more than one sunflower, you can remove the seeds by gently rubbing two flower heads together.
Continue rubbing the flower heads until all the seeds are dislodged.

, Transfer the collected seeds to a colander and rinse them thoroughly with cold, running water.


Allow the seeds to drain completely before removing them from the colander.
Rinsing the seeds removes most of the dirt and bacteria that may have gathered on the seeds while they were outdoors.

, Spread the seeds out on a thick towel in a single layer and let them dry for several hours.


You could also dry the seeds on multiple layers of paper towel instead of a single thick towel. Either way, they should be flat and in a single layer so that each seed can dry completely.
As you spread the seeds out, you should remove any debris or other foreign matter you notice. You should also remove any damaged seeds.
Make sure that the seeds are completely dry before proceeding to the next step.

,


Soak the seeds overnight in a solution made from 2 quarts (2 liters) of water and 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) salt.
Alternatively, you could also boil the seeds in this salt water solution for two hours instead of soaking them overnight.
Drain the seeds on dry, absorbent paper towel.
Spread the seeds out in a single layer on a shallow baking sheet. Roast for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown, at an oven temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius). Stir the seeds occasionally as they roast.
Let cool completely.

, Transfer the seeds, roasted or unroasted, to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator or freezer.


Roasted seeds are best stored in the refrigerator and may be kept for several weeks.
Unroasted seeds can be kept for several months inside the refrigerator or freezer and last longest inside the freezer.

Hunt for purslane in sunny locations with loose, well-drained soil.Purslane is a resilient plant that can crop up in many locations.,
Identify purslane.,
Squeeze the stem to check for a milky sap.,
Cut purslane with scissors or shears.",How to Harvest Purslane1," It prefers full sun and soil that drains well. Check planter boxes, raised flower beds, cracks in cement work, and the edges of lawns for purslane.Purslane begins growing after the last frost of the season. Look for purslane four to six weeks after the first frost in spring or anytime during summer.;
, The stalks of this plant are oval and red in color. Plants often reach up to 12 in (30.5 cm) long. The leaves are shiny, smooth, and paddle shaped. When in the sunlight, you may see small yellow flowers on this plant. Each flower should have five petals.All parts of common purslane are edible. However, all foraged greens should be washed thoroughly in cold water before being eaten., Purslane is similar in appearance to a poisonous plant called the Hairy-Stemmed Spurge. Verify that potential purslane isn’t this poisonous plant by breaking its stem and squeezing it with your fingers. If the plant produces a milky sap, it is poisonous and should not be eaten., Wild purslane should be snipped close to the base of the stem. Hold the tip of the purslane with your hand to improve your access to its base and cut the stem. Harvest purslane in this fashion until you’ve collected as much as you desire or have exhausted the plant.

Harvesting purslane earlier in the day will result in a stronger lemony flavor in the plant. The intensity of this flavor decreases with later harvesting times.The leaves of purslane are ideal for harvest when young. Young leaves are flexible and have a slight shine.As you cut the purslane, remove dead leaves, dirt, twigs, and other debris from the plants to make cleaning them easier later."
"
Purchase purslane seeds.,
Choose a suitable patch of soil for planting.,
Plant purslane in spring or summer.,
Water purslane in arid climates, heatwaves, and droughts.,
Manage purslane size with frequent harvesting.",How to Harvest Purslane2," These can be bought at many flower shops, nurseries, home and garden centers, and most greenhouses. Two common varieties suitable for a home garden include golden purslane (Portulaca sativa) and garden purslane (Portulaca oleracea).Store seeds in a cool, dry, dark location while waiting to plant., Your purslane will thrive in full sunlight and porous soil. If these conditions are unavailable, make a planter box and fill it with potting soil. Position the planter so it receives at least eight hours of sunlight., Purslane should be planted in spring when there is no longer any risk of frost or at any point in summer. Scatter the purslane seeds over your planting area. Drag a garden rake lightly over the soil after scattering the seeds. Tamp the soil lightly with a shovel or a similar garden tool.As long as you allow a few plants to mature to adulthood and seed, your purslane crop will continue to grow every year.
Purslane generally takes about four to six weeks before it is ready to harvest. In ideal conditions, your purslane may be ready to harvest even sooner., Purslane requires very little in the way of care once it is planted. In dry conditions, however, you should water the plants enough to keep the soil from drying out., Purslane can get out of hand quickly if left to its own devices. Harvest your purslane regularly to keep it manageable. Cut purslane with scissors or garden shears at the base of its stalk when harvesting."
"
Keep unwashed purslane in your refrigerator.,
Clean the purslane thoroughly before eating.,
Store cleaned purslane in a freezer for up to a year.,
Dry purslane and use it in smoothies.",How to Harvest Purslane3," After your purslane is harvested, put it in a plastic bag and insert it into your refrigerator. This will keep the purslane good for about a week. Be sure to wash the plant before eating, especially if it has been foraged.

If a refrigerator is unavailable, store the purslane in a cooler bag or similar container. This will keep the purslane fresh for several days., Transfer harvested purslane to a colander. Rinse the plant under a stream of clean, cold water. Shake excess moisture from the cleaned purslane, pat it dry with paper towel or a clean dishcloth, and it’s ready to eat.While rinsing, use your clean hands to spread the leaves to ensure bugs and dirt have been removed.

, When the purslane is clean and completely dry, put it in a freezer bag. Excess moisture may cause freezer burn or worsen the quality of purslane once it is thawed. Write the date on the bag, store it in your freezer, and use it within a year., Once your purslane is clean, remove the leaves from the stems and spread the leaves in a thin layer on a baking sheet. Set your oven to its lowest setting and insert the sheet. When the purslane becomes brittle, it's finished.

Keep a close eye on purslane while in the oven to prevent it from burning. Handle the hot baking sheet with an oven mitt or potholder when removing it from the oven.
Dried purslane can be kept as whole leaves, crushed, or powdered. To crush or powder the leaves, pulse them on a low setting with a blender or food processor until the desired fineness is achieved.
You can add purslane to smoothies or sprinkle it in with other recipes to add some extra nutritional value. Powdered purslane can also be used as a thickener."

Harvest red clover early in the day.,
Conduct your first cutting before the plant’s first mid-bloom.,
Cut at the second mid-bloom.,
Don’t cut at or after full bloom.,
Avoid harvesting during hot and dry weather.,
Cut the stem above the leaf growth.,
Cut leaves.,
Avoid plants with discolored flowers or leaves.,
Place your harvest on trays or racks to dry.,
Put your dried clover into an airtight container.,
Store your red clover in a shaded, dry, and cool location.,
Use red clover as a garnish.,
Incorporate red clover into food dishes.,
Take red clover as a homeopathic medicine.",How to Harvest Red Clover," The best time to cut red clover is early in the morning, right after the dew has dried. This way, it’ll still be somewhat cool out and the plant will have some time to recover before the hottest point of the day. If you cut late in the day, you might weaken and hurt the plant., Mid-bloom is when half of the red clover plants in a given location (a field, your garden, or yard) have at least one flower. Harvesting at this point should yield sweet red clover flowers and leaves. This should not hurt yields for later harvests.

The first mid-bloom of the year will typically be in the spring., Depending on your region, you’ll likely be able to get another harvest in about six weeks after your first harvest. To do this, wait until the plant blooms fully and then gets to another mid-bloom.

The second mid-bloom of the year will typically be in the summer, depending on region., Full bloom is when the vast majority of plants in a given location (a field, your garden, or your yard) have flowers that are blooming. Cutting at or after full bloom could harm the plant and potentially lower yield for the following season. As a result, if you plan to continually harvest a particular red clover patch, you should not harvest late into a bloom., Harvesting when environmental conditions are poor could harm red clover plants and negatively impact production. As a result, don’t harvest during drought and don’t harvest if it is unseasonably warm.

Make sure rain has been somewhat regular before harvesting., When harvesting red clover flower for personal consumption, cut the stem above the leaf growth. After cutting the stem from the plant, you’ll want to remove any remaining stem from the flower itself., Leaves may be cut from the stem in clumps of three. When cutting the leaves (or the flower), avoid cutting the entire plant at its base. While the plant can regrow more leaves and stems, you’ll hurt its ability to produce if you cut it too low. Remember, don’t waste any part of the plant you won’t use., Plants with discolored flowers or leaves could be sickly. Harvesting sick or weak plants could not only hurt the plant (and make it so the plant can’t recover from the harvest), but it could impact the flavor and quality of whatever you produce with it.

Allow plants with discolored flowers or leaves to grow until the next season. If they still appear discolored, uproot them., Unless you choose to eat the leaves or flowers when they are fresh, you need to dry out your harvest so you can store it properly. To do this, place wire racks or trays with leaves and flowers in a shaded area. Then, allow them to turn crisp.

Make sure wherever you lay your harvest is not too moist or humid. Your harvest could mold or mildew.
If you want to speed up the drying process, consider placing your harvest in a dehydrator., After you’ve dried your clover leaves or flowers, you need to store them appropriately. Gently place them into some sort of airtight container. When you’re done, close the container as tight as you can.

Use mason jars, Tupperware, or other similar containers., Take your containers full of dried red clover and place them in a part of your house that is cool and dry. This is important, as the cooler and dryer the location, the higher the chances that you’ll be able to store your clover for a substantial period of time.

Store your red clover in a place with temperatures lower than 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) and 60% humidity., You can use red clover as a garnish for a wide variety of dishes. However, due to its lightly sweet, floral flavor, it is very suited to desserts and sweet entrees.

Sprinkle red clover flower over vanilla or strawberry ice cream.
Place several red clover leaves on top of a sweet, creamy soup.
Sprinkle red clover flower and leaves over a sweet chicken or fish plate. Light tasting fish work best. Try like flounder, cod, whitefish, grouper or tilapia., Use red clover as the base of food dishes or substitute it for other ingredients. By using red clover in your cooking, you'll make seemingly boring recipes exciting again.

Create a red clover flour and use it in baked goods. For example, use some red clover flour in sugar cookies, pound cakes, or cup cakes.
Incorporate red clover leaves into steamed vegetable dishes, like steamed spinach.
Add red clover to spring or summer soups. Soups that have mint, asparagus, or peas will benefit from the addition of red clover., Many people consume red clover as a homeopathic remedy for a wide variety of ailments. Some of them include:

Cancer
Osteoporosis

, If you go out just hoping to come across a patch of them then you are wrong! You have to plan ahead and find somewhere close to you. Otherwise, it's a wasted journey and a waste of petrol! However, if you have in your own garden, then pick away!

, Raspberries can be harvested all the way from mid-summer through to the first frost. The fruit is ripe when it can be easily be removed from the plant without being squashed. Fruit ripens at different times, so you will be able to harvest raspberries throughout the season. By autumn they have usually gone past it.See ""Tips"" for more information.

, If you are picking black, golden or purple raspberries, look for berries with firm plumpness. If they are almost a neon red they are slightly passed their best so don't pick them.

, Do not pick ones that have a hole in them as an insect has probably got there before you.

,, Raspberries do not store well and spoil quickly after being picked. Brambles and blackberries are picked in the same way so keep that in mind if you have a bush or two of them! Read how to store raspberries for advice on how to keep them fresh for up to 6 days.

Prune and harvest when the flowers bloom.,
Gather the lavender into a bunch.,
Cut the lavender a few inches above the woody growth.,
Cut the lavender stems in order of blooming.,
Remove the dead leaf matter.",How to Harvest Lavender1," Pruning and harvesting lavender are essentially the same - you're removing the flowering stalks from the bush. This promotes new growth in the plant's roots, keeps the plant looking neat, and leaves you with 1 - 8 bunches of fresh lavender flowers. Lavender should be cut when the flower have just opened in spring. This is the time during which they're most fragrant and beautiful.Monitor the lavender in the early spring so you can catch it right when the flowers open.
If you cut lavender in the spring, the plant may have time to produce more flowers for a second harvest.;
, Use your hands to gather enough stalks to comfortably fit in your fist. This is one bunch of lavender. The stalks are quite hardy, so you can gather from all parts of the bush without worrying about tearing it apart.


A first-year lavender bush will typically produce only enough flowers to form one or two bunches.
Lavender bushes reach full maturity by the third year, during which they may produce 8 - 10 bunches of lavender.

, If you examine the lavender bush, you'll see it's rooted to the ground with tough, woody growth, above which grow the green stalks - green growth. Cutting into the woody growth can hurt the plant. Give it plenty of room by cutting about two inches above the end of the woody growth.


The best cutting tool for lavender is called a harvesting knife. It's curved like a scythe and has a serrated edge. If you don't have one on hand, a hand pruner will also work fine.
When using a harvesting knife, hook it around the bunched lavender and pull the knife toward you, cutting off the lavender stalks.
Continue cutting the lavender until all the stalks have been cut, and the bush that remains is shaped in a neat-looking mound.
Cut after the dew has dried but before the heat of the sun draws out too much of the essential oils (you will want those intact to evoke the scent in your home).

, The first harvest will be early in the flower cycle. As the bush continues producing more flowers throughout the season, cut when necessary. Areas of smaller variety lavender will tend to flower in patches, and should be harvested in timely order that way, to encourage re~flowering. In general, lavender will act like any other flowering plant, when they are de-flowered early enough, at the base of the flower, a new flower grows, giving you more than one harvest per year.


Blooms should be ready for reharvest in 2 weeks to a month; when re-flowering slows (to approximately 1 month), do one final harvest.

, Cut back any stalks that are dead, along with any stringy twigs and other plant clutter. You will almost always be ""pruning"" for harvest, but sometimes it's necessary to prune unsightly plant matter at the end of the season. Don't cut into the woody growth.

Dry the lavender in bunches or on screens.,
Store in a cool, dark place.,
De-stem your lavender if desired.,
Use the lavender in cooking and crafts.",How to Harvest Lavender2," You can use a food dehydrator, hang it upside down in to dry in a cool, dark spot in your home, or dry it outside on screens in the sun. The latter method affects the color of the dried lavender, since time in the sun will lighten it.


If you opt to hang your lavender to dry, use twine or twist ties to gather the stalks in bunches and hang the bunches upside down off of hooks or nails. Retie the stocks as necessary to keep them together, since they will shrink while drying.

, Storing the lavender away from sun and heat will help it last as long as possible

, The small variety of lavender makes the finest final product, but requires the most additional processing. To remove the flowers from the stems, lay the lavender between 2 1'x 2' sheets of plywood. Crush and roll the stems between the wood pieces. Pour the crushed lavender through a sieve to catch the flowers.

, Now it's time to put the lavender to use. You can placed the dried stems in vases to decorate your home, use the flowers to make sachets, or make delicious confections with your harvest. Here are a few ideas:

Dig up the cattails.",How to Get Rid of Cattails1," To get rid of cattails, you need to completely remove the root system. Cattails propagate through rhizomes. The rhizomes send out additional roots horizontally, quickly resulting in new plants. Manual removal is most effective if you dig out the rhizomes when cattails are first establishing themselves in a pond.


Dig down below the root system to remove the cattails. Dispose of the cattails.
Consider using a backhoe for manual removal if you need to remove a larger amount of cattail stands.;
