Figure out how much food your goat needs.,
Provide colostrum for very young goats.,
Use natural ingredients if possible.,
Determine how often to feed your goat.,
Put the formula in an ordinary bottle.",How to Bottlefeed Goat Kids1," Goats need different amounts of food depending on their weight. As overfeeding can cause serious health problems, determine how much to feed your goat before gathering your supplies.Weigh your goat. If you don't have a scale yourself, you can take your goat to a livestock vet.
Convert their weight into ounces and find 10 to 12% of their total body weight.
Divide this number by four. Feed your goat that amount four times a day.
For example, say your goat weighs 96 ounces. It would need around 10 ounces of milk a day. You would feed your goat a little over three ounces of food three times a day.;
, Colostrum is the milk a mother produces when a goat is first born. In the event your young goat was rejected or abandoned by its mother, you will have provide colostrum yourself. It is difficult for a goat to survive without a steady intake of colostrum.You need to get a baby goat colostrum within its first 24 hours of life. If you have a goat on your farm that recently gave birth, milk that goat and bottle feed your goat the mother's milk.
However, you may not always have real colostrum on hand. In the event you don't have colostrum, there are many online providers that allow you to purchase colostrum.
If you know you're raising goats, freeze milk from goats who have recently given birth or keep colostrum substitute on hand. It's vital to get colostrum to a goat as soon as possible.

, When bottle feeding, it's always best to get your goat as natural ingredients possible. These will best assure your goat gets the vitamins and minerals it needs to thrive. Go for goat's milk or cow's milk, which you an find at most grocery stores.Never feed a baby goat powdered milk or canned milk. These can cause health issues.
If you're using cow's milk, add three tablespoons of corn syrup per gallon of cow's milk.

, In general, you should aim to feed your goat around three or four times a day. Space out feedings over the course of a day, as kids need to eat on and off all day. If your goat is looking for food and seems hungry, bottle feed it as needed. However, keep the total amount you feed within the range you calculated based on the goat's weight.If your goat is three weeks old or older, provide hay and water for free feeding as well.

, Place the proper amount of milk in a regular baby bottle. You do not need a special bottle to bottle feed a goat. Pick up a conventional baby bottle from a department store for the feeding process."

Keep your goat clean and trimmed.",How to Raise Goats," Before you purchase any goats, it's a good idea to think long and hard about why you want them.


Do you want them for milk? For meat or fiber? Or do you just think they'd make a cute pet? The motivation behind your decision to raise goats will influence what breed of goat you will buy and how you'll raise them.
Keeping goats is a big commitment - you'll need to feed them everyday, pay for their food and veterinary bills, and ensure that they are healthy and happy - so make sure that you are prepared to take this responsibility on board.
Take the time to read a few books or talk to someone who knows about goats so you have all the details before you jump in head first.;
, As mentioned above, the type of goats you choose will be influenced by whether you want them for milk, meat or fiber. You will also need to consider the goats' size, temperament and care requirements. Some of the most popular breeds are as follows:



Dairy Goats: Alpine, La Mancha, Nubian, Oberhasli, Saanen and Sable, and Toggenburg.

Meat Goats: Boer, Kiko, Spanish, Savannah, Texmaster, Genemaster and Moneymaker.

Fiber Goats: Angora (which produce Mohair), Cashmere, Pygora and Nigora.

Pet Goats: Miniature goat breeds like Nigerian Dwarfs, Pygmy Goats and Kinder tend to make the best pets.

, Ideally, you should have a large outdoor area where your goats can range, browse and get the exercise they need to stay healthy. The goats will also need an indoor space for rest and shelter.


The general rule of thumb is to provide 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) of space for every standard size adult goat. Miniature breeds will require slightly less space.It's important not to overcrowd your goats or keep them in confined spaces. This will cause them to become stressed and unhealthy, and may contribute to the spread of disease.

, If you decide to go ahead and start your herd of goats, it's important to know what to look for. You don't want to buy a sick or unhealthy goat that doesn't meet your needs.


Look for bright-eyed and alert goats which move around quickly and easily, with an even gait.
Run your hands over the goat's body to check for any lumps or bumps - as this could indicate the presence of an abscess. Check the goat's droppings to make sure they are firm, not runny.
Look for goats with deep, rounded bellies, wide-set hips and large milk sacks with downward-pointing udders (in does). If possible, you should also try milking any potential does, to make sure they have a good temperament and that the milk comes easily.If you're buying dairy goats, make sure they are friendly and not skittish, as you will need to get close to them in order to milk them.

, When starting out, it's a good idea to just purchase does, as only they can bear kids and produce milk.


Bucks can be aggressive and start to smell as they grow older. The pheromones they release can also affect the flavor of the does' milk if they are kept in close quarters.
Unless you want to raise a large herd of goats, it's better just to borrow a buck when you need one for breeding, rather than purchasing one yourself.
Wethers are castrated male goats, and are only useful for providing meat (or as pets). However, if you wait until the first baby goats arrive (which have a 50/50 chance of being male) you will be able to sell the young bucks for a particular type of goat's meat called chevon, which is popular for its lamb-like flavor. , You have a number of options when it comes to buying does - which option you decide to go for will depend on your budget and how soon you want your goats to produce milk or have kids.



Buy a doeling: A baby doe, or doeling can be as young as 8 weeks old, as this is the soonest they can be weaned from their mothers. Doelings are relatively cheap to buy, but you will have to wait about a year and half before you can breed them, and another five months before they will start to produce milk.

Buy a junior doe: A junior doe is a young doe that hasn't been bred yet. These are more expensive than doelings as you don't have to wait as long to breed them and start producing milk. Sometimes you can buy a young doe that has already been bred (i.e pregnant), so you only have to wait 5 months before she starts producing milk, but you will have to buy a breeding fee.

Buy a doe in milk: A final option is to buy a senior doe who is already producing milk. This option is faster and cheaper than the previous ones, however there is a much higher risk that the doe you buy will have problems, as breeders will usually try to sell off the weakest animals in their herd., Goats are herd animals, which means that they prefer to live in groups. Therefore, you will need to buy a minimum of two goats to start off.


Many people make the mistake of buying only one goat. Single goats get lonely and will become very loud, as they bleat and call out for company.
If possible, try to buy two goats from the same herd (especially if they're related). This will help them to adjust to their new surroundings much more quickly.
Under certain circumstances, goats will bond with other hoofed creatures, such as sheep, cows and horses, so this is an option if you already own some of these animals., As mentioned in the previous section, goats will require a sheltered indoor area for sleeping, feeding and protection from the weather and night-time predators.


The housing does not need to be very elaborate, and as long as the goats have plenty of outdoor space to roam around during the day, it doesn't have to be very large - goats like to sleep together in small groups.
You just need to make sure that the shelter stays dry and draft-free. It's also a good idea to have a small stall where you can place sick, injured or heavily pregnant goats.
The floor of the shelter should be covered in a thick layer of bedding, comprised of wood shavings (anything except cedar), straw or waste hay., Goats are notorious escape artists, as they can climb trees, jump over fences, chew through rope and wriggle their way through the smallest of spaces. Therefore, it is essential that you erect a strong, goat-proof fence around the enclosure.


Your fence should be a minimum of four feet high, or five feet for more active goat breeds such as Nubians. Wooden, stock panel or chain-link fences are all good options if you are building a new fence. However, if you simply want to goat-proof an existing fence, you can use high tensile, smooth electrified wire.
Also make sure to brace any gates or fence posts on the outside of the fence as this will prevent goats from climbing up them. You should also make sure that the goats' shelter does not have an easily climbable roof.

, Goats are browsers rather than grazers, which means that they prefer to eat twigs, leaves and weeds rather than plain grass.


This allows goats to be raised alongside sheep, cows and horses, as they do not compete for food. Goats can also be used to clear rough land and get rid of unwanted vegetation.
If you live in a green or wooded, rural location, feel free to put your goats out to pasture and let them forage for things like young shrubs and saplings, blackberry canes, poison ivy and clover, to name but a few.

, Goats will not get all the nourishment they need from browsing alone, so they will also need a large supply of good quality hay (or other forage crop). You can supply the hay free-choice -- meaning they can it as much or as little of it as they like.


Does that are pregnant or producing milk will have extra protein requirements, so they will also need a pound or two of grain each day. You should also supply your goats with a good free-choice mineral mix or mineral block, which is available in most feed stores.
In terms of treats, you can give your goats a wide selection of fruit and veg, including apples, pears, peaches, watermelon, banana, carrots, celery, squash and spinach. Just avoid giving them potatoes, tomatoes and kale, as these can be poisonous to goats., It is essential that your goats have a constant supply of fresh water, especially during very hot, dry weather. So depending on weather conditions, you will need to supply your goats with 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) to 4 gallons (15.1 L) of water per goat each day.


It's a good idea to plan out how you will supply your goats with water in advance, as you don't want to be stuck carrying buckets of water back and forth to their shelter each day. If you don't have one already, consider digging a water line to your goat shelter or barn or installing a stock tank.
If you have a creek or pond on your land, this is a convenient way of ensuring that your goats stay hydrated. However, make sure to get the water tested first to make sure it is safe for drinking. You will also need to watch out for contamination or stagnation., When your does reach maturity - which happens when they are 6 months old or weigh at least 60 pounds (for standard goats) - they are ready for breeding. Their yearly heat cycles usually begin around August or September.


If you don't own a buck, you can either hire a buck or bring your does to a farm that has a buck. You will have to pay a stud fee, which is usually somewhere between $50 to $100.
It can be difficult to tell if a doe is pregnant, so one of the best signs of a successful mating is a milky-white colored discharge coming from her nether regions.
A goat's pregnancy lasts for 150 days, or five months and most pregnancies will produce two kids, though sometimes there can be as many as four.

, Immediately after the baby goats are born, give them a thorough rub down with a cloth to remove any blood or birthing material, or allow the mother to lick them clean. From this point on, there are two schools of thought when it comes caring for and feeding the kids.


Some people prefer to immediately separate the kids from their mother. To feed them, they milk the mother by hand then pour the milk into bottles to feed the kids. The reasoning behind this is that baby goats can be difficult to wean and cause the mother goat to produce less milk. It is also believed that bottle-fed goats will be be tamer and friendlier.However, others believe that separating the mother from her babies is cruel and unnecessary. They allow the mother to feed the babies herself (though you will want to keep a watchful eye to make sure none of the kids are left out) and will only separate them when the kids are ready to be weaned, between 8 and 12 weeks old.Which route you decide to go down is a matter of personal preference and will depend on whether you value increased milk production above a more natural process.

, If you aren't interested in significantly increasing the size of your herd, you will have to decide what to do with the kids.


Young does are usually easy to deal with, as the demand for milk-producing does is high and you can sell them on to other goat owners as soon as they are weaned. If you like, you can keep the female offspring of your best milker, as she can take her mother's place in a couple of years time.
Bucks are slightly more difficult. The majority of young bucks should be castrated by the time they are three weeks of age, as they will ultimately be sold for meat. You can do this as soon as they are weaned, or wait until they have reached maturity. If you want, you can keep one buck as a breeding sire.

, Once a doe has produced her first offspring, she will start producing milk and will continue to do so for approximately 305 days following delivery.


The milk flow is usually highest 2 to 3 months after giving birth then tapers off towards the end of the lactation cycle. The doe will require a two month ""dry spell"" before she gives birth a second time and begins producing milk again - an event which is known as ""freshening"" in the dairy world.
If you have never milked an animal before, it is important to get the technique right. Rather than tugging on the teat, you need to wrap your hand around it, cutting off the milk supply at the top using your thumb and forefinger. Then you can use your other fingers to squeeze the teat and extract the milk.
At first, you might find milking to be somewhat slow and awkward, and it could take you up to 30 minutes per goat. But once you get the hang of it you'll be able to do it in a jiffy!
You should milk your goats once in the morning and once at night. During peak production, standard-sized goats will produce up to 3 quarts of milk per day, while miniature goats will produce slightly less., It's important to be aware of the predators in your area so you can take steps towards protecting your goats.


Common goat predators include dogs, coyotes, cougars, and birds such as ravens and vultures. Some of these predators will carry your goats (especially the kids) away, while others will injure them so badly that they will need to be put down.
The best way to keep your goats safe is to lock them in a secured building (with no open windows or doors) every night. You should also consider getting a livestock guardian dog to fend off predators 24/7.
If you need to deter vultures specifically, the USDA recommends hanging a vulture carcass (which doesn't have to be real) from a tree or post.
You should also avoid tethering your goats, as this makes them an easy target for any predators. Leaving them loose in an enclosed space with a high fence is much safer., You will inevitably have to deal with a sick goat at one point or another, so it's important to be able to read the signs:


Some of the most common and visible symptoms of a sick goat are: not eating or drinking, crusty eyes, diarrhea, hot udders, pressing its face against a wall or fence, coughing, crying or calling more than usual, grinding teeth, separating itself from the group, pale eyelids and grey gums.
The sooner you call the vet to treat your goat, the greater the chance of restoring the goat to full health. Your goats will also need yearly vaccinations against tetanus and enterotoxemia (an overeating disease) and you will need to watch out for parasites like lice and ticks., In general, goats don't require too much grooming (except for the long haired varieties), but you will need to give them some attention every now and then in order to keep them clean and comfortable.



Brushing and bathing: Goats should be brushed at least once a year (preferably at the start of summer when they're shedding) with a firm-bristled grooming brush. This removes dandruff and loose hair, stimulates blood flow, and gives you a chance to check for any lumps on the skin or other signs of diseases. Bathing your goats is not strictly necessary, but it helps to remove lice and makes clipping easier.

Clipping: You will need to clip your goats hair at least once a year, to help them stay cool throughout the summer. You may want to clip the tail and udder regions of female goats more frequently, to help keep them clean during milking and kidding season. You will also need to bathe and clip them more frequently if you plan on entering them in shows.

Trimming hooves: You will also need to trim your goats' hooves about once a month, otherwise they will become overgrown and hard to walk on. This is a relatively quick and easy process, which you can do with a packet or roofing knife.

Sanitize everything that you will be using.,
Prepare a grain bucket.,
Lead your goat to the milking stand.,
Shave the udder.,
Wash down the udder and teats.,
Use a pre-dip on the teats.,
Use single-use paper towels to wash/dry teats.,
Inspect the teats for mastitis.,
Begin milking within 60-120 seconds of teat preparation.,
Place the bucket on the stand.,
Dip, strip, and wipe.,
Wrap your thumb and forefinger around the base of the teat.,
Squeeze with your middle finger, then your ring finger, and then your pinky, in one smooth, successive motion, top-down, from udder to teat.,
Understand what works best for your goat.,
Relax your grip on the base of the teat to allow milk to refill the teat.

,
Repeat steps 6-8, with one hand on each teat.,
Stop when you see that there isn't much milk left.,
Massage the teats after milking.,
Take the bucket away, and put it somewhere that it won't get knocked over by a curious or oblivious goat.,
Use a teat dip (iodine solution) after you are done milking.,
Grab the goat's collar (or attach a leash) and unclip the stanchion.

,
Lead your goat back to her pen.",How to Milk a Goat by Hand," All equipment and utensils should be thoroughly washed in water between 100-120 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8-48.9 degrees Celsius), using an alkaline-based or chlorinated cleaner. This is to prevent the growth and spread of bacteria. It is best to sanitize equipment 30 minutes or fewer before use., Use one pound or less of grain in the feed bucket, as any more grain may cause bloating., Put a little feed in place and she will put her head through the stanchion. Once she does that, clip it closed.The stanchion should be comfortably loose, but not so loose as to allow her to slip her head back through once closed. If you get your goat used to the routine, it will easily come up and jump onto the stanchion., This will prevent dirt and grit from falling into the milk, which is crucial to keeping the milk clean and safe., Using a sterilized cloth and warm water, wring out the cloth so it's not soaking wet and wipe down the teats thoroughly.


Using warm water is important because it relaxes the goat and helps with milk letdown.You should also gently massage the teats and udder while wiping them clean. Udder massage induces the release of oxytocin, which triggers milk letdown in lactating farm animals., Pre-dip products kill bacteria without drying out the teats, and should be left on for a minimum of 30 seconds.


Some farmers prefer pre-dip instead of washing because the pre-dip does not create a warm, wet environment like washing does, which is conducive to bacterial growth., And be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before milking each goat. This step is important to minimize the risk of spreading mastitis bacteria from infected goats to healthy goats.It may be helpful to wear disposable gloves while milking each goat to further reduce the risk of infection.

, Look for redness, swelling, heat, and signs of pain, as well as abnormal milk secretions during milking., This is to capitalize on your goat's optimal milk let-down time.

, Position the milking pail so that it is centered in line with the direction of spray from the goat's teats.

, Dip the teat in an iodine solution if you have not already used a pre-dip. Then squeeze out the goat's first milk stream, which is the most likely stream to contain bacteria. Then wipe with a clean, disposable paper towel, and begin milking as normal.Use a strip cup to collect the first milk stream. Your strip cup should have a black screen across the top to collect any irregular flakes or clots so that you can detect these irregularities quickly., Keep your grip firm but not too tight. Just apply enough pressure to trap the milk inside the teat., Remember to keep your grip tight on the base of the teat, or else instead of going into the bucket, the milk will slip right back up into the udder, which may cause infection.Don't pull on the teat! This will hurt the goat, and it may damage the teat., Every goat is different. Different goats will have different sized and shaped teats, so if your hands are bigger than the teats you may have to learn to use fewer fingers.,, Alternate, with one teat being squeezed while the other teat refills. With practice, you will find an efficient rhythm.

, The teats will be flaccid, with almost a ""deflated"" appearance. Massage the udder to release the remaining milk. You should get another 4-8 ounces, but do not try to wring out every last drop., This can help prevent bacterial growth after the milking process has finished., Milk should be refrigerated down to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius) or cooler within two hours of milking., This will keep bacteria from infecting the teats after the milking process.,,


Be sure that your goat has enough water, as goats can become dehydrated during the milking process.Make sure that your goat is getting enough nutrients. Remember, a high-producing goat will need plenty of hay throughout the day and around one pound of grain for each three pounds of milk she's producing.Ensuring that your goats have adequate food and water is always important, but it is especially crucial during milking periods. Meeting these needs will keep your goats happy and healthy.

Try many times a day at first.,
Get the bottle in a similar position to a mother's natural stance.,
Allow the goat to take the milk naturally.",How to Bottlefeed Goat Kids2," Have patience when you first start the feeding process. Some goats will take to the bottle without trouble. Others, however, may be hesitant to feed early on. You may have to try several times a day at first to get your goat to get the proper amount of milk per day.You will have to hold the goat and have a helper hold its mouth open. Try squirting some of the milk into the goat's mouth to help it understand it needs to suckle to get food.
Some goats will understand right away, while others may take more work. You may have to feed your goat eight to 10 times a day at first, instead of three or four, in order to get your goat enough food.

, This can help the goat instinctively understand it needs to suckle. Try holding the bottle above the goat's head, roughly the same height as a mother goat. For younger goats, you may have to take the baby in your arms and hold the bottle near your chin.This tends to work better when your goat has previously fed from its mother.
It can sometimes help to have the goat suckle on your finger first, and then slip the bottle in its mouth.

, Once your goat understands what the bottle is for, try to get it to suckle naturally. After a few days of regular bottle feeding, your goat should take to the bottle without trouble. Force feeding by opening a goat's mouth and squirting the milk in should no longer be necessary."
"
Try to get colostrum naturally, if possible.,
Consult a vet if your goat refuses to bottle feed.,
Avoid overfeeding your goat.",How to Bottlefeed Goat Kids3," While goats can still thrive on substitute colostrum, natural is usually best. A mother's milk has vital nutrients for survival, so if you can get your goat natural colostrum, go this route.Allow your goat to suckle from its mother for the first 24 hours.
If the goat has been abandoned by its mother, provide colostrum from another goat who has recently given birth.

, Goats need to bottle feed if they're not being fed by a mother. It's normal for a goat to take a few days to take to the bottle. However, if it's been more than a few days and a goat is not feeding regularly, consult a veterinarian. You can find a livestock vet online or in your local yellow pages.Ask something like, ""Is there anything I can do to get my goat to take to its bottle?""

, Weigh your goat regularly and adjust its feeding by weight, using the same calculation involving 10 to 12% of the goat's body weight. Overfeeding can cause serious problems. If your goat seems to be putting on a lot of weight, you may need to reduce feeding. Talk to a vet if you're concerned about your goat's weight."

Consider whether these bees are in your area.,
Look for foragers.,
Keep you eyes peeled for a hollow space.,
Look for the glistening of resin around the nest entrance.,
Keep an eye out for swarms.,
Look for the natural enemies of the bees.",How to Find a Wild Native Australian Beehive," If you don't live in Australia, you will obviously not find one of these beehives. Other places you may not be able to find them in: Central Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Southern Western Australia and Tasmania.
, If you see many of them heading in a similar direction, the hive may be in that direction. Do this in the late afternoon, when the sun is not in your eyes, or on a cloudy day, so you can see the black bodies against the grey., These bees are not fussy about tree species and will nest inside any type of tree with a suitable hollow, and they may even be found nesting in man-made boxes such as water meters!, Red or orange resin is a telltale sign of a beehive in a tree or other space.

, The stingless bee swarms are different to honey bee swarms. They do not happen when they are founding a new hive, but when they are fighting with another bee colony. If you see thousands of small black bees buzzing frantically, it is a good sign that there is a beehive nearby., The natural enemies of these bees, such as Bembix Wasps and Syrphid Flies may be seen around nests and are larger and more conspicuous than the bees themselves.

Pick a frame feeder.,
Try a Boardman feeder.,
Get an inverted feeder.,
Set up a Miller feeder.,
Wear a beekeeper suit.,
Smoke the bees before opening a feeder.,
Mix one part sugar and two parts water to stimulate egg laying.,
Mix one part sugar and one part water to promote honeycomb building.,
Mix two parts sugar with one part water to save food for the winter.,
Set up supplies for winter first.,
Mix spring recipes.,
Feed in times of need.",How to Feed Bees," This is the most common feeder to use. These can be wood or plastic. You want to pick a feeder in the 1-2 gallon range. Some models come with coarse siding to let the bees climb along the sides. Other models have features such as floats to prevent the bees from drowning if water collects inside. You can also find models that are portioned into multiple frames that allow access for multiple hives. Look for ease of access for yourself including the ability to open up the feeder to change spoiled feed.If you go with the frame feeder you’ll need to fill it correctly. Get a funnel (metal or plastic) or make your own funnel out of thick paper. Hover the funnel over the chambers, and slowly pour the syrup feed until the brood chambers in the feeder are just short of full.;
, If you’re worried about bees drowning, then use this instead of the frame or Miller feeders. These wood feeders are shaped roughly like a large box. They hold an upside-down mason jar full of the feed you intend to use. You put the jar in the entrance, and the bees wander up into the jar for the syrup. These are easy to monitor, but you will have to shake off the bees from the jar to refill it., These are watercooler-sized wood feeders that work with inverted mason jars or metal cans full of feed. You place the jar of feed into the top entrance upside-down so the bees can fly into it. You can cover the entrance rim in #8 hardware cloth to prevent bees from hovering around the jar when you need to refill it.This feeder poses less of a drowning risk to the bees.

, If you are interested in handling more bees than the other feeders, then use this model. These are plywood feeders named after C.C. Miller. These feeders are much larger than average feeders with feed capacities typically up to 5 gallons. Miller feeders can have open access so the hive can fly throughout the feeder, or partitioned access so the bees can only get to the syrup. These partitions are really just trays with slots for bee access. But the trays need tight seals so foreign bees don’t drown in the syrup. You can pour the syrup into the trays at the ends, center, or all frames.These feeders can stack taller to hold more syrup, but may get used less by the bees leading to spoiling of the feed.

, You’ll need to purchase a cotton-based suit for comfort. It will need to have several features to allow you free range of motion, but keep out bees. Look for a suit that has leg zippers, knee pads, gusseted crotch, elastic wrists, and a double-ended main zipper. You’ll also need the suit to come with plenty of pockets including a holster for hive tools. The suit should have metal D-rings to tie down the mask or veil tie. Most suits are sting resistant, and not completely sting proof.Suit prices can vary depending on features and fabric quality. Some models can be $20 if you buy just a jacket and head covering. Some full suits can be upwards of $100.

, Light the smoker with a standard cigarette lighter or match applied to the kindling in the main container, but don’t let it get excessively hot. Puff only one or two spurts of smoke in entrance and along the top of the feeder to disarm the bees’ alert pheromones. Wait one full minute after the puffs before opening the hive. If you notice the bees are still agitated, only then use an extra puff or two.Some models come with liquid fuel, and a bellows attached. Follow the model’s instructions for lighting.
You’ll also need a metal prying tool to open the feeder.

, Combine 1 pound (0.45 kilograms) of sugar with 1 quart (0.9 liters) of water, or 5 pounds (2.2 kilograms) of sugar with 5 quarts (4 liters) of water. Stir the sugar into the warm water until dissolved.Use this when there is enough honey available for the brood to feed on.

, You can feed this to bees in the spring or summer. Pour 1 pound (0.45 kilograms) sugar into 2 cups of water (0.47 liters), or 5 pounds (2.2 kilograms) of sugar with 2.5 US quarts (2,000 ml) (2.4 liters) of water. Bring the water to a boil, and turn off the heat source. Stir in the sugar until dissolved and let it cool., Do this in the autumn. Combine 1 pound (0.45 kilograms) of sugar with 1 cup (0.23 liters) of water, or 5 pounds (2.2 kilograms) of sugar with 5 cups (1.15 liters) of water. Boil the water, and stir in the sugar. Stir the sugar until the crystals dissolve. Remove the mixture from the heat, and let it cool., Winter is the time that will be hardest to help bees that are starving. Start preparing and feeding the syrup recipes in August or September. You can wait until October, but waiting until December is risky. Though you should still attempt to feed the bees rather than allow them to starve.The amount of feed to store for winter is something you should ask your local beekeepers.

, Use the seasonally mixed syrups for longer term feeding or to boost the life of a new hive. Prepare 2-4 gallons of syrup early so you can start these syrup feedings in May. Introduce this syrup at the start of a new hive.Once the hive is well underway, don’t over feed.

, Extra feeding should generally be done only when the hive is undersized or starving to begin with. Your batches of syrup may spoil if you’ve prepared much more than the bees need.For example, if you have a hive that is supposed to weigh 150 pounds suddenly weighing 75 pounds, then it may be time to feed.

Choose a suitable feeder.,
Feed bees sugar water in the spring.,
Feed bees sugar water in the fall.,
Add the sugar water to the feeder.,
Replace as needed.",How to Feed Bees Sugar Water," There are a variety of feeders on the market: top feeders, bottom board feeders, and frame feeders.  


Use bottom board feeders when the weather is warmer (daytime temperatures  of 60+ degrees F)
Top and frame feeders can be used in slightly cooler weather, as the bees are not required to leave the hive.  
If you do not have a commercially-bought feeder, you could also use a ""baggy feeder"", which is simply a gallon ziplock bag, with a couple 1 inch slits slashed into it, that you can lay on top of the frames, in between the cluster and the inner cover (with the use of a spacer or shallow hive body).;
, For spring feeding, use a 1:1 ratio of sugar and water, for example, 6 cups of water to 6 cups of sugar. Heat the mixture on the stovetop until the sugar is completely dissolved. Make sure that the mixture does not boil, as boiled sugar has been shown to cause digestive problems for the bees.


This is a great time to add Honey B Healthy if you would like to give an extra health boost to your bees. The 1:1 ratio is also stimulates brood-rearing, so it is a great thing to feed to a recent split or caught swarm.

, For fall feeding, use a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water. The more concentrated sugar water will help the bees store the syrup faster for winter.

, Let the mixture cool, then add the sugar syrup to the feeder.

, Bees may go through a quart a day, so check often. When the honey flow begins, remove any feeders from the hive before you add the honey supers.

Prepare your supplies.,
Put the pot onto a source of heat.,
Prepare a container to receive the molten wax.,
Allow everything to cool overnight. 

,
Invert the whole lot, so the water runs out.,
Clean it further if necessary.",How to Clean Bees Wax," Collect wax that you need to clean, whether its old honeycomb, or whatever. Find a large cooking pot, preferably stainless steel, but aluminium will do.  Fill it with the wax to be cleaned.;
,  Add boiling water over the wax and let it simmer.

,  Ideally, this will be tall and narrow. Pour the wax into the cylinder, including all the old cell casings etc. Make sure you are also pouring in an amount of the boiling water.

,, You should be able to slide the block of wax out, and you will see that all the rubbish has aggregated on the bottom of the block.  This can now be scraped off, leaving the clean wax behind.

, Re-boil the cleaner block of wax and perhaps filter it to remove the finer particles as it goes back into a tall cylinder to cool.

Dress appropriately.,
Get a large jar with a tapered neck.,
Gather some small flowers to put inside the jar.,
Spread some honey around the jar.,
Watch for the bee and trap it at the right moment.,
Release the bee.",How to Catch a Bee Without Getting Stung1," Before you even think about approaching the bee, you need to dress the part of a bee catcher. Of course not everyone’s going to have a bee catcher’s suit to protect themselves from getting stung. Instead, dress as best as you can. Cover up as much of your skin and face as you can. Consider:


Wearing a long-sleeved hoodie. This will protect your neck, head, arms, and torso.
Wear long pants. Jeans are probably the best, because they are the toughest and thickest.
Try to layer when possible, bees can sting through clothing.;
, Now you’ve got to locate a large jar that you’ll later lure the bee into. Make sure it and its neck are large enough so the bee will be able to fly into it. Also make sure you’ve got something to cover or close the jar with once you’ve got the bee in it.

, Get yourself some relatively small flowers to put in the jar to lure the bee. Your flowers will be the main bait to catch the bee. There are many types of flowers that will work, but there are a few that are especially good for attracting bees and other pollinators:


Honeysuckle.
Bee Balm.
Lantana., Don’t use too much honey, and don’t use it in globs big enough to catch the bee. Just spread a little bit around the jar so that the bee will be even more attracted to it. If you are especially worried about hurting the bee, the best way to avoid that will be to put the honey underneath the flowers, so the bee will land on the flowers rather than the honey., You’ve got to stay diligent and watch to see when the bee flies into your trap. Once the bee has flown in, quickly put your top on the jar. Make sure that the top of the jar is securely on. You don’t want to get stung after all of this!

, Take your jar outside. Wait a couple minutes for the bee to settle down. Watch specifically for when the bee is investigating the flowers in the jar and not flying. At that moment, remove the top and retreat to a safe distance. Then wait for the bee to fly away!


Once the bee is gone, close and remove the jar. You don’t want the bee or its friends coming back for more!
Don’t run away. You might trip and hurt yourself. Just slowly walk away until you are a safe distance.
Watch for where the bee went. This might give you a clue as to whether there is a beehive nearby. "

Buy a non-lethal bug vacuum gun.,
Prepare your non-lethal bug vacuum.,
Dress for your encounter with the bee.,
Approach the bee with your gun and capture it.,
Release the bee.",How to Catch a Bee Without Getting Stung2," There are a number of non-lethal bug vacuums on the market. They work by using suction to suck the bug—in this case a bee—into a chamber. Once the bug is in the chamber, you can close it off, remove it, and then release the bee outside. While this is a fairly effective method, remember that you’ll be going on the offensive, which will raise your chances of getting stung.

, Make sure you’ve read your manual, have fresh batteries, and know how to work your bug vacuum. Make sure the release chamber is loaded and is flush with the rest of the gun—you don’t want your bee escaping and stinging you!Practice capturing a small piece of paper or a fly.
Make sure you’re comfortable locking the chamber and taking it out. With most non-lethal bug vacuums, you shut the chamber and then turn off the suction. Know how to do this.
Practice removing the capture chamber so that you can release the bee without getting stung.

, Since you'll be required to get up close and personal with the bee, you'll have to cover yourself as best as you can to avoid getting stung. The more skin you cover, the less chances you'll have of getting stung if the bee decides to go after you.


Find a sweat shirt or hoodie. Hoodie's are great because the hood will cover your neck, head, and your arms. Try to pick one that is relatively thick.
Put on some long pants. You want to make sure your legs are covered, too.
Wear goggles or glasses, if you’re extra nervous.
Make sure to wear thick clothes. Bees often have no trouble stinging through clothing, so pick clothes that will protect you the best., After you’re dressed appropriately, approach the bee and use the suction to capture it. Since you’ve practiced, this should work like a charm. Most non-lethal bug vacuum guns have just enough power to capture the bee without hurting it. Remember, though, don’t get brave. Only approach the bee if you’re confident your gun will capture it., Take the capture chamber out of the gun and wait a couple minutes for the bee to settle down. The key here is that you need to wait until the bee is standing still for a minute. After a few minutes, take it outside, sit it on a table, and crack the opening just a little bit. Walk away a few feet and wait until the bee leaves."

Warm up a bee that may just be cold.,
Dry out a wet honeybee.,
Feed a bee to help recovery.,
Examine the bee’s wings.,
Leave bees alone most of the time.,
Keep a honeybee with a broken wing alive.,
Look for tiny red arachnids.,
Don't touch a honeybee directly.",How to Care for an Injured Honeybee1," If it’s around 12.8 °C (55.0 °F) or colder, honeybees cannot take off. If a honeybee looks normal but is moving slowly or simply can’t seem to get off the ground, they may just be cold. Use a piece of stiff paper, such as a playing card, to pick up the bee and bring it somewhere warmer. After it warms up, it will likely simply fly away!If you need to bring it indoors to warm up, keep it in a ventilated, lidded container. Once it starts to move around more, bring the container outside and leave it there with the lid off.;
, If the bee has been caught in your beer or lemonade, take it out! Its wings are likely too wet to allow it to fly. Place it in a protected, dry, and sunny area outside so that its wings can dry off. Ideally, place it right on a flower! , If a bee has been cold or shaken up, eating can help them get back in shape. Blend a mixture of 30% honey and 70% room temperature water. Use a pipette or eye dropper to drop a tiny amount on a surface within the bees reach.Be sure that you’re placing the mixture on a surface that will hold the bee food without soaking it up.
Take care not to drop the mixture directly onto the bee.
A 1:1 mix of organic sugar and water will also work.

, If you find a grounded bee outdoors in the middle of summer or early fall, it is likely an old bee. Look closely at its wings. If they are ragged on the edges, they may simply be nearing the end of their life cycle – but they may also still have a bit more foraging left in them! Bring them inside to feed them, and bring them back outside if they regain the strength to fly.If the wings are still mostly intact, you’ve likely found a male worker bee that was taking work too seriously and forgot to drink.
Leave him outside in the sun with a bit of honey and water mixture. He’ll get back to work once he’s satiated.

, If a bee is moving around a bit, it will likely regain the ability to fly after a while. It may simply be resting, and is better off being left alone. This applies to bees with ragged wings too. If you feel compelled to offer the bee some water and honey, it’s fine to do so. Within a couple of minutes, it should be able to fly away.
The best course of action may be to simply place the bee on a flower and allow nature to proceed unspoiled by your manipulation.

, Recognize that the bee will not be able to fly again, and will soon die. However, the bee will be able to live a while if you feed it. Keep it in a lidded container with a dirt ground, a bit of water and a couple of flowers. Do not attempt to glue honeybee wings back together.Though you can glue some butterfly wings back together with acrylic glue, this will not work on honeybee wings. Honeybees would be much harder to hold, pose a danger to you, and have smaller wings. Honeybees would also groom the glued wing immediately, getting glue all over and injuring themselves further.

, Realistically, you won’t be able to tell they’re arachnids. But if a honey bee is covered in tiny red insects, it is infected with a parasite and you will likely be unable to save it. If you’ve warmed it up and fed it and it’s not moving around after a few minutes, bring it outside and simply let it be. You will not be able to treat a honeybee for any illness or parasitic infection., Though a single honeybee sting is not dangerous to most people, it will still hurt a bit. You could wear gloves to handle a honeybee and avoid being stung, though you will likely lose the dexterity necessary to do so without injuring the bee further. Instead, slowly and calmly slide a thick piece of paper beneath a bee that can't fly to move or adjust them safely. If you have had an allergic reaction to any type of bee or hornet sting, do not handle honeybees at all.

Keep an eye out for a queen bee in the spring!,
Do not remove honeybee hives from your yard.,
Maintain bee foraging areas in your yard.,
Eliminate weeds by mowing or tilling the soil.",How to Care for an Injured Honeybee2," If you find a large honeybee on the ground during the spring, when the weather is just starting to have warmer days, it may be a queen honeybee! If she stopped hibernating too early, she may have gotten caught by colder weather than she expected. Feel free to bring her inside to warm her up and feed her. However, you should plan to release her in a day or so – her nest’s survival likely depends on her return.It is usually only the queen honeybee that survives the winter. She carries the responsibility of establishing a new colony the following year.

, Unless someone you live with is allergic to bee stings, or the hive is dangerously close to somewhere you need to go frequently, let it be. The hive will only be there for one season, and it’s value as a pollinator is increasingly significant in the context of declining bee populations. In fact, most individual honeybees only live for a few weeks., More directly, choose plants for your garden that bees love. Large scale agriculture has increased honeybees’ dependence on cultivated crops, so providing uncultivated foraging areas is increasingly important. In particular, plant sweet clover, Dutch clover, alfalfa, purple vetch, birdsfoot trefoil, and partridge pea on your land.Allow trees and bushes such as linden, black locust, honey locust, Russian olive, wild plums, elderberries, red maples, willows, and honeysuckle to blossom as well.
Contact your local natural resource management office for information about what you can plant to help the honeybees in your area.

, While you may need to apply an herbicide or pesticide to target another type of pest, mowing or tilling the weeds the weeds in your yard first will decrease the likelihood that you end up killing bees when you apply a pesticide. This is especially important if the weeds are blooming.In particular, mow fields with lots of milkweed, smartweed, and dandelion before applying any chemicals. Otherwise, these plants will likely be covered in bees!

"
"
Do not use pesticides when bees are foraging.,
Scout a field before applying any chemicals.,
Time insecticide application carefully.,
Don’t use pesticides with neonicotinoids.,
Account for spray drift.,
Take care with fungicide application.",How to Care for an Injured Honeybee3," In other words, don’t apply insecticides when crops are in bloom! Many pesticides and insecticides will have warning labels directing you not to use them while a crop is blooming. Since flowers attract honeybees, using an insecticide during a bloom can decimate honeybee populations in your area. Always read and follow a pesticide’s label. Choose products that have a “short residual” impact and are labeled “low hazard.”
Alfalfa, sunflowers, and canola are especially attractive to honeybees, so take particular care when treating these crops.

, To help determine whether you should mow first, inspect the field to see if you can spot any foraging bees. You can likely do so simply by walking along the edge of field and inspecting any flowering plants. Note that some blooming plants do not necessarily produce colorful flowers., Pollen and nectar are only made available to bees by a most plants for a few hours of each day. Accordingly, make sure to scout a field during the time you plan to apply a chemical, particularly an insecticide. Late evening to early morning is usually idea. Shoot for somewhere between 8PM and 6AM.If it’s expected to be cold the night after application, apply an insecticide in the beginning of this time frame. Colder weather may allow the insecticide to remain toxic for longer, so you want to allow more time before bees return to the fields.
For corn, apply an insecticide anytime between late afternoon and midnight.

, Some pesticides are especially dangerous, not only to bees, but to other beneficial insects. Neonicotinoids are able to “express” themselves throughout the chemical makeup of a plant itself, and will be expressed in nectar in pollen. They will kill honeybees no matter when they are applied. The pharmaceutical Bayer markets pesticides with these ingredients to both industrial farmers as well as consumers like you.Watch out for an ingredient called imidacloprid, as this is the most common neonicotinoid. Many of Bayer’s products include it. Understand that by using these products, you’re likely making the plants you spray toxic to honeybees.

, Spray drift refers to the distance and direction that a chemical may be carried by the wind. There are two things you need to do to account for spray drift. First, contact bee keepers in your area before you spray, as far in advance as possible. Additionally, try to minimize spray drift by reducing the pressure of the spray and using a nozzle that will increase droplet size, While fungicides are not designed to kill honeybees, they can be toxic when applied in certain conditions, and will contribute to honeybee mortality indirectly. For instance, fungicides can make it harder to honeybees to forage and feed. While fungicides like Propiconazole are considered safe for honeybees, their use is toxic when combined with certain common surfactants, fertilizers, and insecticides."

",How to Till Soil With Pigs," You will want to look for a level area most likely covered with grass or a previously grown crop. Two pot bellied pigs can till up a 10ft x 10ft (3 meters x 3 meters) pasture area in the summer in approximately a month.;
, You will want to have a place for the pigs to seek shelter from storms and get shade on sunny days. The house can be bottomless to allow the pigs to make a nest in the dirt below it. The house should also be light enough that you will be able to move it. Twelve bales of straw arranged in 3.5 sides make a great, portable pig house, especially if topped with polycarbonate that overlaps the edges, especially on the shady side, and is weighted down with heavy metal. The pig will nose loose straw into bedding and nestle within it at night.

, If using a permanent fence, make sure that the fence is very sturdy - pigs are strong. Cattle panels work well if they're well anchored. Pigs can push down or root under many fences. If you are planning on moving the pigs to make your garden bigger (or if you want to make sure you have a fence the pigs cannot get out of) you may want to set up an electric fence. Several strands of poly-tape or electric tape suspended approximately one foot off the ground can contain pigs, once they are trained to the fence. ElectroNet fences also will work well.

, Pigs are very social animals and like to live with at least one other pig. A pig's size depends on its breed and can range from a 150 pound pot bellied pig to a 700 pound Hampshire boar. If you do not have any experience with large livestock, your best choice is probably a smaller breed.

, Make sure the pigs have access to water via a large water bowl or trough.

, Pigs love nothing more than rooting around in the soil, eating grass, roots, bugs and any other delicious treats they may find. While exhibiting this natural behavior, they unearth anything that is growing and leave behind tilled soil that is full of organic material and the pigs' own natural ""fertilizer.""

, Once the area is turned over and most of the previous ground cover has been eaten, you have two choices. Either move the fence with the pigs in it and the pig house about halfway, giving the pigs a new area to till up and leaving you with the first half tilled and ready to begin planting or move the pigs completely into a new area.

, You will probably need to even out the new bed as the pigs will have areas dug out, especially where the pig house used to be. This should also move around the ""fertilizer"" and get the garden ready for planting. Any other preparation (making raised beds, mulching, etc.) is up to you

, You will want to plant as soon as possible to give your seeds or transplants a head start against the weeds that the pigs chewed down.

, Keep the pig clean. Keep the pig's snout and butt clean when it is exiting the pen.

, Exercise it regularly. Start walking to help the pig lose weight and stay in good condition.


Do not allow the pig to become underweight or overweight.

, Depending on the feed, pick a high protein feed. (This does not mean feed hormones.)

, Tap only on the hogs shoulder to the underarm area on each side. Try if possible to keep your pigs head up to make the top line of your pig look more even. Not too high though.

,, Pigs tend to get excited and run around their first time inside a large pen.


Note that this will excitable behavior will occasionally happen even after you work with them. The best thing to do is just to walk past the judge, maintaining eye contact. Don't get upset.

, Do this a few days before the show so that the coat will come out smooth.

,, Never put the whip, cane, or pipe in between the judge and the hog.

,, Judges like a hog that handles softly.


Don't hit your hog too hard. It will make your pig whine and the judges won't like that.

Get help and advice from an established beekeeper.",How to Buy Honey Bees," There are many different kinds of honeybees, and each comes with their own good and bad traits. The type you’ll choose will depend on what you want to get out of keeping bees, and how you hope to interact with the bees. For example, as a new beekeeper, you might want to choose a type of honeybee known for being less prone to swarms, and on the gentler side.The Italian bee, for example, is a really good option for a beginner. They produce a good amount of honey, aren’t prone to swarming, are gentle, and hardy. On the other hand, the Carniolan bee is a bit more prone to swarming, and don’t produce as much honey as the Italian bee.;
, When ordering your bees, you can choose between a nucleus (nuc) hive or a package hive. A package is essentially a collection of bees put together from different established hives. Since the colony isn’t already acquainted with the queen and she isn’t already actively laying eggs, these can be more difficult to establish. Nucs, on the other hand, are beginning hives that have already accepted the queen and begun producing honey. Both nucs and packages usually have the same amount of bees, about 10,000 each.Traditionally, new hives can begin in the spring, when things are blooming and the hive can thrive right away. With package hives, if you get your package right as the season begins, they may actually miss out on the season as they are still trying to establish themselves as it’s going on.
There isn’t usually much price difference between the two options. Either option will likely cost between $50 and $120.
The package, while the more difficult option, has also been known to be more enjoyable and satisfying for new beekeepers, as it offers them a chance to see how a hive is built from the very start, and the keeper can observe the entire process.

, There are plentiful bee suppliers around the United States, so locating one will be easy enough. You just want to check up on that supplier and make sure they have a good reputation. Online reviews and asking other beekeepers in the area are good sources.


Try to choose a supplier that is near to you, as this will cut down on transport time and distance. This will make the transition from transport container to your hive much easier and take less time.

, The easiest method of starting your own hive is to purchase one that has already been established and fostered by another, more experienced beekeeper. This will ensure your colony will survive and thrive, as they have already been producing workers and honey by the time you get them.One other option, aside from buying, is to capture your own bees in the wild. This is both dangerous and difficult, and should really only be attempted by experienced beekeepers.

, You will likely bring your bees in transporting boxes and move them to your own equipment. You should have your hive prepared before bringing your bees home to it. There are many different types of hives, all of which can be purchased pre-built, or if you’re handy, built yourself.The Langstroth, Horizontal Top Bar, and Warre Hives are the most common and popular among beekeepers in the United States. There are many companies that build and produce these hives, and you can purchase many of them online. The Langstroth Hive is the most popular, and is the most recommended for beginners., You will need to use a smoker to calm the bees and keep stinging to a minimum, as well as wear necessary protective gear, including a veil and gloves to keep the bees away from your face and hands.Make sure you can safely operate a bee smoker. Use a good fuel like pine to start a small fire in the can, then put the lid on. You can also use dryer lint, paper, or cotton to get it started. Be careful of where you put down your smoker while using it, and make sure you wear your gloves while handling it, as it can get very hot., When your hive is just starting out, they might not have enough of their own food made already, so you’ll need to supplement it with feeding them sugared liquids. A basic sugar-water mixture is sufficient. You can also purchase frames to slide right into your hive that will sustain them when they are low on their own food.Once your hive is established, it’s unlikely you’ll need to feed them again unless the hive is struggling, or there is any kind of illness you’re treating in the hive. Otherwise, your hive will be self-sufficient and will produce their own food.

There are many companies that build and produce these hives, and you can purchase many of them online. The Langstroth Hive is the most popular, and is the most recommended for beginners., You’ll want to keep the hive in a location that is near to a lot of flowering trees and flowerbeds, as well as in close proximity to a source of running fresh water. You’ll want the hive in a sunny spot, but one that might be shaded when it’s the hottest during the day. A place with a lot of good air flow is also helpful., Until your bees are creating their own food and thriving on their own, you will need to feed them a sugar-water mixture. After the hive is established, it’s likely you will only need to spend a few hours per year handling and keeping the bees.If your bees are thriving and making their own food, don’t feed them extra sugar syrup.

, If you start out with a smaller group and your colony expands, you will need to add additional space to your hive as needed. Giving the bees a bigger hive as they grow in numbers will help minimize the tendency to swarm, as well, and make handling them easier.You can purchase or build extra hive bodies to add into your existing hive as the colony grows, or you can expand into another hive.

, If this is your first time establishing a hive and keeping honey bees, it’s a good idea to get some advice and guidance from someone who has already done it. They can show you the ropes and help you get acquainted with the ins and outs of keeping bees.


Get some advice on how to best handle bees. Ask them for tips on harvesting honey, if that’s what you hope to get out of beekeeping. You might also ask them their opinion on the best plants to keep near the hive for the bees.

Identify your goals for the market hog.,
Observe the pig for signs of good health.,
Consider the pig’s sex.,
Determine if the pig is purebred or crossbred.,
Ask other 4-H members where they purchased their pigs.",How to Pick out a Market Hog1," If you are going to be raising a market hog for a 4-H project or just for fun, then you do not need to get too technical with your selection. You can simply look for a pig that is in good health and that has no obvious defects. However, if you want to compete at a state fair or you want to get the best possible price for your hog's meat, then you may want to put some extra care into selecting your market hog.


Learn as much as you can about what the judges will consider if you plan to compete with your hog. Before you select a hog, you may want to see if you can get information about what the judges will consider. These considerations are often complex and cover several categories, such as structure, health, and attitude of the hog.
Read your 4-H swine raising project guide. Your guide can help you to navigate the complex process of raising swine. As part of your project, you may be required to complete activities and give presentations on several aspects of raising swine.Make sure that you check these guidelines to ensure that you are meeting your program's requirements.;
, It is crucial to purchase a hog that is in good health. Otherwise, your hog may not mature properly and you may have to spend money on getting the hog well. Before you purchase any hog, make sure that you observe it for signs of good health. If a hog shows any signs of illness, or if you notice that more than 10% of the producer's other hogs show signs of illness, then avoid purchasing a hog from this producer.


Signs of illness may include coughing, sneezing, wheezing, discharge from the nose, scratching, and/or being underweight.Ask the producer to show you the hog’s records, such as vaccinations and dewormers that have been administered to the hog.If the producer cannot or will not show you these records, then you may not want to buy from this producer.

, You will choose between a gilt and a barrow when you purchase a market hog. A gilt is a young female hog and a barrow is a young castrated male hog. Gilts may produce leaner meat than barrows, but barrows may gain weight faster than gilts.Consider your time frame and goals before you choose your hog’s sex. For example, if you have a shorter time frame, then your may want to choose a barrow since it will likely gain weight faster than a gilt.

, The offspring of two purebred pigs of the same breed is considered a purebred pig while the offspring of two pigs from different breeds is considered a crossbreed pig. Purebred pigs may have some superior traits, such as leaner body mass and good bone structure. However, crossbreed pigs are sometimes healthier than their purebred parents due to heterosis, which is when the combined genetics of two breeds produce a superior offspring.Common breeds of pig include the Yorkshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, Chester White, Duroc, Landrace, Poland China, and Spotted Swine.Choosing a healthy pig is your main priority, but you may also want to consider a pig’s genetics if you will be competing with your pig. Keep in mind that you will need to have a purebred pig's papers to register it as purebred for a competition. Ask to see these if you are considering a purebred pig.
Deciding between a crossbred pig and a purebred pig depends on your project goals. For example, if you plan to use a gilt (female pig) for breeding, then you might want to select a white breed pig, such as a Chester White, because white breed gilts have better mothering abilities than other breeds., Another good strategy for purchasing a quality market hog is to buy one from a producer that other 4-H members have gone to. Ask older members of your 4-H club where they purchased their market hogs and how successful those hogs were.Make sure that you avoid any producers that other 4-H members warn you away from as well. For example, if a 4-H member advises you to avoid a pig producer who often has sick pigs, then avoid that producer.

Provide the right type of transportation.,
Provide a large cage for each piglet.,
Travel in the cool of the day.,
Prior to travel, only allow the piglet to drink but not to eat.,
On arrival at your piglet's new home, keep it confined to a small, comfortable area first so that it can acclimatize to the smells, the noises, the different people and animals around it.",How to Transport Piglets (for the Smallhold Farmer)," If it's a case of one to two piglets, they might fit snugly and comfortably in the back of a car that has large space (station wagon, van, etc.). If not, obtain a trailer and hitch it onto your car.;
, A large dog cage should be suitable (you might be able to hire additional ones from the local vet or a boarding kennel). Place a tarpaulin down and line with newspapers, then cover with straw or old blankets for comfort on the base of the cage. Note that this cage method is only suitable for short journeys as livestock should not be confined to a small space for any length of time. The cage is a precaution to prevent them flying about if the vehicle stops suddenly, and to contain them as they move around. If you are traveling for a longer distance, you will need to find a wider space to corral them, or stop frequently to remove them and allow them to walk about, feed, and drink, etc.

, This is especially important during warmer weather, as pigs will heat up quickly (and cannot perspire). Block the back windows of the car from sunlight if it's warm, or cover the cage with dampened cotton blankets. Keep windows down to let air flow through at all times.

, Pigs are partial to motion sickness and any food consumed can trigger this off. Speak softly to your piglet to reassure it. It is likely that it will sleep during the journey but there is no harm in talking to it to reassure it now and then.

, Continue talking to it to reassure it and make sure that it has adequate food and water.

Look at the pig from behind.,
Watch for structural defects.,
Check the pig’s frame.",How to Pick out a Market Hog2," Checking a pig from behind can help you to determine if it has good strong legs. The legs should be straight and sturdy looking. You should also look for a 45 degree angle or V-shape between the pig’s legs. If the pig's legs are wider or narrower than this, then the pig may not make a good project.Avoid pigs that have wide set legs or that have a square appearance from behind. This indicates that the pig may have too much fat on its body and will not produce lean meat, which is what most pork consumers prefer.

, If you are competing with your pig, then it is important to make sure that your pig does not have any obvious defects. If the pig has any obvious defects, then do not purchase it. Common structural defects may include:a hernia on the pig’s scrotum or stomach, which will look like a small or large lump. If you notice anything protruding from the pig's belly or scrotum, then do not purchase this pig.
kyphosis, which will look like a hump on the pig's back. If a pig looks like it has a curved back or a hump on its back, then do not purchase it.

, By looking at a pig from the side, you can get an idea of what its body structure is like and how quickly it is growing. Look for a pig whose legs all seem to be positioned at the same angle and that walks with its head held up. This indicates that the pig has a good body structure and that it will make a good project.Avoid pigs that walk with their heads bent low or that have legs bending at different angles. All of the pig's legs should bend at the same angle and should be about the same length.
As you check the pig from the side, pay attention to the distance between the pig's body and the ground. The pig's legs should all be the same length and its weight should look like it is evenly distributed. If the pig's front legs are obviously shorter than the back legs, then avoid purchasing this pig.

Quickly close the door of the pet carrier once your quail is inside.,
Take the quail back to its home.",How to Catch Quail1," Lock them in a separate room or outside and make sure they cannot get out or in.;
, This way, the quail will be trapped in the room and not be able to escape into a dangerous room with lots of hiding-spots.

, Behind wardrobes, underneath desks or in between cupboards are all places where quails will hide and get stuck. Block the gaps off with:


Pillows.
Blankets.
Towels.
Books.
Boxes.

, You will probably need:


A helper.
A blanket or towel.
A small box with breathing holes.

, Try not to startle the quail or make any sudden movements, quails fly straight up to the roof when frightened and will injure their head.

, The blanket/towel will stop the quail from flying or moving and you will be able to hold the quail easier.

, Don’t squeeze the quail as this will harm it; cup the quail and its wings with your two hands.

, Make sure the box is closed properly and has breathing holes in it.

, Keeping the quail in a small box for too long will stress it out. Make sure that the cage is secure and that the quail will not be able to escape from it again.

, Make sure the quail is bigger than the wiring on the front so that it cannot escape. The wire spacing should be 1/2 of an inch.

, The pet carrier should be in a spot where your quail would go such as a corner.

, Use both of your arms or a blanket to prevent the quail from going the wrong way. The quail will eventually run inside the pet carrier.


Move slowly and quietly. If your quail is spooked it will fly straight up to the roof, damaging its head.

, You’ll have to be fast as the quail will easily run out once you’re near the carrier, but be careful to not slam the door on the quail as you might injure it.

, This time, make sure the quail's housing is secure and has no holes or escape routes in it. You should check the housing over before you put the quail back in.

Understand what kind of birds quail are.,
Keep pets indoors.,
Do not disturb birds in the garden.,
Secure your garden.,
Grow dense grass and foliage.,
Provide suitable feed for the quail.,
Add a water source to your garden.,
Create dust baths.,
Provide a stump or a piece of timber.,
Plant extra food resources.,
Provide nesting material.,
Keep hollow logs in your garden.",How to Attract Quail," Quail do not perch or fly long distances. Instead they live, sleep and forage on the ground their entire lives. They living conditions are in dry grasslands with plenty of foliage.
, If you are going to attract quail into your area you will need to keep your pets away from the garden, especially dogs and cats. Quail are very skittish and one sign of a predator will make them uninvited., If you are one who constantly goes out into their garden then attracting quails may not be the thing for you. It will be even more difficult and will scare the quails off if you disturb them by walking through the place., This is to keep predators out. Provide high and strong fencing around your garden and get rid of items that attract predators such as left over food, plants, etc., A quails natural habitat is in dense grasslands so that they feel safe and secure. Grow long grass and plenty of shrubs in your garden for quails to hide amongst. It will make your garden more inviting for the birds., Quail live on a diet consisting of seeds and insects. Purchase a wild bird seed and keep it low on the ground as quail like to forage and don't perch on tree's. Quail especially love millet sprigs.

Do not buy a bird feeder that hangs in the air as the quail will not be able to reach it considering they do not perch. Instead you need to purchase a feeder that is suitable for the ground or spread the seed mix in the dirt for the quail to forage.

, The quail will appreciate a water source to have a quick drink from. By keeping a small waterfall flowing through or a dripper the quail will hear the water and know that it is available.

The water should be shallow and never deep. If it is deep the quail have a risk of drowning depending on the size of the bird.

, Quail, like many other birds, love to dust bath to keep themselves clean. This is also a technique they use to get rid of parasites too. Provide a little dust bathing spot for the quail that consists of dry sand. If you get a lot of rain keep it sheltered., If you ever do attract flocks, the male leader will stand on a high-ground perch. Providing a stump or piece of timber will make the quails appreciate your garden better., Herbs and vegetables are great additions to add to the garden and the quail will benefit from them too. These will be extra food resources for the quail if they need them., Quail like to find an area where they can breed and raise their young. Provide dry straw, hay, grass, leaf litter, twigs, etc. This will encourage the quail to breed., These can serve the purpose of hiding spots, nesting areas or feeding station for the quail. Hollow out back sides or just one to provide more security. Add at least two hollow logs for the quail."

A helper.
A small box with breathing holes.
A blanket or towel.
A long stick.

, Quails may be quite fast and camouflaged, but your dog or cat will eventually find them and possibly injure or kill them.


Don’t lock the pets in a room where you plan to lead the quail to, such as a shed or barn.

, There are many mistakes that quail-owners make and don’t realize that it’s not a good idea. Some tips on what you shouldn’t do are:


Don’t wait until the last minute to catch your quail. Most people take so long thinking of what they should do or waiting until someone arrives to help them that by the time they realize what to do or get help the quail is gone! Another mistake is people waiting until it is nighttime to catch the quail, thinking that the quail is sleepy and more tired. By then it would be a lot harder to find the quail as it is dark and the quail probably isn’t in the area anymore.
Don’t leave your quail. Even for just one minute, quail do travel and ‘’’blend’’’ into plants, grass and trees.
Don’t chase your quail. Even though you think you are going to catch up with the quail, quickly grab it and everything will be fine, the quail is a lot faster and smaller than you. Quails can also fly straight up into a more difficult position when frightened.

, In order to catch the quail you will need to know where it is. Search in bushes, along fences, under logs and above in the trees or on the roof. Remember, quails can fly a short distance so you may want to ask a neighbour to check their yard.


Try not to leave the quail out of your sight. You will most likely lose it and have to search all over the yard again, you might even lose it for good this time.
Poke a long stick along bushes, shrubs, grass and other hiding places. It might scare the quail into coming out or at least spook the quail so that you know where it is.

, The best place to corner the quail is indoors such as a shed, barn or your own home. That way the quail will find it hard to get away from you.


Do not corner the quail into any bushes, under large objects or outside your backyard, you will find it very hard to catch the quail.
Approach the quail slowly and quietly. Quails get frightened easily and will fly straight up if you scare them.

, You probably know by now that quails fly when frightened, that’s why placing a blanket over the quail is a good idea. The blanket will stop the quail from flying or escaping, it also makes the quail easy to hold.

, Cup both of your hands on the quail and remember to be gentle and not squeeze the quail tightly. Quails are very small and fragile.

, The box doesn’t have to be big if you are going to put the quail in its cage straight away, it does have to have breathing holes though.

, Do this straight away, keeping the quail in a small box can stress it out and make the quail unhappy. Make sure that the cage has no gaps and is closed securely to prevent the quail from escaping again.

, Bird nets can be purchased from most pet shops and will make the job of catching your quail a lot easier. If you cannot find a bird net anything alike will do as long as it is bigger than the quail.

, There’s more than catching a quail with just one simple bird net. You will probably need a helper and a small box with breathing holes.

, Quail don’t really travel far, especially if they are travelling away from their home, so you will probably find them eventually as long as you have patience and dedication. Good places to look are:


Around the quails housing. Most quail don’t like the ‘free life’ and will eventually try to get back in the cage or at least hang around the cage.
In bushes, shrubs or trees. You should get dirty and search through, under and above the bush. If your quail flies it might land in the bush and possibly get stuck.
Along fences/walls. Most quail will try to hide and get out of the open because they have many bird predators, so if you have no bushes, trees or hiding places for your quail, they might be along your fence/wall.
On the roofs of sheds, houses or garages. Once again, quail fly really high when frightened, so they might be on the roof of something.
In a neighbours garden (with permission). When quail fly, they can travel quite a distance so by now they might be in one of your neighbour’s garden.

, The worst thing you can do is run, shout, get angry and make sudden movements as this will scare the quail and cause it to fly to a more difficult spot.

, Do not lift the net off but keep it firmly down on the ground. Never move the net or slide it on the ground, this might injure your quail as they are small, fragile birds.

, Keep holding the quail firmly whilst lifting the net off the ground, then grab the quail from the inside of the net.


Never lift the net and quickly grab hold of your quail from the inside, they are fast birds that can easily escape if you do this. The best way to grab hold of the quail is from the outside of the net.

, The box doesn't have to be very big if you are going to put the quail straight into its home.

, It should be secure, safe and there should be no gaps or any sort of escape route for the quail.

, It’s best to do this straight after catching the quail otherwise the quail might get stressed out and be very unhappy.

, You can’t just leave the quail out of your sight, not even for one minute as they are fast birds that can get lost easily. You will probably need:


A helper.
A small box with breathing holes.
A long stick or something alike.

, This is where you will chase your quail into. If your quail is indoors, it makes them easier to catch as they cannot hide in shrubs, fly away and you cannot lose them.


The room doesn't have to be a shed, it can be anything (E.G. a garage, barn or even your own home) as long as it doesn't have a step to get indoors as quail will not go indoors if there is a step.

, In order to catch the quail you must first find it. Look in bushes, long patches of grass, along fences and in the trees.

, Spread your arms out and slowly lead the quail to the shed one step at the time.


Try using a long stick to lead the quail. The stick will reach a further distance than your arms and it will make it easier to control your quail.
It won’t help if you are rushing the quail as it will probably fly away instead of going to the shed.

, If you don’t, it makes it easier for your quail to escape as there is a clear exit.

, Cup your hands on the quails body and put the quail inside a box with breathing holes. Hold the quail firmly but don’t ‘’’squeeze’’’ the quail, you may injure it.


If your quail goes under/behind a large objects such as washing machines, old furniture, lawn mowers, etc, try using your stick to get it out.

, You don’t want to keep your quail in a small box as it can stress the quail out. The best thing you can do for the quail now is to return it to its safe and happy home.


Make sure the cage is escape proof before you put your quail back in it. The last thing you want to do is catch your quail and then lose it all over again.

Be prepared.,
Find out where the quail chicks are.,
Once you have found the chick, try catching it with your hands.,
Place the chick in a small box.,
Put the chick back in its home.,

Be prepared.,
Put the mother quail of the chick inside the pet carrier.,
Find the chick.,
Place the pet carrier (with the mother quail inside) near the chick.,
Block the entrance/exit of the pet carrier with a large book.,
Take the chick and its mother to a safe place.",How to Catch Quail3," Once you have found your chick, you won’t want to leave its sight. You will probably need a small box and a helper.

, Though they are small, it’s not too hard to find out where they have gotten to.

, Chicks can be just as fast as fully-grown quails so make sure you are quick.


Be gentle and do not squeeze the quail chick, this will harm them and cause them injury.

, Make sure the box has breathing holes and that the chick cannot escape from it.

, Whether the housing is a brooder or with the mother hen, it’s important to put the chick back where it belongs.

, The chick should be able to get through the wiring on the pet carrier whilst a fully-grown quail shouldn't.

, You will probably need a helper and a large book.

, Do not put any other chicks in the pet carrier as they will escape.

, Go to the area you last saw them and look around. If you cannot find the quail try looking in your neighbour’s back yard (with permission). Quail chicks can be fast and they might have travelled a long distance by now, depending on the time they escaped.

, The mother quail will most likely call to the chick and persuade the chick to get inside the pet carrier.

, The chick should be trapped with its mother.

, A good place to take them is indoors, in a brooder or a cage, but before you take them to the brooder/cage make sure that it is secure and that the chick cannot escape any more.

"
"
Make sure that you shut the cage/pen door properly.,
Make sure that there are no holes, gaps or any sort of escape route for the quails.,
Keep the quail cage in a secure and safe area.,
Clip your quails wings.",How to Catch Quail4," Attach a lock to it and make sure that it is secure.


It’s also good to set rules on who can open the door to the cage. If you have children who are keen on the quail, tell them that they have to have permission or you have to be with them to open the quail cage.

, Invest in a better cage or fix the cage up a little. The wiring holes should be 1/2 of an inch so that the quails cannot get through them.

, Close the door and windows of the room at all times and keep pets out. A good room to keep them in is:


A place with low traffic such as your bedroom (if you don’t mind your quail being kept indoors). If your quail does manage to escape from the cage and people are constantly opening doors to get into the certain room where your quail is kept, there is a more chance that your quail would get through the door and get lost.
In a barn, shed or garage. This might be better than keeping your quail outside because if they escape you can easily find them in that certain area.
An empty room. This way, if your quails escape, you will not need to spend a lot of time trying to catch the quail with annoying objects in the way.
In an enclosed area. If your quail live outdoors, placing their cage in an enclosed area can prevent them from getting lost in bushes, grass and trees. Make sure you enclose the quails area at the top as well as the sides.

, Clipping your quails wings will prevent them from flying when frightened so if you have an entrance on the top of your quails cage they cannot get out. It also prevents your quail from flying away and getting lost meaning that if they escape, they'll be very close and most likely in your garden.

"
Purchase high-quality quail feed from a feed store or from online.,
Give the quail enough food, and make sure that the texture is right.,
Keep the feed troughs clean, dry, and easily accessible.,
Offer plenty of water, and make sure that the quail have easy access to it.,
Keep the water troughs clean and replace the water daily to minimize bacteria growth.,
Store the food in a clean, dry place, and use it before it expires.",How to Feed Quail1," Unlike other fowl, quail cannot eat low-quality feed without sacrificing quality. This is especially important when it comes to quail being raised for breeding and laying eggs. If you can't find high-quality quail feed, try a another type of game bird feed. You can also try turkey feed, which is usually higher in protein than chicken feed, making it more suitable for quail.


Chicken feed can make a decent substitute for meat quail.
If you choose to go with turkey feed, make sure that it is non-medicated.Always refer to a qualified nutritionist before you make any substitutions.
About 80% of a quail's diet will consist of grains. Most quail or game bird feeds will consist of: cracked corn, grains (barley, oats, rye, and wheat), millet, milo, oat grouts, popcorn, safflower seed, sunflower kernels, and sunflower seeds.;
, Quail are easy to feed in that you do not have to worry about over-feeding them. They will stop eating once they feel full. However, quail are picky when it comes to the size of their food. If the grains or pellets are too small or too big, they won't eat it. It has to be just right.


If the feed comes in pellet form, try breaking it up into (quail) bite-sized pieces. Make sure that the pieces are consistent, or the quail will just pick out the pieces they like best and leave the rest. This can result in an in-balanced diet.
Avoid mashed feed, if you can. If you must use mash feed, make sure that it is not too powdery. The powder can easily get in between the quail's toes and cause infections.
Adult quail will eat about 20 to 25 grams of food a day., Make sure that you place the troughs in a dry place, away from rain, snow, sunlight, and wind. You might want to place the food further away from the water troughs as well. If the feed gets wet, it can grow mold, which can kill quail.Also, you should empty the feed troughs often. Only wash the troughs when they become dirty from waste, or if the feed itself gets wet.


Make sure that the food trough is level with the quail's crop area.
Try to use linear troughs, with enough space for the quail to eat comfortably without competing for food.
Depending on how many quail you have, you may need to empty the troughs as little as two to three times a week, to as often as once a day.
Quail can be messy eaters. Consider keeping the feed in a hopper with ""anti-spill fingers."", As a general rule, the water trough should be no higher than the bird's back.Many quail breeders also recommend keeping marbles in the bottom of the trough. This not only makes the water more attractive to the quail, but it also gives quail chicks an escape route in case they fall in.Quail are guzzlers. Consider making your own guzzler by digging a shallow hole in the ground, lining it with plastic, and then adding a ramp into the hole., Clean the trough three times a week with a commercial, nontoxic disinfectant. Don't pour the old water out inside the pen. The pen must be kept as dry as possible.Pay special attention to the water during the winter time. Don't let it freeze.
Add a little bit of apple cider vinegar to the water from time to time. This kills parasites and makes the feathers look nicer., If you don't store the food properly, it can get moldy, which is deadly for quail. It can also become food for other critters, such as insects and rats.


Use the feed before it expires—usually 3 weeks after the manufacturing date. You may need to use it even sooner if you live some place hot and humid.
Throw away stale or foul-smelling feed. This indicates that the feed has either expired or gone moldy.
Rats can not only eat all of the quails' feed, but also contaminate it."
"
Pick the right cage.,
Line the bottom floor of the cage with newspaper, paper towels, or other paper products, as these are safest and cheapest.,
Add perches.,
Add toys.,
Have a place for food and water bowls.,
Clean the cage weekly, and rinse the toys when they become dirty.

",How to Set Up a Cage for a Lovebird," Know how many birds you'll have. Are you keeping just one, a pair, or a whole flock? Get them the biggest cage you can afford so they have room to fly and move, but a minimum for a single bird is 2 feet (0.6 m) tall, wide, and long, and even with that size you should allow them time to exercise outside the cage.


Don't put birds in round cages, because with no corners to hide in, they tend to feel unsafe. Stick to square or rectangular.
Bars should be spaced at maximum 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm), to keep the bird from getting stuck or slipping out.;
,


NEVER use walnut, corn cobs, cedar shavings or kitty litter. All contain toxic ingredient that, if ingested, could harm or kill your bird.

, Lovebirds enjoy moving around, so have various perches of different, height, diameter, and texture.

, Most birds will often prefer certain toys, so try a few out with them. Toys such as ladders, ropes, bells, swings are recommended, but always check that the material is safe.


Try not to overcrowd the cage with toys. Use common sense, and adjust the amount and size based on the size of both the cage and bird.

, Wash and replenish both daily, even if it seems like the bird hasn't eaten.

Offer some fruit and vegetables.,
Consider offering other types of food as well.,
Know that some types of foods can be toxic to quails.,
Provide a bowl of grit for your quails.",How to Feed Quail2," About 20% of a quail's diet will consist of vegetables, fruits, leaves and other roughage compose. Don't be afraid to offer some other type of food. Try to consider the quail's natural, habitat, however. For example, if you have quail that are naturally found in the desert, offer some cactus fruit.Consider planting some berry shrubs, such as: blackberry, currant, huckleberry, manzanita, Oregon grapes, salad, serviceberry, and snowberry.Offer vegetables, such as: broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cucumber, peas, lettuce, and turnip greens.
Be careful with tomatoes. Quail can eat ripe tomatoes, but they cannot eat any other part of the plant, including the leaves and the stems.

, The main part of a quail's diet should be specialized quail feed. However, it you can include other types of food as a treat, such as: cake, pasta, rice, and sweet corn.Quail love nuts and seeds. Consider having some nut or seed baring trees around, such as: ash, cascara, hazelnut, and oak. The quail will eat the nuts and seeds that the trees drop.
Quail also love insects, especially chicks. Insects are full of protein, which chicks and egg-laying hens need.

, This includes avocado, caffeine, chocolate, grape seeds, meat, parsley, rhubarb, the stems and leaves of tomato plants, salty foods and treats, uncooked potatoes, and most citrus fruits.


Quails will avoid anything toxic to them unless they are starving. This indicates that you should feed your quail more.
There are many plants that are poisonous to quails, but you most likely will not come across them anyway. It is still important to be aware of this, though.
Avoid giving quail anything from your garden. The quail will figure out quickly where their food comes from, and may try to feed themselves. This may not be good for your garden.

, This helps your quails digest their food down; however, if they wander about on the grass often, this is not a big worry for them as they will find some goodies in the ground to digest their food with.

"
"
Feed chicks a starter soon after hatching until they are 6-8 weeks old.,
Feed your quails a good-quality developer feed after six to eight weeks of age.,
Feed your quails' layer-pellets after they start laying eggs.,
Always provide a fresh supply of water.",How to Feed Quail3," Chicks need plenty of protein, which is found in the starter feeds. The starter feeds also offer other nutrients and vitamins that enable the chicks to grow into healthy, fully-grown quail.Use long, straight troughs for brooding chicks. Transition to circular feeders after the chicks are 2 weeks old. Use a smaller bowl for water.
Chicks can eat fine crumble until they are 6 to 8 weeks old. A coarser texture, or pellets, are better for older quail.
When raising chicks, teach them how to drink by dipping their beaks into the bowl/dish. If they have their mother hen with them, this is not much of a worry as she will show them how to drink.

, The best feed for quails is a game bird feed that has at least 20 percent protein or more. Quail feed is expected to have plenty of protein to enable them to have a balanced diet for them to grow into great, healthy pets.


If you are planning on using the quail for their meat, you do not need to give them a developer feed. Give them a finisher feed instead.
If you are going to use your quail for breeding or laying eggs, slowly transition them to the new diet before they hit 10 weeks of age., Layer-pellets provide enough calcium for your quails to lay strong, healthy eggs. Make sure to grind the pellets up a bit if you find the quails quite big for them. This is especially important if you buy chicken pellets, as these are bigger than the quail layer-pellets. Just make sure you don't grind them up into a powder.

, Clean the water bowl one to three times a week and refill once a day. The bowls will tend to get dirty, as the quails will often stand in them, spill dirt/bedding in them and do all-sorts!

"
"
Find out what you want to do with the quails.,
Feed quail a starter and a finisher mix if you plan on using or selling them for meat.,
Feed quail a starter and a developer mix if you plan on using them for flight or game.,
Pay special attention to quails that you are raising for breeding and eggs.",How to Feed Quail4," Do you want to raise them for eggs, meat, breeding or just as a simple pet? Quails need a diet depending on their purpose as you'll need to choose a feed that suits them. The four main different types of feeds are:


Starter
Developer
Layer
Finisher

, The finisher feed will help sustain the quail, until they reach the certain age to be killed at. The finisher feed is higher in fiber than other feeds.


Start the quail off with a starter mix from shortly after hatching until 6 weeks of age. Transition to a finisher mix after 6 weeks of age. Continue feeding the finisher diet until the time comes to sell or slaughter the quail.

, This diet is also suitable for quail being kept simply as pets. The developer feed differs from the finisher in that it contains more protein.


Start the quail on a starter mix from shortly after hatching until 6 weeks of age. Transition to a developer mix after 6 weeks of age. Continue until 16 weeks of age.

, Quail being used for breeding and laying eggs need a special feed when the time comes for them to lay eggs. If they are not given the proper feed, their eggs may turn out too weak or fragile.


Feed most quail breeds a starter mix from shortly after hatching until 6 weeks of age. Transition to a developer mix after 6 weeks of age. Continue until 20 weeks of age. Finish off with a layer mix at 20 weeks and older.
Feed Coturnix (Pharaoh) quail a starter mix from shortly after hatching until 6 weeks of age. Transition to a layer mix after 6 weeks of age. There is no need for a developer mix.

Take some thought on raising quail.,
Find a space in your yard or on your balcony where you can hang a quail cage.,
Purchase a long, narrow cage and hang it from an overhang on your house, garage or balcony.,
Hang some lights around the cage.,
Decide if you want to buy mating birds or hatching eggs.,
Decide how many birds you need based on your egg consumption.,
Look for a good egg laying breed.,
Go to Craigslist or look in your local paper first.,
Check on eBay to find hatching eggs.,
Try local ranch or farm supply and feed stores.,
Buy at least two females for every male, but keep males separated.,
Purchase an incubator at the feed store or ranch supply store if you plan to raise hatching eggs.,
Keep the humidity at 45 to 50 percent during incubation and 65 to 70 percent during the 23rd day of hatching.,
Adjust the temperature of the incubator so that it is 100 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius).,
Don’t turn the egg turner on until three days after the eggs are laid.,
Keep the quail in a small space once they are hatched.,
Keep up to 100 quail chicks in a two by three foot space for the first ten days.,
Give chicks a chick starter feed up until they are six to eight weeks old.,
Ensure that each bird has three to 4ft2 (1 m2) of space in the cage.

,
Provide quail with clean drinking water.,
Change the straw beneath the cages daily.,
Clean the cage out if any waste starts to build.,
Start to adjust conditions and change the food to a laying fowl mix at five to six weeks.,
Provide crushed oyster shells and grit for your quail.,
Keep the animals undisturbed after six weeks of age.,
Consider adding fresh greens, seeds and small insects to your quail feed.

",How to Raise Quail," Quail are small and fairly easy birds to look after but do need time for feeding, refilling water containers, cleaning the cage, checking up daily, and collecting eggs. You may also encounter many problems while raising quail for the first time.
, Clear the space underneath in which to place straw. This will help you to collect and remove waste.


You can also decide whether to house your quail in a different sort of housing like a rabbit hutch or something alike. However, the cage above is set up in a way to prevent diseases since quail waste is high in ammonia.

, Choose somewhere that has access to light, but is blocked from strong winds. Most quail cages are built of open mesh wire, since the birds need shelter, but plenty of air.


They should be housed away from predators including pets and the room shouldn't have any disturbances.

, This will allow you to increase egg production in the fall and winter months. The birds need 15 hours of light per day to produce eggs but any more and they will get stressed from lack of sleep.

, A mature bird can cost around $5, while you can get 50 eggs for about $20. Along with the eggs you'll have to prepare to spend a lot of time caring for a bunch of chicks and you will also have to purchase some extra equipment. If it's your first time raising quail you might want to purchase some mature birds instead of hatching chicks.

, Figure out your weekly chicken egg consumption. It takes five quail eggs to equal one chicken egg and your mature females should lay one egg every day.


Plan to get one female bird (through hatching eggs or pairs of mating birds) for each chicken egg you eat.
Quail eggs can be consumed like chicken eggs; however, it requires more birds to produce the same amount.

, Coturnix are highly recommended birds to keep. They aren't just good egg producers but they can also be kept as meat and are really easy to look after. If you're looking for quail that lay bigger eggs you should go for the jumbo coturnix.


Coturnix quail are also known as japanese quail. You'll also get different coloured coturnix quail such as the tuxedo quail which is a white and brown colour.
Coturnix usually start laying at 6-8 weeks when they mature. From then on they will lay 1 egg every day.
If you're not sure about coturnix you can buy other popular breeds such as the Scaled Quail, Gambel’s Quail or the Bobwhite Quail. However, coturnix quail is the recommended starter breed.

, The best idea is to use contacts in the local livestock or urban farming community to get birds that are acclimated to your climate.

, They can be sent via mail; however, you may suffer higher mortality rates than if you buy locally.

, If they don’t get quail each spring with their chickens and guinea fowl, they may be able to order them specially for you.

, A preponderance of females will ensure plenty of egg production in your flock. At the same time, you'll probably only be able to house one male in each cage; if two or more males are kept in a single cage, the dominant male may attempt to kill all other males to ensure that only he will be able to mate with the female quails.

, You can also order them in advance online. Your incubator should include an egg turner.

, Keep a humidifier or dehumidifier nearby to adjust the humidity. Humidity controls unnecessary loss of moisture in the egg.

, It is essential that you keep it even at this temperature. It will take a Couternix egg about 16 to 18 days to hatch at this temperature, while other breeds take 22 to 25 days.

, Then, the tray must turn 30 degrees each way every day to keep embryos from sticking to the shell., Gradually lower the temperature from 100ºF (40ºC) to room temperature by three degrees each day. Cold chicks will bunch on top of each other whilst hot chicks will pant.

, Then, give them more space as they grow.

, Chick starter provides more nutrients for your chick which is what they need, and when they get older they do not require this diet any more. You can purchase some turkey starter or some chicken starter and grind them up into smaller grains so that the quail chicks can eat it. Any feed that is high in protein should be alright.,, Clean and refill their water containers daily.


Make sure that the chicks cannot drown in the water container and have easy access to it. Most breeders will put marbles in the water container to prevent the quail from drowning.

, You can add some of it to your compost. Quail waste is high in ammonia, so it must be changed frequently.

, Wash it once per week to avoid disease and illness.

, Special laying food is available at most feed stores. Ask if it is good for laying birds before you buy it. If you are raising quail for meat, change their food to a finisher diet instead of a laying fowl mix.

, The grit will help grind down the food and the oyster shells provide calcium for the quail to lay strong, healthy eggs., The females will start to lay and they will have poor egg production levels if they are exposed to other animals, noise or other disturbances.

Set up a brooder for the quail chicks.,
Provide a heat-lamp for the chicks and keep the temperature at 100 °F (37.8 °C).,
Add bedding to the brooder.,
Purchase a feeder and a water bowl.",How to Care for Quail Chicks1," A brooder is a small space to raise your quail chicks and can generally be anything (e.g. a cardboard box) as long as it is safe, warm and sanitary.


The brooder should be kept in a safe and warm place that is away from predators. In your home is the best place to keep your chicks but you can also keep them in a shed or a garage as a last resort.;
, Lower the temperature by 5 degrees every week until it is at room temperature.


Cold chicks will pile on top of each over and fluff up whilst hot chicks will pant. You will also see the chicks trying to get away from the heat source if they are hot and trying to keep under the middle of the heat source if they are too cold.

, Wood shavings are good bedding for your chicks but you can also use paper towels or newspaper, however, they are not as absorbent as wood shavings and newspaper is ‘slippery’.

, Choose a small feeder/water bowl and make sure that the chicks have easy access to them.

Decide whether you need to bathe your quail.,
Understand the risks associated with bathing your quail.,
Determine what the substance is that you need to clean off.,
Examine your quail's physical state.",How to Bathe a Pet Quail1," You should only ever bathe an animal if they need to be bathed. Constant cleaning is unhealthy and dangerous for any kind of pet. Their immunity levels can lower and certain chemicals in shampoos and soaps can irritate and dry their skin.


If your quail desperately needs to be washed, or if advised by an avian vet, you can decide that it is necessary to bathe your bird.;
, It's good to be knowledgeable on what can go wrong when you decide to clean your quail. Your bird's immunity levels lower when soaked with water, making them more prone to illnesses such as a cold, and they could also accidentally inhale the water. Soaps and shampoos can also irritate and dry out your quail's skin and get rid of the important oils on their feathers.


This is why you shouldn't randomly decide your quail needs a bath when they actually don't. If your quail seems smelly to you, there's usually nothing to be concerned about and it's a poor reason to bathe your bird.

, Is it dirt or gum? If it is a tougher substance that won't easily come off, you will need to seek a vet for help. Coarse scrubbing in an attempt to get it off will harm your quail's feathers.

, You should never attempt to bathe a quail that is weak or ill. If you attempt to bathe an already unhealthy quail, you will put them in a life-threatening position. You need to seek veterinary care to help your quail get better.

The daytime shelter should be something the ducks can quickly hide under in case a bird of prey spots them.,
Keep the environment clean.,
Provide them with clean water daily.,
Ducks absolutely need clean swimming water for their physical and mental well-being.,
Feed your duck the right food.,
Consider getting multiple ducks.,
Have fun with your ducks.",How to Look After Fully Grown Ducks," It doesn't have to be too elaborate, but should be large enough that all of the ducks can hide at one time, if needed.;
, If a duck's enclosure gets too messy, or the ground that the duck walks on is abrasive to the padding on the feet, the duck can develop a condition known as bumblefoot. Bumblefoot is a bacterial infection that swells the pads of the foot and makes it very painful for the duck to stand. If left untreated, bumblefoot could eventually cause infection or even death.

, Water dishes work fine, but ducks have the habit of turning the water chalky brown or muddy just from playing around and looking for bugs like they do. The dish needs to be deep enough to fully immerse their bill.

, Without access to clean water in which the ducks can bathe and swim and immerse their entire bodies, they cannot maintain their waterproofing. Their waterproofing is essential in order for the ducks to thermoregulate (keep cool in the summer, warm in the winter) and to prevent them from drowning. The water must be clean and easy to get in and out of (a kiddie pool is fine if there is a ramp for exit/entrance, something larger that is flush with the ground is even better, but it must have a shallow grade or ramp for exiting.

, A common thought is that ducks can survive on bread, but this is untrue. Bread may be sufficient as a snack, but it lacks the proper nutrients required to keep a healthy duck. The most commonly used duck feed happens to be chicken feed or scratch from the local farm supply store. This is a good choice, and paired with greens like peas and salads, it will keep a healthy flock. Make sure the chicken feed is un-medicated, though. Mazuri, a brand of animal food producers, puts out a duck maintenance which is also an excellent choice of feeds, but it is costly. One 50 lb bag can cost in excess of $25.

, Ducks can make awesome single pets, but a lot of attention has to be poured into one to keep them happy, because they are flock animals. Two or more ducks can still be personable, but don't rely as much on the owner for attention.

, They are clowns, and will constantly be making you chuckle as they perform their wild antics!

Put a small bowl of dog food outside.,
Hide somewhere with a net.,
Sneak up on the duck.,
Scoop up the duck with the net.,
Remove the duck from the net.",How to Catch a Duck1," Fill up a small bowl with wet or dry dog food and place it outside near where the duck typically stays. You can use dry food, or you can wet it a bit with water.If the duck is injured, it’s best to use wet dog food so the duck will get some water and avoid dehydration.
You can also put out a bowl of water for an injured duck to get rehydrated.;
, Find a place to hide where you can see the food bowl, but the duck will not be able to see you. Hide there with a net big enough to fit the duck.


A net with a handle will give you good leverage to be able to scoop up the duck without having to get too close.
Get a net with an opening greater than 1 foot in diameter. A large fishing net is a good option.

, While the duck is eating the dog food, quietly sneak up behind it. Make your movements quick but quiet because you need to get up to the duck before it’s done eating, but you don’t want the duck to hear you coming.


Keep the net hidden behind your back so the duck does not see it.

, When you get close enough to the duck for the net to reach, swiftly bring the net down over the duck.


Grasp the duck by the neck while it is in the net to gently lift it off the ground.
If the duck flies away before you can get the net out, try the method again the next day.

, Place the net on the ground and gently reach in to grasp the duck by the neck. Be careful not to pull the duck out with its wings tangled in the net. Gently work the net free from the duck's feet and wings to prevent injuring the duck.


While holding the duck by the neck you can safely place it in a carrier for transport, or release it in a new location.

Keep your chicks in a brooder.,
Feed your chicks a special chick starter diet.,
Provide plenty of fresh water for your chicks.,
Clean the brooder daily.",How to Care for Quail Chicks2," Once the chicks are dry it’s important to raise them in a brooder for the first four to six weeks of their lives to ensure that they are safe, warm and are being kept healthy.

, Chick starter provides more protein than a quail's average feed and should be given to your chicks for six to eight weeks to keep them healthy.

, Fill the water bowl daily and make sure that it isn’t too deep for your chicks as they can fall in and drown. A common trick is to put pebbles/stones is the water bowl to make it shallower.


Remember to clean the water bowl once a week to prevent diseases and the water from getting dirty.

, Depending on the amount of chicks you have and how old they are, it’s important to clean the brooder often as the waste can cause serious disease to your chicks.

Keep the hen with her chicks.,
Isolate the chicks and the mother hen.,
Make sure your hen and chicks cannot escape from the housing.,
Add bedding to the brooder/cage.,
Make sure your chicks are safe from any pets.,
Consider adding a heat lamp to the housing.,
Provide your chicks and hen with chick starter soon after hatching.,
Provide a constant supply of fresh water.",How to Care for Quail Chicks3," The mother hen will keep the chicks warm, feed them and keep them safe. If you are going to separate the chicks it is best done when they are fully grown and can thrive on their own.

, Keep them in a brooder or a small cage. This is important if the hen and her chicks are housed with other quail or aviary birds (finches, budgies, etc.) as they will attack or peck at the chicks causing them serious injuries and possible death.


Suitable housing includes rabbit hutches, rodent cages, aquariums, pet carriers, etc.

, Measure the space between the wiring, see if there are any gaps about and check that the housing is ‘’’secure’’’.


A suitable place to keep your quail is indoors or in a shed/garage. As long as the area is warm, safe and free of drafts it is suitable for your quail chicks.

, Some suitable types of bedding are wood shavings, sand, hay, straw or newspaper shreddings., The main threat to quail are dogs and cats. Smaller pets such as hamsters, mice or fish are no harm to quail so they can be kept in the same room as your quail but other pets should be kept away.

, Though the hen will keep her chicks warm naturally, if it is a really cold day or if winter is approaching consider giving them a heat lamp as the hen can get cold as well.

, Chick starter provides more protein than normal quail feed and should be given if you want to raise your chicks into healthy quails.


If you cannot purchase chick starter, use your normal quail feed and grind it down so that it is edible for the chicks. If the feed is too big the chicks will not eat no matter how much the hen tries to make them.

, Choose a shallow bowl for the chicks and make sure they can easily access it. Adding pebbles to a deep bowl can prevent the chicks from drowning if they do fall in.


You should clean the bowl at least once a week to prevent the water from getting dirt. If your chicks have a more messy bedding such as wood shavings or sand, clean the bowl more often than usual.

Give your chicks more space as they grow.,
Provide a tub of sand for your chicks.,
Give your chicks some treats.,
Let your chicks outside after a couple of weeks.,
As they age into adulthood, continue taking taking good care of them.",How to Care for Quail Chicks4," Once your chicks are older they will need more space. Consider moving your chicks to a bigger brooder/cage.

, They will soon begin dust bathing which quail love very much. Dust bathing also prevents mites, lice and other nasty parasites.

, Quail love vegetables, fruit and table scraps. Give them various items and see what they like and dislike. Good treats to give your chicks are:


Vegetables such as cucumber, salad leaves, broccoli, etc.
Fruit such as strawberries, tomato, melon, apple, pear, etc.
Scraps such as pasta, boiled egg, rice, cereal, bread, etc.
Live creatures such as mealworms, woodlice, millipedes, small spiders, etc.

, Put the chicks and the hen in an outdoor cage and then watch them dig for bugs, dust bathe in dirt/sand and explore the new environment. Be cautious and make sure they cannot get out. To be sure, watch them for a minute or two to see how they adapt to their surroundings.


If you're not watching them, put a tarpaulin on top of the cage so no birds will attack/scare them. Make sure to weight down the blanket with something heavy (bricks) so the wind won't blow it away.

, How to Care for Quail covers quail care beyond the chick stage.

Cut and attach the wire.,
Attach the panels.,
Attach the top, bottom, and wheels.,

Add entertainment features.",How to Make a Bird Cage," You'll need plywood or MDF at 1/2"" thickness, 1x2 lumber, four 2x2 pieces of lumber, strong metal cage wire (poultry wire or similar), wood glue, 2.5"" decking screws, hinges, and a saw. You can optionally add casters if you want the cage to be easily movable.


The wood you choose for making the cage should be very hard like plywood and the netting or wiring should not be painted but simply electroplated.





;
, Cut the 2x2 lumber to 72"" lengths. These will be the vertical posts.

, You'll need the following cuts of 1x2 lumber:


Two pieces at 72""
Three pieces at 45""

, You'll need the following cuts of 1x2 lumber:


Four pieces at 36""
Four pieces at 33""

, You'll need solid pieces of MDF or plywood, each cut to 36""x51"".

, Using decking screws, screw through the narrow side of the long pieces and into the ends of the short pieces. You should end up with two large panels for the front and back at 48""x72"" with a bar in the middle. You should also have four square frames for the sides, each at 36x36"".

, Cut wire that is big enough to cover the center of the frames and extend onto the frames themselves. Using a staple gun, staple the wire to wood frame on what will become the inside of the panels. You can soften the edges and keep things from getting caught on them by tracing the edge of the wire with silicon or caulk.

, Attach the front panels to the posts, so that the edges are flush, using the decking screws. Then attach just one of the side panels on each side, one flush with the top and one flush with the bottom. Set the remaining two side panels aside to become the doors. You should now have a 36""x51""x72"" box.

, Using decking screws, screw the top and bottom pieces into the posts, two screws to a post. If you want wheels, attach caster wheels into the posts using the manufacturer's instructions.

, Attach the remaining two panels by placing two hinges on each side, one half attached to the door, the other half attached to the the center piece on the other side panel. This should leave you with a cage door on either side: one on top to add food and interact with the birds, the other at the bottom to aid in cleaning.

, Line the bottom of the cage with a flattened garbage bag and then wood chips, newspaper, or other appropriate lining material.

, You can mount the food trays to the wire or wood, or place them elsewhere in the cage, depending on what is best for your bird.

, Birds need perches and toys. Birds spend a lot of their time on perches. Place them in varying heights within the cage. Some good toys for your bird are mirrors, ladders, and bells. These keep your bird from becoming bored.

Place your quail inside a warm room.,
Get rid of other pets and threats.,
Use a damp flannel or sponge to clean your quail.,
Fill a shallow bucket with lukewarm water.,
Firmly hold your quail and slowly place them in the water.,
Refrain from using soap unless necessary.,
Never wash your quail's face or ear region.,
Gently wrap the quail in a warm towel.,
Leave your quail in the towel to air dry.,
Clip the wing feathers.,
Trim your quail's nails.,
Return your quail to their cage.",How to Bathe a Pet Quail2," You should bathe your quail in a warm area free from drafts. Alternatively, turn a heater on until the room has warmed up to a fair temperature. Never attempt to bathe a quail in the cold. They are prone to sickness this way.


A bathroom is not ideal as the tiles make the room a lot colder. Unless you can find a heater that will easily heat the room, then don't use the bathroom. Instead, use a warm living room or bedroom.

, The room should be a safe and secure space for your quail. They should feel calm in their surroundings. If there is a chance your quail suddenly escapes, will they be safe in the room?


Remove other pets from the room. Even a friendly animal can scare a small quail. Cats and dogs should be removed from the premises and so should other noisy birds such as budgies.
Ensure there are no small children in the room. You may be using objects to preen your guinea pigs that shouldn't be touched by young children.
Close all windows, doors and ensure the room is draft-free. Quails are more prone to illness if cold air can get into the room.

, Before you attempt to give your quail a bath, you can always try to get rid of any dirt on your quail with a damp flannel or sponge. If this step doesn't work, move onto bathing your quail.

, The water should come up to the halfway length of your quail's body but not too deep. Be cautious with the water as your quail can easily inhale it.

, Cup both hands over your quail's body and slowly place them in the lukewarm water. Use one hand to continue firmly holding the quail and your other to wipe away any dirty substances stuck to your quail. The water alone should clean any dirt on your quail.

, The chemicals in soaps and shampoos can irritate your quail's skin and remove important oils on their feathers, thus leading to dry and irritated skin.


If the dirt isn't coming off with plain water, consider using a safe, gentle soap to remove it. Gently scrub the dirt with your finger and a slight drop of soap. A tiny drop of baby shampoo should be safe to use.

, These should be kept dry and away from the water. If you attempt to wash your quail's face and ear region, they are prone to inhaling water and irritating their eyes, nose, and ears. If there is dirt stuck to your quail's face, contact a vet for professional advice.

, Wrap the body of your quail, leaving their head exposed, and allow them to sit in the towel. Gentle blot away at your quail's feathers, partially drying them. Stroke along the feathers.


Remember that at this stage, you should ensure that your quail is kept warm in a heated room.
A blow dryer can be used to attempt to dry the quail's feathers, but it's not recommended as the heat can be too hot and stressful for your bird.

, Your quail should be happily sitting in the towel. Not all the water can be dried through using a towel, so you will need to allow the quail to air-dry and preen itself as it does. Your quail should stay indoors until fully dry.

, Wing clipping isn't necessary, it can help prevent your quail from flying away or out of their cage. Get a friend to firmly hold the quail and then spread out their wing. Clip the tips of the flight feathers on both wings. Avoid cutting too close to the bone area.


Wing clipping is an easy process, but if you're a little unsteady, you can always book an appointment with a bird groomer or veterinarian, especially if your bird is jumpy.

, Overgrown nails will need to be filed back or cut down. Take the opportunity to trim them now. You will need sharp nail clippers and watch out to not cut the quick. The quick is the red bloodline that is visible in the nail.

, Once dry and clean, your quail should be ready to be returned home. Avoid returning your quail to a dirty cage. Make sure he/she won't get dirty all over again by being returned. Never return a wet quail that hasn't fully dried yet.

Take the opportunity to clean your quail's pen.,
Consider their type of housing.,
Spot clean.,
Disinfect the cage at least every two weeks.,
Allow for dust-bathing.",How to Bathe a Pet Quail3," If dirty, you should opt towards cleaning the housing of your quail to keep them clean. It will benefit both you and your bird. Whilst the quail is currently not in their home, quickly clean it up.


If you're using water to clean their home, do not place your quail back inside until both they and their housing are dry.

, A large guinea pig cage is adequate for quails as it has a solid and clean bottom. In most cases they can be a lot cleaner than pens which are housed on the garden floor. Keep note of a few factors that will determine your quail's living conditions.


A small cage will quickly get dirty compared to one with plenty of space to roam.
Of course, placing your quail's pen on dirt will only set yourself up for failure. When winter time rolls in, that dirt will turn into wet mud. Grass or a solid floor bottom would be a cleaner option.

, Spot cleaning is a term used when you clean little patches of dirt around the cage daily. This can be sweeping up a pile of droppings or soiled bedding and rinsing the food and water dishes each day. Spot cleaning can be effective in making their cage stay clean and their bedding last.

, It's important that you perform a deep clean at least fortnightly as quails can make a lot of mess. Disinfect all around the cage including their water and food dishes. Add new bedding and sweep up the droppings.

, Dust-bathing is your quail's way of keeping clean and grooming themselves naturally. Provide them with a shallow tub or dry dirt or sand and they will be encouraged to dust bathe. It's great for their feathers and health!

Wait until it is dark out.,
Sneak up on the duck.,
Put down a carrier.,
Scoop the duck into the carrier with a blanket.,
Release the duck in a new location.",How to Catch a Duck2," Ducks don’t see well in the dark, so your best bet at catching a duck is at night. Wait until the middle of the night when it’s the darkest and the ducks will be sleeping., While the duck is sleeping, carefully creep up on the duck. Make your movements slow so that you don’t risk waking the duck and alerting them to your plan.


Observe the location where you have spotted the duck for several nights. You maybe able to locate a nesting location where the duck sleeps each night.
Look for matted grass or droppings nearby to find the duck's resting spot.

, Put an animal carrier down right next to where the duck is sleeping. Have the door open and ready for your to scoop the duck into the carrier.


Open the latch of the carrier before approaching the duck to prevent the noise of the locking mechanism from disturbing the duck.
A plastic animal carrier for a small dog or cat is a good size for a duck.
Avoid carriers with long slits as the duck's wings may slip through and become trapped.

, When you’ve crept up very close to the duck, cover the duck with a lightweight blanket or towel. Quickly use the blanket to scoop the duck into the carrier before the duck has a chance to figure out what’s happening. Close the carrier’s door and lock it.

, Turn the door of the carrier away from your body and reach over the top of the carrier to open the door. Try to keep your arms and body away from the opening to allow the duck to escape peacefully.

Build a funnel trap.,
Place the trap in an area frequented by ducks.,
Attract the duck to your trap.,
Scoop the ducks into a net or cloth bag.,
Remove the ducks from the bag.",How to Catch a Duck3," Attach 5 foot metal or wooden poles to a mesh net every three to four feet. You will need a section of net that is 6 feet wide by 30 feet long.A funnel trap works by allowing the ducks to squeeze into a narrow opening that is tapered inward making it easy to get in but hard to get out.
Hammer the posts into the ground in a circular shape with the ends of the net extending inward to the middle of the circle.
Drape a piece of netting over the top of your trap to keep the ducks from flying out.

, Observe the behavior of the ducks you are attempting to catch for a few days to get a good idea of where to place the trap.


Traps can be placed on dry land or in shallow water.
The best time to catch ducks is after they have mated and molted their flight feathers which leaves them grounded.

, In order for your trap to be effective you will need to get the duck to be comfortable coming to the area where the trap is located.


Spread bait in and around the trap. Keep the majority of the bait inside the trap to encourage the duck to enter the trap. You don’t want them to feed outside of the trap, but it is necessary to place a small amount of bait such as corn outside the trap to attract them to the area initially.
Place a decoy duck in the trap. When ducks see another duck in an area they are more likely to investigate and approach the area. Placing a mounted duck inside the trap is the most realistic decoy, however wooden or plastic decoys can also be effective.
Use a duck call to attract ducks to the area where your trap is located. Be sure that you stay hidden in blind or under cover to avoid spooking the ducks.

, Remove the ducks from the trap one by one by scooping them up with a net or bag.


If you must grab the duck with your hands, grab it by the neck rather than the wings to prevent injury to the duck.

, After transporting your ducks to their new location, gently lay the bag on the ground. Open the end of the bag and grasp the duck firmly, yet gently, around the neck. Pull the ducks from the ground and hug them towards your body with your other arm to prevent them from flapping their wings. Release the duck onto the ground to waddle away.

Get a dog cage.,
Get mesh.,
Take zip ties and zip tie the mesh to the four corners of the cage.,
Add in bedding at the bottom.,
Add in perches.,
Add in the toys.,
Add in a food and water bowl, and a bath!,
Add in the bird!",How to Make a Bird Cage from a Dog Cage," The cage you use depends on the size of your bird. A budgie could go with a medium size, while a parrot may need and extra large! Please ensure that your cage can fit the necessary products for your bird’s health, and that it has room for your bird to fly around.;
, You can use fabric mesh for budgies and smaller birds, but harder mesh, or metal mesh, is recommended for larger parrots, like African Greys.

, Make sure to do this and tie the zip ties firmly. When you get to the door, simply tie it to the side that the door opens to, so you can access the cage easily.

, If you use newspaper, or bird paper, add that in. This will make cleaning the birdcage easier, since bird feces dry fast and will stick to the bottom of the cage.

, The highest perch will be the one your bird will go on most. So ensure that the highest on is one that will benefit your bird, preferably a natural wood perch.

, Add in swings, ladders, mirrors, whatever you want! Make sure the cage is full of toys, but not too many so it is safe for a bird to fly around. Also, make sure they vary, and have foraging toys to have stimulation in your bird's life. Again, go for as many natural wood toys as possible!

, Food and water bowls should be kept clean! Bathwater is needed, to help with molting and makes it easier for the feathers to come out, taking some stress off the bird.

, The bird will be happy to have a nice, big home. If you just got your bird, give them 1 month to get used to its new home and cage. If you already had your bird and just making an upgrade, simply give them a few days to get used to the cage.

Remove your bird from the cage.,
Remove toys and accessories.,
Remove seeds and loose droppings.,
Clean and rinse the interior of the cage.,
Disinfect the cage.,
Clean the items you removed from the cage.,
Let everything dry before reassembling the cage.",How to Clean and Maintain Lory and Lorikeet Habitats1," About once a month, you should give your cage a thorough cleaning. Before you start cleaning, remove your lory or lorikeet from the cage so you don't have to clean around it. You can move your bird to an alternative cage or a room in your home that's safe for your bird., Take out any toys and accessories that are removable. Place somewhere safe for now. You will clean them later in the process., Put on a pair of gloves. Remove any loose debris, like droppings and seeds, from the floor of the cage and throw them away.If there are droppings on perches or toys, scrub them off using dishwashing detergent and water. With wood perches and toys, rub off the droppings with sandpaper.

, Use a cloth soaked in hot, soapy water. Scrub down the full interior of the cage, including bars, perches, and the floor. Wash away any set in dirt or stains from the cage. When you're done, use plain water to rinse the cage. You can use a cloth soaked in plain water or spray the cage down with a hose or spray bottle., Buy a commercial disinfectant for a bird cage online or at a pet store. Spray down the full interior of the cage with your disinfectant. Then, rinse the cage thoroughly using plain water., Toys, perches, baths, and food dishes should all be washed with warm water and dish soap. They should also be sprayed with disinfectant after the washing process. Make sure to rinse all items from the cage completely before returning them to the cage.Some toys and accessories can be washed safely in the dishwasher, which can save you time.
Soft toys, like ropes, can be washed in a washing machine.
Unfortunately, older toys and accessories may not come completely clean, no matter how much you wash them. Anything that doesn't come clean should be thrown out.

, In general, air drying is your best option. Make sure the cage and all toys and accessories dry completely before reassembling your cage and putting your bird back in the cage.Placing items out in the sun can speed up the drying process.

Clean out the dishes.,
Inspect the cage accessories.,
Change the liner.,
Sweep up the surrounding areas.",How to Clean a Birdcage1," Food and water dishes should be cleaned out every day using hot water and dish soap. Rinse the dishes before lathering with soap, then rinse the soap off under hot water for several seconds. Once the bowl is clean, dry thoroughly with a clean towel.Some dishes may be dishwasher safe. Check to make sure that your dishes are dishwasher safe before placing them in the dishwasher, and make sure you use an animal-safe detergent.
Animal-safe dish soaps and detergents are often available at local pet stores, online, or in grocery stores that carry environmentally-friendly cleaning products.
It may also be useful to have two or three sets of dishes on hand if you do not have time to properly clean and dry the dishes every day.
Often, the bird can stay in the cage during daily cleanings. However, if you think the bird is a flight risk, you may want to consider keeping an alternate cage where the bird can stay while you clean.;
, If you have a birdbath, swings, ladders, or other toys, wash them in hot, soapy water the same way you do the dishes. Scrape droppings off perches and rotate the perches to ensure they wear evenly.When you replace the toys in the cage, consider moving them around to give your bird variety and additional stimulation.

, Your bird cage liner should be replaced every day. Newspaper or other store-bought paper linings are generally the preferred lining for your bird cage, as they are safe, economical, and easy to check for droppings. Remove the old liner completely, using a damp rag or sponge to take up any paper that sticks, and place the new paper down in several thin layers.Newspaper lining or any other recycled paper lining should be free of colored ink, as some pigments used in some inks may be toxic to birds.
Try to have at least seven layers of paper down to catch and absorb all debris and droppings.

, Use a handheld broom or vacuum to sweep up the areas surrounding the cage to pick up food, feathers, droppings, and other debris that may have fallen out of the cage. Wipe up any water or moisture that may have spilled into the surrounding area, as well.


A cage apron can be used to help collect debris falling out of the cage and may be easily emptied every day. These are available at pet stores as well as specialty bird stores.
If your cage is in a carpeted area, a plastic floor liner such as a placemat or a mat that might go under an office chair can help catch debris and may be easily sanitized.

Consider the size of your bird.,
Consider how the cage is made.,
Place food and water bowls in the cage.,
Consider adding a bathing dish.,
Include accessories for your bird cage.,
Line the bottom of the bird cage.,
Add the finishing touches.",How to Set Up a Bird Cage," You definitely don't want your bird to be cramped in a cage that is way to small. You'll want to get the most spacious cage possible, that will fit well into your home.


Many cages are species specific. For example, a finch usually does best in a wide cage where they have room to fly. You want to get a cage that is at least twice as tall and twice as wide as the wingspan of your bird.
Make sure the bars on the cage are not far enough apart that bird will be able to stick its head or body through.
Parrots and birds can feel stressed in a rounded cage. Make sure that your cage is square, rectangle or at least has corners.;
, Some bird cages eventually rust. Stainless steel is a good way to go if you want something that will last for years. Also, birds with very strong beaks won't be able to mess it up.

, Most pet stores sell dishes that will hang from the side of the cage and are made for a bird to perch on. These allow for easy refills and may be more convenient than placing a bowl on the bottom of the cage.

, Some people find that their bird enjoys bathing and they add a third dish, filled with water, for solely that purpose.

, Birds need perches and toys. Birds spend a lot of their time on perches. Place them in varying heights within the cage. Some good toys for your bird are mirrors, ladders, and bells. These keep your bird from becoming bored.

, Under the wire, use a liner, such as paper towel, to catch droppings and make for easier clean up.

, Fill up your bird's food and water dishes, hang up all the toys, and add in your bird!

Consider how and how often you must maintain the aviary.,
Research materials you could use to build the aviary.,
Decide if you want your aviary indoors or outdoors.,
Plan for a larger aviary rather than a small one.",How to Build an Aviary1," What materials would aid in quick cleaning?;
,


Certain types of wood can be poisonous to birds and some metal materials can chip easily, which can also cause health problems. Professionals advise using non-coated galvanized steel for the cage, and ceramic, concrete, brick or linoleum for the floor of your aviary.







, This may affect the size and materials you decide to use.

Weather conditions and predators are important considerations when building an outside aviary, while maintenance and ventilation are key for an indoor aviary.






You can structure your aviary so that it is portable for both inside and outside use.







,


An aviary can be any size but you'll want to accommodate for the size of your bird and give him enough room to fly--at least twice the wingspan for width, six times the body for length and four times the body for height.
Budget space for additions like nests or branches.

Place a plastic chair and small shower curtain near the cage.,
Spray down panels and floors as needed.,
Replace your liners each day.,
Clean dishes each day.",How to Clean and Maintain Lory and Lorikeet Habitats2," Lory and lorikeets tend to have loose droppings due to their diet, which can create mess in the area surrounding the cage due to dripping. To keep the surrounding area clean, hang a shower curtain on the wall near the cage. Place a plastic chair under the cage as well., Due to runny stools, the floor and panels of lory/lorikeet cages need frequent cleaning. Each day, use a hose or spray bottle to spritz clean water over any soiled areas in the cage. This should keep the cage relatively dropping free for your birds., Any liners you keep in your bird's cage should be replaced at the end of each day. Cage liners, such as newspaper, should be removed, thrown out, and replaced with fresh materials.If you use many layers of cage liners, it's sometimes only necessary to replace the top layer.

, At the end of each day, remove food and water dishes from the cage. Wash them using warm, soapy water. Rinse them thoroughly and allow them to dry completely before returning them to the cage.Do not wash your bird's dishes near areas where food is prepared.
As it can sometimes take awhile for dishes to dry, invest in an extra set of dishes to place in the cage while the other dishes dry.

Opt for a larger cage.,
Replace damaged toys regularly.,
Go for natural cleaning products.,
Place the cage in a space that's easy to clean.",How to Clean and Maintain Lory and Lorikeet Habitats3," Lory and lorikeets need a large cage to thrive. The cage you get should be at least two feet tall and 24 by 24 inches., When doing a routine cleaning, check all the toys. If toys have broken edges, loose strings, or other damages, throw them away. Replace them with similar toys right away. Most bird toys are not made to last long term and need to be replaced fairly regularly., To minimize the risk of negative reactions to cleaning products, go for natural products. Most pet stores sell organic cleaners and disinfectants that minimize the use of harsh chemicals and artificial ingredients., Due to the tendency of lories and lorikeets to squirt their droppings, place the cage in an area that is easy to clean. Ideally, keep the cage outdoors. If you don't have space for a safe outdoor aviary, place the cage near washable walls, such as tiled walls or walls painted with acrylic paint."
"
Pick a cleaning schedule.,
Remove everything.,
Scrape away debris and droppings.,
Wash the cage.,
Disinfect the cage.,
Refill the cage.",How to Clean a Birdcage2," How frequently you need to sanitize your cage depends on a number of factors including the size of the cage, the size of your birds, the number of birds you have, and how much time daily your birds are in the cage. Find a cleaning schedule that meets the needs of your specific set-up.Smaller cages with individual birds may only need to be sanitized once a month, especially if the bird is regularly let out of the cage.
Large cages for large birds or cages for multiple birds should be sanitized weekly.

, Move your bird into a safe area such as an alternate cage and take all toys and accessories out of the cage to wash as you would for a daily washing. Remove the old liner and leave the cage bare.It is important to keep your bird in an area free from any exposure to fumes or excess product while you are cleaning your cage.
Remember to wash any dishes and cage accessories in hot, soapy water before returning them to the clean cage.

, Remove debris and droppings from the cage using a pet-friendly soap or washing detergent and a scrubbing pad. Scrape them off of any of the cage surfaces, as well as off of perches and toys.Sandpaper can be useful in removing stubborn debris from wooden perches or toys.

, Use hot, soapy water to wash down the cage completely, then rinse thoroughly removing all soap and suds. This may be manageable in a sink for smaller cages, but larger cages may require a shower or use of a hose outdoors.An animal-safe dish soap or detergent is sufficient for this stage in the cleaning process.
For better results disinfecting, use a clean towel to lightly dry the cage and soak up any excess water pooling around the cage’s surfaces.

, Once the cage has been washed, spray the cage from top to bottom with a cage disinfectant spray. Disinfectant sprays meant specifically for bird cages may be bought online or purchased at a local pet or bird specialty store. Rinse the cage thoroughly with water and allow to air-dry completely before returning the bird.Some people opt to use a vinegar cleaning solution of one part distilled white vinegar and two parts water. Another homemade solution is three cups hot water, three tablespoons baking soda, and three tablespoons lemon juice.If you do not have the means to spray the disinfectant on the cage, thoroughly wipe down every surface with a clean towel soaked in the disinfectant solution. Remember to use protective gloves whenever handling the disinfectant.

, Once the cage has been sanitized, rinsed, and dried you are ready to replace all dry perches, toys, dishes, and other cage components. Place in the clean cage lining and make sure the apron and surrounding area are clean and free of debris before allowing your bird back in.


Do not put wet or unrinsed components back in the cage, as these may cause harm to your bird or otherwise hinder their movement and access to parts of the cage.

Choose a birdbath.,
Use warm water.,
Allow the bird to dry.",How to Clean a Birdcage3," Bathing your bird regularly is just as important to its overall health as cleaning the cage. Choose a birdbath that is appropriately sized for your bird so that it will not have trouble getting in and out of the basin.Some birdbaths are meant for use inside the cage, while some are meant for use outside the cage. Larger birds may benefit from external baths, but bath setup largely comes down to owner preference.
If you have a bird that can swim, such as a duck, make sure the bath contains enough space and water for the bird to be able to dunk their head safely.

, Allow the bird to use the bath only with your supervision. Fill the bath with warm water, and allow the bird to splash around, getting itself wet and preening for several minutes before removing it from the bath.Once your bird has finished bathing, scratch against the feathers to imitate mutual preening. Be sure not to press the feathers down against the bird’s body, as birds do not enjoy this sensation.

, Your bird will need time enough to dry before the evening. Allowing a bird to bathe too close to bedtime could lead them to getting dangerously cold during the night. Make sure your bird has at least a few hours to dry fully, especially for large birds.If you live in a colder environment, make sure the room is well-heated while your bird is bathing as well as when it is drying off.

",How to Build an Aviary2,"


If you use concrete as recommended, lay 12 inches (30.5 cm) for the foundation. You can add a layer of sand, gravel or pine to the concrete to sweep up with waste during cleaning.
You may also want to ""plant"" non-toxic foliage in the concrete while it's setting or at least leave enough space.

, Stone, metal, plastic or brick piping work, as well as treated lumber.

,


Parameters and wire spacing are dependent on the size of birds you want to house in the aviary.
You'll want to make sure the wire is heavy enough that your bird can't break it, usually 10-gauge or heavier.

, Whether you make the entrance or purchase a ready-made door, make sure it is a double-door to prevent escape.

,


At least one-third of the aviary should be enclosed. Fasten material--plastic, Plexiglas, cloth or hardwood--to two or three sides of the aviary and the roof.
You can also add insulation and a heater.

,

Add another layer of wiring or mesh to prevent predators from getting too close to your bird. A 1/2-inch-by-1/2-inch wire will thwart opossums, rats and cats. Even smaller wire can prevent snakes and mice from accessing the aviary.






If you set the aviary on the ground, you'll also want to make sure that other animals cannot dig to get inside. Digging 6 inches (15.2 cm) down and around the perimeter can help.







, Make sure perches are far enough from the edge of the aviary that it won't invite predators.

This is the best way to keep the bulk of your livestock healthy and free of pests or disease. However, it's important that you use only healthy pigs that are free of pests to restock your pig population so that you do not usher in a new wave of pest infestation.Restock your pig population with pest-free stock. Closely inspect all incoming pigs and keep all new, incoming pigs in quarantine.;
, New livestock should always be viewed as potentially infected. You should choose new pigs from a trusted livestock source that you believe is free of pests, but remember that it's impossible to guarantee that a pig has never been exposed to lice or mites.


New livestock should be quarantined away from the main herd for up to three weeks.Treat new, incoming pigs with an approved insecticide twice, with treatments spaced out two weeks apart. Then keep the pigs in isolation for an additional week to ensure they are free of parasites.
Look for signs of lice and mange, including skin irritation, redness, scabs, and visible insects.

, While pig lice and mites don't affect humans, you can act as a medium to transfer lice and mites to other pigs. To prevent this, it's imperative that you wash your hands/arms any time you handle an infected pig. You should also change your clothing and wash those garments before wearing them around any healthy pigs.Handle healthy pigs first, then work your way towards the infected pigs. This can help streamline the process of treating your pigs.
Wash any exposed clothing in clean, hot water with soap. You may also want to consider spraying some insecticide on your clothing before washing them to ensure that all pests have been killed., There are a number of pesticides that can safely be used on infected pigs. It's important that you follow the directions on a given pesticide's label, as the application method may be specific for that particular insecticide. Ask your veterinarian if you're unsure about whether a particular insecticide is safe to use or if you have any questions about how to safely administer an insecticide.Ivermectin (Ivomec) can be injected subcutaneously. It should be administered at least 18 days before slaughter.
Amitraz (Point-Guard) can be poured on topically. It should be applied at least seven days before slaughter.
Amitraz (Tactic) can be used topically as a spray or a dip. It should be applied at least one day before slaughter.
Permethrin (Gard-Star 40EC) can also be applied as either a spray or a dip. It should be applied at least five days before slaughter.
Fenvalerate (Ectrin WDL) can be applied as a spray only. It should be applied at least one day before slaughter.
Ivermectin (Ivomec Swine Premix) should be administered orally through the pig's feed at least five days before slaughter. This insecticide is only recommended for pigs that weigh 220 pounds (99.8 kilograms) or less.

, In addition to disinfecting pigs, you should also disinfect their living spaces. Pests like lice and mites are transmitted through both direct contact and shared bedding and living spaces, so by treating an infected pig's living space you can help protect the pigs that will occupy that space in the future.Air out the barn and try to let as much sunlight in as possible.
Pens that housed infected pigs should be cleaned and sprayed with an approved insecticide.Lice and mites cannot live for very long without host animals. Pens should be left unoccupied for at least three days after treating the living space, but keeping the barn free of livestock for up to two weeks is preferable.
Any bedding used by infected livestock should be sprayed with insecticide or discarded entirely., If some of your pigs have contracted lice or mites, it's only a matter of time before those parasites spread to the rest of your livestock. Lice and mites typically spread through direct contact or shared bedding and living spaces, but they can also be transmitted through shared outdoor pasture space.If it is not possible to treat the entire herd at the same time, keep the treated pigs isolated from the untreated pigs. They should be kept in separate spaces and should not share a fenceline., Though a pig's diet won't necessarily stop a pest infestation, good nutrition does help keep livestock healthy. Well-fed, well-cared for pigs tend to have a stronger resistance to infestations than unhealthy livestock. Feed your pigs a healthy diet and make sure that they have access to clean drinking water at all times to reduce stress and increase their resistance to infection.You can give your pigs access to pasture grazing, but they should also have high-fiber grain available.Any cereal grains you feed your pigs should be processed, meaning the grains are cracked, rolled, or soaked. This helps the grain become more easily digestible for pigs.

, By delivering piglets that are free of parasites and keeping them quarantined from infected pigs, you can help ensure a healthy generation of pigs on your farm. Some experts suggest that caesarean-derived piglets are more likely to be free of mites than piglets delivered through a natural birth.Talk to a veterinarian about caesarean births for your pigs.
Make sure newborn piglets are not exposed to infected livestock, as experts generally advise against using insecticides on piglets.

, Enzymatic soap weakens the exoskeletons of insects and dehydrates them. This method is safe and nontoxic, but it is very labor intensive and may not be feasible for large herds or particularly bad infestations.You can buy enzymatic soap at many home supply stores or through online retailers, or make your own at home.


Enzymatic soaps must typically be reapplied every seven days, as soap will not kill the eggs laid by previous populations of lice.

, Pyrethrum powder is a naturally-derived chemical that has very low toxicity in mammals. It is applied as a dust directly on the pig's skin, but it can also be mixed with diatomaceous earth and hung in dust bags in your barn.You can buy pyrethrum powder at many home supply stores or through an online retailer.


Reapply pyrethrum every seven days, as the powder will not kill eggs laid by previous lice populations.
Always wear a mask while using pyrethrum. If at all possible, apply the powder to pigs outdoors or in a well-ventilated area.

, While not as effective as other treatment methods, many people find that applying natural oils to an infected pig's skin can help control the pests. Oils suffocate existing lice and may affect a louse's ability to reproduce. Oils may also repel new pests from attaching to a host pig.Essential oils like anise, camphor, eucalyptus, pennyroyal, rosemary, and sassafras can all be safely applied to pigs.
Mineral oil and vegetable oils can be applied to the skin to safely suffocate lice and mites.

Use a disinfectant.,
Dry the cage thoroughly.,
Wash your bird's accessories.,
Clean under the cage.,
Put down fresh liner.,
Set up all the accessories.,
Return your finch to his cage.",How to Disinfect a Finch Cage," The first step in cleaning and disinfecting a bird's cage is to remove all the perches that are in it. Finches do not usually like to be handled, so your bird may struggle when you attempt to catch him. His perch will likely be the first place he goes for.The perches need to be cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis along with the rest of the cage. Use this opportunity to let the perch soak in hot, soapy water while you secure your finch and disinfect the rest of the cage.;
, Before you can actually clean your finch's cage, you'll need to remove the bird and transport him to a safe, undisturbed location. If you have a second cage, you can use it as a storage space to keep your finch confined while you clean his primary cage. If not, you may want to consider using a bird-proofed room to avoid exposing your finch to your cleaning supplies.Songbirds like finches do not generally like to be handled, so you'll need to proceed with caution.
Turn out the lights in the room before attempting to catch your finch. This will help keep him a little calmer when you reach into his cage.
Gently place one hand over your finch's back so that his head is resting between your index and middle fingers. Do not pinch your bird's neck, as this may seriously injure him.
Use your thumb, ring finger, and pinky finger to gently restrain your finch's wings.Use your other hand to cup your finch from the bottom so he does not squirm out of your grip. Carefully transport him to his temporary space.
If keeping your bird in an empty room, make sure you bird-proof the room first. Close all windows, doors, and skylights. Turn off any fans in the room, unplug any electrical cords, and cover or remove any mirrors. All windows should also be covered with curtains or blinds., Once your finch is secured outside the primary cage, it's safe to take out anything else that remains. Remove your finch's food and water dishes, any toys, and anything else that is in regular contact with your bird, as these will all need to be cleaned and disinfected as well., Remove any cage liners, including newspapers, and discard them. Even newspapers/liners that appear unsoiled should be discarded to ensure that the cage is completely disinfected. After taking out the cage liners, you should also wipe down the floor of the cage with a wet paper towel to remove any seeds and/or droppings that may have fallen through. Disinfectants will not work properly if there is any organic matter left behind, so it's a good idea to scrape away any residue for a proper cleaning., It's important that you wash the cage thoroughly before using a disinfectant, for the same reason that you scraped away the floor of the cage: disinfectants will not work properly in the presence of organic material.You can use a gentle dish soap or antibacterial soap and hot water to clean the cage, but make sure you thoroughly wash every part of the cage.


Add enough dish soap to a bucket or sink full of hot water. You'll want a nice, soapy wash for your finch's cage.
Use a designated bird cage sponge, or simply use paper towels. Do not use anything that you might also use to wash dishes or countertops with.
Dip your sponge or towel in the hot, soapy water and scrub the cage thoroughly. Get between the bars, in the corners, and on all parts of the cage's floor.
Rinse the cage completely under hot running tap water. Make sure there is no residual soap left behind.
Use a clean paper towel to wipe the cage dry.

, Even if you use an antibacterial soap to wash the cage, it's best to use a disinfectant to ensure that no bacteria remain behind. There are a number of options when it comes to disinfectants. Many bird owners simply use a store-bought disinfectant that's safe for bird cages, like Avitek Oxy-Gene.You can also make your own disinfectant by diluting 1/2 cup of bleach in one gallon of water.Whatever you choose, make sure your finch is far away from the cage at this point, as the fumes can be very harmful to birds.


Make sure you are in a well-ventilated area so that you are not exposed to any hazardous fumes.
If you're concerned about exposure to bleach or other disinfectants, wear rubber gloves and safety goggles to protect your eyes and skin.
Apply your disinfectant liberally to all surfaces in the cage. Work some disinfectant between all the bars and in every corner of the cage, inside and out.
Let the disinfectant sit for about 5 to 10 minutes undisturbed. This will allow it to kill any bacteria or viruses that may be growing in the cage.
You may want to rinse the disinfectant away using clean, hot water. This will help remove any residual chemicals so that your bird is not affected by the fumes.

, After approximately 10 minutes, use clean paper towels to wipe down the cage inside and out. Once again, get in between all the bars and in every corner of the cage. You need to ensure that the cage is completely dry and free of any residual disinfectant before putting your bird back inside.


Try giving the cage a smell. If it smells like bleach or other disinfectant chemicals, you may want to rinse the cage again to make sure it's completely free of any residual fumes.

, Once the cage is clean, you should focus on cleaning and disinfecting your finch's food and water bowls, toys, and perches. You may want to wait until everything is done before returning your bird to his cage to ensure that the fumes have time to completely air out.


Use clean, hot soapy water and your designated bird sponge or a bundle of clean paper towels to wash the bird cage accessories one at a time.
Rinse the cage accessories completely free of soap, and gently dry them with clean paper towels.
Liberally apply disinfectant to all the bird cage accessories, and allow them to sit undisturbed for approximately 5 to 10 minutes once again.
Note that bird perches and toys made of cotton rope or wicker/wood will be difficult to disinfect due to the porous nature of these materials. However, some of these accessories may be dishwasher safe. Check the packaging from your accessories or contact a pet store employee to confirm that your cage accessories are dishwasher safe. Discard any toys/accessories that will not come clean or cannot be properly disinfected.
Dry your cage accessories completely. You can use clean paper towels, or put metal accessories in the oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius) for 10 to 15 minutes., Now that the cage and its accessories are clean, you should turn your attention to the spot where your cage is generally kept. Use a clean paper towel dipped in soapy water to hand wash the surface of your counter or table top, then wipe it dry. Spray a little disinfectant on a clean, dry paper towel and wipe the counter or table down, and let it sit undisturbed for 5 to 10 minutes. Once again, wipe everything dry with clean, dry paper towels, and make sure there is no residual disinfectant or any lingering fumes before setting the cage back up.Consider turning a small room fan on facing the table where you keep the cage to blow away any residual fumes from the cage or counter. Turn the fan off when you're done so that your finch does not accidentally fly into the fan and injure himself.

, Lay down clean, un-used cage liners (newspaper will do). Be sure to cover the entire bottom of the cage with liner paper to ensure that no droppings, food bits, or splashed water soil the floor of the cage., Put your finch's clean perch back in place in the now-clean cage. Refill his food and water dishes and set them out where your bird is used to them being. You can also return any toys that you washed and disinfected back in the cage, as your finch may want to play when he settles down., You'll need to take great care once again when you catch and transport your finch back to his permanent cage. If possible, try to turn off the lights in the room before attempting to catch your finch again. This may help keep him a little calmer after what has surely been a stressful afternoon.


Gently place the palm of one hand over your finch's back so that his head is between your index and middle fingers. Do not pinch your bird's neck, and take great care not to squeeze his body.
Use your thumb, ring finger, and pinky finger to gently restrain your finch's wings.Cup your finch gently from below with your free hand. Carry him carefully back to his cage and let him loose inside his clean, disinfected home.

Obtain a license.",How to Care for an Injured Wild Bird That Cannot Fly," You might think a baby bird needs help, but it may just be the bird is learning how to fly. Watch the bird for a while from a distance to establish it really is injured and has been abandoned by the mother.Look for feathers. If a baby bird has feathers, it is likely learning to fly.You can put featherless baby birds back in the nest if they're not injured. If a bird feels cold, warm it in your hands before setting it back in the nest.The scent of your hands will not bother the parents, who will feed it as they do the other babies. If you don't see a nest, put the bird somewhere where it is hidden from cats and dogs. For instance, you can set it in a bush or tree.;
, If you see a gaping wound, that is an indication an adult bird needs help, and you may need to rescue it., Blood is another indication a bird is in trouble. If the bird is dripping blood or if you see dried blood, it may need help., If the bird is having trouble standing or flying, it is in serious trouble and needs help., It may be best to leave the bird where it is until you can get help from a professional. Big birds, such as hawks, can cause you serious harm if you don't know what you're doing., Use a cardboard box, and cut holes in it for ventilation. Place something soft in the bottom, such as a towel.You can also use other types of pet carriers, such as cat carriers, if the bird is large. You should have something to cover the box or cage, such as a towel, as it is best to keep the animal in the dark and quiet.However, you shouldn't use a wire carrier, as that can cause harm to the bird., You can use either a heating pad (set on low) or hot water in a zip-top bag. If you use the heating pad, place it on the outside of the box at one end. If you use the zip-top bag, wrap it in cloth, and set it inside the box with the bird., Even small birds can cause damage to your hands. Put on a thick pair of gloves before attempting to help the bird., Before trying to move the bird, cover it with cloth to help calm it., Though the bird is injured, it can still cause you and itself harm if you startle it. It likely will fight back., Close the lid, and cover it with the towel. Keep the bird in a warm, quiet place while you work on your next steps. Make sure your pets do not have access to the area where you place the bird., Even with gloves on, it's important to wash your hands and arms after handling wildlife, as they can spread bacteria and disease., You will likely get the diet of the bird wrong. You can provide water so that the bird can drink on their own, but never try to drip-feed the bird water. , This is important, as a wildlife rehabilitator will know how to care for a wild animal like the bird you found. You can usually find lists of local rehabilitators on local and statewide government wildlife websites.You can also call veterinarians for recommendations.In fact, it's illegal for a person without a license to attempt to rehabilitate a wild animal or bird without help from a licensed professional.Birds are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, making it illegal for you to keep one in your possession without a license., The rehabilitator may tell you how to care for the bird, or they may tell you it's best to bring it to someone who is licensed to care for it. Either way, you'll know how to move forward., Birds have diverse requirements for diet and care, and wild birds do not adapt well to captivity.

, Animals that are rehabilitated face one of four fates. The best option is the bird will recover and be released back into the wild. If it is not possible to release the bird back into the wild, the bird will be placed at an appropriate facility and used to educate people. The other two options are not as pleasant. The bird may die from the condition, or it may need to be put to sleep if the injury is too severe. , If you insist on keeping the bird, you will need to be licensed, as it is illegal to keep wildlife without a permit or license. You can apply for the proper paperwork through your local government.To obtain a license, you need to fill out the permit form from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the federal government,as well as a form for your state government.To be permitted to rehabilitate animals, you need to have the knowledge and expertise to care for wild animals. You will need to answer questions about your knowledge, as well as about how you were trained to care for animals."

Feed your pig food that is low in fiber.Since fiber takes more energy to digest, the pig will end up expending more calories when eating fiber that it would when eating a less fibrous food.,
Give your pig feeds with a high fat content.Fat in pig feed comes from poultry, pork, tallow, vegetable oils, and blended animal or vegetable fats.,
Select a protein source.,
Choose a grain for your pig.,
Increase the amount of food the pig is eating.Weight gain occurs as a result of ingesting excess calories.,
Add supplements to the pig’s diet.You can choose to add fat or protein in order to help your pig pack on pounds.,
Make the food more appealing.Palatability enhancers are toppings that you apply to your pig’s feed in order to make the food taste better.",How to Increase the Weight of a Pig1," In other words, a high-fiber diet will reduce the amount of calories that the pig absorbs and turns into fat.


Avoid feeding your pig soy hulls, wheat midds, and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS).;
, The type of fat that is included in your pig’s feed has little impact on the weight gains it will make. Feed your pig whatever high-fat feed that it finds most palatable, and you find most affordable.Skim milk, yogurt, and dairy are also foods that can increase pig fat.
Sweet foods with high sugar content -- donuts, candy, and cupcakes -- can also rapidly increase your pig’s weight., Tankage (animal feed made from residue left behind from the tanks in which animal carcasses were rendered) and meat scraps are two good sources of protein. Soybean oil meal is another option. Give your pig a mix of many types of protein.See what the pig likes best, and feed it primarily that type of protein.


Combining soybean meal with a corn diet will provide your pig with well-balanced amino acid levels., Whatever you choose, 50% of your feed should be yellow corn. The remainder of your pig’s feed should be a mix of barley, wheat, and sorghum. Feed your pig various grains and see which it likes best. Use the pig’s favorite grain in abundance in order to increase its weight.Avoid bird-proof sorghums, as pigs find them less desirable than regular red or white sorghum.

, If a pig is not eating enough food, it will lose weight. If a pig eats over and above the caloric volume needed to maintain its current weight, it will increase its weight.


Increase the pig’s nutrient intake as you increase the amount of food it eats. Take your pig to the vet or nutritionist for blood work and a nutritional analysis. The vet will be able to tell you if your pig is suffering a nutritional deficiency, and what supplements can correct it.
Adequate nutrient intake helps your pig absorb calories more efficiently.
Vitamin B12 is an important addition to your pig’s diet. It can help improve feed intake, as well as reduce stress levels and prevent disease in your pig. B12 injections are the best way to go. Talk to your vet about how much B12 your pig should receive.

, Fat and protein supplements (sometimes labeled as energy supplements) are available in many varieties, with fat and protein contents ranging from 30% up to 70% or more. Some have high protein and high fat, while others are high in either fat or protein.


Decide how much weight you want to increase your pig by, then incorporate fat supplements or fatty foods into the pig’s diet.
Typically, pigs under 150 pounds receive half a pound to one pound of supplements. For pigs over 150 pounds, you can add one to one and a half pounds of supplements.
Always follow the directions on the package of your supplement product.
Young pigs need about 17% of their diet to be protein. Older pigs should get a diet with about 15% protein., If your pig enjoys what it’s eating, it will eat more of it, thus increasing its weight. Try several palatability enhancers and see which pushes your pig to eat the most.


Add water to the feed. When your pig’s feed is wet, the food will be softer and the pig can more easily ingest it. Pour some water over your pig’s feed in order to turn it into a watery mush or paste.
If your pig really likes one feed, but dislikes another, you should regularly purchase the one it likes. Tasty feed will be consumed in greater quantities and with greater enjoyment than feed that the pig doesn’t like. This will lead to rapid weight gain.
Give your pig a variety of foods. Like people, pigs get bored of eating the same thing over and over."

Determine if the bird is a nestling or a fledgling.,
Note if the baby bird’s parents and/or nest is nearby.,
Check if the bird is injured or appears ill. Look for signs of injury on the bird, like a broken limb, bleeding on the bird’s body, and missing patches of feathers (if the bird is a fledgling).,
Avoid interacting with a fledgling if it is not injured and it is close to its nest.,
Wear gloves when handling the bird.,
Make a hanging nest if the bird’s parents are nearby but the nest is destroyed.,
Create a nest from a small plastic bowl and paper towel if the bird is orphaned.,
Place the bird in the nest and cover it with a paper towel.,
Put the nest in a warm, quiet, and dark area.,
Do not feed the baby bird.,
Wash your hands after handling the bird.,
Contact your local wildlife center.,
Describe the condition of the baby bird.,
Transport the baby bird to the care of the rehabilitator.",How to Help a Baby Bird That Has Fallen Out of a Nest," To best help the baby bird, you will need to first determine how young the bird is and how far along it is in its development.A nestling has very few feathers and/or will be covered in fluffy down, their eyes will be closed, or they will just barely open. These are very young birds who should remain in the nest, as they are still highly dependent on their parents for nurturing and food.
A fledgling is older than a nestling and they will usually have lots of feathers on their bodies. Fledglings are encouraged or even pushed out of the nest by their parents. They will usually spend two to five days on the ground once they are out of the nest, flapping their wings and hopping about. However, their parents will keep close watch on them from a distance and continue to feed and nurture the fledgling until they learn how to fly, eat, and protect themselves from predators.;
, Another way to determine if the baby bird is in danger is to check if there is a nest in a nearby tree or perch close to the baby bird. You may also notice adult birds perched close to the baby bird and observing the baby bird. If you see a nest or parents nearby, and the bird is a fledgling, you may be fine to leave the baby bird alone.If you see a nest close to a nestling, you can pick up the baby bird carefully and put it back in the nest. It is a myth that the smell of humans will cause the parents to reject the baby bird, as birds do not have a strong sense of smell. The baby bird should be nurtured and feed by the parents once you put it back in the nest.You may need to observe the fledgling for at least an hour to determine if the parents are nearby or to spot the baby bird interacting with it’s parents. Make sure the parents visit the baby bird in the nest to confirm the baby bird is not orphaned or alone., The bird may also be shivering or making low noises. You may also notice a dead parent or parents nearby or in the nest, as well as the presence of a cat or a dog that may have injured the bird.If you see any signs of illness or injury, or if the parents are dead or do not return to the nest after two hours, you may need to make a temporary nest for the baby bird and then bring it to the nearest wildlife rehabilitation center.

, If the bird is a fledgling and it does not appear ill or injured, you should leave it alone to continue its development on the ground. However, you should prevent any household pets, such as cats, from getting close to the bird and watch it to make sure it can hop away from an area with any hazards or predators.Do not try to feed the fledgling, as birds have specific and unique diets. As well, giving the bird water could be a drowning hazard.

, Protect yourself from disease and parasites, as well as the sharp beaks and talons of the bird by using gloves. You should also wash your hands before and after handling the bird, even if you are wearing gloves.

, If the bird’s nest is clearly destroyed but the bird’s parents are close by, you can create a simple hanging nest for the birds.Use a small basket or a small tupperware container. Punch or cut holes on the bottom of the container and line the container with paper towels.
Hang the nest with duct tape to a branch near the old nest. Place the baby bird in the hanging nest. The parent should then locate the new nest and the baby bird.

, It is important that you do not put the baby bird back in the original nest if it is injured and its parents are missing, as the nest may contain parasites that could weaken the bird further. Instead, build a temporary nest for the bird using a small plastic bowl or a berry box. You should line the bowl with unscented paper towel to provide some cushioning for the bird.Avoid using a wire cage as the wire can injure the bird’s delicate feathers.
If you do not have access to a plastic bowl, you can use a paper bag with air holes.

, This will keep the bird warm and protect it when it is in the temporary nest.If the bird is shivering, you can warm it up by putting one end of the cardboard box on a heating pad set to low. You can also fill a hot water bottle and place it next to the bird in the bowl. Make sure the bottle does not touch the bird, as this could burn it, or leak, as this could chill the bird even further.

, Once you place the bird in the lined plastic bowl, you can put the bowl in a cardboard box and tape the box shut. Put the box in a spare room or a bathroom away from pets and children.Noise can be very stressful for the bird so make sure all radios and televisions are turned off. You should limit your contact with the baby bird so you do not make its injury or illness worse. Make sure the baby bird’s legs are tucked underneath its body, not stretched out.

, Every species of bird requires a specific diet, so avoid making the bird more ill or weak by giving it food it should not eat. When a bird is injured, it will use all its energy to fight shock and the injury so do not force it to devote its energy to eating as well.You should also avoid giving the bird water, as it can potentially drown the bird.

, If you touch the bird, you should wash your hands well to prevent the transfer of any diseases or parasites.You should also wash any items the bird was in contact with, like towels, blankets or jackets.

, Once you create a temporary nest for an injured or orphaned bird, you should reach out to your local wildlife center. You can locate the nearest wildlife center by contacting:Your state wildlife agency
The Humane Society in your area
A local veterinarian that specializes in wildlife or exotic animals
The US Fish & Wildlife Service
The Wildlife Rehab Info Directory

, Once you get in touch with a wildlife rehabilitation center, you should describe the bird’s symptoms and provide information on if the bird is a fledgling or a nestling. You should also note where you found the baby bird in the wild, as the wildlife center may use this information when releasing the bird., Bring the baby bird, in its temporary nest, to the nearest rehabilitation center for treatment as soon as possible so it can be treated and released back into the wild.


Though you may be tempted to keep the baby bird and treat it yourself or keep it as a pet, the baby bird is considered a wild animal. It is illegal to keep a wild animal in your home and keeping the bird can put the life of the bird in danger."

Ensure your pig has enough space.If a pig’s facilities are inadequate for its needs, its appetite will decline due to stress.,
Ensure your pig can access its food.,
Regulate your pig’s temperature.If the weather is hot (95 degrees Fahrenheit or above), your pig will be disinclined to eat.",How to Increase the Weight of a Pig2," Pigs should be given between 20 and 50 square feet of space within their pens, and at least 100 square feet of outside pasture in which to move around in.There are several ways to give your pig more space, such as:


removing pigs from the pen and putting them in a separate, larger enclosure
selling pigs until you have a population that can thrive within the confines of the pen
expanding the size of the pig pen

, If your pig is having a hard time getting to the feeder or trough, take steps to help it. For instance, if your pig is being fed with several others in a communal pen, it might be pushed aside by larger, more dominant pigs.If you only keep feed out during limited windows of time, some pigs might be eating less than others.


Consider adding a feeder, or providing extra bowls of feed for pigs that aren’t at the weight they should be.
Always give your pig fresh water. Even if you add water to your pig’s feed to soften it, you should also provide a bowl or trough for water. Change your pig’s water regularly. Water should be cool but not cold. Pigs need 2-3 pounds of water for every pound of feed they consume.

, Humidity levels as well as temperature affect the pig’s tendency to eat. Low humidity makes pigs more interested in eating.


Keep the air in your pig pen circulating by opening the windows or doors. Introduce fans or a large inflatable pool into the area your pig lives. Ensure it has plenty of shade.
Ensure your pig is not too cold. If the temperature of your pig pen is below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, your pig might be too cold to eat. Ensure your pig pen is well-insulated against winter. Use a heater to keep the temperature in your pig pen between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.

Monitor your pig’s health.Sick pigs will not be inclined to eat much.,
Deworm your pig.Deworming regularly (every thirty days) will keep your pig healthy and remove the parasites that steal nutrients and calories away from your pig.,
Check your pig for injuries.If your pig has recently had an operation or been injured, it will not want to eat much.",How to Increase the Weight of a Pig3," Even when a sick pig does eat, its illness causes nutrients and vitamins to be expended at higher rates than normal as the pig fights off the infection or disease afflicting it.


Check your pig’s temperature with a rectal thermometer. The temperature should be around 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
If your pig has a fever, take it to the vet immediately.
Look for signs your pig is ill. If your pig is acting lethargic, squeals painfully, has diarrhea, or does not eat, it may be ill. There could be one or many causes for your pig’s illness, including viruses, parasites, or poor nutrition.Take it to a qualified veterinarian for a checkup.

, You don’t need to take your pig to the vet in order to deworm it. Rather, you can purchase a commercial deworming medication at your local farm supply store and administer it directly to your pig. Most require a three-day feeding cycle. Be sure to follow the directions with your pig’s deworming medicine.


You do not need assistance to administer the deworming medicine. Simply add it to the pig’s feed, typically at a ratio of one cubic centimeter per 50 pounds of body weight.In other words, if your pig weighs 100 pounds, you’ll probably add two cubic centimeters of deworming medicine. However, always use the prescribed dosage when administering any medicine to your pig.

, Check your pig’s legs and belly for sores, and check its feet for sharp objects. Patch up small wounds. If you see serious injuries, take your pig to the vet as soon as possible.


You should also bring your pig to the vet before introducing him or her to the rest of your pigs. This will ensure the pig doesn’t introduce parasites or illnesses to the other pigs.
If you observe any strange behavior such as lethargy, staggering, poor appetite, it may be injured internally or ill. Bring your pig to the vet for an examination.Pigs should get a checkup from the veterinarian at least once each year.

Know the symptoms.,
Ensure that the pigs are getting a balanced, healthy diet.,
Drench the pigs.,
Put the pig on a fast for 24 hours after drenching.",How to Prevent Dysentry or Scours in Pigs," These are easy – your pig will have diarrhea. For older pigs, this will often clear up in a few days and the pig will be fine. For piglets however, this can be fatal.;
, Don't feed them too much of one thing and ensure that the food is of good quality.

, It is possible to use a commercial drench but you can easily make a homemade drench that works as well, using Epsom salts and dill seed:Place a handful of dill seeds into a pot of water. Bring to the boil, then remove from the heat. Leave to brew for a few hours.
Add 50g of Epsom salts.

, Feed garlic to the pig for a few days. See the vet if no improvement shows.

Refrain from interacting with the bird more than is necessary.,
Be prepared.,
Observe the bird.,
Get a paper towel and cardboard box.,
Pick up the bird.,
Place the bird into the box and shut the box lid.,
Check on the bird periodically.,
Let the bird go.,
Call experts.",How to Care For a Bird That Has Hit a Window1," More likely than not the bird has sustained a concussion, in which case it should be removed from all stimuli. Anything else will make its condition worse. If it has sustained injuries to its limbs, it will require professional assistance anyway.;
, If birds frequently collide into your windows, be sure to keep on hand a towel, a small box (a shoe box is ideal), gloves, and, if possible, safety glasses

, Often the bird will only need a couple of minutes to recover. You should stay to watch the bird and ensure that no predators attack it before it recovers. If it does not recover within five or six minutes you should be more proactive.If you are not comfortable handling a bird you should call the local bird or wildlife rehabilitation center immediately. These can be located with the Wildlife Rehabilitation Information Directory: http://wildliferehabinfo.org/Contact_A-M.htm.
If the bird has a shoulder injury it might be able to fly for short distances horizontally. However, it will not be able to lift its wings above its shoulders or obtain any elevation in its flight.
Should or wing injuries will require skilled medical assistance and months of rehabilitation. If the bird seems to have extensive damage to its limbs, call the local bird or wildlife rehabilitation center.Conversely, if the bird seems unconscious the bird has sustained head trauma and will merely need a safe place to relax.

, Removing all stimuli will significantly increase the probability of the bird recovering from a potentially fatal concussion. You want a small box that will block all incoming light. To make it comfortable you should line it with a paper towel or a soft cotton cloth.If the bird is larger, you can place a towel on the bottom of a paper bag and staple or tape the top the bag, leaving enough of a crack to allow for airflow. However, if the bird is large enough to potentially injury you, you should consider avoiding contact and calling for professional assistance immediately., Use gloves and safety goggles if possible. Hold the bird upright so that it can breathe. Use a firm grip without squeezing. Hold by the wings, near the body., Make sure the box has breathing holes in it. Put the box in a warm sheltered location (out of direct sunlight). Keep it away from predators, including cats., Observe the box every 20 minutes for about 2 hours. When the bird appears to have recovered take it outside., After two hours take the box outside to the woods. Remove the lid. Watch to see if the bird flies away., If after two hours the bird is not able to fly away you should consult the Wildlife Rehabilitation Directory. Call an expert who can provide specialized care for the bird.


Do not keep the bird in your possession for more than two hours. It is illegal to keep a wild bird.

Check for symptoms of pneumonia.,
Take the pig's temperature.,
See the vet swiftly.,
Keep the pig in a warm and dry place for recovery.,
Prevent a relapse and protect other pigs from catching pneumonia by taking proper precautions.",How to Care for a Pig With Pneumonia," Unfortunately, many symptoms of pneumonia don't show in pigs until the situation is life-threatening.Any sign of going off food during winter should be treated as an early warning to consider with great care. Symptoms of pneumonia in a pig include:Disinterest in food, loss of appetite, picky eater. (Number one worry sign.)
Coughing.
Lying down (sick pigs will usually lie down while other pigs are up and about).
A dull appearance.
Thumping (shallow, rapid breathing).
Fever and lethargy.;
, Anything over 101ºF is a fever in a pig, and pneumonia ranges from 102ºF to 104ºF at the start.The temperature is taken through the rectum; for tame, pet pigs this may be an approachable task but for larger pigs that do not have regular human contact, this is an affair that should be approached with caution. Pigs are very strong and can cause severe injuries.

, Your pig will need a course of antibiotics or ""antibacterials"" and the sooner the treatment begins, the better the pig's chances of survival. The vet may prescribe these as injections or feed-given.

, Keep the pig well fed and ensure that the pig receives the full antibiotics course.

, Things to consider include:Removing any sources of stress from the pigs' environment.
Ventilating the pigs' housing adequately, without creating draughts.
Preventing overcrowding.
Keeping pigs warm during severe cold weather.
Keeping pigs wormed and drenched against internal parasites.
Speak with your vet about developing a management plan for the herd if your pigs continue to get pneumonia. All pigs and piglets at risk of contracting pneumonia should be vaccinated against the possibility.

Determine whether the bird is a fledgling or nestling.,
Determine whether the fledgling needs help or not.,
Do not handle dangerous birds.,
Obtain the equipment you will need.,

Get your bucket (which should have holes in the bottom so it doesn't fill up with water).,
Throw a towel over the bird and gently grab the bird at the back nape (neck).,
Secure your bucket to a tree.,
Release the fledgling into the bucket.,
Observe the bird for about an hour.,
Once the bird has left take down the bucket.",How to Help a Fallen Fledgling," A nestling is a baby bird with no feathers and they won’t survive for long out of the nest. You should put the nestling back in its nest as soon as possible. A fledgling is a baby bird with feathers and it’s very common for them to be found hopping on the ground as they’re just learning to fly and forage for food.;
, Although it’s normal to feel worried for a fledgling hopping about on the ground, the fledgling might not actually need any help at all. If there are some cats or dogs about, all you have to do is place the fledgling back in a tree and remember to keep your dogs and cats inside your house if the fledgling is in your back garden.


If the fledgling is injured, you should immediately take action and call a wildlife rehabilitator.

, Dangerous birds are normally meat eaters and usually have sharp beaks and claws such as hawks or owls. Instead call a wildlife rehabilitator; they are trained to handle birds of prey.

, You will need a bucket with holes in the bottom, a stick that can fit in the bucket, some string, some dirt or leaf litter and a cardboard box with air holes in it.

, Once you’ve set up the bucket, you should also bring along your box.







, Whilst holding the bird with the towel put it in the box making sure it doesn’t escape.

, The bucket should be secured at least 2m of the ground and near the site of where the fledgling was found.


Use a ladder if you need to, never climb the tree.

, Make sure that there is no thick cover over the bucket, this is to allow the bird to get out and the parents to help it.

, If the parents do not return call a wildlife rehabilitator.

, The last thing you want to do is litter. It’s also handy to record the date, incident, treatment and description of the bird for reference.

Monitor your bird's eating.,
Observe your bird's mobility.,
Watch for excessive urination or diarrhea.,
Look for physical markers.",How to Treat Polyoma Virus in Conures1," Anorexia, loss of appetite, and weight loss are all symptoms of polyoma virus in birds, so keep track of your conure's eating habits. For an accurate assessment, check your pet's food bowl everyday when you change it, and note how much food has spilled out onto the bottom of the cage. Regurgitation and vomiting are also signs of the disease, so check the cage liner each day when changing it to see if your bird is digesting its food properly., Observe your conure's movement and activity for signs of the polyoma virus. Listlessness and paralysis are both symptoms of the illness, which require careful observation to identify. Conures are generally very playful and active birds, so it should be easy to note if your pet is moving less than usual.Difficulty breathing is another symptom of polynoma that might restrict your conure's mobility.

, Check the liner of your bird's cage for signs of excessive urination or diarrhea. The liner will appear more wet or soiled than usual if this is the case. Both these symptoms can be attributed to polyoma virus, but are cause for concern either way and are reason to contact your veterinarian., Observe your bird everyday for physical signs of polynoma. Note that once the disease has manifested itself visibly, it has already progressed extensively and your pet is in danger. Contact your veterinarian or an emergency veterinary  clinic immediately if you see:A distended abdomen
Bleeding (hemorrhages) below the skin
Feather abnormalities (e.g., lacing or flying feathers)

"
Move your feeder.,
Use white drapery.,
Install a bug screen.",How to Care For a Bird That Has Hit a Window2," If your feeder is close enough to the window, birds won’t be able to pick up enough velocity to hurt themselves when flying into it. If it is far enough away, then the bird will be more likely to recognize that the window is not part of the natural environment.


Ideally you should place your window either less than 3 feet from the window or more than 30 feet from it., Birds are drawn to the reflection of the natural environment that they see in your windows. Installing drapes or blinds will obstruct that reflection. This should reduce the likelihood of them flying into your window.You can also place decals on your window. However, to significantly reduce the likelihood of birds flying into the window you will need to have stickers placed no more than 2 inches apart horizontally and 4 inches apart vertically. This would obstruct much of your view. , These can be doubly effective. They will reduce the reflectivity of the glass, decreasing the likelihood that birds will fly into the window. Furthermore, they will provide cushion and reduce the chance of injury if a bird does fly into your window."

Visit your veterinarian.,
Quarantine the bird.,
Make sure your infected conure is comfortable.",How to Treat Polyoma Virus in Conures2," Confirm that your bird is infected with polyoma virus by visiting your veterinarian. The vet can conduct tests and determine right away whether your conure is suffering from the illness. Though there is no known cure for the virus, ask your veterinarian for advice about how to care for your conure after the diagnosis., If you have multiple birds, quarantine your infected bird right away in its own cage. Remove your other birds from their shared cage and disinfect it with an oxidizer, as well as everything in it. Bring all the other birds to the veterinarian to be tested for polyoma, and return them to the cage once their tests are confirmed to be negative., While some infected birds do recover from polyoma virus, most die from the condition. Large birds like conures may live up to 140 days with the illness, but young birds may pass away as early as 2-15 days after contracting the it. Do your best to keep your conure comfortable by giving it soft toys or blankets to rest under, and ask your veterinarian if any of the symptoms  can be eased with supplements.For instance, your veterinarian may administer vitamin K injections to your conure to deal treat mild hemorrhages.

"
"
Purchase from a reputable store or breeder.,
Disinfect with an oxidizer.,
Get your bird vaccinated.",How to Treat Polyoma Virus in Conures3," When purchasing a conure, choose a reputable store or breeder. Ask whether polyoma virus testing and vaccination are performed on the birds as well as their parents, which should always be done as part of a responsible breeding process. Never buy a conure that is not yet weaned form its mother, and do not trust any merchant who tries to sell birds that prematurely., Many disinfectants are not strong enough to kill all traces of the polyoma virus. Use an oxidizer (such as chlorine bleach) to clean your bird's cage, food bowls, toys, perches, and anything else it comes in direct contact with.Dilute 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of chlorine bleach with 500 ml (2 cups) of water to make a cleaning solution.This process should also be completed if your conure is treated for polyoma.

, There is an anti-polynoma vaccine available for young birds but its effectiveness is not yet proven. Ask your veterinarian if your conure should be vaccinated. Note the treatment costs $40-60 per bird, and requires annual booster shots.The vaccine is administered in a double dose. The first is given to birds at four weeks of age, the second at six to eight weeks of age.Adult birds can also be given the vaccination, although polyoma is more common in younger birds.

Check in both directions for oncoming traffic and, when clear, cautiously move toward the bird. If you move suddenly, most birds will try to fly away, which will probably cause greater injury.;
, If the bird is in the middle of the road, the best thing to do in the meantime is to get it off of the road, as this will prevent it from getting hit again. If the bird is on the side of the road, evaluate the bird without causing it too much distress.

,,


Using a box: Open the box and get as close to the bird as you can without especially disturbing it. You want the box to lie on its side, with the opening facing the bird. Use you feet to guide the bird into the box, but make sure not to kick it! Once the bird inside, lift the box and close the lid while leaving a small gap in it for air.
Using a blanket: Spread out the blanket and hold it up using the upper corners, lower your hands and approach slowly. When you get close to the bird, slowly open the blanket and toss it over the bird. If the bird escapes, get even closer and toss the blanket a little faster than before. If you don't have a blanket, a shirt or sweater will also work.

Using your hands: Form your middle and index fingers into a V shape, slightly bending forward their tips. Kneel behind the bird and move your hand toward the back of its head. Encircle the bird's neck with your fingers, firmly enough to hold it but not strangle it. This position will stop the bird from moving its head around and biting you.
Using gloves: Following the above method, move slowly toward the bird. Using both hands, place one above the bird, ready to hold the bird across the wings on its back. The other hand should be placed under the front of the bird, so as to support its bust. Bring both hands to the bird and hold it that way until you can put it in a suitable container.

, Get a box that will easily contain the bird; the bird will need to be able to stand in the box without bending its tail or having to duck its head. Crack closed the lid of the box and place it in a quiet room or on the back seat of your vehicle.

, They know how to care for injured animals, including wild birds. This is where your job ends. However, if you live too far away from an animal clinic and the bird is not injured badly, there are more steps you can take to save it.

, Stress, like in humans, can be treated by keeping the patient warm with nothing to bother it. Place the bird, leaving it in the box, in a room with a heater or a fireplace, or place a blanket over the box. Don't place any food or water in the box; water, though good for helping with dehydration, can also give the bird pneumonia in the early stages of stress. You also want to keep the bird dry; if you place water in the box, you may cause the bird to stress out and bash around.

, After about 12 hours, check on the bird. The bird may have passed away due to stress, but in good cases the bird will still be alive. At this time, if the bird is still panting or looks to be in stress, leave it covered for another 12 hours. Birds can take a while to recover from stress. If the bird is fine, get some bird seed and place it in a corner of the box, and leave the bird alone for a while. When the bird is not stressed, you can more safely take it out and place it in a larger box or cage. This will allow you to see what the bird's injuries are and how severe they are. Sometimes, you will need to nurse the bird back to health, if you do not want to do this take the bird to an animal rescue centre and they will provide for it.

, If the bird was rescued near your house and is not injured, you can try to release it. Birds that cannot fly usually pass away due to cold and being killed by predators. If the bird cannot fly away, capture it again and keep caring for it until it has fully recovered. When you release it, find a place with adequate tree and canopy coverage, as this will protect the bird from any predators. But if there are native flowering plants around, the bird may decide to stay a while longer!

Let your canary get used to her surroundings.,
Keep her cage at eye level.,
Observe your canary.,
Talk quietly to your canary for 10 to 15 minutes, twice a day.,
Place a single toy, a mirror, or one to two perches in the cage.,
Put your hand in her cage, with a treat.,
Start over if your canary bites you.,
Try to hold her outside of the cage.,
Use a perch to coax your canary out of the cage.,
Practice calling your canary to your hand.,
Let your bird return to her cage on her own.",How to Train Your Canary," It’s best to focus on training one canary at a time, with one canary in a single cage in a room. Canaries are prone to getting nervous about possible predators around them, so be patient and let your canary get familiar with the area around her cage. Avoid making sudden movements and loud noises when you enter the room so you don’t startle your bird.Spend time sitting in the room with your canary for the first several days. When you enter the room, make a low sound or whistle and then repeat the same sound or whistle every time you enter the room. This will become your “special noise” for your canary, which will signal her of your presence.;
, Hang your bird’s cage so it sits eye level with you, as she can become stressed from having to make too many movements with her head. Place her cage in a room with some household activity so she can watch you and become comfortable with your presence.At night, cover her cage with a dark cloth so she knows when it’s night and time for bed. Take the covering off in the morning so she can recognize that it is day and time for activity.

, Avoid direct eye contact when you first enter and sit in the room, as many birds associate direct eye contact with danger. Instead, watch your canary in her cage from a safe distance. As you watch your canary during the first few days, you may note she is flitting around the cage as well as feeding, bathing and preening in your presence.Once she stops flitting around and grooming herself, you can begin to make closer contact with her.

, This will help your canary get familiar with you over a period of time, and build your relationship. Sit near her cage, whistle to her, and talk in a quiet tone. Over time, she will recognize your voice and come to see you as a friend.Stress can kill canaries so focus on acting calm and soothing around her. Some canary owners create a certain low noise, like a humming or shushing, that they then repeat when they move close to the canary’s cage. The canary will get used to the “special noise” and come to associate it with their owner and with comfort., Don’t overcrowd the cage with lots of toys, accessories, or perches. Though it is important for your canary’s well-being that they move and fly around, keep the cage items to a minimum to allow your canary to move freely.Change up the accessories to allow for variety, but keep only one or two items in the cage at a time. Note how your canary interacts with the toys, especially how she flies from perch to perch.
You can also place a shallow water dish in the cage, along with her normal water dish, so she can take the occasional bath. Fill the plastic shallow dish with lukewarm water and place it on the floor of the cage. Be sure to clean it every day, along with your bird’s other dishes.

, After several days of observing your canary, talking to your canary, and letting her play with toys in her cage, you can try placing your hand in her cage while holding a treat. Though she may not take it right away, she will start to get used to your presence in her cage and see training as a good thing that comes with a treat.Slice up vegetables like broccoli, kale, asparagus, carrots, tomatoes, and zucchini to offer as a treat. Fruits like apples, blueberries, bananas, grapes, peaches, and melons also work as great treats. Hold the treat lightly between your fingers so it is easy for your canary to pick it up.
As you offer her a treat, look for any signs of stress, like panting from the mouth, jerking movements away from you, and if her feathers are lying flat against her body. If you note any of these signs, leave the treat in her cage, and remove your hand. You can try to give her a treat again the next day, but don’t be discouraged if she shows signs of stress. With enough patience and persistence, she will become more comfortable over time and start to respond to your treats.
Once your canary starts to feel safe around you, she may tilt her head and squint at you. Some canaries will place one foot on your finger to show they are responsive to your presence in their cage. If your canary seems comfortable placing one foot on your finger for a long period of time, you can start to accelerate her training., Canaries bite on occasion, but their bite is not harmful or dangerous. It will feel a slight nip. However, you should take even a small bite as a sign your canary is not willing to train at the moment. If your canary bites, take your hand out of her cage and revert to observing her in the room and talking calmly to her for several more days. Then, try to feed her a treat again while she is in her cage., Once she starts to take treats from you and respond to your “special noise” by looking at you and placing one foot on your finger, you can try to coax her into your hands and take her out of the cage to prepare her for more intense training. It’s difficult to train your canary while she is in her cage, as it can seem threatening to her. If she is comfortable with you, she should display no signs of stress or fear when out of the cage. The right time to do this will vary from bird to bird, but try this at after four to six weeks.To hold your canary properly, put your palm on her back and wrap your fingers around her by placing your thumb and forefinger on either side of her head.As you hold her, make the “special noise” and use your fingers to gently stroke down her back and then down the front of the body. This will soothe her and make her comfortable outside of her cage, as well as in your hands., Move to training your canary to venture out of her cage on her own by using an 18 inch perch. Make sure all the doors and windows in your house are shut so she cannot fly away. Then, insert the perch through the bars close to the cage door and then open the door. You may need to use a treat to encourage your canary to slowly step onto the perch and move out of the cage.You should also have another perch set up close to the cage, such as on branch on a potted tree or a toy perch, to give your canary somewhere to land after she flies.
Avoid chasing your bird from her cage as this can spook her and make her fearful of leaving her cage. Even one bad experience can undo all the previous training and bonding you have done with your canary. Take it slow and let her come out of her cage on her own, with the help of a treat.

, Once your bird starts to venture out of her cage on her own and becomes comfortable landing on perches around the room, you can train her to land on your hand. Use treats to motivate her and reward her during this training.


Once your bird is out of her cage, hold a treat in your hand, between two fingers. Create a perch with your two fingers together and out straight. Call your canary to you, using the “special noise”.
If she lands successfully on your two fingers, reward her with a treat. Continue to do this until she seems comfortable landing on your hand. Over time, you can hide the treat until your canary lands on your hand, or in some cases, the top of your head. With enough practice, she should get used to landing on your hand or head when called.

, For your canary to become well trained and well tamed, she should go back into her cage on her own. Avoid chasing your canary or shooing her back into her cage, as this can scare her.


Use fruit treats to encourage your bird to go back into her cage. Hold the treat between your fingers, just inside the cage. Once she is in the cage safely, reward her with the treat.
On rare occasions, your bird may not want to go back into her cage, though it may be time for bed or you may be leaving the house. To do this, make the room dark and net her quickly and carefully. Be gentle as you place her back in her cage. Avoid netting your bird, unless absolutely necessary."

Take your bird to the vet.,
Use a bird-safe insecticide.,
Move the birds from their cage.,
Remove babies from the nesting box.",How to Treat Blood Mite in Canaries1," It may be tempting to take the canary back to the pet store where you bought it, but there is a chance that the employees will not be able to correctly recommend a good treatment.If you find that you have an infestation, take your bird to the vet. The vet can correctly diagnose the type of mite and provide advice on proper treatments.


While your local vet may be able to handle birds, it is best to find an avian or exotic pet veterinarian.;
, Many common insecticides can harm your bird. Ask your vet for an insecticide that is safe for your canary. There are many brands available that are designed specifically for use on birds with mites. Spray the canary three or four times a day for seven days. Carefully apply around the plumage, and spray the insecticide into the dark corners of the bird house.Ivermectin is an ingredient that can kill lice and mites. You can find low concentrations of it for birds at your local pet store.You can also check for lice and mite medications that contain it as an ingredient.
Permethrin is another common type of insecticide used to kill red mite and lice in birds.These sprays typically do not kill mite eggs. You will have to clean the cage thoroughly to destroy the mite eggs.

, It is hard to treat the birds when there are hundreds or thousands of mites crawling around in their cages. Even if you kill all of the mites on the bird, they can be re-infected overnight. Spray a clean cage with insecticide, and lay down fresh shavings. After you have applied the insecticide, relocate your birds temporarily this accommodation. You may chose to place a paper towel on the bottom of this cage to catch any dead mites that are dropping off your bird. Replace this towel often., Young birds are especially vulnerable to the mites, and you should treat them separately from the adults. The older birds may pluck out the chicks' feathers in an attempt to remove the mites.Carefully remove nestlings from the infested nesting box. Treat them with a safe insecticide spray. Keep them in a clean nesting box separate from the adults with a lining of paper towels. Change out the paper towels every ten minutes at first, then every thirty minutes, and then every hour. The mites should fall off the baby birds after they feed, and you can remove the mite-infested towels. Keep changing the towels until no more mites fall off.Be sure to treat their new nesting box beforehand with insecticide.
Once both the adults and the babies have been fully deloused, you can reintroduce the chicks to the adult cage.

Make sure their cage is large enough.,
Place the cage in an active area of your home.,
Add a variety of perches to encourage flight.,
Put a few toys inside their cage.,
Set a bath inside of their cage.",How to Keep a Canary Entertained1," Canaries may be small, but they need roomy cages to flap, hop, and fly to their heart’s content. A canary cage should be at least 16 inches (41 cm) tall and 30 inches (76 cm) wide.Avoid cages with a rounded shape, as these can restrict how much the canary can fly around. They may also make it difficult to hang perches correctly.;
, Canaries are active birds, and they may enjoy interacting with your family. Keep the cage someplace with plenty of interesting activity. A living room or home office may be ideal.While canaries may enjoy watching humans, many do not like to be held or handled by humans. Let the canaries watch you, but try not to bother them.
Put the cage in an area with plenty of light but no direct sunlight. It should be well-ventilated with no drafts blowing on the cage from vents or windows.
Keep the cage about 6 feet (1.8 m) off the floor, either by hanging it or setting it on a stand.

, Canaries will be happiest when they can flit from one perch to another. When placing perches in the cage, adjust them so that they are different heights. This will give the canary multiple flight paths.Choose perches between 3/8 inches (9.5 mm) and 3/4 of an inch (19 mm) in diameter.
Keep a few different widths of perch inside the cage. This will reduce foot discomfort for your canary.

, Canaries do not require as many toys as other birds, but a few interesting objects will help keep them active. Avoid crowding the cage. Two or three toys will go a long way. Good toys for canaries include:Mirrors.
Plastic balls.
Swings.
Sticks with leaves on them.
Bells.
Vine balls.
Tightly-wound ropes.

, You can attach a bird bath to the walls of the cage or place a small bowl of cold water inside. Your canary will splash and bathe in the water when they need a quick refreshment.If your canary does not use the bath, try filling a spray bottle with cold water, and gently spritzing them with it instead.
Change the bath water every few days or whenever it becomes cloudy and dirty.

Cut off the thick branches of a native tree.,
Using secateurs, cut off a 10cm twig from the branch.

,
Get someone to help you cut more twigs.,
Use a cordless screwdriver to drill a hole on each end of the twig.,
Line all the twigs up, placing the smallest in the middle and the biggest on the outside of the line.,
Thread some hemp string through the right hole of the twig.,
Cut off the end of the string.,
Repeat the threading process on the left hole on the twigs.

,
Tie the bridge in the bird cage.",How to Build a Canary Bridge," For a small cage cut off 3 to 5 50cm branches.;
,, The 10cm twig you cut off on step 2 will help you measure how much of the branch you have to cut off. Get someone to hold the twig to the branch while you cut up the pieces. Cut about 16-20 twigs for a small cage.

, The hole should be 2cm away from the ends of the twig.

, Take a look at the bridge and if you feel like it isn't big enough for your cage, cut up some more 10cm twigs.

, Do this to all twigs so they're all joined.

, Make sure you leave enough string so you can be able to tie it to the cage.

,, The bird will need at least a day to get use to the bridge and then it will surely explore and play on it.

Ensure you have a male canary.,
Play recordings of canaries singing.,
Keep the lady canaries out of sight.,
Talk and sing to your canary.,
Jump start a canary’s mating season.",How to Get a Canary to Sing1," Identifying the sex of a canary is challenging, as males and females have very similar appearances. While singing likely indicates a male, this will not be apparent at birth. Check the cloaca area, or the area just in front of the underside of the bird's tail feathers. Blow on the area to improve visibility. If there is a bump in this area, the bird is likely a male.If you don’t have a canary yet and you want to make sure you get one that sings, you can always wait for proof.
You can get canaries from breeders who will know which of their birds love to sing. Similarly, visit pet stores until you hear a bird sing for yourself!
Female canaries also sing, though their song is much simpler and less expressive than that of a male canary.;
, In the wild, male canaries learn to sing by hearing other canaries sing. They will also emulate other songbirds or similar noises. Many of the tunes that a male canary hears will affect the development of their own personal song. You can even teach your canary to make video-game-like noises by playing recordings of these sounds.Most often, your canary will sing the songs it believes are most likely to attract a mate.
Once a canary is sexually mature at around 6 months of age, they will likely begin to stick to traditional canary songs., Males sing for one reason: attracting a female canary. If you keep a male and female canary together, the male won’t be searching for a mate, and will not sing. That said, a male canary may be more likely to sing if a female canary is close enough to him to hear the noises she makes. For instance, if you keep a female canary in another room, your male canary won’t be able to help himself from singing non-stop, especially during the mating season., Speaking to your canary in a soft, soothing voice will also provide him with motivation to sing. Similarly, softly singing to him may goad him into outdoing you with his vastly superior singing abilities. Further, the emotional stress caused by loneliness may keep some canaries from singing. Your company may provide him with comfort., In the wild, canaries’ mating season is determined by seasonal changes in daylight and temperature. If you keep your canary indoors, you’ll need to control the amount of light and the temperature of the room. This will keep your canary healthy, as well as affect when he is most likely to sing. Your canary will start thinking about breeding if you slowly increase the amount of light they’re receiving. Meanwhile, keep the room they are kept in between 65 °F (18 °C) and 75 °F (24 °C).Depending on where you live, natural light can likely be utilized most of the time. You can have lights turn on before sunrise and stay on until the room is naturally lit, or cover a cage early in the evening if there is too much natural light.
Use a timer to help control the amount of light your canary gets. For instance, set a timer to turn lights on near your canary’s cage and run for 12 hours.
Each week, increase the amount of time you leave the lights on by 30 minutes, either by having the lights turn on earlier or run longer.
Stop increasing the amount of light at 14 hours. Canaries will begin to molt as the “days” reach 15 hours, concluding their breeding season.

"
"
Empty the cage.,
Wash each part of the cage.,
Spray the aviary down with an insecticide.,
Leave the cage outside to dry.,
Fill in any nooks and crannies where mites can reside.,
Return the birds to their cage.",How to Treat Blood Mite in Canaries2," Toss out all padding and bedding in the cage. Remove as many separate parts of the housing as you can. You will be cleaning these separately. Since mites like to crawl around in the small nooks of the cage, you will more successfully eliminate the infestation by dismantling the cage and cleaning each part separately., Dilute 1/4 cup of bleach in a gallon of warm water. Wear gloves as you scrub down each part of your bird’s housing or cage. Rinse afterwards with fresh water.Alternatively, if you have access to a power washer, you can spray down each part.


Don’t neglect the small cracks and grooves. These are where mites like to live. Scrub down into these parts.

, Use an insecticide that is safe for birds. You can use the same spray you used on your bird. Spray down each part individually, and make sure that it reaches the dark cracks and holes.

, You can leave the cage outside to dry for a day or two. After it is dry, check it over carefully for any more signs of mites. Do not place the birds into this cage until they have been fully treated for the mites living in their feathers, or you will risk starting another infestation.

, This may be a small or a large job, depending on the size of your canaries' home, but it is very important to prevent future infestations. Use gap filling agents or sand down these areas. Paint with bird-safe paint once you have finished.

, Once you are certain that the infestation has been completely eliminated, you can return the birds back to their original cage. Wait until you are certain that all of the mites on the bird have been treated; this may take up to a week. Once you have returned the canaries to their original cage, clean the secondary cage in the same manner to fully ensure that all of the mites have been killed.

"
"
Note any unusual symptoms.,
Check the crest of the bird.,
Place a white cloth in the cage.,
Examine the cage.",How to Treat Blood Mite in Canaries3," Canaries suffering from blood mites may have powdery lesions around the face, beak, or eyes.Other symptoms include weakness, lack of appetite, or lack of energy. Be on your guard if your canary seems to be sleeping more than usual., This type of mite in particular can usually be found on the head and around the crest of the bird. With your fingers, gently brush the feathers around the head of your canary. The mites will appear as small red specks. After a few seconds, the specks may move and disappear into the feathers. The mites are small, so look carefully., If you are concerned that mites have moved into the cage, you can try using a white cloth. Fold the cloth so that it fits in the cage, and place it on the bottom. Leave it there overnight. In the morning, if you see any small red specks on the cloth, you may have an infestation., If you don’t see mites on your birds but suspect there might be an infestation, examine the cage closely, especially the nesting box. Blood mites like dark spots and are often found in the cracks and bedding of the cage. Use a flashlight to shine into these dark areas. You may see hundreds of tiny specks milling about in these spots."
"
Birdproof the room.,
Open the cage door.,
Supervise your canary.,
Lure your canary back to its cage with food.,
Catch the canary with a net if necessary.",How to Keep a Canary Entertained2," Some slight adjustments can make the room safe for your bird to fly in. Choose a room without much furniture. Turn off any fans, and make sure all windows and doors are closed. There should be no wires out in the open that they can chew.Cover up mirrors and windows so that the bird does not crash into them while flying.
Keep other, larger pets, such as cats or dogs, out of the room while your canary is exploring.
Keep toxic plants and items out of the room. These include avocado, foxglove, lilies, and tomato plants., The canary may wander out on their own. If they don’t, place a perch outside of the cage door to encourage them to leave. The bird will happily fly around the room until they become tired or hungry., While the canary is flying around, you should stay in the room with them. Do a quiet activity, like reading a book or surfing the internet, as they explore., After about 30 minutes, your canary will likely be hungry. Put some fresh food in their cage, and wait for them to return to their cage. Once inside, slowly approach the cage, and close the door before they can escape again.If you move too quickly towards the cage, the canary may see you and bolt out of it again.
Avoid feeding your canary outside of their cage or else they may not return as easily.

, Canaries can be difficult to catch by hand. Instead, use a bird net to capture your bird if they will not return to their cage willingly. Move the net slowly to capture the bird gently inside the net. Once inside, gently pick them up and put them back in their cage.You can try dimming the lights to help. The canary may think it is night, and they will stop flying around. This can make it easier to catch them. Don't make the room pitch black, however, as the bird may injure itself.

"
"
Stick a mirror in the cage.,
Spend time with your canary.,
Play a recording of canary songs.,
Avoid getting them a companion if your canary lives in a cage.",How to Keep a Canary Entertained3," If the canary is alone in their cage, you can make them think they have a companion by setting up a mirror in their cage. If you have a breeding pair together, however, the male might think that his reflection is an intruder., Canaries often do not like to be held or handled by humans, but they may enjoy having you in the same room. Do a quiet activity in the room with your canary. Your male canaries may even start singing to you!, Young canaries may need to be taught to sing. The best way to do this is to play recordings of other canaries singing. You can use CDs or online videos. You may even find that your canary sings back to these recordings.Only male canaries will sing. Females generally only chirp.

, If you have a cage instead of an aviary for your canary, it is best to keep them alone since canaries can become extremely territorial over small spaces.If you do get a second canary, make sure it is the opposite sex of the first one. Keep them in separate cages unless it is the breeding season.

"
"
Feed your bird well!,
Provide ample entertainment options.,
Ensure a comfortable cage.,
Keep your canary clean.",How to Get a Canary to Sing2," While bird seed will likely be your bird’s main diet, seeds do not offer all of the nutrients your bird needs. Make sure to balance your bird’s diet with either canary-specific pellets or “egg food.” Both of these can be found at your local pet store or online. Supplement your canary’s diet even further with finely chopped leafy greens, vegetables, fruit, and grain.Include Vitamin A in your canary’s diet to help bring out the color of their feathers. Carrots and sweet potato are great options to provide this nutrient to your bird.
Provide two separate food bowls. Place seeds and pellets in one bowl and fresh fruits and veggies in the other.
Do not be fooled by fortified seeds. Though additional nutrients have been added to the exterior of seed, your canary may leave this fortified hull behind, eating only the contents inside.
Avoid feeding your canary anything sugary or fried, as well as avocado.
Take any food out of the cage that is not eaten within 24 hours.

, Aside from nutritional sustenance, your canary also needs mental and physical stimulation. Play and exercise are necessary to maintain health, as well as contentment. Meanwhile, boredom may contribute to negatively effect your bird's mood, which may keep them from singing. Keeping multiple male canaries together will keep them entertained, but may lead to fighting. Toys and perches are additional options to keep a canary active.Hang strips of leather or sturdy string for your bird to play with.
Mount perches made of various different materials at different locations in the cage. Include at least three different types, as perches of different thicknesses help prevent foot injuries.

, Temperature is extremely important to your canary. Fortunately, normal room temperature is perfect. Make sure the temperature never exceeds 78 °F (26 °C). If you only have one canary, house it in a cage that’s at least 18 inches wide, 18 inches tall, and 18 inches long. For two birds, choose a cage that’s at least 24x18x18 inches. The bigger the better, and additional horizontal space is better than additional vertical space.(Note: 1 in. = 2.54 cm)


Make sure the space between the bars of the cage are less than 3/8 inch.
Place the cage in your living room, or whichever room is most often occupied during the day. Do not place the cage in the kitchen.
Position the cage with one side against a wall, and in a place that receives only a bit of direct sunlight, if any.
Consider covering the cage at night to help your canary rest.

, Canaries enjoy grooming and depend on good hygiene to stay healthy. Use a water spray bottle with room temperature water to mist your canary a few times a week. Further, provide a bowl with 2 to 3 inches of water in it so your canary can wash itself. Remove and replace the water after a bath, which will likely occur about twice per week.Aim the spray above the bird so that mist descends onto the bird like rain.
Do not spray a canary directly with a stream of water.
If you bird does not clean itself, take it to the vet.
Ensure that there are no drafts that reach your bird’s cage. Drafts can cause a bird to become dangerously cold while they are wet.

"
Check to see if the bird is molting.,
Talk to an avian veterinarian.,
Look for signs of illness.",How to Get a Canary to Sing3," Your canary will not sing while it is molting, and may not sing during non-mating seasons as well. Often, this means your bird is less likely to sing during the summer and the winter. However, if a bird suddenly stops singing without an apparent change of temperate or lighting, take it to a vet., If you know you have a male canary and it simply does not sing, this does not necessarily mean anything is wrong with it. For help diagnosing reasons it may not be singing, see a vet that specializes in taking care of birds. You should take your bird in for an annual check-up even if nothing seems wrong. Talk to a vet then about any curiosities you have about their singing behavior., There are certain signs you should watch out for. These may affect singing, but may also pose a serious danger to your canary. Watch out for permanently fluffed feathers, missing feathers, or incessant plucking. Also be on the look out for any swelling, unusual marks, discharges, or wheezing and coughing. Further, see a vet if your bird stays low in their cage, stops eating, or holds either foot or wing in odd positions."

For one canary your cage should be about 16” tall and 30” wide. The larger the cage, the better for the canary.Be sure that the area you put the cage has good light and ventilation, without a draft. It should be away from doors and windows that would allow for direct sunlight, because that might make it too warm. It should be near one wall, to create a greater sense of security for the canary.
Hang the cage or place it on a stand, so that the cage is elevated approximately 6 feet above the floor.;
, At the pet store, buy natural wood to install along the cage for perches. Buy perches of different diameter to add some diversity to your canary’s experience. Because canaries like to fly horizontally, rather than up or down, place the perches on the sides of the cage, across from one another.


Some canaries also like swings. If you buy one, make sure that this is also off to the side. You do not want it to obstruct your canary’s flight across the cage., Line the bottom of the cage with newspaper. Every day you should replace this paper and clean water and food bowls. Once a week use soap and water or bird cage disinfectant to wash down the entire cage. Avoid using bleach.


Cleaning the cage is very important. A dirty cage will make your canary susceptible to disease., Canaries can die after 24 hours without water. You should have a large water dish in the cage that you refill regularly. Tap water should be good for your canary. However, if you know that your local water standards are poor, consider using bottled water., Pellets are a preferred substitute for seeds, because they are designed to include more of the protein and vitamins that your canary needs. However, if your canary was not raised on a pellets, it will likely refuse to eat them.You can try to transition a canary to pellets, but you must do it slowly and carefully.


If you want to transition your canary to pellets put some in with its seeds and slowly, over a period of 4 to 8 weeks, reduce the quantity of seed and increase the quantity of pellets. If your canary still is not eating the pellets, do not stop feeding it seeds., Though they aren't the best source of nutrition for your canary, seeds probably are its favorite type of food. Provide your canary with a seed mix labeled for canaries at the pet store. Feed your canary approximately one teaspoon of food per day. Canaries are not inclined to overeat, so you can feed them slightly more if you believe it is necessary., About 20 -25% of your canary’s daily diet should consist of fruits or vegetables. Every day wash and cut some fruit or vegetables into very small pieces. Place less than a teaspoon in a separate dish. Vary the types of fruit and vegetables you feed your canary frequently.


Avocado is poisonous to canaries. Lettuce does not offer sufficient nutrition.
Good fruits and vegetables include: apples, apricots, asparagus, bananas, beat, blueberry, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, carrot, carrot top, coconut, corn, dates, fig, grapes, grapefruit, kale, kiwi, melons, mango, nectarines, orange, papaya, parsnip, peaches, pear, peas, pepper, pineapple, plum, pomegranate, pumpkin, raspberry, spinach, squash, strawberry, sweet potato, tomato, zucchini., If your canary is on a seed diet it likely is not getting enough protein. A good way to supplement your canary’s protein supply is to feed an egg that is boiled for 15-20 minutes. Let it cool down and put small pieces in the treat dish twice per week.


Egg will go bad quickly. Remove any remaining egg four to five hours after putting it in the cage.

, A toy or a swing in the cage can help keep your canary entertained. However, canaries are less inclined to play with toys than many other types of birds. One toy should be sufficient. More can clutter up the cage and make it harder for your canary to fly around, which should be your top priority.In the wild, canaries like to roll around in damp grass. Putting damp dandelion leaves or grass at the bottom of the cage can serve as a fun distraction.

, Your canary should care for itself. You will only need to provide a shallow water dish filled with lukewarm water. Place the dish on the cage floor away from your canary's perch. Plastic planter dishes are ideal. Clean the bowl daily., Canary nails need to be clipped approximately twice per year to keep it healthy. However, there is a vein inside the nail that, if punctured, can cause severe and potentially fatal bleeding. Consult with your veterinarian about proper nail clipping technique., Canaries prefer to sleep in the dark. If there are any outside noises or lights in your house, cover the cage with a towel or blanket over night, to help it go to sleep., Canaries are hearty animals. Be aware of signs of illness, however, so that you can take your canary to the vet if anything is wrong. Be mindful if you canary lacks appetite or begins to lose weight rapidly.


Other signs of illness include droppings that are not black or white, wheezing, lethargy, molting out of season, and ruffled feathers.If your canary is fluffed up for long periods of time it might be too cold, and if it holds its wings away from its body and pants, it might be too warm. It will prefer temperatures from 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit."

Get some clothespins.,
Start using your clothespins daily.,
Use a clothespin to help with feeding.,
Create easy, fast and sturdy perches.,
Clean the clothespins regularly.,
Think of some other ways to use clothespins.",How to Use Clothespins for Your Canary Cage," The wooden or the plastic varieties are both fine. They should be about 4 inches (10.2 cm) in length.;
, Whenever you open the cage door to handle your canary or to clean the cage, have the clothespins handy to keep the cage door open.

, Clothespins can hold the canaries' greens (leaves, stalks etc.) from the top of the cage. You can reposition the food as often as needed to improve ease of access for your canary.

, A good possibility is to use a clothespin as a perch. Ensure that the clothespin is secure and straight and placed in a good position for the canaries to perch on. Vary the perching areas in the cage by changing the perching position regularly. This is easily done by simply unclasping and shifting the clothespin!

, This will ensure they do not build up bacteria etc. that might harm your canaries. As clothespins are not that expensive, discard when the clothespin is beyond cleaning and use other ones.

, And then leave your ideas here!

Purchase breeding supplies.,
Keep canaries separated until time to breed.,
Watch for signs that the canaries are in ""condition,"" which means they are ready to breed.,
Place the male and female canaries near each other, but not in the same cage.Put their cages side by side or place both birds in a special breeding cage that has a central divider.,
Add a nest to the female's side of the breeding cage.,
Feed a proper diet.,
Place the canaries together once there are signs that the canaries are ready to breed.,
Watch for breeding behavior.,
Look for eggs in the nest.,
Keep the chicks with the male and female canaries until they begin eating on their own, usually they are around 3 weeks of age.At first the mother canary will stay with the babies all the time and the father will bring the mother food.",How to Breed Canaries," In addition to the basic supplies you should already have for your birds, you will need a large cage for the canaries to breed in, a nest for the female to lay its eggs in, and nesting material the female will use to build up the nest.You may also need a light to shine on the cage if your region is getting less than 14 hours of light each day.


There are special breeding cages available that first allow the male and female canary to become accustomed to one another without allowing contact. These cages have a divider down the middle that can be removed when you are ready to allow your canaries to mate.Nests for breeding canaries are available from specialty pet supply providers. If you buy a pre-made nest, you will also need to buy your canaries some nesting material that they can add to the pre-made nest.;
, Unless actively breeding, canaries must be kept in their own cages. Males tend to fight and a male might kill the female if she is not ready to breed. Their cages can, however, be kept in the same room.

, Breeding usually occurs in the Spring. Canaries like to breed when the temperature is around 70 degrees and there are about 14 hours of light. These conditions can be replicated indoors, in order to promote breeding. Male and female canaries act differently when they are ready to breed.


Male canaries will usually come into condition before the female. Signs that they're ready to mate include dropping their wings when they sing and singing harsher and louder songs. They may also dance around on their perch and be more territorial when other males are nearby.
Females will most often begin to tear paper, as if readying a nest, when they come into condition. The most certain sign of their readiness, however, is when their vent appears red and swollen. They may also raise their tails and appear to squat when males are nearby.

, This will get the birds used to each other and their behavior with each other will tell you if they are ready to mate.

, If you are just using a large cage instead of a breeding cage, simply place the nest in the female's cage. Once the female has begun adding nesting material to her nest, it is a sign that she is getting ready to mate., Nesting canaries should be fed a proper diet that consists of enriched seed, soft food, and additional calcium from a few weeks before breeding until they are done feeding their chicks.A cuttle-bone or grit is recommended to give the hen the additional calcium required for producing healthy eggs. These speciality foods are available through pet supply companies.

, This can be indicated by kissing between the canaries and the female beginning to putting nesting material in the nest.If both are in condition, your male and female canaries will begin to ""kiss"" through the bars of the wire partition by touching beaks. Kissing may happen right away or it may take a few days after you place the canaries near each other. Once they are ready to breed, you can put them in the same cage.


Watch for any fighting. If they begin to fight, separate them immediately and watch for signs that they're still both in condition. However, mating can be relatively aggressive, so be sure that you are not witnessing breeding instead of regular fighting.

, This will begin with the male courting the female canary. Once she is ready, she will crouch down, signaling her willingness. The male will then mount the female is short, successive bursts., The female canary can lay anywhere from 2 to 6 eggs.The female will lay one egg a day, usually in the morning. It typically takes 14 days for canary chicks to hatch. They should hatch without any assistance.

, Then, gradually, the father will take over feeding the chicks, making sure that they get enough to eat.Once the chicks begin eating on their own and are fully fledged, meaning their wing feathers have developed enough to fly, you may remove them to their own cage.


At this point you should also separate the parents again as well.

Learn your rooster’s crowing habits.,
Meet your rooster’s needs.,
Decrease the size of your flock.,
Limit your rooster’s exposure to nighttime stimuli.",How to Stop a Rooster from Crowing1," The rooster is responsible for protecting his flock. He crows to inform the flock of environmental changes and potential hazards. Observe your rooster’s crowing habits and note specific stimuli that causes him to crow., In addition to alerting his flock to potential dangers, a rooster may crow to inform you that he is out of feed and or water. Meeting his most basic needs on a consistent and regular basis will decrease his need to crow. To decrease his nighttime crowing, make sure to stock his coop with water and food before you head to bed., Roosters crow to assert their dominance over other roosters and to communicate with their flock. To avoid crowing matches between roosters, only keep one in the roost. Decreasing the size of your flock will reduce your rooster’s need to crow as well., Crowing is most disruptive to you and your neighbors throughout the night. When a rooster is allowed to roam at night or he lives in a coop with an outdoor run, he is exposed to stimuli that will likely cause him to crow. Keeping your rooster inside a closed, darkened coop throughout the night will limit his exposure to predators and light that may cause him to crow."

Once you have your chicken/chick, treat your chick like a pet.,
Handle your bird daily.,
Keep the bird sheltered.,
Wash the chicken.,
Don't forget those beautiful birdie feet!,
Put your bird in a wire cage with straw bedding.,
When you take your chicken to the show, the following things will make your chicken stand out regardless of the breed of chicken or the chickens' breeding:


Your chicken is friendly-it may even hop right into the judge's hands.",How to Show Chickens," The purpose of this is to train your chick to be friendly towards people. Doing so will immediately make your bird stand out when the judges are handling the birds.;
, Examine it in the way it will be checked over at a show. Do all this very gently:


unfold the wings,
look at and touch the feet and beak,
look at the eyes to make sure they are nice and clear,
stand it up on a table for a second or two, kind of like you are showing it off. This type of training ensures your bird will be patient and expect that it will be handled and it won't be timid. This will also help you to learn what is normal for your bird so that if something is wrong, you catch it and treat it right away.

, The whole time your bird is growing and you are preparing to show your bird, make sure it is in a covered area. This will keep your chicken's feathers color beautiful and bright.

, When the weather is very warm and there is no breeze, you can give your chicken a dip. Do this once about two weeks before show, then the day or so before you take your bird to show:


Fill a tub with water. Use a metal washtub outside and let it set out to be warmed by the sun. Use one that only holds about 4 gallons (15.1 L) of water. Do not add any soaps or chemicals to the water. The chicken will do all the work.
Hold your chicken's head very gently so it can't throw its head into the water, hold the body from underneath. If you have a large or heavy bird, you may need help with this part. One person holding the bird body, below and above, and one person protecting the bird's head so it doesn't try to drown itself.
Very quickly, dip the bird in the water with a quick up and down swish, no more than two swishes. Pick the bird up out of the water. Very important - Only wet the chicken up to the neck. If the chicken gets water into its respiratory areas, you could very easily end up with a sick or dead chicken.
If the bird seems well saturated, you are done with this part. If the bird kept the wings and feathers very close to its body and only the outer layer is wet, repeat the dip as instructed above.
Do not dip your bird more than two times.
If your chicken is dirty on the head area, you can get a wet rag and gently wipe its head. When the chicken feels that the head has gotten moist, she will also groom her head.

, Spray your bird's feet with a mixture of 3 parts water, 1 part ""campho phenique."" It's not known why this helps their legs to look and feel good,but it does. Consider mixing it in a very small travel bottle with a ""fine"" mist sprayer.

, The chicken's natural instinct is to groom itself, so she will go right to work. A chicken is the best groomer of their own feathers.


Make sure you leave your chicken in the cage alone until they are completely dry, but be sure to give access to food and water. Grooming is a tough job.

, A friendly chicken shows the judge that the chicken's owner has spent an awful lot of time preparing the bird, not just ignoring it and bringing it to a show on show day. The initial author's son's favorite hen won Grand Champion from the Village fair all the way through to the State fair. Each judge noted that they were impressed with the friendliness of the hen. She just jumped right into their hands.
Your bird is used to being handled - this is impressive, it shows the owner's dedication.
The bird is healthy, had you been handling your chicken every day you would have noticed anything unusual and it would have been cared for immediately.
Your bird's feathers are beautifully clean and colorful.

Gather the required materials and find a suitable location.,
Assemble and prepare the raised dog crate.,
Cover the crate’s holes.",How to Stop a Rooster from Crowing2," A blackout box provides your rooster with a dark, non-stimulating sleeping environment. You can often locate the materials required to build a blackout box around your home or purchase them from a local pet supply store. If you intend to keep the blackout box outside, find a shady location. If you prefer to house your rooster’s indoors, place the blackout box in your garage or outbuilding., A raised dog crate serves as an ideal blackout box because it’s raised bed provides ventilation and you can easily cover the kennels’ holes. Assemble the crate in the location you selected—follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Remove any dog bedding and cover the floor of the crate with a layer of hay., The walls of your dog crate may be solid, slotted, or wire. To effectively block out light, drape the top, back, and side walls with blackout drapes. Purchase or cut a piece of plywood that is the same dimensions as the front wall. Lay the plywood against the front of the crate."

Purchase or make a rooster collar.,
Secure the rooster in your lap with both hands.,
Place the collar on the back of the rooster’s neck.,
Wrap the collar around the rooster’s neck and secure it.,
Make sure the collar is not too tight.,
Allow your rooster to acclimate to the collar.,
Adjust the collar as needed.",How to Stop a Rooster from Crowing3," A Rooster collar limits the airflow to a rooster’s voice box, which reduces the volume of his crows. You can purchase a rooster collar or make your own.To make your own collar you will need double-sided Velcro. The velcro should be 2 inches wide. Cut a 6 to 8 inch piece of velcro. Adhere the back sides of the velcro to each other., Place the rooster in your lap—his head should face away from you. Circle your thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand around his neck. Lift his feathers by moving your hands up his neck., Use your dominant hand to grab the collar. Lay one end of the collar on the back of the rooster’s neck. Use the thumb encircling the rooster’s neck to hold the collar in place.Position the collar low on the rooster’s neck.

, As you continue to hold the collar with your thumb, use your dominant hand to wrap the collar around the rooster’s next. Overlap the collar and secure the velcro. Carefully align the lengths of the collar., It is essential that you assess the fit of your rooster’s collar.Insert your pinky finger between the collar and the rooster’s neck. Your pinky finger should slide under the collar’s top and bottom edges.
Listen to the rooster’s breathing. If he is struggling to get air, loosen the collar. Continue to check on him often.

, When you first put on the collar, your rooster may jump backwards and try to remove the collar. Work with your rooster to help him get used to wearing the collar.


For the first day, keep the collar loose.
As you gradually tighten the collar, reward your rooster with treats.

, It may be necessary to adjust the fit of the collar. Check the fit of the collar from time to time. Pay special attention to your young rooster—adjust the collar as your rooster grows.

Some places will not allow you to keep roosters because they are too noisy. Unfortunately this will affect you if you want to breed your hens but fortunately it won’t affect you in any other way such as keeping hens for eggs or meat.
Some places will only allow you to have a certain number of chickens. If you plan on keeping a lot of chickens, check the maximum amount of chickens you can keep first.;
, Before you do get some chickens, you’ll want to make sure you can provide them with everything they need to keep them happy. You will need to:


Set aside some space. Make sure you know where the coop is going and that the chickens have enough outdoor space. Each chicken should have 10 square feet of space outdoors and bantams should have 8 square feet.
Save some money. Chickens aren’t cheap, you’ll need to purchase them feed for as long as they live, purchase fresh clean bedding, an expensive coop, and they’ll need a few extra things. If you’re short of money, you can keep bantams instead of regular chickens since they tend to be cheaper to take care of, take up less space, and don’t eat as much as regular chickens do.
Reorganize your schedule. Chickens usually take up a lot of your time. You’ll have to feed them daily, refill their water containers, clean their coop, collect their eggs, and if your area has a lot of predators about you’ll need to check on the chickens often.

, Before you buy a flock of chickens, it’ll be nice to let your neighbours know if it’s alright with them, you don’t want to be a nuisance.


If your neighbours wouldn’t like the noise, consider only getting hens and no roosters since roosters are much louder than hens.
If your neighbours are worried the chickens will get into their yard, make sure to keep the chickens in an enclosed area. You can always buy a chicken coop with a run attached to it so the chickens cannot escape.
If your neighbours are still not keen on you getting chickens, bribe them with a fresh supply of eggs.

, If you’ve never cared for chickens before, know what you’re getting into. Chickens can be a lot of work and you’ll want to know how to look after them properly and how to avoid common mistakes.


There is plenty of information online on websites, blogs, forums, etc. You can also get some advice from other chicken owners or purchase a book about chickens.

, There are many advantages and disadvantages of keeping chickens and it doesn’t hurt to learn them.


The pros of keeping chickens are that they get rid of pests, eat your snails, they’re a source of fertilizer, they lay fresh eggs, they’re great company, they’re wonderful to watch, and over all they’re very fun birds to raise.
The cons of keeping chickens are that you have to spend a lot of money on them, you have to spend most of your time caring for them, they take up a lot of space in your garden, they will often peck at your plants, and they attract flies.

, There are different purposes for chickens. They can be kept for eggs, meat, show and as pets. Whichever purpose you choose, there are plenty of breeds that are recommended for that purpose.


Decide on the age of your chickens. You can purchase fertilised eggs, chicks, pullets or laying hens. If you’re new to keeping chickens it’s recommended that you purchase some pullets or laying hens instead of young chicks or fertilised eggs. However, incubating your own eggs is a wonderful experience and chicks will also be a lot tamer than pullets or laying hens since you’re raising them yourself.

, Different breeds of chickens are used for different purposes. Some are better egg-layers than others and tend to lay eggs longer and there are ones that are best used as broiler (meat) chickens which mature quicker than others. You also get more unique and colourful chickens which can be kept for show and the cuter ones such as bantams which can be kept as pets.


If you’re looking for good egg-layers, go for the Plymouth rock, rhode island reds or the leghorn chickens. These chickens tend to lay more eggs for a longer period of time.
If you’re looking for chickens to be kept for meat consider keeping Faverolles or brahma chickens which mature quicker than other breeds.
If you’re looking for ‘show breeds’ research different kinds of breeds online. When you come across a breed you like consider buying one. Generally, a show breed can be any chicken that looks colourful and more unique and different from your regular breeds. However, fancier breeds may not lay as much eggs and may not be as friendly as other chickens.
If you’d like a simple pet chicken, consider seeing what kind of chicken breeds are available in your area. You can always go for the bantam sized chickens which are smaller and usually cuter than the standard chicken. There are many bantam breeds to choose from and many of them are very friendly such as the lavender bantam or the orpington bantam.
You can also get a dual-purpose breed which is a kind of chicken that is good for both eggs and meat.
If you don’t mind the breed, try to find one that is suitable to your environment. Some chickens can handle hot climates such as Hampshire reds. Some breeds can handle colder climates more than others such as Australorps. And don’t forget, if you don’t have much space or money to spend you can always go for the bantam which take up less space and eat less food than the standard chicken.
Keep in mind that you might not get the breed you want. If you look for chickens for sale locally, there might not be a huge range of breeds to choose from and the age can differ.

, As mentioned above, you might not get the breed you want, but if you’re lucky you’ll get another breed which is alike. Chicks are usually available in spring or summer so if it’s winter or autumn right now, you might want to get some pullets instead.


There are plenty of places to purchase chickens from. You can browse on websites that sell chickens such as craigslist or you can look on bulletin boards at pet shops to see if there’s an advertisement on chickens there.
If the above information didn’t help you find any chickens, you can try asking a local farmer if he’s looking in selling a few chicks or pullets. Young chicks can also be bought at local feed stores or you can purchase some fertilised eggs online and get them mailed to you.

, You can let your chickens roam around in an enclosed area in your garden, let them free in a run, or permanently keep them in their housing.


Free-ranged chickens are often more happier than cooped up chickens. They get more light during the day, get most nutrients from the things in the ground, eat up any snails or slugs in the garden, have more space, and they get to dust bathe in the dry dirt daily.
Chickens that are kept in a run have their advantages; they’re safe from predators, you don’t have to check on them often, they still get to live on grass and dirt, and they get fresh air and light.
Chickens that are cooped up are often the same as chickens that are kept in a run except they have more disadvantages. E.g. their coop has to be cleaned up more frequently, they don’t get much light or fresh air, they need more space to live happily, and they can’t go foraging in the grass.

, All chickens need a coop to be kept in. The coop needs to be well ventilated, predator-proof, free of drafts, and have plenty of space for the number of chickens you want to keep. You can purchase a chicken coop from a pet store, a warehouse, a ranch supply store or online and the cost can range from $200 to $600 depending on the size of the coop.


If you have some knowledge in building things, you can try to construct your own chicken coop. You can get many coop designs online or design your own coop.
Your chickens should have 4 square feet of floor space each in their coop, bantams should have half of that which is 2 square feet. If you’re going to keep your chickens in the coop permanently, it will have to be quite large so that the chickens are happy with the amount of space they have and have room to roam around.
Place the coop in an area with plenty of grass and some dirt piles. Chickens like to eat any grass they come across and they love to dust bathe daily. Keep your chickens in an area with some dry dirt to dust bathe with and in a place with plenty of long grass to munch on.
Consider attaching a run to the coop so that your chickens can roam around outside but still be protected from predators and so they won’t wander off.
Purchase a few perches/bars to hang in the coop. Chickens don’t usually sleep on the ground but they often roost at night on perches or on top of nesting boxes. This is why you’ll want to buy a couple of perches for your chickens. The amount of perches you buy depends on the amount of chickens you have. Make sure the perches aren’t too thin so that the chickens can easily rest on them. It’s also better to buy removable perches so that you can clean them without any trouble.
Purchase or build a few nesting boxes to go inside of the coop. These will be the place where your hen will lay her eggs. Make sure there is one nesting box between every four hens. You should add bedding such as straw to the boxes so that it is like a nest. Also, make sure the boxes are big enough so that your hens can fit in them and be comfortable. Make sure you have easy access to the nesting boxes and that they have a lip so that the eggs cannot fall out of the nest and crack on the ground. You might want to build or purchase a coop with nesting boxes in a way so that you can collect the eggs from outside of the coop, this way you won’t be disturbing the flock every morning by entering their housing.
Add absorbent bedding to the coop. The bedding is so that you can clean up the chickens waste quickly and easily. It should be added to the flooring of the coop.
If you cannot buy or build a coop, you can always keep your chickens in a warm, well ventilated, predator-proof shed. The chickens will easily adapt to this.

, Chickens have many predators including raccoons, cats and dogs which can fit through cracks in the coop or fence or dig under the coop or fence. Make sure to reinforce your chickens enclosure unless you want to find all your chickens gone in the morning.


Make sure to put up a fence around the chickens enclosure. Make sure the fence is made out of strong materials. If the predators continue to get inside the chickens enclosure, consider setting up an electric fence.
Stick some wiring underground so that no predators can dig underneath the coop and get in.
Block off any gaps that predators can fit through in the fence or coop. You can block off the gaps with a piece of wood, tile or something similar.

, When caring for chickens, you’ll need to make sure they have the right feeding equipment, cleaning tools, extra items to go in their coop, and the correct type of feed. A list of equipment you will need can be seen below:


Purchase a feed and water container. You can use some tubs or bowls as your chickens feed and water container or you can buy a feeder and drinker. You can keep these inside or outside the coop and the amount of feeders/drinkers you buy depends on the size of your flock. If you’re planning on breeding your chickens later on, you’ll want to keep a drinker since it will lessen the chance of chicks drowning.
Purchase the suitable feed for your chickens. There are different chicken feeds to buy, usually for different purposes of chickens. You can buy layer pellets which is suitable for laying hens, a finisher feed which is given to meat chickens and your normal chicken feed which is for any kind of purpose of your chickens.
Purchase extra bedding. If you’ve already bought bedding for the coop, you might want to buy some more since you will be disposing of the used bedding every time you clean the coop.
Purchase a heat lamp if necessary. If you plan on breeding your hens or if it gets quite cold during winter in your area, you’ll have to invest in a heat lamp. A heat lamp is guaranteed to keep your chicks and chickens warm.

, There are three types of chicken feeds for different purposes of chickens including layer pellets which is high in calcium and is given to hens so that they can lay great eggs, a finisher feed which is high in protein and is given to meat chickens that are over six weeks old, and the usual high-quality chicken feed which is fed to any kind of chicken.


You can get two forms of feed; pellets which is given to regular chickens, and crumbles which is given to smaller sized chickens known as bantams.

, Provide grit to help your chickens grind down their food and a source of calcium for laying hens. Crushed oyster shells or egg shells are a great source of calcium and free-ranged chickens don’t need to be supplied with grit as they find things in the ground to replace it.

, Chickens can eat almost anything such as vegetables, fruits, table scraps, bugs, seeds, etc.


Never feed your chickens avocado, rhubarb, onion, garlic, uncooked potato or egg, citrus fruits, alcohol, chocolate or anything salty. If you’re going to feed your chickens egg, make sure to cook it first. The freshest food is always the best.

, You should provide one gallon of water for up to three or four hens, the more chickens you have the more water you need to supply them with. Always make sure the water is fresh and clean and remember to refill and clean the water container daily to prevent a build-up in bacteria.

, During the night cover the container and feed up with a lid to stop it from attracting pests and clean up any leftovers so that it doesn’t turn moldy.

, In the morning, make sure to let the chickens out of their coop whilst when it gets dark and the sun is setting make sure to lock them up in their coop. When locking the chickens up, make sure to count them all to make sure they’re all in the coop. If one chicken is missing you might have to grab a torch and a helper to find that chicken and round it up.


Chickens will learn that their coop is home and eventually settle inside the coop every night when it is time to go in. This will save you the trouble of rounding the chickens up. However, if you’re still having some trouble getting the chickens inside of their coop, throw some treats inside.
The chickens should have access to their coop at all times during the day whilst the coop should stay locked during the night. Chickens will come in and out of their coop to lay eggs, eat and drink (if the feeder and drinker is in the coop) and get away from the heat or the cold.

, Each hen will lay one egg every day if kept happy. You should collect the eggs in the morning or in the afternoon to make sure you are receiving a fresh supply. On a hot day you should collect the eggs twice a day.


You should collect the eggs in a basket, box or some sort of container. If you drop an egg make sure to clean up the mess!

, Cleaning your chickens coop is very important as it prevents pests such as mites and diseases. The chickens bedding must be replaced often and you must also clean the whole chicken coop from time to time. Depending on the amount of chickens you have you may have to clean the coop more frequently, the same rule applies if you constantly keep your chickens in their coop or if they are not free-ranged.


Put on some gloves and dispose of all the bedding, sweep the floor of the housing, hose the housing down, clean out the nest boxes, rinse the feeders and drinkers and clean the perches.

, Do your daily routine and feed them, refill their drinker, collect eggs, etc. Then observe them and see if there is a change in appearance or behaviour to make sure the chickens are healthy.


Panting, cloudy eyes, sluggishness, low alert, huddling, bald spots, reduce in egg production, and no eating or drinking are all signs of illnesses. If you come across any of these you must take your chicken to a vet as soon as possible.
If one of your chickens are bleeding you must split them up immediately to stop other chickens pecking at the wound. Isolate the chicken until healed and then return it back to its coop.

, Dust bathing is a way your chickens clean themselves and it also prevents parasites such as mites or lice from infesting your chickens. If your chickens are free-range they might have some access to some dirt already.

, If you’re preparing your chickens for a show or if they’re just very dirty at the time, consider bathing them. While you’re at it, clean the coop as well!


Grab a big enough tub, a mild soap and a cup or sponge and bathe your chicken. While your bathing them it would also be good if you trim their beaks and nails and clip their wings too.

As a beginner farmer, you should be aware of the skills, abilities, and expectations required of you so you are prepared to start your farming endeavor with a good sense of what the role entails.As a farmer, you will need to be willing to work long hours, including weekends, very early mornings, and likely late nights. You will also need to be prepared for physical work, where you are feeding, cleaning, shoveling, and caring for your chickens on a constant basis.
You will also need to be prepared for seasonal earnings, where your profits are dependant on when your hens lay and how well you market and sell the meat and eggs produced by your chickens. This may mean your profits will be on the low end during your first year as a chicken farmer and you may need to wait one to two years to turn any significant profits from your farm.
As a chicken farmer, you may need to be patient and be okay with setbacks or first time mistakes. You will then need to problem solve issues by fixing it yourself and relying on your abilities as a doer.;
, Set your farm up for success by creating a business plan. Your business plan should include:Farm expenses: This is the cost of your equipment, the cost of your feed, the cost of your chicken coop(s), and the cost of your chickens. You should also consider the cost of the insurance premiums for the farm and if you need to pay for labor in the form of workers or employees to help you maintain the farm.
Farm income: This should be made up of profit goals, where you have a certain amount of profit you will need to hit on a month to month basis. It’s important to have profit goals so you can sustain a certain income from the farm and ensure you turn a profit.
Financing: To get the farm off the ground, you will need some form of financing or capital. This could be in the form of a savings account, borrowing money from a business partner or family, and/or grants or loans from government agencies. You may also have cash-flow through another source of income, like a part time job or another farming endeavor, that can be used to pay for expenses and keep your farm running.
Disaster plan: As any farmer knows, the weather or a bad season can lead to low profits. You should have a disaster plan in place in the event of an emergency to ensure you can survive a bad year or a bad turn of events. Outline changes you can make to your farm to help you save money and stay in business in the event of a disaster. You may also want to have a succession plan in place, such as a will, in the event of a fatal incident.

, Unless you have a large amount of money in your savings account or access to start up funds through family or friends, you will have to apply for financing through a third party. This could be through a government program that provides grants for beginner farmers or through a loan from your local bank.Most banks are partnered with local agencies that provide financing for start up farms, through Aggie Bond programs and the USDA. If you do not own the land you are farming on, you may be able to create a contract with the landowner in exchange for coverage of your equipment and start up costs.
Look into the Farm Credit Services of America for Young and Beginning loans. These are made for farmers 35 years or younger, with 10 years or less of experience. Youth in Agriculture Loans also offers up to $2,500 for young farmers who are still students. You can find a complete list of farm loan programs on the Farm Service Agency’s website.Check if your state has a tax-free bond program to provide funding for beginner farmers. You should also check with the USDA Farm Service Agency, which can lend you money to get your farm off the ground.

, If you would like to get a better sense of the work environment and the expectations in the farmer role, you may want to spend some time working with a farming organization like WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms).These positions often cover your room and board on the farm in exchange for working on the farm. You can also get hands on experience in the life of farming for a longer period of time, which will better prepare you to start your own farm.

, There are two options when it comes to chicken farming: farming your chickens in a coop or farming your chickens in a pasture. When you set up a coop chicken farm, you will need to have coops, buildings, and large equipment to take care of the chickens. Pastured farming only requires a small acreage of land and an enclosure so the birds are protected from predators. The benefits of pastured farming are that there is very little overhead or start up costs and it can be done with fifty chickens or hundreds of chickens.Many of the other elements of chicken farming, like selecting chickens and caring for the chickens, are the same for both coop farming and pastured farming. The major difference in pastured farming is that rather than build a coop for the chickens, you will need small enclosed shelters on a pasture. The chicks, feed, and water will then be moved everyday in movable pens.
You can also set up a pastured farm using a shelter that has a door that allows the chicks to move in and out of the shelter at will. You will then surround the shelter with electric fencing and move the fencing on occasion so the chicks are given access to new areas to pasture.

, The most important element of your chicken farm is the chicken coop, which should be big enough to fit forty to sixty chickens at a time. Chickens are social animals and do well in groups. The coop should be big enough to provide four square feet of space per chicken. For example, an 8 x 8 chicken coop can hold 16 chickens. The coop should also be large enough for you to stand in so you can gather eggs and shovel manure. But do not make it too big, as the chickens can get cold in a space that is too large.Most chicken coops are built out of wood, with wood roofs and chicken wire windows and a chicken wire door. The windows or screens are important as they will allow sunlight into the coop in the wintertime and provide ventilation in the summertime. You can buy the raw materials and build it yourself using a chicken coop plan.
If you do not want to take the time to construct a coop, you can buy one at your local hardware or farm supply store. Coops can range from $500 for a small one to $3000 for a larger size.

, Your coop must include a roost for your chickens, about 6-12 inches of roosting space allotted for each bird. You can build the roost inside the coop using a board or dowel that is 1 ½ inches in diameter, making sure the roost is 2 ½ - 3 feet off the coop floor.The coop should also have a nesting box for the chickens, 13 inches all around, one box per four to five birds. The nesting boxes will keep the eggs laid off the coop floor and away from the manure.

, Finally, make sure the coop has a feeder that is big enough for the chickens to eat from and several water containers that are shallow so the chickens cannot fall into them. You should have one long feeder per four to six birds and one water container per four to six birds., Your chickens will need an outdoor area to walk and cluck around in so they can spread their wings and take dust baths throughout the day. A chicken run will help your chickens stay healthy and ensure they produce high quality eggs. You should fence the area with chicken wire or put up a chicken fence so the chickens stay in and are not threatened by predators, including any household cats or dogs.Try to have the outdoor area close or next to the chicken coop for easy access and convenience. The chickens will spend a lot of time in the outdoor area and in the coop so they should be close to each other.
You should fortify the chicken wire with fencing using T-posts to keep predators out and line the base of the enclosures to ensure no small animals like weasels, minks or snakes from getting into the enclosure.

, If you plan to breed your own chickens, you should get one to two incubators to help keep your new chicks warm and well cared for.Keep in mind incubators can be expensive and often take up lots of space. You can find incubators at your local farm equipment store or online through second hand websites.

, You should be prepared to process any chickens raised for meat by investing in stainless steel killing cones and a feather plucker. This will make the processing time for each chicken fast and efficient.If you do not want to invest in this type of equipment, you can use a hatchet and a scalding pot instead to kill and process your chickens. However, larger meat chicken farms often have more sophisticated equipment to keep production easy and fast.

, In order to sell chicken eggs commercially, you will need to have egg-washing equipment to clean the eggs properly. You will also need to have a professionally calibrated scale so you can size your eggs properly and a high intensity candler to grade your eggs.You should also invest in egg cartons and egg labeling. Your labeling should advertise that your eggs are all natural, locally produced, and pesticide and chemical free as this will attract more customers to your eggs.

, If you are focused on getting meat from your birds, you may want to go for the Ranger breed, which grows moderately fast and are more active than the American white broiler birds that are popular in the chicken industry. These birds are full grown in about 12 weeks.Heritage breeds like Jersey Giant, Wyandottes, Rocks and Australorps, are also good meat chickens and are good dual purpose birds, where you can procure both meat and eggs. They are slow growing but are known to be healthy and tasty. A heritage breed chicken can be ready in 6-8 months.

, Most egg laying breeds will have smaller bodies than meat producing breeds and can lay white or brown eggs. There is no difference between white or brown eggs besides the color of the eggs. Many white egg layers are of the Leghorn breed and many brown egg layers are of the Rhode Island Red breed. White Leghorns, Black star, and Red star are all popular egg laying breeds, which can lay 320-340 eggs a year., Some chicken breeds are considered dual purpose, where you can get both meat and eggs from them with the proper care. Most first time chicken farmers go for dual purpose breeds if they are planning to have both eggs and meat.Popular dual purpose breeds include Orpingtons, Rocks, Wyandottes, Australorps, Rhode Island Reds, and Sussex varieties. You will need to have a rooster in your flock if you have dual purpose breeds, one rooster for every eight to twelve hens.
Most dual purpose breeds take about three to four weeks to produce eggs and are “broody”. This means the hens of these breeds will sit on the eggs and hatch the chicks, thereby replenishing your flock without the need to buy new chicks or hatch the eggs yourself.

, You can buy chickens at several different stages of development from a breeder: day-old chicks, ready-to-lay pullets, and mature laying hens. Young, day-old chicks take the longest to grow and raise and you will need to wait about six months for eggs, but they are cheap, about $3 each from a hatchery. Invest in forty to sixty chicks if you are planning on running a larger scale chicken farm. You may want to start with only twelve to fourteen chicks if you are planning on running a small scale chicken farm on your land.Ready-to-lay pullets are 20 weeks old and are more expensive than day-old chicks. But they are just starting to lay, meaning they will produce eggs sooner. They are also usually females and can go straight into your coop for roosting and laying.
It is is difficult to get mature laying hens, as they are usually only available if a chicken farmer wants to sell their old hens and replace them.

, You can buy your chickens from a local hatchery, which should be run by a knowledgeable breeder. You should ask the breeder about the noise level of the birds, if they are docile or very active, and if they are good in a confined space. The breeder should be able to recommend a breed based on your coop size and farm set up.You should also ask the breeder if the chickens are high-laying and how long they will take to lay eggs or reach maturity for meat. For example, some breeds are calm, docile, and high-laying, like the Jersey Giant, but require more room in the coop due to their size. Other breeds are not as docile, but are quiet and good with confinement, like the Araucanas, but they produce green colored eggs rather than the standard white or blue. The breeder should be forthcoming about all of this information before you buy any chickens from him.

, Feed can be one of the most expensive supplies for running a chicken farm, but it is also the most essential element. Good high quality feed can ensure your chickens are healthy and their products taste good. While you may be tempted to allow your chickens to forage in pasture to reduce your feed costs, this will likely lead to a coop of hungry chickens and less eggs produced. Instead, buy enough feed in bulk to last you two months. This will allow you to save money and ensure you do not run out of feed for your chickens., Most backyard chicken farms start with a flock of baby chicks, so it is important that you give the chicks the right amount of nutrients and care so they grow into full, healthy chickens. Look for chick starter feed at your local farm supply store. Chick starter feed usually comes in a mash or crumble form and contains a protein content of 18-24%, which helps the chicks to gain muscle and weight.Give the chicks just starter feed once a day for the first two days, then introduce chick grit into their feeders on the third day. This will help them digest their food better. You can give them grit until they reach maturity and switch to oyster shell once they start to lay eggs. All chick breeds will consume around three pounds of starter feed during the first three weeks in the coop.
You should make sure the water troughs are not too deep in the coop, as the chicks can drown in them. They should be shallow and cleaned daily. Have about a one gallon-sized waterer for every hundred chicks. If you have pullets, you can use one waterer for every six to eight birds.

, Chicks will need a red brooder lamp on at all times in the coop and no drafts or cold areas to grow properly. The temperature of the coop should be around 92 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the chicks start to feather out, you can reduce the temperature in the coop by five degrees per week until they are six weeks old.Make sure the chicks are close to water and food in the coop. You can do this by spreading four inches of pine shavings on the coop floor and then several layers of newspaper. Scatter chick feed on the paper so it is easy to access and make sure the feeding trough is full of feed. Remove one layer of paper a day until the chicks are comfortable using the feeding trough.

, Picking is common among chicks and chickens in coops, as well as cannibalism and pecking to death. You can prevent this by making sure there is enough space in the coop for all of your chickens.You can try to mix the ages of your flock and keep them in one coop, with older chickens living with young chicks. They should not pick at each other as long as there is enough space in the coop for all of them.

, If you are raising a fast growing breed, you will need to give the birds grower mash feed that has 18-24% protein content until they are ready for processing, about six to nine weeks. These fast growing birds can consume about 20 pounds of feed from the age of three weeks to processing at six to nine weeks.If you have Heritage breed chickens or Ranger breed chickens, you should give them a grower mash with an 18-21% protein content to ensure they grow healthy and full. Ranger breeds can consume 25 pounds of feed from the age of three weeks to butchering time, about 11-12 weeks old.
Egg laying breeds will need a grower mash with a 17-20% protein content until they begin to lay eggs at five months old. Switch to grower feed with a protein content of 15-17% with a supplement of oyster shell once they start to lay, as this will allow the hens to produce strong egg shells.

, Once your chickens have matured and are ready for laying, you can start to collect eggs from their roosting area. As long as they have access to 12 to 14 hours of light, most hens will lay eggs in the spring, summer and into fall., Think about who is going to buy your products. Perhaps you specialize in a specific chicken breed and feel you can market it to high end restaurants in your area. Or, you may be able to sell eggs at a lower price than your competitor. Do some research and visit your local farmer’s markets to see what types of eggs and meats are selling. You should also look at the menus of local restaurants and see if you can fill a gap in their supplies.You should also think about how you are going to get your products to your target audience. If your target audience seems to be more at local farmer’s markets, you should have all the supplies necessary to package and sell your products. If your target audience seems to be more in restaurants or the dining industry, you may need to consider using a nearby processing plant that is USDA-approved to ensure you can fulfill large orders for these clients.

, To turn a profit with your farm, you will need to focus on marketing your products to local food vendors and suppliers in your area. This will allow you to turn a bigger profit, selling larger units of your products, and to build working relationships with your buyers. Get the word out by advertising your products online and using local online databases that are setup to connect buyers with local farms.You can also create a Facebook page for your farm and update it regularly with announcements and photographs of the farm. This can act as free marketing for you and allow you to connect to buyers outside of your local area.
You many want to consider creating business cards and a business website for your farm. This will allow you to advertise your farm and keep your customers informed on changes or updates in your products.

, Many chicken farmers will focus on local customers and sell their products at farmer’s markets in their area. This is a good option for beginning farms as it usually requires a very short travel time and you can build a customer base every week at the same markets.


Your products should be properly labeled, with your farm logo or name, and notes on being locally farmed and preservative free. If you use organic feed for your chickens or if you pasture your chickens, you should also note this on the packaging. This will entice customers who are health conscious and environmentally conscious to buy your products.

, After several weeks to months of selling your products to your target audience, you should re evaluate your chickens. Note if one product from one chicken breed is selling more than the same product from a different chicken breed. Consider adjusting your chicken selection so you have more chickens who produce eggs and meat that sell well. This will ensure your farm is sustainable and responding to the needs of your customers.

It may be difficult finding homes for your male chickens (roosters). Roosters are considered good for one thing; breeding. But not everyone wants to breed, let alone keep a noisy rooster. On the other hand, hens are usually sold within days after making it known that they are for sale.;
, Do not even attempt to sell a sick, injured or dirty chicken. Make sure your chicken is ready to go to a home before selling them. You must ensure they are healthy. If possible, around a check-up with an avian vet to get an accurate sign-off., Some will jump at any chance to get their flock a new home, whilst others couldn't live with themselves not knowing they're at the best place possible. There are a few factors you should consider; do you mind if your chickens go to a breeder? Or would you be fine with them being sold as potential broiler (meat) chickens? Or do you expect higher standards of your flock which will have to meet specific requirements such as a free-range farm even.

The higher the expectations the less likely you are to find new homes for your chickens. Though it is possible. Many people jump at the sight of seeing hens up for sale in their area. But whether they reach your expectations is a mystery.

, You might have more luck selling chicken per each separately, however some people tend to look for flocks. If you have a small flock of around four chickens then you shouldn't be concerned., Most hens will catch a price of $20 each, but some can go as high as $40 and even higher if they are special showline breeds. Roosters, however, will hardly sell at all unless a showline winning breed or an exotic breed. Depending on the country, roosters aren't often worth anything at all., A lot of people prefer to see pictures straight up when they see an advertisement. It also gains viewers and attention. The pictures should be of high quality and show the whole body of each and every chicken in your flock. Make sure they show your chickens assets rather than flaws. They should attract the buyer and make them want to buy your flock., Farmers have the land to expand and set aside for poultry. Small-scale farmers who are just starting out often look for multiple flocks of chickens to add to their land and can guarantee a healthy life for your flock with the knowledge and space they are able to provide. If you know a farm or two, don't hesitate to contact them. Many farmers can and will expand their current flock if they find a beneficial deal to them., Although many consider this to be their last option, it's a useful way to find your flock a new home. The biggest threat is that you might not exactly know where your chicken is going. Sites such as craigslist and gumtree offer free advertising for livestock on their website., Social media is gaining a large amount of people each week and is becoming more useful as the minute goes by. Some towns will have their own buy and sell or livestock group which you can freely advertise your chickens on. The plus side is you can take a quick snoop on the buyers profile to determine whether they look capable to look after your chickens.

You will need to set a price, photo and description on your post. All three will attract buyers and enable you to get more views and attention from your advertisement.

, You will find that some people with a desperate want for chickens will post wanted advertisements. You may find these on your local newspaper, public pin boards or situated on online sites. If you're lucky enough to find someone wanting chickens, then be sure to contact them., If you have a few friend who keep chickens or are interested in keeping chickens, offer them yours! Additionally you could ask your friends, family and neighbours if they know anyone who would be interested in keeping a flock of chickens., You can use Microsoft Word to create an easy flyer/pamphlet. You must include a title, description, picture, price and of course contact details. Hand them out, pin them up or put them in random letterboxes around the neighbourhood., You can use these pin boards to either pin up your flyers or find wanted chicken advertisements. You might come across a pin board in your local corner store or pet shop. Some stores will require payment to pin up an advertisement, so make sure to ask before you actually pin your flyer on the board., There are a number of places you could try, with many being free such as the use of flyers, pin boards, social media, online sites (such as craigslist or gumtree), etc. A classified newspaper ad will most likely require payment., The title should be the first thing to let the viewer know what you're selling. It should be short and simple and possibly include a very brief description such as 6-8 month old bantam pullets for sale - this title includes what the poster is selling and a brief description., You will have to include your price in order to post your advertisement on most sites. Some places will allow you to write down negotiable or even free on your pricing. As states beforehand, most hens will catch a price of $20 in US dollars. On the contrary roosters fail to catch a fairly high price if one at all., A description isn't always needed, however it will gain attention from viewers into what they want and whether your chickens meet their expectations. You should include the age, sex, breed and price of your chickens and if possible, the characteristics.

A good example of a description is as follows; These two sussex hens are roughly 24 months old and ready to go to their new homes. They are friendly girls, suitable for young children to handle. Preferred to go to a good home that will provide them with the attention and care they require.


, As briefly described beforehand, pictures help engage the audience and attract viewers. Your image should capture the full body of each hen and be of high-quality., Of course, the buyer will need a way to contact you. Provide an email dress or phone number (or both) whichever one is best for you. This will enable the buyer to arrange a pick-up date with you., You should NOT add your home address to the advertisement, but provide the location you're situated at such as the town or your countries state."

Listen closely and notice what your chickens are doing when they make a certain sound.,
A mother hen will instinctively make a certain clucking to her chicks when she is out and about with them.,
If you are far away from your hens, you can sort of teach them to come when called.,
You can also sing in chicken to your hens.,
Chickens will have warning calls of sorts.,
Chickens are capable of learning, and if you constantly use one specific call for one task (E.g, say ""Scraps!""",How to Talk to Your Chickens,";
, It means ""Come here, I've found something for you to eat, scratch at, or play with."" It sounds like regular clucking but has a very distinct difference. It will either be ""kruk kruk,"" with a rolling r that you'll hear in Spanish accents. Roosters will often use this for the same reason as mother hens, as a sort of, ""Hey, I found food, come and eat it."" You can use this when you want to give them leftovers or something to eat, or if you need to do a role call because you've seen a fox lurking near by.

, You cluck relatively similar to the food call, you just say, ""Chick chick chick chick CHICKIES!"" Generally use a higher tone when doing this.

, It sounds like a sort of ""craaaaaaaaaaaw cruk cruk crawwwwwww."" Singing to them can really be any kind of clucking-ish sound, you just draw it out sort of in a quiet low tone of voice.

, You may find it impossible to imitate them, but listen and you might be able to hear them and go running to them to keep them out of trouble. The warning calls sometimes can be imitated. They are also useful, if you have to watch out for hawks that might eat the chicks.

, when bringing food out) they will respond in kind

Inspect your flock weekly (or even daily).,
Look through the feathers.,
Watch your chickens behavior.,
Examine the comb and wattle.,
Look into their eyes.,
Look at the body shape.,
Examine the crop and breathing.,
Look at the legs.,
Check the chicken's vent.,
Examine the excrement.,
Act fast.",How to Tell if a Chicken is Sick," Symptoms are easier to notice if you perform a routinely check-up and inspection on each bird. A close-up can help you a lot. A check-up consist of examining the;


Wattle
Comb
Feathers
Legs
And claws.;
, You should be looking for bugs called mites/lice on your chickens skin and feathers. These bugs are small, black and can cause your chicken to become very weak and agitated.


If your chicken does have mites you will also notice white, flaky build up at the shaft of the feathers. These are called mite eggs and are easier to spot.
If your chicken has mites you might also notice her picking at her feathers and shaking her head, feather loss and visible agitation.

, Unusual behavior could be a give-away to knowing that your chicken is sick. They could be sluggish, cold or even agitated.


If your chicken is itching itself it could be a sign of mites/lice.
If your chicken is bundled up this is a sign of illness; especially if the rest of the flock are normal. But it it's cold out you can expect this sort of behavior.
Sluggish chickens are most likely to be ill too. They aren't moving around or cautious like the rest of the flock. Instead they just sit there in the corner.

, Usually, a chicken's wattle and comb should be bright red. If you notice it is pale in color this could be another sign/symptom.


A pale comb/wattle can indicate frost bite if you get snow in your country. Reddened areas can indicate thawed frost bite.
Young chickens don't develop bright wattles/combs until they have fully matured so expect to see a cream coloured wattle in young pullets.

, They should be aware and clear. A sign of illness is sleepy and/or cloudy eyes. This is known as conjunctivitis.

, If your chicken's tail and wings are stooped down he/she could be ill. Your chicken's body should be perked up and steady. A puffed up chicken could also be a symptom, however chicken's do this in the cold anyway.

, If your chicken is wheezing/sneezing they are either ill or have something stuck in their crop. Their crop shouldn't be engorged, hard or squishy. However a full crop is normal, it's just their way of digesting food.


The crop is located below the beak, in the middle of it's front body.
If your chicken is sneezing/wheezing they could have a cold or some respiratory disease.
Sour crop is commonly caused by bread or any sort of build up in the crop. The chickens crop will be smelly and squishy.

, Raised scales can indicate scaly-leg mites (which burrow under the leg scales). If your chicken has a black scab on the bottom of it's foot this is known as bumble foot.

, If your chicken has a protruding vent it could be a sign of prolapsed vent or your chicken could be egg bound.

, If your chicken has blood in their excrement or diarrhea they could be seriously ill. This is a common sign of coccidia (a contagious illness deadly in young chicks).

, Chickens only show sickly symptoms in the last stages. However, all of the above can be treated as long as you get your chicken help as soon as possible.

Trim up to the quick.",How to Trim a Chicken's Nails," If this is your first time in attempting to trim the nails of your chicken and you find it difficult, get a partner to help you. Your partner can help hold the chicken while you trim its nails.;
, Clutch the chicken and be sure to hold its wings down so that it doesn't try to escape by flapping its wings. Consider using a towel to keep the chicken calm when holding it.

, Whilst doing this you can also inspect the chicken's feet to see if there are any injuries.

, The quick is the blood line of the nail. You can find it as a darker line inside of the nail. You shouldn't cut the quick as it will hurt the chicken and bleeding can occur.

, Again, don't directly trim the quick as this can hurt the chicken. Instead trim just up to it, leaving enough room to stop any bleeding from occurring. After trimming the chicken's nail with nail trimmers, file it back a bit.

Formulate a business plan.,
Have land, capital and equipment.,
Make a decision how to best raise your chickens.,
Decide what sectors of the poultry industry you wish to pursue.,
Find a niche market, if possible.,
Make yourself known to potential customers and consumers.,
Keep up with records and accounting of your business and operation.,
Raise your animals in accordance with local, state/provincial and federal law.

",How to Start a Chicken Farm Business," This is one of the most important things to draw up as part of your operation. It tells of what goals you wish to achieve and how you intend to get there. It's also a plan of how you want to operate your business from not just a producer's standpoint, but the banker's, lawyer's, accountant's and even possibly the hired hand's standpoint.;
, You cannot start up nor maintain a chicken farm or a chicken farming business without these dire necessities. You will need buildings to raise your chickens in, whether they be barns or hutches depending on how you are wanting to raise your chickens: conventional or free-range? Land is to have the buildings on and to grow crops on to feed your chickens. Equipment and machinery are needed to clean barns, dispose of deadstock, work crops, etc.

, There are two main ways to raise them. Conventional systems have chickens confined to barns that are temperature and photo-period controlled areas. Free-range systems allow your chickens to just about have the run of the farm to behave as naturally as possible.

, Ultimately there are two types to choose from: broilers, which are chickens raised for meat, or layers--chickens raised for their eggs. However, there are also the other sectors of the industry that you can pursue. Eggs which are not to be put on the market for human consumption (these can be from both broilers and layers) are incubated and the chicks hatched and raised until they are at the right age to be sold to farms to be raised as layers or broilers. Often the business of incubating eggs and raising chicks is separate from that of raising the chickens themselves. There is also the part of slaughtering chickens for meat that is a separate sector in itself you may wish to pursue.


Many chicken farms (primarily those that are not conventional) have more than one sector of the chicken farming business to operate. Whether you wish to operate all sectors or just one or two is your choice.

, If the area you are in is popular for raising chickens a certain way (more conventional than free-range), you may wish to pursue a niche market that targets the consumer's interest in free-range chickens rather than the conventionally-raised ones.

, Advertise yourself by simply letting other people know you have eggs or meat you want to sell. Often selling by word-of-mouth is a lot cheaper and still the most popular means of advertising than paying for an advertisement in the local newspaper that may get read by only a few people. However, there is no harm in doing that either, nor is there any harm in setting up a website promoting your product.

, This is so that you can always tell if you are making money or not.

Observe the duck’s plumage (feathers).,
Observe the bill color.,
Look at the duck's size.,
Look for a curled feather near the tail.,
Listen to a duck’s quack.",How to Tell the Difference Between Male and Female Ducks1," During the mating season, male ducks will have very bright coloration in their plumage to attract mates.After mating season, the male duck will molt and lose his bright coloration and resemble a female.Mallard ducks are sexually dimorphic, which means the males and females look different to each other. The females are brown and relatively dowdy, whereas the males have a vivid purple sash on the wings and are iridescent colors.
The male Canvasback has solid white to light gray plumage. His female counterpart has plumage that is grayish-brown.The male wood duck has gray feathers with blue markings on the wings during mating season. The female's plumage is usually grayish-brown.Male and female mottled ducks have similarly colored feathers, making it difficult to tell them apart by plumage alone.;
, Bill color is another way to tell the difference between a male and female duck. In many duck species, the bill color does not change during mating season, so this physical characteristic will stay the same throughout the year.


In Mallards, the male duck has a bright yellow bill and the female has a brown and orange bill.In mottled ducks, the male duck has a bill that is a solid olive green to yellow color. The female's bill is brown to orange with dark splotches.Male wood ducks have a red bill that has a patch of yellow at the bottom.During mating season, the bill of the ruddy duck changes to a bright baby blue., Across species, male ducks tend to be larger than female ducks. In addition to have a larger body size in general, male Mallards, Rouens, and Welsh Harlequins, have larger heads and thicker necks than the females., Male ducks will have an upwardly curled feather near the tail; this is known as the ‘sex feather.’ This feather, which will become noticeable in male ducks when they are between two and four months old, remains after molting.Females do not a sex feather., Female ducks tend to have a loud and hard quack. The quack of male ducks is usually soft and rough. If you have ducks as pets and you are comfortable handling them, you can gently hold the duck by its tail until it quacks.The sound of a quack can be used to differentiate between male and female ducks from the time that ducks are about one month old.In Muscovy ducks, the female's quack sounds like a trill or a coo. A male Muscovy will make a quack that's very deep and breathy (sounds like 'huch-uch-uch').The female Grey Teal makes a quack that sounds like a cackling noise, which differentiates it from the male Grey Teal."

Place the duck on his back on a table.,
Identify the cloaca.,
Expose the cloacal walls and genitals.,
Identify the reproductive organs within the cloaca.",How to Tell the Difference Between Male and Female Ducks2," Cloacal examination, also known as venting, is another method of determining the sex of a duck. It is used in ducks that are sexually monomorphic (same external features between males and females), but is also used in ducklings as young as 12 days old.Venting is a difficult procedure to perform; if you are not comfortable with doing it yourself, ask someone who is more experienced to do it for you.When you place the duck on the table, position it so that its breast is facing up and its legs is facing away from you. The tail should drape over the edge of the table so that it can be bent down to examine the cloaca.If you do not have a solid surface on which you can lay the duck, you can also kneel down and lay the duck on your leg so that its tail can be bent over your knee.Venting is even more difficult in ducklings than adult ducks, so ask a professional to do this.

, The cloaca is a small external opening near the duck’s rear. A duck’s genital and reproductive tracts end at the cloaca. Use your fingers to search amongst the feathers to locate this external opening., To do this, use your index fingers to fold down the tail and apply opposite, upward pressure on the other side of the tail with your middle and ring fingers. Next, place your thumbs on both sides of the cloaca and slowly move your thumbs away from each other.Use gentle pressure while attempting to expose the cloacal walls and genitals. Too much pressure can cause serious injury to the duck.
An alternative approach to exposing the cloacal walls and genitals is to insert your finger about one centimeter into the cloaca and move your finger in a circular motion to relax the sphincter that keeps the cloaca closed.Once the sphincter is relaxed, you can use your thumbs to ease the cloacal walls apart.

, By exposing the cloacal walls and genitals, you should be able to determine whether the duck is male or female.The duck is a male if a penis protrudes from the cloaca.A female duck will have an oviduct opening in the cloaca.In male ducks, the penis will be small and unsheathed (uncovered) in immature ducks and large and sheathed in adults."
"
House your ducks in a secure pen.,
Provide your ducks with a small shed.,
Lay rice hulls or straw inside of the ducks’ shed.,
Lock the door to your ducks’ house.",How to Take Care of Ducks1," Ducks require a safe structure to live in. An enclosure or pen will keep them from wandering (or flying) away from your house and allow them a measure of safety. You can erect a suitable enclosure using chicken wire or another fencing material. If the ducks will be spending their days in this pen, it should provide 1.5 square meters (16 square feet) of space per duck.Most commercially grown ducks are too heavy to fly far, and will stay near sources of food and water.To be on the safe side, however, be sure to put a layer of fencing material over the top of the duck pen, so that they don’t fly away.
If you don’t already have an erected enclosure, you should be able to find all of the necessary components (at minimum: chicken wire and fence posts) at your local hardware or home-supply store.;
, This shed should be located inside of the pen or enclosure, and should be stable enough to provide ducks with protection from wind and inclement elements. Make sure that the shed has firm, stable walls which are opaque and can provide the ducks with shade on sunny days.If the ducks will be sleeping in the shed, it should provide 0.5 square meters (5 square feet) of space per duck.
Since ducks defecate frequently, the housing shed needs to be well ventilated.

, Good care is required in this area if you would like your ducks to remain healthy. Be sure to give them new hay or straw at least once a week. This material will serve as your ducks’ bedding and also as a surface for them to walk on.You should be able to purchase rice hulls or straw at a farm-supply store.

, Be sure that the ducks will not be able to open the lock and get out of their house. Also, be sure that other animals won’t be able to get into their home and eat the ducks or their eggs. However, make sure that the lock is easy to open and close when you enter and exit their house.


If you prefer not to purchase a lock for the door of the ducks’ shed, try pushing a heavy stone at the bottom of the door.

Sell eggs, ducklings, and adult ducks.",How to Raise Ducks," Duck eggs usually take 28 days to hatch, but some breeds take as long as 35 days. You need to make sure that your incubator is prepared in advance before you purchase duck eggs and attempt to hatch them.


Duck eggs are larger than chicken eggs, so many chicken egg incubators will not accommodate duck eggs. Make sure that the tray used in the incubator is large enough.;
, Set the temperature to 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) and the relative humidity at 55 percent, or 84.5 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) on a wet bulb thermometer.The ventilation should be set according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Let the incubator stabilize for a full day or two before adding the eggs.

, The eggs must be in good shape in order to hatch.


Avoid eggs that are cracked, double yolked, misshapen, oversized, undersized, or dirty.
Ideally, the eggs should be set in an incubator one to three days after they were laid.

, After you place the eggs in the incubator, you should check them at least four times each day. When you check them, turn them over, so that they receive even heat on all sides.


On the first day, you should check the eggs roughly every hour.

, If there are any eggs with clear shells, that means that the eggs are infertile. Eggs with cloudy shells are dead inside. Remove both types of eggs from the incubator and leave the rest alone.

, You can either remove them to a separate hatching machine or change the settings of the incubator to accommodate the eggs as they hatch.


The temperature should be at 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 degrees Celsius) with a humidity of 65 percent.
Increase the humidity to 80 percent and increase the ventilation openings by 50 percent once the eggs begin to pip or change notably.
Within the last 6 to 12 hours, just before the end of the hatch, decrease the temperature to 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 degrees Celsius) and the humidity to 70 percent. Open the vents all the way.

, Once 90 to 95 percent of the ducklings have hatched and dried, you should remove them from the hatcher and transfer them to a brooder.

,


You will be able to care for a smaller number better, especially if raising ducks is a new experience for you, but you should also have more than one duckling to prevent that duckling from feeling lonely. Ducks need to socialize with other ducks.
Oftentimes, if you buy from a hatchery, you will be sold 10 to 15 ducklings at minimum. This amount can be overwhelming, so consider pawning off some of the ducklings on responsible friends and relatives.

, If you buy ducklings instead of hatching them. You should dip the tip of each bill into shallow water or sugar water to hydrate them.


If using sugar water, use 1/3 cup (80 ml) sugar per 1 gallon (4 L) of water.

, Water makes it easier for ducklings to swallow food and clean their beak vents. You should give ducklings access to water for a minimum of one hour before and after feeding.


Chick fountains and shallow bowls are recommended for ducklings. Be prepared to clean the area often, however, since ducklings enjoy splashing around in the water.
A week-old duckling will drink about 1/2 gallon (2 L) of water weekly. By the age of seven weeks, ducklings drink 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) (2 L) of water daily.
Make sure that the water is no deeper than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) to prevent the ducklings from drowning.Be aware of the fact that ducklings do not produce waterproofing oil until they reach four weeks old. Mother ducks apply it to the ducklings before this in the wild, but domestic ducklings cannot be allowed to swim before this age since they will not have developed any oils of their own.
Until ducklings reach the age of one month, they should only be allowed to enjoy short swims under close supervision. You can do this by filling a small plastic tub with warm water and letting them splash around for 2 to 5 minutes. Dry them off before returning them to the brooder.

, Keep your ducklings safe and warm in a brooder to shield them from predators, drafts, and diseases.


You do not need anything fancy. A spare bathtub, plastic tote, dog crate, or cardboard box lined with plastic will work.
Keep the water dish on one end of the brooder and lay a few layers of newspaper beneath it to absorb the excess water that the ducklings will inevitably cause to splash out.
When the ducklings are old enough to recognize what is and is not food, line the brooder with wood shavings.

, Shine a heat lamp over the ducklings in the brooder until they reach 7 to 9 weeks of age. Before this stage, they are unable to regulate their own body temperatures and need outside sources of heat.


Ducklings that are too cold will cluster together. If they are too warm, they will stand as far from the heat as possible.
The temperature during the first week should be 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Lower the temperature by a degree a day after the first week until the temperature is about the same as the temperature outside the brooder., After the ducklings become fully feathered and adjust to outside temperatures, transfer them to a protective shelter instead of a brooder. The shelter must be able to protect them from predators and the elements, and it also needs to grant them some form of calm and quiet.


The shelter must be adequately ventilated and large enough for the ducklings to expand their wings in once they grow into adult ducks.

, You can buy specialized duckling feed, or you can buy plain, non-medicated chick feed. If you use chick feed, however, you should sprinkle brewer's yeast over the top to provide extra niacin.


You can slowly add raw oats to their food for additional protein. At most, you should only have one part oats to three parts feed.
Add commercial chick grit to the food so that it digests better.
You can offer healthy treats like dandelion greens, grass, untreated weeds, worms, kale, peas, and moistened oatmeal every couple of days.
Change the food out daily since it tends to get wet and can develop mold and bacteria if allowed to sit out.

, If you plan to keep your ducks as pets, you should handle them often in the duckling stage. This socializes them and causes them to form a bond with you.


For this reason, it is generally preferable to raise ducks from the egg or duckling stage, since social patterns and behaviors are learned as ducklings.

, If you are buying ducks as adults instead of raising them from eggs or ducklings, you should buy two to four ducks to start with, especially if you only want to raise the ducks as pets.


If you have more than four ducks, you cannot keep them in a small area, since that area can quickly become messy.

, As with ducklings, adult ducks need access to water during feedings so that they can swallow their food and clean their beak vents.


You do not need to provide your ducks with a pond. In fact, if your pond is hard to clean, it could even be a health threat to the ducks.
Keep a dish of water near the ducks' food source. Ducks need to drink as they eat to avoid choking.
Plastic wading pools are a great way to provide your ducks with a swimming hole. They are inexpensive, easy to clean, and easy to move.
Spread pea gravel, sand, and sawdust around and beneath the pool to limit the amount of mud that develops. Change this out once or twice a year.

, Even though adult ducks will forage for slugs, grasses, and other foods on their own, you need to supplement this food supply with balanced, nutritious food.


Commercial waterfowl feed is recommended, but if you cannot find this, you can go with a commercial gamebird feed or non-medicated chicken feed.
You may also need to add supplements of grit or calcium to help with digestion and the strengthening of bones, respectively.
As an adult duck ages, its nutritional needs will vary. Mainly, young ducks should not receive high levels of calcium unless you are planning on raising them for meat.

, Adult ducks can fall victim to wild predators and bad weather, and the primary purpose of a shelter is to protect them from either threat.


Shelter also provides ducks with a quiet place to rest.
Make sure that the shelter is ventilated and large enough for the ducks to groom themselves in.
An insulated house, coop, or enclosed pen will work best, but it does not need to be perfectly snug.
If you can spend the time and energy on it, you should also consider getting a shepherding dog that you can train to guard your ducks at all hours.

, Even when you allow your ducks to roam, you should surround their grazing area with a protective fence. The fence only needs to be about 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6 to 0.8 m) (61 to 76 cm), and most ducks will never try to jump it as long as they are well cared for.If you do have a flying breed, clip the primary feathers on one wing once a year to keep them grounded.

, Ducks are fairly resistant to the worms and diseases that often plague chickens, but you need to make sure that their basic health needs are met.


The healthiest ducks are allowed plenty of exercise in wide, open spaces.
Keep no less than three ducks (females) to one drake (male) to prevent excess stress on the females.
Watch out for signs of illness, including ruffled feathers, changes in food or water intake, lethargy, and bloody diarrhea.
If a duck does get ill, quarantine it and treat it immediately.

, The primary reason for raising ducks is simply for the sake of companionship. Ducks can be entertaining to watch, since they enjoy playing in the water and can form bonds to the humans that care for them.

, Duck eggs are richer and higher in protein, calcium, iron, and potassium as compared to chicken eggs. Many breeds of duck also lay more eggs on a yearly basis than chickens do.


Note that if you have an allergy to chicken eggs, you might be able to tolerate duck eggs. Confirm this with your doctor before consuming duck eggs, however.
Duck eggs can be used for almost anything that a chicken egg would be used for, but be aware of the fact that they tend to be larger, so you will need to take this difference into account when adding them to recipes.

, If you end up raising a large number of ducks, you can consider using some of them for food. Duck meat contains vast quantities of protein, iron, zinc, and selenium.


Roasted duck leg contains 217 calories with 11 grams of fat, which is comparable to the amount of calories and fat in a broiler leg of chicken.
Similarly, roasted duck breast has 140 calories with 2.5 grams of fat, while broiler chickens have 165 calories and 3.6 grams of fat.

, If you have live ducks, ducklings, and eggs to sell, you might be able to find a buyer at a nearby farm or in a rural area. When you only need to sell a few, you can usually do so without obtaining a license, but you should check with your local and state laws first before doing so.


If you plan to make a business out of selling your ducks, you will need to obtain the right licenses from the city, state, and federal levels of government. You will also need to follow strict health code regulations.
If you plan to sell eggs or food or duck meat, you will also need to follow strict food and health regulations concerning the processing of meat.

Breed chicks.",How to Make Extra Income from Keeping Chickens," Often you are not allowed to keep more than six chickens, and most places you cannot have roosters. This is for the sake of your neighbors (and your reputation). Contact your local authority before buying any hens.

, If you rent, would the owner be happy with you keeping chickens? Do you have a nice garden that you don't want chickens scratching around in? Do you have adequate space for the chickens to roam about in? Do you mind chicken poop in the garden and underfoot?


It's your choice whether you want your chickens to free-range (live on grass) or not. If you do let them free-range you must build a predator and escape proof enclosure for them but if you don't want them to free-range you must purchase or build a bigger chicken coop or purchase or build a chicken coop with a run.

, Put chicken wire around the yard and make it high enough to keep them in. Chickens, especially young ones, can fly away. However, you can prevent this by clipping their wings.
, Hens need to be safe at night, asleep within some sort of suitable hen house. You can either build one or purchase it ready made. If building, decide where to build the cage. The hen house height can be 7 feet (2.1 m), with small slabs for the chickens to jump (for fun) and also for having rest.


Ensure that it is warm and draft free but well ventilated as well. It should also provide shelter from the weather such as rain, hail, snow and harsh winds. A well ventilated coop can prevent frost bite and respiratory disorders which is why ventilation is very important.
Provide nesting spots, such as wooden boxes filled with straw. This is where your chickens will lay their eggs or brood and it will also be the place where you will be collecting the eggs so place the nesting boxes in an easy to get to spot.
Provide perches for roosting and sleeping on. Most chickens like roosting above the ground which is why its good to place some perches for your chickens.

, A common choice for bedding is wood shavings, pine needles or straw whilst you should use straw or hay for the nest boxes bedding.

, Chickens began laying eggs from the fourth month to 2 years of age. You'll get approximately one egg per hen every two days in the first year, and it will begin to taper off in the second year.


After two years, hens can be sold for meat for additional income. They can also be fed a finisher feed which has a high level of protein and should be fed to chickens before slaughter.
You can purchase pullets which are young female hens that do not lay eggs yet. They can be bought from farms, breeders or online.

, Country and natural varieties tend to be popular. You will also want a chicken breed that are good egg layers such as leghorns and rhode island reds.

, This means feeding the chickens well without eating into the profitability of your income-seeking venture. When choosing food at a budget price, always look for ways to reduce the food cost without compromising the chickens' health and the egg quality. A lack of appropriate nutrients can cause disease in chickens, so do not skimp on that aspect.


If you want to promote your egg layers, feed them crushed egg shells or crushed oyster shells, these turn their eggs into the best they can be. They should also be fed this is their egg shells are soft.
Chicks thrive on wheat, corn, or a special chick starter feed.
See if it's possible to get scraps from restaurants in your area for free, chickens love scraps and they can eat just about anything besides from avocado, alcohol, salty treats and never feed them uncooked egg as they will learn to eat their own eggs that they lay.
Consider growing suitable food for the chickens if your land is large enough.
Decide whether you can feed the chickens daily or will you need to use automated feeders.

, Look for discounts and special deals to keep costs low. Ask what deals are provided for buying in bulk.


If buying in bulk, you'll need a secure and dry storage spot. You might also benefit from placing the feed in plastic containers or something alike. Rats and mice can chew through cardboard and the bags you get feed with and they will eat the feed.

, You can purchase water feeders which are great especially if you are keeping chicks. The hens must have access to fresh and clean water at all times and you might have to refill the containers at least once a day.

, What you are offering is free-range at a minimum, so compare like with like. If you're going one step further and raising the chickens in an organic garden solely on organic food to create organic eggs, this will put the price up, but you need to make all these things clear and verify as required by any by-laws.


Make your price cheaper than that of the shops. About $2.00 - $2.50 for a dozen is good (this will vary on your location in the world). It may seem cheap, but if you want to make business, you have to make it worth it for your customers.
To price, don't forget to include feed cost or else you end up making a loss.

, Can you make use of the same distribution network or do you need to use other means? If the latter, what sort of ways do you intend to sell? It might be door-to-door, from your gate, through the internet, etc. Again, know the local laws with respect to the sales process.


Try bakeries, local stores, cooperatives, supermarkets that like stocking local produce, etc.
To advertise, simply tell your neighbors about your chickens. They will probably be quite willing to buy eggs from you.
If all else fails, you can sell your eggs to your local butcher. Almost all butchers will sell eggs from locals.

, You should collect the eggs once a day and twice during summer or when it's hot outside, this is to be sure you get the eggs fresh. Store the eggs properly, they can be stored without refrigeration for up to 4 to 5 days, provided it's not hot.

, The sooner the eggs are out, the better and the fresher they are for the customer.

, Many poultry shows run around the state. If you have a particularly pretty hen or rooster you would like to show-off, then why not make some money out of it too? Majority shows have a cash-prize for the winner. However, you will need a purebred breed that is taken care of and groomed well., Chicks can be sold for $5 each on average. If you have a rooster you can breed your chickens or incubate eggs."

To clean the dropping boards,put some disposable gloves on and scrape the droppings off with a taping knife. You can scrape each board directly into your compose pile, or scrape them all off into a small pail, then dump the pail on your compost pile.
If you see poop on the roosts, scrape them clean with your taping knife, too.;
, If the bedding is visibly soiled or smells bad, you should dispose of it. You can compost your used chicken coop bedding like pine shavings and hay. If your bedding looks generally good and is free of odors, you can simply set it out in the sun where it will naturally dry. The sun will kill also pathogens, bacteria, and mold.You should remove any noticeably dirty bedding every morning.

, Add fresh, clean bedding to the coop.If you simply took the old bedding out and allowed it to dry after removing the badly soiled bits, place the bedding back in the coop.








, Evaluate the condition of the bedding in your nesting boxes each morning. Replace any dirty straw or pine shavings. Add new bedding as needed.To keep your nesting boxes clean, make sure they are located at a height which is lower than your roosts. Otherwise, your chickens will roost (and poop) in the nesting boxes. For the same reason, do not position the nesting boxes directly below roosts.

, If your chickens are free-range, stick them outside for a bit. If they aren't, put them in a shed or garage of some sort. Chickens cannot fly well, so you shouldn’t worry about your chickens escaping. If your chickens have had their wings clipped, they will be even less likely to fly off. Keep the gate to your yard closed and you should be fine.


If you have time, you can take advantage of the opportunity you have to get your chickens out of their cages. If you have a partner, you could ask them to clean the chickens while you continue to work on the coop.

, You should also remove all the tools and items which might be in the coop. Your feeder, waterer, nesting boxes, and roosts (if they are removable) should all be removed and wiped down with a nontoxic household cleaner. After taking out all the bedding and other removables, go back over the floor with a broom and sweep out any bits you may have missed.









Check the ceiling for cobwebs at this point, too. Use your broom to remove any you see., You could use a power washer, though you don’t need to. Point the hose toward the floor and move it in a back-and-forth motion in order to ensure you’ve applied water to the entire surface.


The water will help soften up any manure or dirt that is strongly attached to the floor. Go back over these areas with a paint scraper in order to remove them.
Allow the water to drain somewhat. If you have a coop which drains poorly, mop up the rest of the water.

, Spray it on the walls if you notice spots of grime, droppings, or blood. Use a stiff-bristled brush on the areas you want to clean, and scrub them vigorously with wide, circular motions.









Allow the coop to dry by opening all the doors and windows. If the coop cleaner is not draining out properly, use a mop to absorb excess liquid.

, DE is a fine powder made of fossilized algae called diatoms, and prevents infestations of ticks, fleas, mites, digestive worms, and other pests.With your coop’s floor dry and clean of feeders, nesting boxes, and other removable objects, sprinkle some DE across the floor of your coop. The amount you’ll need varies with the size of your coop. If you have a large coop, use a large amount. If you have a smaller coop, use a smaller amount.


You could sprinkle the DE with a small spoon by scooping some up and then shaking your hand back and forth over the floor, allowing a bit to spill over the edge of the spoon with each shake. Alternately, you could use a duster to apply the DE. A duster sprays the DE out when squeezed, and is useful for getting it deep in the cracks and crevices of your coop.
Ensure you use food grade DE.
Do not inhale the DE. It can cause inflammation of the lungs.

, New bedding will complete the process of making your chicken coop a chicken home.If you chose to dry the old bedding in the sun rather than discard it entirely, you can bring it back in and replace it on the floor.








, After you've added the bedding, put the rest of the items you removed -- such as the feeder and waterer -- back inside the coop. Refill the food and water if needed. Finally, bring your chickens back inside.








, While certain maintenance tasks like checking the nesting boxes, dropping boards, bedding should be checked each day and changed as needed, a full-coop cleaning can occur at various intervals. How often you choose to clean your coop top-to-bottom depends on how many chickens you have and how big your coop is. Clean your coop more often if you have many chickens in a small space. You can clean your coop less often if you have few chickens in a big coop.


If you detect any foul stink, especially one reeking of ammonia, your coop needs a serious cleaning.
Always err on the side of cleanliness when deciding whether or not your coop needs to be cleaned.
Some coops can be cleaned as few as three times a year, while others call for cleaning every two weeks.When you get a new flock, clean your coop out before housing them within., Cleaning the chicken coop can be a dirty business. You should minimize the chances of touching something yucky by wearing disposable gloves.Not only will this keep your hands clean, but it can minimize your risk for contracting germs and illnesses like Salmonella.Disposable gloves are readily available at most gardening or housing supply stores.
Using disposable gloves help reduce the risk of spreading bacteria as gloves are thrown away after use.
If gloves become punctured during use, put a new pair on to avoid spreading bacteria.
Wash your hands with soap after exiting the chicken coop and removing your gloves.

, If you do not, select your rattiest pair of sneakers and use them exclusively when cleaning the chicken coop. Remove the shoes just before you step into your house. This way, you won’t track any of the chicken coop grime into your home.

, Chicken coops can collect dust that you don’t want to breathe in. If your chicken coop is mostly enclosed, the problem is compounded. No matter what type of coop you have, however, you should always put a face mask on when you enter the chicken coop.Ear loop masks of the variety worn by doctors tend to be the most comfortable, and effectively cover both mouth and nose.
Prevent dust buildup by providing adequate ventilation for your chicken coop.

, Wear old shirts and tattered jeans that you don’t mind messing up when cleaning your coop. Since you might be kneeling or brushing against the inside of your chicken coop, you should not wear clothes that you would mind getting grimy, dusty, and gross. After you’ve finished cleaning the coop, change into something clean. Wash the clothes you wore into the coop as soon as possible., There are many coop cleaners available. Only use cleaners that are nontoxic and free of ingredients like bleach and creosote. Avoid aerosol sprays as well. Try to find a cleaner that leaves behind a pleasant odor when used. You could choose a cleaner from your local farm supply store specifically designed to clean chicken coops, or you could use a household cleaner.


If you mix bleach and ammonia (a primary component of chicken feces), you can create toxic fumes, and irritate the lungs and eyes., There are many varieties of homemade coop cleaner, all of which contain vinegar and water as main ingredients. For example, you could easily create a pleasant-smelling lavender-mint cleaning agent by mixing half a handful of fresh mint, half a handful of fresh lavender leaves and flowers, and half of a vertically-sliced vanilla bean in a standard-size mason jar white vinegar.


Fill the jar with vinegar and stop when it is 1/4 inch from the top. Let the jar sit for three to four weeks, shaking three times every other day.
When the vinegar smell has mostly been replaced with a minty-lavender scent, strain the leaves and vanilla bean out and pour the mix into a spray bottle.An even more basic recipe calls for an equal mix of water and white vinegar., Don’t feel obligated to use just one cleaning agent when cleaning your coop. Different cleaning agents often have different strengths.For instance, one cleaner might do well against poop on the floor, while another might do well against dirt and mud. Try a variety of cleaners in order to find which work best for your coop.

Look for an incubator with a fan.,
Place the incubator on a table away from direct sunlight.,
Start the incubator one to two days early.,
Use a broody chicken hen or duck if you do not have an incubator.,
Use an egg that has been laid within one to three days.,
Place the egg small end down in the incubator.,
Maintain the correct temperature and humidity in the incubator.,
Turn the egg three to seven times a day.,
Candle the egg with a flashlight after seven days.,
Lower the temperature on day 25 for hatching.,
Let the duckling hatch on its own.,
Keep the duckling warm and dry.,
Provide fresh water and feed for the duckling.,
Release the duckling near a water source.",How to Hatch a Mallard Duck Egg," Using an incubator will ensure the egg stays at the right temperature for hatching. You can get a small incubator for eggs with a fan at your local pet store or online.The incubator should also come with a wet bulb thermometer to allow you to monitor the relative humidity.
You can sometimes find used incubators online for a lower price. Make sure the incubator’s fan and temperature gauge works properly before you buy it used.;
, Make sure the table is indoors and sturdy. Pick a spot by an inside wall that does not get any direct sunlight via a window, or heat from other sources like an oven. This will ensure the temperature and humidity of the incubator are undisturbed.Make sure the ventilation holes on the incubator are not covered or obstructed by anything around it.

, Set the temperature to 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius). Put the relative humidity to 84.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Allow the incubator to warm up one to two days before you put the egg in.Make sure you set the ventilation in the incubator based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.

, A broody duck or chicken hen can be used as a live incubator if you have access to one. Place the egg under a broody duck or chicken hen and wait 27 to 29 days. Use a muscovy duck, as they are able to hatch 12-15 duck eggs at a time.Put the nest box in a clean dry shelter. Provide feed and water for the broody duck while it incubates the egg.

, This will ensure you get the best results. Check that the egg is not cracked or misshapen. If the egg is dirty, use room temperature water to carefully wash off the dirt on the egg.If you find the egg, try to guess how long since it has been laid. If it is warm to the touch, it may have been laid within one to three days.
Make sure the egg is at room temperature before you put it in the incubator. An egg that has been kept in the fridge will need to be left out to warm up before it goes in the incubator.

, You may mark the top of the egg with an “x” and the bottom of the egg (the small end) with an “o.” This way, when you turn the egg, you can keep track of how often it is turned.Close the doors of the incubator once the egg is inside. This will keep the humidity inside the incubator.

, It takes around 26 to 29 days total for Mallard duck eggs to hatch. From day 1 to day 25, the temperature in the incubator should be 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius). The relative humidity should be 86 degrees Fahrenheit (55%).On the first day of incubation, check the incubator regularly to ensure it is at the right temperature and humidity. The first few days are crucial for proper incubation.

, Turning the eggs is a key step in the incubation process. Use your hand to turn the egg so it is on a different side. Then, wait a few hours and turn the egg so it is on its other side. Do this three to seven times a day to keep the eggs at the right temperature.The more often you turn the egg, the better it will hatch. Get into the habit of turning it an odd number of times each day for the 25 days of incubation. You may write down the times you turn the egg in a log for reference.
Do not leave the eggs in the same position every night. Try to turn them during the night or right before you go to bed.

, Touch the top of the egg with a small bright flashlight. This is called ""candling the egg."" Use the flashlight to check if the egg is growing and progressing. It should not appear clear or cloudy when you touch the flashlight to the top of it. If this is the case, it may not be progressing well. Check the temperature and humidity in the incubator to ensure it is correct.If the egg looks solid in the light, it is fertile and doing well.
You can candle the egg again at the end of week 3 of the incubation to make sure it is still growing properly.

, Put the egg in a hatching tray. Adjust the temperature of the incubator to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 degrees Celsius). The humidity should be set to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (65%). Make sure the ventilation holes on the incubator are open to their maximum setting to allow the eggs to cool.At day 26 and 27, increase the humidity to 93 degrees Fahrenheit (80%).
At day 28 and 29, lower the temperature so it is at 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 degrees Celsius) and the humidity is at 90 degrees Fahrenheit (70%).

, You do not need to help the duckling emerge from the egg. Let the duckling hatch itself by breaking through the shell on its own.If the ducking makes a hole in the egg and cannot progress because it gets stuck, carefully help the duckling out with clean hands.

, Put the hatched duckling in a box with high sides. Place a hot water bottle under a towel at one end. Keep the box in a shaded area indoors. Make sure the duckling is dry by wiping it gently with a clean towel.If the duckling appears to be very cold or shivering, you can snuggle the duckling close to you to keep it warm.

, Place a small amount of hard boiled egg or crushed dried mealworms in the lid of a jar. Give it to the duckling in the box. You should also give the duck a shallow dish of water filled with medium-sized pebbles. The pebbles will prevent the duckling from drowning in the water.Always offer the duckling fresh water with any food.

, Ducklings can be released after they are six weeks old and fully feathered. Pick a pond or lake that has other ducks in it. If possible, release the duckling in the original water source where you found it.Release the duckling early in the morning. Let the duckling make its own way into the water and into the company of other ducks in the area.

Check chicken droppings for signs of worms.,
Send the feces to a veterinarian if your chickens are losing weight or having other problems and you don’t see signs of worms in their feces.,
Purchase a package of food-grade diatomaceous earth.,
Add 1/4 cup of diatomaceous earth per 35 oz.,
Repeat for four or five days to create an unattractive environment for parasitic worms.,
Treat the worms with vet-prescribed medication if chickens aren’t wormed in a week.",How to Worm Chickens1," Many types of worms show up in the feces. Others create dirty or poopy eggs.


If only some of your chickens seem to have worms, it is still likely that they will give the worms to the other chickens, so it is a good idea to treat the whole flock.;
, They could have larger internal parasites that don’t leave through the feces.

, It is sold in the form of a fine white powder at most ranch feed stores and online.

, of feed. Mix it thoroughly. Feed it to your chickens as you normally would.Diatomaceous earth is food safe for pets. However, humans should not breathe in the powder.

, You can also do this for one day every three to four months as a preventative measure.

, Diatomaceous earth doesn’t effectively treat every type of chicken worm.

Remove the waste.,
Train the chickens to roost.,
Use absorbent bedding.,
Clean up leftover food.,
Adjust the coop.,
Avoid using manure and composting chicken litter.,
Grow carnivorous plants.,
Add a herb bedding mix to the coop.,
Set up fly traps.",How to Reduce Flies in a Chicken Coop," Let's face it, flies are attracted to chicken poo. If the poo build up is really bad then you may want to clean up more regularly. Faeces in the garden can simply be hosed down.;
, Roosting is actually one way for the chickens to reduce mess and make clean up easier. If you haven't done already, install roosting poles. Chickens that tend to the nesting boxes and floor at night should be shooed to the roosting poles when you go to secure the coop.

, Wood shavings usually do the trick whilst hay, straw and newspaper isn't as effective. Although sand isn't the most recommended or absorbent bedding, it actually helps to dry the poo out. Opt for this option if you can.

, Dry chicken mix doesn't have to be cleaned up to reduce flies but other sweet treats do such as fruits. Flies are attracted to sweet fruits such as watermelon, strawberries and apple. After the chickens are finished with their food, clean it up.

, Flies are attracted to moist, warm areas. Low ventilation, leakage from the roof and spills from the drinker will help cause the perfect living space for flies. Do your best to avoid this by making a few adjustments:


Make sure the coop has high ventilation. Ventilation is the air flow so that the coop doesn't get too humid or stuffy. If the weather gets really hot you can install a fan or cut in some windows which draws in some light too.
Fix any leaks hidden in the roof. You can tell when the roof leaks after a rainy day and the coop has some wet spots or it's drenched. Any leaks could be due to holes in the roof so give it a good inspection. Another reason could be if you have shingles and they haven't been laid out properly - you can get a handy man to come over and fix this or fix it yourself.
Reduce spillage from the drinkers. You can do this by hanging them above the ground or making the bar around the edges bigger so that the water doesn't spill over.

, Flies are attracted to these odors. If you really don't need the composting system or extra fertiliser; don't use it.


Another option is to move the composting system as far away from the coop as possible. That means there will be less flies around the coop but they may relocate to where the compost bin is.

, These plants feast on flies. It might not be the most effective solution but they do catch flies now and then. They also grow very big and can be bought at your gardening store. It's worth a shot.

, Online chicken stores do make and deliver a herb mix suited for chickens. You simply add this mix to the nesting boxes and bedding and it repels the flies.

, Fly traps may have a nasty oder and aren't great to look at beside the coop but they do work. They help attract flies and then kill them for good. If you don't mind spending a bit of money, head to your local warehouse store.

Provide your ducks with non-medicated poultry food.,
Keep fresh drinking water out at all times.,
Clean out the duck shed daily.",How to Take Care of Ducks2," Ducks will eat frequently throughout the day. Rather than establishing a specific feeding time, allow them constant access to food. Domesticated ducks typically eat pellet mash. You can also feed your ducks chopped vegetables and worms (of any variety) as the occasional treat.You should be able to buy a good-quality poultry feed at your local pet store or farm-supply store.
Do not give your ducks medicated food. This type of poultry food is engineered to be given to hens in a poultry farm to stop the spread of disease. Feeding medicated food to your ducks could harm their health.

, Ducks need constant access to water. Not only do they drink about 1 liter (0.25 gallons) of water a day, but they also need water to help them swallow and digest their food.Provide the ducks with water in a metal dish, and place this next to a similar dish containing the ducks’ pellet mash food.


If the ducks have immediate access to a pond or lake in their enclosure, they will be less reliant on you to provide them with drinking water.

, Ducks are messy, unclean animals; they defecate frequently and, unlike cats and dogs, cannot be trained to use one specific area for their bathroom. In order to keep the ducks’ shed clean and to maintain their good health, you’ll need to scoop out all of the duck feces from the floor of their living area. Also, change their food and water and wash the shed walls as necessary.Cleaning the shed is even more important in the winter, since ducks will be spending more time inside of the shed and less time outside. You may need to clean the shed multiple times a day.
The more ducks you have, the more often you will need to clean the shed.

"
"
Allow your ducks to socialize.,
Give your ducks daily access to a body of water.,
Allow your ducks to forage in a garden.,
Provide your ducks with toys to play with.",How to Take Care of Ducks3," Ducks are highly social animals, and will become lonely, sad, and unhealthy if deprived of other ducks’ company. Give your ducks plenty of time during the day to socialize, eat, and (if they’re juveniles) play together.If you’re acquiring ducks for the first time, never adopt just one. Always buy or adopt at least two ducks so they can keep one another company.


If you’re adopting the ducks as young ducklings, it will be challenging to identify the gender of the ducks. If you’re hoping for a male and female pairing, you may be disappointed.

, While ducks do need water to drink and eat their food with, they also need a deeper body of water to groom themselves in. Ducks love to swim and it keeps them clean. If the ducks don’t already have a small pond or lake within their enclosure, you can shepherd them to a nearby pond on your property.Ducks will also groom themselves in available water in order to keep their feathers, bills, eyes, and other body parts clean. Consequently, the water set out needs to be deep enough for them to fully submerge themselves in.
The pond or body of water should be at least 8 inches (20 cm) deep. While a small plastic “kiddie” pool will technically fulfill the ducks’ needs, they will be able to exercise more if given a larger pool or actual pond to swim in.

, If you have a garden near your house, you can let your ducks freely roam through it. Ducks enjoy eating grass found in gardens, and will also root around in your mulch to find worms and insect larvae. This will supplement the ducks’ diet, satisfy their natural curiosity, and provide them with entertainment.On the other hand, if you don’t want ducks to get into your garden and eat greens and vegetables, you may need to erect a fence around the garden to keep inquisitive ducks out.

, Ducks are intelligent and naturally curious, and will be interested in playing with small objects. Set a small stuffed animal or a ball inside the ducks’ enclosure, and over time, they’ll start to pick up and play with the toy. If you want to play with the ducks, try rolling a toy ball towards them.Make sure that any toys you provide are safe for the ducks to play with. Don’t give them any toys that have small parts that the ducks may swallow.

Talk to a veterinarian about worming your ducks.,
Inspect your ducks’ feet for injuries or ulcers.,
Watch for wing injuries.",How to Take Care of Ducks4," Ducks tend to be healthy pets and have relatively few medical problems. However, ducks may contract various forms of internal (intestinal) and external worms. On average, domestic ducks need to go through a de-worming procedure once every 6 months.Speak with your veterinarian, and ask if they recommend a specific product that you can use at home.


Regular swimming can help keep ducks healthy by allowing them to wash mites and other intestinal worms out of their feathers. If your ducks do not have access to adequate water, they will be more likely to contract mites or worms.

, Ducks’ feet are sensitive and tender, and can be damaged from walking on rough surfaces. Look at your ducks’ feet every couple of weeks—if you notice any “ulcers” (which cause sores, swelling, or limping), take your duck to the veterinarian.To help protect your ducks’ feet, cover the floor of their shed with a generous layer of straw or rice hulls. Avoid letting your ducks walk on bare concrete or cement.

, Ducks tend to be clumsy animals, and can easily damage their wings by running or flying into an immovable object in their environment. Regularly look for any ducks that seem to be favoring one wing, or that have a wing sticking away from their body at an odd angle. If you find that a duck has injured or broken a wing, take the animal to the vet immediately.Juvenile ducklings can easily damage their wings while learning to fly, since juveniles are unsteady and inexperienced flyers."

Administer the veterinarian-prescribed medication.,
Treat every three weeks if worms recur.,
Change the landscape of your chicken coop and run if you find that worms are a common problem.,
Don’t eat the eggs for seven to 14 days, depending upon the medication label.",How to Worm Chickens2," Your vet should tell you what type of worms they had and the best medication for effective treatment.

, Purchase enough for your chickens online or through the vet. In some countries you don’t need a prescription for 1 percent Flubenvet.

, Mix Flubenvet into food. 60g is enough to treat 20 chickens. Administer Solubenol by mixing it with the chickens’ water. Apply other types of prescription wormers directly to the skin or the beak., Many people move to a treatment every six months to prevent or treat worms at the beginning and end of the hot summer months., You can prevent worms by making the habitat less friendly to bacteria and parasites.

, One percent Flubenvet and diatomaceous earth do not require you to throw out the eggs during treatment.

Cut a viewing portal in the cooler's lid.,
Test the incubator.,
Put in your chicken eggs.,
Keep track of time and vital statistics.,
Rotate the eggs.,
Candle the eggs after the first week.,
Listen for the sounds of the chicks starting to hatch.",How to Make a Simple Homemade Incubator for Chicks," The hole will contain the light bulb and its socket. Insert the socket from any lamp and put in a 25 watt bulb.Place duct tape around the hole and the socket from inside and outside the cooler. This is very important in order to reduce the risk of fire.


You can also use a small box, but a styrofoam cooler works well because it is insulated.;
, Using chicken mesh or some other hard wire mesh, partition off the side of the cooler where the light bulb sits. Doing this is important to protect the chicks from getting burned.


Optional: Create a false bottom using chicken mesh a little above the floor of the cooler. This will make cleaning out the chicken poop easier once the chicks hatch.

, Place it on the side where the eggs will be. Since the main function of an incubator is to keep the temperature and humidity inside it at an optimal level, be sure that the thermometer/gauge has a high rate of accuracy..

, This will be your humidity source. Put in a sponge, too, so that you can adjust the amount of water easily.

, Using the glass from a picture frame, determine how big the opening needs to be. It should be a little smaller than the dimensions of the glass. Then secure the glass by using duct tape to fasten it in the opening.


Optional: Make a hinge for the cooler's lid by attaching it to one side of the top with duct tape.

, Before putting in the eggs, turn on the light and monitor the temperature and the humidity for a day or so.Make adjustments to the heat and humidity until they are at optimal levels. The temperature should be kept at 99.5 degrees through-out the incubation. Optimal humidity varies: it should be between 40 to 50 percent for the first 18 days and 65 to 75 percent during the last four.


To reduce the temperature, punch holes in the sides of the cooler. If it gets too low after you do that, tape up some of the holes with duct tape.
For the humidity, sponge up some of the water to reduce it and squeeze out more water to increase it.

, It's important to find fertilized eggs: store-bought eggs will not work. If you don't have any chickens and a rooster yourself, a good way to find fertilized eggs is to contact local farmers. Cluster the eggs close together, as this helps them maintain a constant temperature.


The quality of the eggs depends on the health of the chickens they came from. Therefore, before purchasing eggs from a farm, ask the manager if you can inspect the facility. Free-range hens are almost always healthier than caged hens.
An optimal hatching rate is between 50 and 85 percent.Laying hens are usually smaller in size and are bred to produce eggs. Meat hens, on the other hand, are bred for size. They tend to be larger birds that grow relatively quickly. However, there are chickens that are bred as dual-purpose birds. Ask the farmers you contact which varietythey breed.

, Chicken eggs take 21 days to hatch, so it's important to know the exact day you put them in the incubator. Also, keep track of the humidity and temperature readings.

, Turn the eggs one quarter to half a turn three times daily for the first 18 days. You want to turn then so that one side faces down and the other up. Mark one side of each egg with ""X"" and the other side with an ""O"" to keep track of which side is facing up.

, Candling allows you to detect infertile and bad eggs. It involves holding an egg against a bright light in a dark room to see inside. You can purchase a candling device, but for most situations, a small, bright flashlightwill do. If you find any bad or infertile eggs, remove them from the incubator.


If you use a flashlight, its lens should be the small enough so that the light is directed at the egg.
Another way to make a homemade candleris to insert a desk lamp inside a cardboard box with a small round hole cut at the top. Put the egg in this hole to candle it.
You may have to gently turn the egg up and down or from side to side to better see its contents.
A living embryoappears as a dark spot with blood vessels radiating out from it.
A dead embryo can show up as a ring or a streak of blood inside the shell.
Infertile eggs light up bright and even since there is no embryo inside.

, On the 21st day, the chicks will ""pip"" their shells in order to breathe after bursting the air sacks. Watch them carefully after this point. It can take up to twelve hours after ""pipping"" for a chick to fully emerge from its shell.


If some of the chicks haven't concluded their hatching after twelve hours, go ahead and remove the tops of those eggs.

Check immediately.,
Pick up the chick.,
Evacuate the chick's bowels.,
Lift the vent.,
Spread open the remainder of the vent.,
Check for the sex organ.,
Return the chick.",How to Sex Rhode Island Red Chicks1," Vent sexing must be done within the first day or two after a chick hatches.


As the chick eats and grows, its lower digestive tract will distend, blocking the rudimentary sex organ from view. For that reason, you need to check before the chick has much opportunity to grow.;
, Use your non-dominant hand to carefully catch and hold the chick so that its underside faces you.


Ideally, you should be able to hold the neck of the chick in between your middle and ring fingers while holding the legs of the chick in between your ring finger and pinky.
Regardless of how you hold the chick, you must be able to keep it still and secure without applying too much pressure.

, Apply gentle pressure to the chick's lower abdomen using the thumb of your non-dominant hand. Doing so should cause the intestinal tract to empty.


Keep things cleaner by evacuating the contents of the chick's intestines into a disposable container.
As you squeeze, a small amount of feces should drop into the waste bin. Ridding the intestines of waste is necessary if you want to get a clear view of the vent.

, Carefully use your non-dominant thumb to press the edge of the chick's vent up. Continue pressing until the interior border of the vent is directed and secured toward the neck.


The ""vent"" of a chick is the hole through which feces exit.
You need to work carefully since applying too much force can damage the chick's intestines.

, Using the thumb and index finger of your dominant hand, fold down the other half of the vent to fully expose the interior of the chick.


You'll need to fold the bottom half of the vent toward the chick's abdomen. Hold it in place with a firm yet gentle pinch.

, Peer into the opened vent and look for the male sex organ. If you are unable to find it, the chick is likely female.The rudimentary male sex organ, formally called the ""male process,"" should look like a small, semi-transparent bulb. It is located within the second of three folds inside the vent cavity. Additionally, it should look separate from the surrounding tissue.
Female chicks, on the other hand, usually have a mild depression or swelling in the same area.
If your eyes are good enough, you might be able to do this using nothing but the naked eye. If you have difficulty seeing the interior vent in detail, though, you might need to use a wearable magnifier while checking.
Also note that approximately one out of every five male chicks are not clearly identifiable, usually because the male process of these chicks is more difficult to spot.

, As soon as you complete the check, release your grip on the vent and allow it to close again. You can then return the chick to an upright position and release it.


Work quickly since holding onto the chick for too long can cause more feces to drop.
Since this process can be difficult for novices to perform, you should consider getting professional training before attempting it.

"
"
Check early.,
Hold the chick steady.,
Gently stretch the wing.,
Examine the feather size.,
Look at the color.,
Release the chick.",How to Sex Rhode Island Red Chicks2," You should perform feather sexing within the first ten days of a chick's life.


Feather development usually evens out by the tenth day regardless of gender, so beyond that point, you may not notice any difference in wing feather size or color.

, Pick up the chick with your non-dominant hand, keeping a firm yet gentle grip around it.


The exact placement of your fingers does not matter much, but you need access to at least one wing. You also need to make sure that you have a firm enough grip to prevent the chick from dropping as it moves.

, Carefully pinch the outer edge of the chick's wing, lifting it away from the body in a natural direction.


You don't need to extend the wing to its full length, but you need a complete view of the chick's pinfeathers.

, In many cases, male chicks will have even rows of pinfeathers, while female chicks will have pinfeathers that alternate between long and short.


Feather size is only an accurate determination of sex if the chicks have been bred with this trait in mind. It is not an entirely accurate method, even though it does work with most chicks.

, Male chicks have a white spot on the down over the web of the wing, but female chicks do not have this spot.This spot may only be visible within the first few days. After the down is shed, it will disappear.
Since the size of the spot varies greatly, it might be difficult to see, leading to some inaccuracy.

, After checking the wing feathers, release the wing and return the chick to its proper place.

"
"
Understand the principle.,
Consider the breeding.,
Look at the color of the down.",How to Sex Rhode Island Red Chicks3," Sexing a chick based on sex-linked crosses will require a basic understanding of genetics.


Feather coloring is a genetic characteristic passed down through the sex-determining chromosomes of the parent chickens.
The mother hen will contribute one sex chromosome to the offspring and the father rooster will contribute the other. With poultry, the sex of the resulting offspring is determined by the mother's chromosome. Females carry a Z and W chromosome, while males carry two Z chromosomes.
As such, if the mother hen contributes a Z chromosome, the chick will end up with two Z chromosomes and will be male. If the mother contributes a W chromosome, the chick will have a Z and W pair, resulting in a female.
The feather color, along with the sex, will be determined by the mother hen based on the chromosome she passes down.

, Since Rhode Island Red chickens do not have an independent sex-linked coloration trait, the color of a chick's down will only be indicative of its sex when Rhode Island Red roosters are bred with hens of another breed.


As a result, you can only use the sex-linked method of sexing chicks if you know the breeds of both parents, and if those breeds are compatible with the process.
The Rhode Island Red parent must always be the father rooster.
There are several different breeds the mother hen can be, but in general, they will need to be silver, penciled, or barred breeds.

, Look at the down coloration of each chick. You should be able to make a judgment without even handling the chick.If the mother is a barred hen of some type, she will produce male chicks that are black or dark brown with a white spot on the head and female chicks with solid black or dark brown down.
If the mother is a silver or penciled breed, she will produce male chicks that are either silver, cream, white, or smoky in color. The female chicks will be gold, buff, or red.

Give it time.,
Look at the appearance of the developing chick.,
Watch the chick's behavior.",How to Sex Rhode Island Red Chicks4," If you aren't in a rush to sex your chicks, you can wait until they grow enough to develop adult sex traits.


You should be able to notice adult traits within three to four weeks.Since many of the other sexing methods require you to act quickly, this is also a good option if you get the chicks well after the initial sexing window has passed.
This is also the easiest way to determine sex for beginners.

, The first trait you'll likely notice will be the comb. Male chicks develop combs within three the six weeks.


Additionally, male chicks tend to develop feathers in patchy clusters, while female chicks develop feathers more evenly.
Male chicks also tend to produce more pointed tail feathers. Female chicks, on the other hand, generally have broad, rounded feathers.
Most male chicks also develop larger feet and thicker legs than the average female chick has. This trait can be difficult to spot in young chicks but becomes increasingly more obvious as the chicks continue to age.

, Male chicks demonstrate bolder, more aggressive behavior than most female chicks.


Male chicks can begin crowing within six weeks, but female chicks will only make soft clucking noises.
When startled, male chicks tend to stand their ground and give a sharp warning chirp. Females are more likely to scatter or crouch down.
Also remember that only females lay eggs. The timeline for egg laying will vary, but females can begin laying eggs within 16 to 24 weeks.

Check local regulations on keeping chickens.,
Decide what chicken breeds to keep.,
Decide how many to buy.,
Make space for the chickens before you bring them home.",How to Look After Baby Chicks1," Most communities permit keeping chickens, but there may be zoning codes you should follow. You may need to get a permit or a signed agreement from neighbors before you're allowed to set up a coop.Each state and local municipality have slightly different codes, so be sure to check up on the laws in your area before making any purchases. Check your local homeowner association rules.


Some communities limit the number of chickens you can keep. There may also be a limit on the size of the coop you can have in your yard.
Others limit the number of crowing chickens, or roosters, you're allowed to have. This is more common in areas that are densely populated.;
, Chicks might look the same when they're little, but different breeds grow up to have very different qualities. Some chickens are great egg layers, others have sweet pet-like personalities, and still others are good if you want chicken meat. Do some research to find out which breeds to get before starting your coop.


For example, if you want a breed that reliably produces good eggs, choose a layer breed. Rhode Island Reds, Buff Orpington, and Australorp are all layer breeds.If you're interested in chickens that lay eggs and provide good meat, you need a dual-purpose breed such as Silver Laced Wyandottes, Ameraucana and New Hampshire.Broiler chickens are raised primarily for meat. These include Jumbo Cornish Cross and Heavy Man Special.

, Chickens are a flock animal and perform better in flocks of at least 6 or more, so it's a good idea to get more than one. A healthy chicken will typically lay 1 egg each cycle (about 1 egg every 25 hours) five or six eggs per week, so keep that in mind when you're deciding how many to get. Most small coops start with four to six chickens. If one falls ill or gets eaten by a predator, you'll still have plenty of chickens to produce eggs.


Once you know how many you want, you can choose to buy them from a disease-free licensed hatchery, reputable breeder or at your local farm store in small quantities. If you want to order them from a mail-order catalog, you may have to purchase a minimum number of 20 or 25 chicks.
Unless you're prepared to raise a rooster, make sure you get all female chicks. Roosters can sometimes be aggressive, however they are no more difficult to take care of than hens. Roosters don't lay eggs.
If you want to see the chicks hatch from eggs, different preparations are necessary. See How to Hatch Chicken Eggs for more information.

, For the first two months, your chickens will live in a brooder. This is a small box or cage that can be kept indoors at a controlled temperature. Once they're fully feathered the chicks can be moved to an outdoor coop with a yard for them to roam.


The coop structure will need to be six to eight feet tall. It should be wide enough to accommodate side-by-side nesting boxes for your birds. Each box will be about 10 inches wide.A good rule of thumb is to plan for four square feet of yard space per bird. This is enough room for the birds to roam comfortably. Of course, if you have more space, the birds will appreciate having a bigger yard to explore."

Give chicks their first vaccinations at the right time.,
Do not give vaccines to chickens who are laying eggs.The risk of the virus being shed via the oviduct into the egg, and then taken off site where it could pose an infection risk to other birds, is too high when you vaccinate chickens while they are laying eggs.,
Be aware of which vaccines need to be given annually.,
Check the overall health of your chickens before you vaccinate.,
Check and record the vaccination information.,
Double check that the vaccine has been stored correctly.,
Gather all of your materials.,
Sterilize the spot where you plan to inject the vaccination.",How to Vaccinate Chickens1," Different vaccines generally need to be given at different times in a chicken’s life. Most vaccines are given soon after the chicks have hatched. Always talk to a veterinarian before vaccinating if you have never vaccinated a chicken before.Listed below is a general guide for the most common vaccinations and when they should be given:


E.Coli: Given at one day-old.
Marek’s Disease: Given at a day-old to 3 weeks of age.
Infectious Bursal Disease (Gumboro disease): Given from 10 – 28 days old.
Infectious Bronchitis: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age.
Newcastle Disease: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age.
Adenovirus: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age.
Salmonellosis: Given at day old to 16 weeks of age.
Coccidiosis: Given at day-old to 9 days.
Infectious Laryngotracheitis: From 4 weeks of age on.;
,


Most vaccine manufacturers recommend giving vaccinations to adult birds at least 4 weeks before the hen starts laying. This ensures that the recipient is no longer shedding virus and does not therefore pose a risk of indirect transmission via the egg to birds at a different location.

, Some vaccines need an annual booster shot to make sure that they are still effectively guarding against the virus they are designed to fight. Other vaccines only need to be given once and will provide lifelong protection.Vaccines that need an annual booster: Infectious Bronchitis, Newcastle Disease, Adenovirus (Egg Drop Syndrome), Salmonella.

Vaccines that do not need a booster: Marek’s Disease, Infectious Bursal Disease, Coccidiosis, Infectious Laryngotracheitis

, You do not want to vaccinate sick birds, as the virus might be too strong and may kill them. The best way to tell if you should vaccinate or not is to have a veterinarian inspect the chickens to make sure they are healthy.


At the same time, the veterinarian can talk to you about the best way to vaccinate your specific chickens.

, It is very important that you check to make sure you have the right vaccine, right dosage, and understand the best way to give the chicken that vaccine. Double check you have all of the correct information and write down all of the information, including:


Vaccine name.
Lot number.
Manufacturer.
Production date.
Expiration date.
Which chicken is receiving what vaccine.

, If the vaccine is supposed to be stored at a specific temperature or in a specific location, it is important to check that the storage has not been compromised in any way.


If you notice any cracks, or the temperature is not at the right level, you will have to cancel the vaccination and order another round of the vaccine through your veterinarian.

, The following sections in this article discuss different ways you can vaccinate your chicken. Each method can only be applied to specific kinds of vaccinations so you should always make sure you are doing the right kind of procedure. Once you have double checked that you know what you are doing, gather all of your materials so you can have them on hand when you are vaccinating the chickens.


Some vaccination methods require that you have one or two other people helping you so assemble a team if this is the case with your vaccination method.

, If you are planning on using a syringe and needle to get the chicken her vaccination, you should sterilize the spot where you plan to do it. To sterilize the skin soak a cotton wool ball in surgical spirit (such as rubbing alcohol), part the feathers over the injection site and swab the skin.

Set up a chicken brooder.,
Prepare the brooder floor.,
Install a lamp and monitor the temperature.,
Provide food and water.,
Play with your chicks.",How to Look After Baby Chicks2," A brooder is a small box that your chicks will live in for the first few months. During this time they're still growing their adult feathers, so they need to be kept in a warm, secure environment for protection. The brooder should be kept inside your garage, laundry room or another safe indoor area.


A sturdy cardboard or plastic box works well as a brooder. You can also get a special wooden chicken brooder from a farm supply store if you prefer.
After a week or two, place a low perch in the brooder, such as a thin bar or stick. The chicks will learn to practice hopping up on the perch.

, You'll need to add soft, comfortable flooring that can easily be changed out every few days. Pet litter made from pine shavings works well. You could also use shredded newspaper in a pinch, but the ink can stain the fuzzy chicks. Do not use slippery computer paper or glossy paper to line the floor.


The litter should be changed every few days to keep the chicks from getting sick. Chicks are prone to diseases that can easily spread in dirty conditions.
If the floor of the brooder is wire, be sure to cover it with solid cardboard or wood to keep the chicks' feet from slipping through.

, Chicks can die if they get too cold or too hot, so it's essential to buy a lamp or a brood heater for your brooder so you can keep them at the ideal temperature. A light bulb with a reflector should provide the right amount of heat, but always check with a thermometer. You can use a 100 watt red bulb or a red heat lamp (avoid using bright lights). Affix the lamp to the top of the brooder along with a thermometer you can use to monitor the temperature.


The temperature should be kept between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first week of the chicks' lives. After that, you can reduce it by five degrees each week. Keep doing so until the chicks have developed their feathers after about five to eight weeks.
Adjust the heat by raising or lowering the light or changing the wattage of the bulb.
If the chicks are panting or pressed against the sides of the brooder, that is a sign that they are too hot, and you need to turn down the heat. If they are huddled together under the light, they may be too cold.

, You'll need to buy a special chick feed called crumbles at your local farm supply store. This feed meets all the nutritional needs of a chick under two months old. You can buy either medicated or non medicated crumbles. Provide fresh food at all times in a shallow metal or plastic bowl. Provide fresh water in a shallow bowl as well.


Medicated feed contains medication to help prevent disease from spreading. If you choose unmedicated feed, be sure to clean the brooder frequently and pay close attention to your chicks' health.
Make sure the water is changed daily. If it looks soiled, change it even more frequently.
Chicks are allowed snacks such as worms or bugs (except cockroaches) from the garden. Avoid giving them any human food until they grow older.

, Getting your chicks used to your presence from the time they are babies will help you coexist later on. Bring the chicks out of their brooder to play once a day or more. Pet them, let them prance in the grass, and help them get used to being handled.


Make sure you don't leave the chicks unattended. A cat or another predator could snatch them away if you aren't careful.
Handle the chicks gently. They have fragile bodies and should not be dropped or squeezed. Make sure children know how to handle them properly.

"
"
Move the chicks to their outdoor coop.,
Provide food and water.,
Clean the coop regularly.,
Play with the chickens.,
Collect eggs regularly.",How to Look After Baby Chicks3," When the chicks are at least two months old or have grown their wing feathers, they will be ready to move outside to their larger coop. Ready-made coops can be purchased from farm supply stores, or you can build your own. A coop should provide shelter from inclement weather, protection from predators, and a cozy place to sleep. Make sure it has the following features:An elevated, enclosed roost. The coop should have a place for the hens to sleep comfortably several feet from the ground. Chickens naturally prefer to roost off of the ground when they sleep, since this protects them from predators.
Nesting boxes. In the roosting area, make sure each chicken has a separate box about 10 inches wide in which to lay its eggs. Line the boxes with straw or wood shavings. Larger nesting boxes can fit more than one chicken.
Space for the chickens to run. Chickens are happiest when they have space to run around and forage. The coop should have a door leading to an outside area that's at least four by eight feet for three to five chickens. The chickens will be safest if the area is fenced on both sides an overhead (to protect from hawks). The holes in the fencing should be no larger than 1 inch squared., Now that the chickens are over two months old, start buying ""laying mash"" (also called ""poultry pellet"") so they have the nutrients they need to lay eggs. It's available at the farm supply store. You can feed older chickens organic kitchen leftovers, fruits and vegetables, and garden weeds as well. Put the feed in a chicken feeder that you clean out once every week and a half.


Chickens like raw fruit and vegetables of all kinds, cooked pasta, cooked rice, cooked beans, and any other type of grain.Don't feed them food that's high in fat or salt.
Put a bowl of sand or finely crushed eggshells in the coop. The chickens use it to digest their food, since they don't have teeth to grind it up. Eggshells also provide extra calcium.
Provide water in a chicken waterer. In the winter, you may need to use a heated waterer to prevent the water from freezing.

, The straw in the nesting boxes and the floor shavings should be shoveled out and replaced with fresh materials every week and a half or so. Every four months, clean out the entire coop by shoveling out the waste, spraying it down with a hose, letting it dry out, and adding fresh bedding. Neglecting to do this could lead to diseases spreading in the coop.

, Even as young adults, chickens like to be around humans. Name them, pick them up, and pet them. You can feed chickens by hand to help build trust. After awhile, your chickens may come when you call, just as a dog would. Many people find that chickens make intelligent and fun-loving pets.

, Hens, also called pullets, will start laying eggs between 20 and 24 weeks of age. Depending on the breed, most hens lay five or six eggs a week through the spring, summer and into the fall. When the daylight drops below 12 hours, the egg production will also drop off.Collect eggs daily to encourage more production. Don't leave eggs sitting in the roosting boxes for too long.
Hens will produce eggs for an excess of 8 years under ideal and stress-free conditions and when fed a species-specific diet (void of hard grains, flax, fish meal). Most commercially raised egg layers will slow production after about 2 years, but your happy, healthy chickens should be laying eggs for a very long time.

Once finished, place the chicken into a carry crate or kennel, lined with deep, clean, dry bedding.,
After 5-days unwrap the foot.",How to Treat Bumblefoot in Chickens," Chickens (especially free-range) like to fly up at night to roost, scratch, jump, run and dig. A minor splinter, cut or scrape can be an entry point for any bacteria to penetrate, and is usually caused by direct contact with fecal matter or wet bedding.;
, Place it in a mixture of 1/2 gallon distilled, warm water, 5 drops Betadine (or Oregano Oil) and 1/4 cup of Epsom salts until the visible scab has softened.

,, It should be just about 1/4"" outside the circumference of the scab, (do not attempt to remove the scab. It is attached to the heart (AKA: core, kernel, plug) of the Staph infection.

, Position one thumb at either side of the surgical punch (cut/slit), and gently push down (careful not to break or fracture any toes or tiny bones). This is a very painful procedure for the chicken, but the chicken will remain calm.


With continued pressure, the entire staph infection with scab and heart will rise out of the foot. You may notice some blood, but there should never be a stream of blood loss.

, Double check that the entire heart has been removed.


Visual inspection of heart should be either 1. appear dehydrated, solidified or a hardened pus mass. or 2. In the event the pus has not hardened, the visual appearance may be white to yellow, string-like decomposing tissue.
Once infected and dead tissue has been removed and only the remaining, soft, pinkish living tissue is present with some fresh bleeding, prepare the foot for final treatment.

Recognize the danger posed by cold weather.,
Know the symptoms of frostbite for chickens.,
Identify the degree of frostbite your chicken may be facing.,
Recognize the severity of your chicken’s frostbite.",How to Treat Frostbite in Chickens1," Frostbite can be a relatively innocuous discomfort for your chickens, but can also lead to significant health issues. Aside from pain, frostbite can cause disfigurement, reduced mobility, and decreased fertility.Effects on fertility are usually temporary. A rooster suffering from frostbite will have a reduced sperm count and decreased interest in sex. Hens suffering from frostbite will see a drastic reduction in egg production. Fortunately, both sperm and egg production will return to normal once your chicken heals.;
, Frostbite usually first develops on chickens’ toes, comb, or wattle (the fleshly head-dressing and beard equivalent, respectively). Areas that are affected by frostbite may initially feel warm to the touch, but will later turn cold and hard.If you’re wondering whether your chickens may be suffering from frostbite, look for the following symptoms:Color changes, especially blue or black.
Swelling and blisters.
Limping or an inability to stand.
Disinterest in eating or general listlessness.

, The type of treatment you will give your chicken depends on the degree of frostbite they are suffering from. You want to treat chickens affected by frostbite before there is permanent damage to their body tissue, and immediately if there is any evidence of infections.1st degree frostbite will irritate your chickens and make their skin softer, lighter colored, and warm to the touch.
2nd degree frostbite will lead to hard, white skin that feels frozen to the touch. Chickens will also start to suffer from swelling, blisters, and loss of sensation, though will usually not suffer significant tissue damage from 2nd degree frostbite. If you’re chickens are showing these signs, take steps to prevent the worsening of their frostbite, as noted in the section in this article on preventing frostbite.
3rd degree frostbite will lead to skin that feels hard and waxy, is swollen, and has blackened. At this point, permanent tissue and nerve damage has occurred.

, If they go untreated, or are treated too late, frostbitten areas will dry out, shrivel up, and fall off. If free of infection, however, do not rush to treat frostbite that is not getting worse, as it may be effectively protecting flesh underneath the affected area.


Begin treatment as soon as you notice frostbite spreading, or an infection. Crust, weepiness, blood, or puss on or around the affected area require treatment immediately.
Remove chickens suffering from frostbite from other chickens, as others may peck at the injuries.

Prepare the subcutaneous (SC) vaccination.,
Pick your injection site.,
Have an assistant hold the chicken for you.,
Create a tent with the chicken’s skin.,
Insert the needle into the chicken’s skin.,
Inject the vaccine.",How to Vaccinate Chickens2," Let the vaccine heat up to room temperature 12 hours before the vaccination process. Before preparing the mixture, double check that the vaccine you have is meant to be injected subcutaneously. Subcutaneous means that the needle only gets inserted into the chicken’s layer of skin and does not go all the way down into the muscle below the skin.


To prepare the vaccine, follow the instructions that come with the vaccine package.

, SC injections can be given in two spots on a check—the dorsal (or top) part of the chicken’s neck, or in the inguinal fold. The inguinal fold is the pocket created between the abdomen and the thighs.

, It is easier to give an injection if you have both of your hands. The way you hold the chicken will depend on where you are injecting the vaccine.


Neck: Have the assistant hold the chicken so that the chicken's head is facing you. Your assistant must grasp the wings and feet to make sure the chicken is secure.
Inguinal fold: Have your assistant hold the chicken in such a way that the chicken is upside down with her chest facing you. It should look like the chicken is lying on her back in your assistant’s hands.

, While this might sound odd, doing this will help you to insert the needle. Grasp the chicken’s skin at the injection site and lift it up with the fingers and thumb of your non-dominant hand.Neck: Lift the skin midway on top of the neck area using your middle finger, index finger, and thumb. This will create a pocket in between the neck muscles and skin.
Inguinal fold: Again, the inguinal fold is the pocket created between the abdomen and the thighs. Lift the inguinal fold using your fingers, and feel the pocket or space created.

, Inject the needle into the pocket created. Initially there will be resistance, but once the needle has penetrated the skin and entered the subcutaneous space, the needle will pass through very easily. You should feel this initial resistance, followed by smooth movement.If you still feel resistance (like there is something blocking the needle), it means that you may have gone to deep and inserted the needle into muscle. If this is the case, remove the needle and change the angle of your needle so that it goes more shallowly into the chicken’s skin.

, Once you have inserted the needle correctly, press down on the plunger and inject the chicken with vaccine. Make sure that all of the vaccine gets injected and that the needle has not come out on the other side of the fold of skin you are holding on to.

"
"
Prepare the intramuscular vaccination.,
Have an assistant hold the chicken down on a table.,
Locate the keel bone.,
Insert the needle at a 45 degree angle.,
Push the plunger down on the syringe and inject the vaccine.",How to Vaccinate Chickens3," Intramuscular (IM) means that the needle you will use gets injected into the chicken’s muscle. The breast muscle is the best site for injecting this sort of vaccination. Follow the instructions that come with the vaccine to make sure that you prepare it correctly.

, It is easiest to give this injection when the chicken it placed on a table. Have your assistant grab the hocks and legs of the chicken with one hand, while the other hand grasps both wings at the base while the chicken is lying on her side.

, The keel bone is the bone that divides the chicken’s breast. You will want to inject the vaccine in a spot that is 1 to 1 ½ inches to the side of the keel bone. This is the largest part of the breast muscle, which makes it easy to inject the vaccine into., Holding the needle at a 45 degree angle and inserting it into the chicken will help to make sure that the needle reaches the muscle below the skin. Check to make sure that there isn’t any bleeding.If you notice that the spot is bleeding, you have hit a vein or artery. Remove the needle and try a different spot.

, Make sure that none of the vaccine spills out while you are injecting it. Once all of the vaccine has been injected, remove the needle from the chicken.

"
"
Use an eyedropper for respiratory vaccines.,
Prepare the vaccine solution by diluting it.,
Attach the eye dropper to the vaccine vial or bottle.,
Have an assistant hold the chicken and apply the vaccine.",How to Vaccinate Chickens4," This route is tedious but is the most effective and surest way to administer a respiratory vaccine. This route is more commonly used in breeders (chickens used to produce chicks), layers (chickens used for their eggs), and when you only have a small number of chickens to vaccinate.

, Open the vaccine vial or bottle and dilute it by using a syringe with 3 ml of diluent (this syringe and diluent comes with the vaccine). Make sure that the temperature of the diluent is 2 to 8 C°.To make sure that the diluent is always cold, always carry an ice box with ice, and place the vaccine vial and diluent in it.
If you are going to vaccinate a lot of birds, you can divide the diluted vaccine into two or three clean bottles and keep them on ice. That way, the vaccine will stay at the right temperature.

, Gently shake the vaccine vial several times before attaching the dropper. Once shaken, attach the eye dropper that should come with the vial or bottle containing the vaccine.

The eye dropper will appear different, depending on whether or not you use a vial or bottle. However, you should be able to attach them by pulling them over the lip or the container or twisting them on.

, Grab the bird’s head and slightly twist it so that her eye is facing you. Drop 0.03ml of the vaccine in the chicken’s eye and wait for a few seconds. Taking a moment to wait will ensure that the vaccine is absorbed by the eye and flows through the nostrils."
"
Use this method if you have a watering system in your hen house.,
Make sure that your watering system is clean.,
Stop running the water prior to vaccinating your chickens.,
Calculate the amount of water to be used by the birds over the course of two hours.,
Stabilize the water if you use a manual drinker.,
Let the water start running again so that the chickens can be vaccinated.",How to Vaccinate Chickens5," This vaccine method should also really only be used if you have a commercial chicken farm, as only vaccinating a small amount of chickens this way will waste a lot of vaccine.

, It is very important that you watering system be clean but also free of chlorine. Stop running chlorine and other medications through your watering system at least 48 hours before planning on vaccinating your chickens., In order to make sure that you chickens actually drink the water that contains the vaccine, you should stop running water to the chickens for a period of time before the vaccination process.


Withdraw water 30 to 60 minutes before vaccination for hot climates, and 60 to 90 minutes for cold climates.

, As a rough guide the water consumption in liters for 2 hours can be calculated by multiplying the number of chickens by their age, and then multiplying that number by two.


For example: 40,000 birds at 14 days of age would mean 40 x 14 x 2 = 1,120 liters (295.9 US gal) of water for 2 hours.
If you have a proportioner hooked up to your water system, add another step to the equation. For houses with proportioners with 2% injection rate prepare the vaccine solution in a bucket with 50 liters (13.2 US gal) capacity. To do this multiply 2% to the computed water consumption for 2 hours, and place this amount in the bucket, for the example above: 1,120 liters (295.9 US gal) x 0.02 = 22.4 liters (5.9 US gal). Mix the vaccine in this bucket and place the proportioner’s suction hose in this bucket.

, Stabilize the water by placing 500 grams of skim milk for every 200 liters (52.8 US gal) of water, or by using chlorine neutralizers like Cevamune® at 1 tablet for every 100 liters (26.4 US gal). For houses with bell drinkers, mix the vaccines in the overhead tank.For automatic drinkers with proportioners use Cevamune® to stabilize the water. For the example used in the previous step, you would need around 11 tablets. This was based on 1,120 liters (295.9 US gal) divided by 100 liters (26.4 US gal) = 11.2 ( 1 tablet for every 100 liters ). Mix these tablets in the pale with the 22.4 liters (5.9 US gal) of water (from the example above).

, When the water is back on, the chickens will start to drink. In this way, they will receive their vaccinations. Try to get the chickens to drink all of the vaccine water within one to two hours. Do not put chlorine or other medications back into the water for at least 24 hours.


For houses with manual or basin drinkers, equally divide the vaccine solution in the basins or drinkers. For houses with bell drinkers, just open the over head tanks to let the birds drink. For houses with automatic nipple lines, just open the valves.

Provide a constant supply of water.,
Make sure the coop is well ventilated.,
Provide plenty of shade.,
Place frozen blocks or water bottles around the run.,
Give the chickens cold treats.,
Hose down the run.,
Provide sand for dust bathing.",How to Keep Chickens Cool in Hot Weather," Refill the water source every day and consider getting a drinker. A drinker is different from the usual bowl. It can hold more water and automatically refill the drinker - though keep in mind you'll still need to refill the drinker, just less often.


Make sure the water is cold. Consider keeping a big bottle of water in the fridge for when you have to refill the water source. This way the water can stay cold.
Keep more than one water source. Also make sure the water is close to the hens and is easily accessible. You might want to make sure the water is under shade or inside the chicken coop.
Consider keeping sprinklers in/around the chickens run. This is a great way for the chickens to cool off and it's guaranteed they'll love it. It's also good for the grass.;
, No body likes a stuffy home - the same goes for chickens! Make sure enough air goes through. A coop that isn't ventilated is bad for the chickens and can cause problems in them.


Fans can be installed in the coop if the weather gets really bad. A lot of chicken owners have been known to install fans in the coop and have said it helps a lot. Try to install the fan in the nesting areas.

, The coop should be accessible to the chickens. If the chickens have no shade outside move a table or bench there for the chickens. In the future consider planting a tree there or moving the chickens to an area with trees and bushes.

, If you fill a small tub (eg. icecream tub) or a large plastic bottle with water and let it freeze overnight, you can later on chuck it in the chickens run. The chickens will lay beside the frozen blocks and water bottles as a cooling method.

, This includes frozen fruits and vegetables or watery types of foods to keep the chickens hydrated. Watermelon is a great treat to give them on those hot days.

, Be sure all the grass, bushes, shrubs, etc are wet. The chickens will love pecking around and laying in the grass. Though try to avoid any mud or sand as this will make the chickens dirty.

, Chickens like to dust bathe in hot weather as it's another cooling method for them. Provide a tub of dry sand or dirt and the chickens should soon begin to bathe in it.

Overnight is when the temperature will be lowest, so it is when your chickens will be most susceptible to frostbite., Before adding anything to your chicken’s comb, make sure they aren’t already suffering from frostbite. You’ll notice because those areas of the comb will be black. You can still apply a covering, but just be careful when applying jelly to this skin, as it will be very sensitive.If you notice frostbite on the skin, treat it where possible. Move your chicken to a warm area. Soak a clean cloth in lukewarm water and hold against the frostbitten areas. Do not use direct heat like a dryer, or rub the comb.Combs do not grow back, so don’t break off the blackened tips. This will cause problems for the chicken in regulating body heat, especially during the summer., Cover the chicken’s wattle and comb liberally with petroleum jelly. Massage the jelly into any exposed red skin around the head. Once you have rubbed some in, leave an extra thick coat onto the comb and wattle.Be very careful to avoid getting any jelly into the birds’ eyes.
If you want a natural alternative to petroleum jelly, consider using olive oil, coconut oil, or a biodegradable product like Waxelene instead., You want to make sure your birds’ combs stay warm, so be prepared to pick them up and touch the skin. If the comb feels dry, you should apply another coat. If it feels oily or greasy, the original coat is still there., Some breeds are better in cold conditions, and you may consider choosing to raise these if you are in a cold climate. When looking for cold-weather birds, focus on breeds with larger bodies and smaller combs. This means more body fat for keeping warm and less exposed skin vulnerable to frostbite.Some of the best breeds for cold weather are Ameraucanas, Ancona, Black Australorps, Black Giant, Blue Andalusian, Brahma, Buff Orpingtons, Cochins, Delaware, Dominique, Langshan, New Hampshire, Plymouth Rocks, Rhode Island Red, Russian Orloff, Speckled Sussex and Wyandottes.

, While you want to avoid having a drafty coop, there should be some air circulation. Add screened windows near the overhang where the walls meet the roof. You can close windows during the night, as long as you remember to open them back up during the day.It is important to keep the coop ventilated, and not sealed, to keep the environment safe. A sealed coop will trap humidity, which can lead to frostbite. You can also get a buildup of ammonia gas from the chickens’ droppings, which will damage their lungs.

, To help prevent frostbite on your chickens’ feet, they should have a roost wide enough for the hens to perch with their bodies covering the tops of their feet and the roost covering the bottom. Installing a 2x4 with the 4” side facing up is a good choice., If you face particularly chilly winters, you may consider putting a small heater in the coop. You don’t want the coop too warm, just a little above freezing. If the coop is too warm, your chickens won’t get used to the cold weather.An electric light bulb is a good option, as it provides heat without being as much of a fire hazard, and will be cheaper to run., You want to reduce moisture in the coop, so don’t allow your chickens to roost in wet bedding, especially in cold weather. Make sure the bedding material is both deep and dry, or else you’ll be dealing with wet conditions, which can quickly lead to disease., Consider adding a little more to your chickens’ diet during the colder weather by supplementing it with corn or scratch. This will help add a little more fat to your animals for better insulation. This doesn’t replace your regular feeding amount, just adds a little bit more., You want to make sure your birds stay hydrated, so keep their water filled and clean. If you notice any ice beginning to form, break it up.Remove any eggs. Chicken eggs are nearly 75 percent water, so if they stay in the coop, they will probably freeze and crack, getting everything wet."
"
Know what not to do.,
Wash the frostbitten areas.,
Treat infection immediately.,
Remove the infected flesh.,
Reintegrate the bird to your flock carefully.",How to Treat Frostbite in Chickens2," It’s important to avoid making a few mistakes that are commonly made when treating chickens for frostbite. First and foremost, don’t overreact – mild cases of frostbite will heal themselves. For more severe cases, be sure to avoid these missteps:Do no massage frozen, frostbitten areas of the chicken.
Do not expose the chicken (or parts of the chicken) to direct or sudden heat. This may further damage the chicken’s nerves.
Do not rupture any unbroken blisters. This increases the risk of infection., If your chicken’s flesh is discolored and swollen, they may be frostbitten. If their feet are frostbitten, they will likely not be able to move their toes, and may not be able to stand. If infected, the swollen parts will feel warm to the touch.Bring the chicken inside, but let it rest in the coldest part of the house to ensure they warm up slowly.
Once the chicken has warmed up somewhat, wash the affected areas with lukewarm water and Epsom salt. Make sure the water is not hot.
Dry the area with clean paper towels.
Place the chicken alone in a box with plenty of towels and ample drinking water.

, If your chicken has an infection, getting rid of the infection is your first priority. After cleaning, consider applying an antibiotic. There are specific antibiotic creams that are safe for birds and available at pet stores and farming suppliers. Your vet can also provide you with antibiotics.


Keep the chicken in an area that is covered in a clean layer of newspapers. Change these papers daily.
If the infected area doesn’t heal in a week, or worsens rapidly, you should consider trimming the infected area or allowing a vet to do so.

, For frostbite on your chicken’s feet, get a vet’s assistance. It is safe for you to remove pieces of your chicken’s comb or wattle flesh are infected. If you’re comfortable doing so, get a clean, sharp pair of scissors, a scalpel, or very sharp knife and clean it with alcohol or antiseptic.


After cleaning the affected area, apply rubbing alcohol to the area you’ll be cutting.
Secure your chicken or have someone hold it. It will likely scream.
Make the incision just inside the infected area (through healthy flesh), taking care to make a straight, decisive cut.
Wipe the area with sterile gauze or cotton, and apply a healthy amount of antibiotic or antiseptic when the bleeding stops.
Clean and reapply antibiotic cream twice a day for a few days.
Do not cut off flesh that is blackened but not infected. Again, only cut off infected parts of the comb or wattle.

, Keep a chicken you’ve operated on isolated in an area that stays between 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit for 24 hours. Ideally, keep it in it’s own cage with a heat lamp at one end.


Know that the healing process may take a while.
Monitor you chicken’s dietary intake, and make sure they’re eating well during recovery.Do not return the bird to the flock if there is still any active bleeding. The other chickens will likely pick at the wound.
Return the bird to the coop at night, after you’ve turned off the lights. This will reduce the chance of fighting as social parameters are re-established within the flock.

Employ the deep litter method.,
Ensure your coop provides sufficient warmth and shelter.,
Consider the breed of the chickens you choose to raise.,
Protect and hydrate your chickens during cold weather.",How to Treat Frostbite in Chickens3," The deep litter method is an alternative to cleaning your coop once a week, as you ought to do during the non-winter months. By allowing an accumulation of manure and bedding to begin to decompose, you provide a natural, healthy source of warmth radiating up from your coop’s floor. Instead of removing and replacing your bedding materials, simply turn over the soiled bedding and add a new layer of fresh bedding on top. The chicken poop will decompose beneath the fresh layer of bedding and emanate warmth into the coop.
Beneficial microbes that are inevitable products of composting even help control pathogens, making your chickens less vulnerable to disease and disallowing certain common parasites to grow.
In the spring, when you give the coop a seasonal cleaning, you wind up with a prime batch of compost ready to till into your garden.

, Ventilation, heating, and even the size of your roosting bars all impact the likelihood of your birds getting frostbite. The best way to prevent frostbite, actually, is ensuring that your chicken coop safely shelters your chickens.Ventilate properly. Make sure you have an effective ventilation system at the top of the coop. The primary purpose of ventilation during the winter is the release of moisture that would otherwise build up inside the coop, increasing the likelihood of frostbite and infection.
Don’t heat the coop artificially. Though this seems counterintuitive, heating actually increasing the chances of frostbite as heat increases the amount of moisture in the coop. Increase ventilation if you see condensation form within the coop.
Install a wide roosting bar. A roosting bar that is wide enough for your hens to perch with their bodies completely covering their feet will help prevent frostbitten feet. Try a standard 2x4 board.

, Different breeds of chickens are more hardy, and can better endure the cold. In particular, those with small combs are less likely to suffer from significant frostbite. Some chickens are actually quite resilient to cold weather.Select a breed with small combs. If you live at a Northern latitude, you’ll likely want to raise chickens with small combs. These include Easter Eggers, Buckeyes, Ameraucanas, and Wyandottes. Avoid breeds with especially large combs such as Andalusians and Leghorns. Note that roosters will likely be more vulnerable to frostbite, as their combs and wattles are often significantly larger than those of hens.
Choose a chicken breed known for cold-weather resilience. Birds with large body mass, from breeds that originated in Northern climates can better handle cold weather. These include birds from the four breeds recommended above, as well as Australorps, Bantam Brahmas, Barnevelders, Brahmas, Buff Orpingtons, Cochins, Delawares, Dominiques, Faverolles, Jersey Giants, Marans, New Hampshire Reds, Plymouth Rocks, Rhode Island Reds, Sussexes, and Welsummers.

, Applying a preventative coating to your birds’ exposed skin and making sure your chickens are able to stay dry can go a long way in keeping your birds healthy and frostbite-free during winter.


Apply a protective coating to wattles and combs. You have several options in terms of coating. Coconut oil, petroleum jelly, or Waxelene (an all natural alternative) are all solid options. Whatever you choose, apply the coating to your chickens after they’ve gone to roost for the evening. Clean any initial signs of dry, damaged skin. Whether a mild case of frostbite or simply a scratch, cleaning a chickens skin can prevent infection. A good cleaning product option is Vetericyn, which is safe to use on all animals. Vetericyn is non-toxic, steroid-free, antibiotic-free, and is free of alcohol. It is designed to clean scratches, skin rashes, cuts, and irritated skin, and more, making it an all-around animal skin care product.Hydrate the heck out of your chickens. Especially during the winter, make sure water is always available, but only use containers that won’t spill. Prevent freezing by opting for plastic instead of metal containers, placing the water where sun will hit it, and floating ping pong balls in the water.Considering adding electrolytes to your chickens’ water supply to ensure hydration. If you’re feeling especially team-oriented, add a shot of your Gatorade to their water supply."

Use a backpack sprayer for large scale vaccinations.,
Test the backpack spray device.,
Get the right amount of distilled water based on the size of each chicken.,
Prepare the vaccine solution.,
Divide the vaccine equally into the backpack sprayers and prepare the hen house.,
Vaccinate the chicks.,
Return the chicken pen to normal.,
Clean the backpack sprayer.",How to Vaccinate Chickens6," If you have a lot of chickens that you need to vaccinate, the backpack sprayer is one of the fastest ways to get the job done. This device actually gets worn like a backpack on your back and can vaccinate many chickens at once.

, Test spray by spraying four liters of distilled water in the backpack sprayer, and take note of the time it takes before the device is completely emptied. Ensure that the particle size of the nozzle is correct.


For chicks (day 1 to 14) this should be at 80 to 120 microns, for older birds (day 28 onwards) this should be between 30 to 60 microns (1).Desvac®, and Field Spravac have color coded nozzles with different particle sizes.

, The total amount of distilled water will depend on the amount of birds to be vaccinated, and the age of vaccination. As a rough guide:


500ml to 600ml of distilled water is needed for every 1000 birds at 14 days of age, and 1000ml of distilled water is needed for every 1000 birds at 30 to 35 days of age. For example: for a 14 day old flock of 30,000 birds; 30 x 500 = 15,000 ml or 15 liters (4.0 US gal) of distilled water.

, Only mix the vaccine together when you are completely ready to vaccinate the chickens. Open the vaccine vial first, and pour distilled water into it before mixing it in the clean pale with the correct amount of distilled water (see Step 2).


Mix the vaccine thoroughly using clean plastic stirrers.

, Prepare the house by setting it to minimum ventilation rate, and dimming the lights to calm the birds. Always vaccinate in the cooler parts of the day.

, After preparing the house and the vaccine, start vaccinating by letting one person walk slowly ahead to part the birds, and the vaccinators behind him to the left and to the right. The sprayers must slowly walk and direct the nozzle 3 feet (0.9 m) above the birds heads.


While you spray, maintain the pressure of the nozzle at around 65 to 75 PSI. Each backpack sprayer brand is different but there is always a way to read the pressure on the device.

, After vaccination, immediately restore the ventilation settings to normal. Turn the lights back on after a few minutes (5 to 10 minutes), to give the chickens time to rest., Clean the backpack sprayer with 4 liters (1.1 US gal) of water, by shaking it and spraying it until it is emptied. Always check the parts of the backpack sprayer and replace as needed. For battery operated sprayers, always recharge after every use.

Use a wing web vaccine for serious chicken diseases.,
Dilute the vaccine.,
Have an assistant hold a chicken and lift a wing.,
Dip the needle into the vaccine.,
Pierce the underside of the wing web, but avoid piercing the blood vessels and bones.,
Replace the needle and check to see that the vaccination was successful.",How to Vaccinate Chickens7," This route is generally taken when you are vaccinating chickens against Chicken anemia, live Fowl Cholera, Avian Encephalomyelitis, and Fowl Pox.

, The vaccine you get should come with a diluent. The amount of diluent you need depends on the vaccine you will be giving your chickens. Follow the instructions that come with the vaccine on how to properly dilute it., Gently lift the right or left wing of the chicken. Expose the wing web so that the wing web is in front of your. This means that you should expose the underside of the wing so that it is facing up. Gently pluck some of the feathers on the wing web so that you can see what you’re doing and so none of the vaccine gets on the feathers.The wing web is located near the bone where the wing connects to the body.

, Dip the two pronged needle applicator into the vaccine bottle. Take caution that the needle is not dipped too deeply. Only the wells of the two pronged needles must be dipped into the vaccine.

, You can ensure this by centering the needle puncture in the middle of the triangle formed by the wing web, while the wings are spread apart.


If you accidentally hit a vein and bleeding occurs, replace the needle with a new one, and re-vaccinate.

, Replace the needle with a new one after vaccinating 500 chickens. Check after 7 to 10 days to make sure that the vaccination was successful. To check:

Pick 50 birds per chicken house and check them for scabs under the wing web. Scabbing or scarring means that the vaccination was successful.

Dispose of all empty vials and vaccine bottles properly.,
Recycle your vials and bottles.,
Check on the chickens’ health.",How to Vaccinate Chickens8," To do this, you will first have to disinfect them in a bucket filled with disinfectant and water (50ml of glutaraldehyde with 5 liters water).

, Some operations recycle vials and bottles and use them for sample collections. This can be done by first disinfecting the vials or bottles, and then rinsing them thoroughly afterwards. After the rinse, autoclave the containers to make sure that they are fully sterilized.

, It is always important to keep an eye on your chickens after you have vaccinated them. Look for any signs that something might be wrong. If you do notice anything, call a vet right away.For respiratory vaccinations it is normal for the chickens to develop respiratory issues like sneezing for 3 to 5 days after they get vaccinated. If the signs persist for longer than that, call a vet.

Find out where to source fertile eggs.,
Beware of getting your eggs shipped.,
Select your eggs wisely.,
Understand that you will have roosters.,
Decide whether to use an incubator or a broody hen.,
Know the pros and cons of each method.",How to Hatch Chicken Eggs1," Fertile eggs must be obtained from hatcheries or poultry farms which have roosters in their flock, if you do not breed your own chickens. You may be able to buy fresh farm eggs from someone who sells their extras. Be sure to check with potential suppliers well in advance, to ensure they have the correct breed and number of eggs in stock. Your county extension agent or extension poultry specialist may be able to suggest a source.The eggs you find in grocery stores are not fertile and cannot be hatched.
For disease prevention and health reasons, it's best to get all your eggs from one source.
If you are looking for a particular or rare breed of chicken, you may need to contact a specialized hatchery.;
, You should be wary of buying your eggs online and having them shipped to you, especially if you are a first time hatcher. Shipped eggs are more difficult to hatch than eggs from your own flock or eggs acquired locally.


On average, eggs that have never shipped have an 80% chance of hatching, whereas shipped eggs have only a 50% chance.However, if the eggs are treated very roughly during shipping, it is possible none will hatch, even when you are doing everything right.

, If you are able to select your own hatching eggs, there are several things you should look out for. You should select eggs from breeding hens that are well developed, mature and healthy; they should be compatible with their mates and produce a high percentage of fertile eggs (around three). The breeding hens should also be fed a complete breeder's diet.


Avoid excessively large or small eggs, or misshapen eggs. Large eggs hatch poorly and small eggs produce small chicks.
Avoid eggs with cracked or thin shells. These eggs have difficulty retaining moisture needed for proper chick development. Cracked or thin shells also make it easier for disease to penetrate.

, An important point to keep in mind is that your eggs will generally hatch out in a 50:50 mix of males and females. If you live in town, roosters can be a problem and keeping them is often against municipal regulations! If you can't keep roosters, you will need to be prepared to find them a home. Even if you can keep them, you will have to consider what living arrangements you will need so that the roosters won't overbreed and or even injure your hens.Understand that there is no way to know whether an egg contains a male or female chick before the egg has hatched. Even though the general ratio of males to females is 50:50, you may be unlucky and hatch 7 males out of 8 eggs, which does not make for much of a laying flock.If you do intend to keep some or all of the male chicks, there are several things you will need to consider, such as whether you will have enough space to ensure that the hens are not overbred. Overbred hens can have feathers pulled out from their heads and backs, their combs injured and, even worse, can get accidental puncture wounds from rooster spurs. Too many roosters can fight amongst themselves, as well.
The usual recommendation is to keep about one rooster for every ten hens or so. This is also a good ratio to keep if you want decent fertility in your home flock.

, You have two options once you've decided to hatch chicken eggs; you can hatch them in an incubator or hatch them under a broody hen. Both options have pros and cons that you will need to consider before proceeding.An incubator is an enclosure which has controlled temperature, humidity, and ventilation. With an incubator, you are the only one responsible for the eggs. You will be in charge of preparing the incubator, monitoring the temperature, humidity and ventilation inside the incubator, as well as turning the eggs. Small incubators can be purchased, though it is also possible to make your own. If you have a commercial model, follow the instructions supplied with the unit.
A broody hen can be used to incubate and hatch chicken eggs, even if she didn't lay the eggs herself. This is a great, natural option for hatching eggs. Just make sure you choose a broody breed to hatch your eggs, popular broody breeds include Silkies, Cochins, Orpingtons and Old English Games., Of course, both incubators and broody hens offer advantages and disadvantages to cultivators trying to hatch chicken eggs. Knowing what these are will ultimately help you make the best decision given your circumstances.



Incubator pros: Using an incubator is a good option if you do not have access to a broody hen or you are hatching chickens for the first time. An incubator allows you to be in control of the hatching process. Incubators are also the best option for hatching large quantities of eggs.

Incubator cons: The main drawback of using an incubator is that its operation is wholly dependent on a reliable power source. If you are hit with an unexpected power outage or someone accidentally unplugs the incubator, it can adversely affect the eggs, even killing the babies in the shell. If you don't already own an incubator, you may need to buy one which, depending on size and quality, may be costly.

Broody hen pros: Using a broody hen to hatch your eggs is a practical and natural option. With a hen, you don't need to worry about the power going out and ruining your eggs. There are no concerns about the temperature or humidity being right. Once the eggs have hatched, the hen will be a mother to the chicks, which is a beautiful thing to see.

Broody hen cons: Your hen may not be broody when you need her to be and there is no way to make a hen go broody, so you will need to get your timing just right. You may need to invest in a ""broody coop"" to protect your hen and the eggs from overcrowding and possible damage to the eggs. This can add to the expense of hatching eggs. In addition, a hen can only reliably hatch a few eggs at a time. Large hens may be able to hatch 10-12 eggs at the very most, depending on the size of the eggs, while small hens may only hatch 6-7."
"
Choose a location for the incubator.,
Familiarize yourself with the operation of the incubator.,
Adjust the conditions.,
Set the eggs.,
Allow the temperature to drop after adding the eggs.,
Record the date.,
Turn the eggs daily.,
Adjust the humidity levels in the incubator.,
Ensure the incubator has adequate ventilation.,
Candle the eggs after 7 to 10 days.,
Prepare for the hatch.",How to Hatch Chicken Eggs2," To help your incubator maintain a constant temperature, place it where it will receive as little temperature fluctuation as possible. Do not place it near a window where it will be exposed to direct sunlight. The sun's heat can raise the temperature high enough to kill the developing embryos.Connect the unit to a dependable electrical source, and make sure the plug cannot be accidentally detached from the outlet.
Keep the incubator out of the reach of small children, cats and dogs.
In general, it's best to keep your incubator on a sturdy surface that won't be knocked or stepped on, and in a place that has relatively stable temperatures, out of the way of drafts and direct sunlight.

, Before you begin to hatch your chicken eggs, make sure to read all of the instructions in the incubator's instruction manual. Make sure you know how to operate the fan, the light and any other functions.Use the thermometer provided to check the temperature of the incubator. You should do this frequently during the 24 hours before you incubate, to be sure it will stay at the correct temperature.

, In order to successfully hatch chicken eggs, the conditions inside the incubator must be spot on. To prepare the incubator to receive the chicken eggs, you should adjust the conditions inside the incubator to the optimum level.



Temperature: Chicken eggs should be incubated at a temperature between 99 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (99.5 is often considered to be ideal). Avoid temperatures outside the 97–103 °F (36–39 °C). range. If the temperature remains beyond either extreme for several days, hatchability may be severely reduced.Humidity: The moisture level in the incubator should be about 50 to 65 percent relative humidity (60 percent is often considered the ideal). Moisture is provided by a pan of water under the egg tray. You can use a wet bulb thermometer or a hygrometer to measure humidity., Once the conditions inside the incubator have been properly set and monitored for at least 24 hours to confirm stability, it is time to set your eggs. Never set fewer than six eggs. If you try hatching only two or three eggs, and especially if they are shipped eggs, a bad hatch is likely. You may get one chick, or none.Warm the fertile eggs to room temperature. Allowing the eggs to warm up will decrease the amount and duration of temperature fluctuation in the incubator after you've added the eggs.
Place the eggs carefully into the incubator. Make sure the eggs are lying on their sides. The larger end of each egg should be slightly higher than the pointy end. This is important as the embryos can become misaligned if the pointy end is higher and may have difficult pipping, or breaking through the shell, when it comes time to hatch., The temperature will temporarily lower after you've introduced the eggs into the incubator, but it should readjust if you've calibrated the incubator correctly.


Don't increase the temperature to compensate for this fluctuation or you may damage or kill your embryos.

, From this you will be able to estimate the hatching date of your eggs. Chicken eggs take twenty-one days to hatch when incubated at optimal temperature. Older eggs, eggs that were allowed to cool down and eggs that were incubated at too low a temperature, may still hatch--but they will hatch late! If it is Day 21 and your eggs haven't hatched yet, give them a couple of extra days, just in case!

, Eggs should be turned a minimum of three times per day at regular intervals--though five is even better! Some people like to lightly draw an X on one side of the egg so they can more easily keep track of which eggs have been turned. Otherwise it is easy to lose track of which have been turned, and whether they have been turned all the way over or not.When turning eggs manually, your hands must be washed and clean before each session to avoid transferring bacteria and oils onto the surface of the egg.
Keep turning the eggs until day 18, and then stop to allow the chicks to position themselves properly for hatching.

, Humidity should be around 50 to 60 percent throughout incubation, except during the last 3 days when you will want to raise it to 65 percent. You may need higher or lower humidity levels depending on the type of eggs you wish to hatch. Consult your hatchery or the available literature on hatching your species of bird.Replenish the water in the water pan on a regular basis or the humidity levels will drop too low. Always add warm water.
Add a sponge to the water pan if you need to increase the humidity.
Measure the humidity level in the incubator using a wet bulb thermometer. Take a reading with the wet bulb thermometer and also record the temperature in the incubator at the time. Consult a chart or psychrometric chart online or in a book to find the relative humidity from the relationship between the wet bulb and dry bulb temperature readings.

, There should be openings on the sides and top of the incubator to allow air flow-check to make sure these are at least partially opened. You will need to increase the amount of ventilation once the chicks begin to hatch., Candling the eggs is when you use a light source to view how much space the embryo occupies within an egg. After 7 to 10 days, you should see development of the embryo. Candling allows you to remove eggs with embryos that are not viable.Find a tin can or a box that can fit over a light bulb.
Cut a hole in the can or box that is smaller in diameter than an egg.
Turn on the light bulb.
Take 1 of the incubated eggs and hold it over the hole. If the egg appears clear, the embryo has not developed or the egg may never have been fertile. You should see a cloudy mass if the embryo is developing. The embryo will increase in size as you near the hatch date.
Remove any eggs that do not show a developing embryo from the incubator.

, Discontinue turning and rotating eggs 3 days prior to the estimated hatch date. Most viable eggs will hatch within a 24 hour period.


Place cheesecloth under the egg tray prior to hatching. The cheesecloth will help catch bits of eggshell and other matter during and after the hatch.
Increase the humidity level in the incubator by adding more water or a sponge.
Leave the incubator closed until after the chicks hatch.

Choose the right breed.,
Know when a hen is broody.,
Prepare a brooding area.,
Place the fertile eggs under the hen.,
Have feed and water available at all times.,
Refrain from disturbing the hen or the eggs as much as possible.,
Have a back up.,
Let nature take its course.",How to Hatch Chicken Eggs3," If you are decided on using a hen to hatch your eggs, you will want to know how to choose the best for your hatching needs. Some breeds will never go broody, so if you are waiting for your favorite to get in the mood for hatching, it may be a very long wait! The best broody breeds are Silkies, Cochins, Orpingtons and Old English Games.


There are plenty of other breeds that will go broody, but keep in mind that just because a hen goes broody, it is no guarantee she will be a good mother. For instance, some hens will go broody, but will not stay on the nest consistently, so few if any eggs will hatch.
Some hens are so startled when the eggs finally hatch, that the mother hen may attack the new chicks or abandon them. If you can find a hen that's a good breeder and mother, then you're on to a winner!

, To tell whether a hen has gone broody, look for a hen that stays flattened out in the nest box in a trance-like state and stays there at night. You can also look for a patch of naked skin on her underside. And if she warns you away with a loud squawk or gives you a sharp peck, this is a good indication that she's broody.


If you don't trust your hen, before placing fertile eggs under her, test her for a couple of days to see if she sticks tight to the nest. You can place her on golf balls, artificial eggs, or regular eggs that you are willing to sacrifice. You don't want a hen that will abandon the nest partway through the incubation cycle.

, Put the broody hen in a separate house or room that can be used for both the incubation and hatching period and the time when the chicks are growing. Place a comfortable, ground-level nest within the brooding area, filled with soft cushioning such as wood shavings or straw.


Minimally the brooding area should be somewhere quiet, dark, clean, draft-free, isolated from the rest of the flock, free of lice and ticks, and safe from potential predators.
Allow ample room for the hen to leave the nest to eat, drink, and move around.

, Once you are sure the broody hen will be a good setter and you have prepared the brooding area, place the fertile eggs under then hen. Place the eggs under her all at once, so they will hatch within 24 hours of each other.


Place the eggs under the hen at night, since you are less likely to disturb her and cause her to reject and abandon the nest and eggs.
Don't worry how you place the eggs. The hen will shift them numerous times over the course of the incubation.

, Make sure the hen has access to food and water at all times, even if she only gets up to eat and drink once a day. Place the water far enough away from the hen that she won't knock it over or spill it over her nest and eggs.

, The hen will do all the necessary work of turning and adjusting the eggs and the eggs should stay moist and warm from the hen's body. If you want to inspect and candle the eggs to check on their progress, resist the temptation of doing it too often.


However, you don't want to have rotten eggs that could create health and safety problems if they crack open. A good compromise is to candle all the eggs at the same time between seventh and tenth day of the incubation process. If you discover a rotten egg or are absolutely sure the egg has no chick developing inside, remove it.
During the last week of incubation, expect the hen to stay on the nest full time without turning or fussing with the eggs. That's all natural, so leave her alone.

, It can be very frustrating when a hen has been faithfully broody for two weeks and then gives up on the eggs, but don't despair. If you have another broody hen or an artificial incubator at hand, you can still save the clutch.

, Once the chicks begin to hatch, try not to peek or remove the eggs from under the hen just to get a better look. They are exactly where they need to be. Don't worry if not all of the eggs have hatched, hens are surprisingly good at multi-tasking between incubating eggs and caring for baby chicks. The hen will usually stay on the nest for 36 hours or longer to provide time for all of the chicks to hatch while keeping the hatched chicks very close under her wing.

Keep an eye over the chicken's healing process for a few weeks.",How to Help a Pecked Chicken with a Wound," You need to act quickly because the chickens will keep pecking.
, Flush out the wound with water. If it is not a deep wound, you can use hydrogen peroxide but it is risky.Make sure to rinse the hydrogen peroxide off after disinfecting, as it can eat at the skin, setting back healing. Apply an ointment (or drop of honey) to accelerate healing.

Clean the wound out once a day.

, The chicken can never go back with any of the chickens that were pecking it. The chicken will have been ""marked"" and in the order of its former coop-mates, it will be on the bottom and liable to being pecked again. Time doesn't help either––if it's gone from the other chickens for a while, they won't remember it and will pick on it more as a ""newbie"". Thus, get it a new coop and make sure it is very clean because the cut might be infected. Also choose a place that flies can't get into because they may further infect the wound., Ensure that it cannot access the other chickens, or vice versa. When the chicken has healed, make a run for it of its own."

Make a schedule for cleaning.,
Give your birds daily check-ups.,
Feed your birds quality feed.,
Let birds free range around your yard!,
Try not to add new chickens to the flock.,
Vaccinate your chickens.",How to Prevent Diseases in Chickens," Every month, you should remove bedding and nesting straw/shavings and replace with new, fresh material. Every 6 months, you should bleach and clean their feeders, waterers, and entire coop. Once again, remove the old shavings and replace with clean shavings. Cleaning the bedding material prevents disease-causing stuff , such as mold, parasites, and ammonia from building up and biting you AND your birds, It will prevent fungus in their feet and parasitic infections. a bed placed in a location where it gets sun will also prevent bacteria reproduction, It makes the coop feel fresher, too!;
, Because birds are flight animals, they will often hide their symptoms of illness until it is too late. So, even if your birds DO get sick, you can still catch it before time runs out! Signs to look for include:


Lethargic behavior
Suspicious or abnormal stools, including diarrhea, all white stool (should be brown with white top), blood in stool, or worms
Sneezing
Huge drop in pecking order
Wounds
Take your bird to the vet if you see any of these. For wounds, disinfect.

, Good feed should contain about 20% protein, amino acids for growth, and sufficient but not excessive fats and carbohydrates.

, It reduces stress, which will keep them more healthy overall. They will also eat weeds, grass, worms, and other delicious things they find in the yard, which will not only help your lawn, but will also help out their digestive system, making them healthier!

, If you buy or receive chickens from a person they may carry a disease. To prevent this it is best that you make sure that the chicken doesn't carry a disease or do not add them to the flock and just raise your own chicks.

, Vaccination is only necessary if your chickens have suffered from something in the past or have been in multiple flocks. You can also buy vaccinated chicks from a breeder or farm store.

Place hay at the bottom of the frying pan and lay a thermometer on top of it.,
Turn the pan to its absolute lowest setting.,
Put the eggs in the pan, keeping them covered most of the time.,
After three days of incubation, hold each egg up to a bright light to see inside the shell.,
Turn the eggs two to three times a day.",How to Incubate Eggs in an Electric Frying Pan,";
, You will know you have set the temperature correctly when it reaches 99.5 °F (37.5 °C) and stays that way. Do not place any eggs in the pan until you know the temperature is consistent.

, Make sure they don't touch each other. Unless the lid has a built-in hole, it should be kept slightly ajar.

, This is called candling.


If the egg is clear inside, it is not fertilized. Remove it from the pan and throw it away.
If you see a spot of blood with veins coming out of it, congratulations, you have a fertilized egg! Keep candling the fertilized eggs every few days to make sure the chicks are still developing.
If the egg gets discolored or makes a sloshing noise after being lightly shaken, the chick is dead and the egg needs to be thrown out.

, Try to be quick, since the temperature goes down every time the lid is removed from the pan. Space the out turning. A recommended turning pattern is to turn in the morning, then mid-day followed by a final turning during the late evening. You should stop turning the eggs about three days before they are scheduled to hatch (see tip below for more information).

Wash your hands after handling chickens and supplies.,
Minimize touching your chickens.,
Do not eat or drink near your birds.,
Keep your chickens outside.,
Do not let young children handle chickens.",How to Reduce Salmonella Risk when Raising Backyard Chickens1," This can help you get rid of any bacteria that may cause salmonella. It is vital that you wash your hands each and every time you come into physical contact with chickens or their supplies.To wash your hands properly, wet them in running water and then lather them with soap. Make sure you target your whole hands, including between your fingers, under your fingernails, and the backs of your hands.Make sure to scrub your hands for 20 seconds. To help keep track of time, hum or sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice.
Rinse your hands when you're done and make sure to clean them using a clean towel.;
, In general, the less you handle your chickens the less likely you'll be to contact salmonella. Only handle your chickens when necessary, such as examining them when they're wounded. You should avoid things like cuddling or kissing your birds.
If you do touch your chicken for whatever reason, do not touch your mouth afterwards until you've washed your hands.

, Your eating area and chicken coop should be strictly separate places. Eat indoors, away from your chickens, and do not bring beverages to drink near the chicken coop. If you do eat outside, do so far away from the chicken coop., If chickens are indoors, they can contaminate your home with bacteria that could cause salmonella. This is especially true if your chickens are anywhere near the kitchen. Do not allow chickens to come inside. Always raise chickens as strictly outdoor animals., Young children are more vulnerable to contracting salmonella. Children under the age of five should not have any contact with the chickens. Make sure to monitor young children at all times to keep them away from the chickens and the coop.Adults with weakened immune systems are as vulnerable to disease as young children, so anyone with a weak immune system should also stay away from the chickens.

Look at their down color.,
Look at their feathers.,
Look at their size.,
Consider temperament.,
Notice their behaviour and lifestyle pattern.",How to Determine the Sex of a Chicken1," Easily enough, often a chick's down color will tell you whether it's male or female. Of course, it depends on the type of chicken you're raising -- if they're Black-Breasted Red, Light Brown, or Silver Duckwing, it'll be simple. The males have only two colors down their backs and a dot on the crown of their head; females have three colors and they all run up and down their backs.


Barred Plymouth Rocks can produce chicks that are easy to sex at hatching (they're black with yellow or white spots). With this breed, the males have yellow spots on their heads. For the New Hampshire or Buff Orpington types, the male chicks will have off-white streaks on their wings while the females will often have brown lines down their backs and/or dark spots on their heads.;
, Female chicks (pullets) get their feathers quite quickly -- in the first week or so. Cockerels' feather growth doesn't go nearly as quickly. However, at 2-3 months you will see the long and pointed hackle feathers developing on the males.


The cockerels will start to develop combs at around 1 1/2 months in most breeds. It will start to redden in the males; the females will still be yellow.

, Cockerels are usually bigger by just a few weeks old. What's more, cockerels (the males) have angular (and often larger) heads, while the pullets have smaller, round ones.


Cockerels usually have longer legs, too (look for spur development).

, Go into your hen  house and sneeze. The cockerels will probably stay put and the pullets will scatter! Talk about reinforcing gender norms, huh?, Roosters are brave and put the hens first. They'll find a piece of food and call for the female to eat it. They also crow whilst females obviously lay eggs."

Understand why you need to candle your eggs.,
Use the correct candling equipment.,
Follow an appropriate candling schedule.,
Hold the egg above the light.,
Look for signs that the egg is a winner.,
Look for signs that the egg is a quitter.,
Look for signs that the egg is a yolker.,
If you are unsure, leave the eggs alone.",How to Candle an Egg," When you are hatching eggs at home, it is good practice to keep track of how the eggs are developing. However, this can be very difficult (if not impossible) without the use of candling. Candling involves shining a bright light into the egg, allowing you to see its contents and check whether it is developing properly.


When you are hatching eggs at home, you will never get a 100% hatch rate. Some eggs will not be fertile to begin with (these are called ""yolkers"") while others will stop developing at some point during the incubation process (these are known as ""quitters"").
It is important that you are able to identify and remove these yolkers and quitters during the incubation process, otherwise they can begin to rot and eventually burst inside the incubator, contaminating the other eggs with bacteria and creating a very bad smell.;
, Candling equipment doesn't need to be very fancy or specific - in fact, in the old days it used to be done with the flame from a candle (hence the name). The main requirement is a bright light (the brighter the better) with an opening smaller than the diameter of the eggs you intend to candle. You will need to conduct the candling in a very dark room in order to see inside the egg.


You can buy specific egg candling devices at any poultry supply store. These usually look like small flashlights which are powered either by batteries or a plug-in cord.
You can make your own egg candler at home by placing a 60 watt light bulb inside a coffee can and making a hole with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter in the top of the can. Alternatively, you can take a very bright flashlight and cover the opening with a piece of cardboard with a hole (1 inch in diameter) in the middle.A more high-tech, expensive option for candling eggs is known as an Ovascope. This has a rotating stand on which you place the egg. The egg is then covered by a hood which blocks out any ambient light. You can then view the egg through an eyepiece, which magnifies the egg slightly for easier inspection., You should candle your eggs before you even put them in the incubator. You probably won't be able to see anything, let alone differentiate between good and bad eggs, but it will give you an indication of what an undeveloped egg looks like, which can be useful for comparison later.


It may also be helpful to look out for any tiny cracks which are not visible to the naked eye. Cracked eggs are more susceptible to harmful bacteria getting inside and affecting the development of the embryo. If you find an egg with a crack, do not discard it just yet, but make sure to take note of the crack and check the egg's progress later.
Although some people will candle their eggs every day while they are incubating, it is a good idea to wait until about day seven. There are two reasons for this.


Number one: Eggs are temperature sensitive and constantly moving them in and out of the incubator could negatively affect their development, especially at this early stage.

Number two: Before day seven the eggs will not have developed very much and it will be difficult to distinguish between good and bad eggs.


After the candling on day seven you should leave the eggs alone til about day fourteen. At this point, you will be able to double check any eggs that you were uncertain about the first time and discard them if there are still no signs of development.You should refrain from candling after day sixteen or seventeen, as the eggs should not be moved or even turned in the days leading up to the hatching. In addition, the embryos will have developed so much by this stage that they will fill the inside of the egg, so you will be able to see very little., Set up your candling equipment in a dark room within close proximity to the incubator. Select an egg from the incubator and hold it above the light. The correct way to do this is as follows:









Place the larger end of the egg (where the air sac is) directly against the light. Hold the egg near the top, between your thumb and forefinger. Tilt the egg slightly to one side and rotate until you get the best view.
As you work, you should mark each egg with a number and take notes on your findings. That way, you can compare the results of your first candling with the results of your second candling.
Try to work quickly, but not so fast that you risk dropping the egg. As long as the eggs are returned to the incubator within twenty minutes to half an hour, there is no risk of the candling process affecting their development. A mother hen will frequently leave her eggs for short periods of time while she is incubating them.
Be aware that it will be more difficult to candle brown or speckled eggs as the dark shells do not become as transparent under the light.

, A winner is an egg with a successfully developing embryo. You can tell if an egg is a winner using the following signs:


There will be a visible network of blood vessels spreading from the center of the egg outwards.
With a weaker candler, you might just be able to make out the clear bottom half of the egg (where the air sac is) and the darker top half of the egg (where the embryo is developing).
With a good candler, you might be able to see the dark outline of the embryo at the center of the network of blood vessels. You are most likely to see the embryo's eyes, which are the darkest spots inside the egg.
If you're lucky, you might see the embryo moving!, A quitter is an embryo which has stopped developing at some point during incubation, for one reason or another. Some quit due to poorly maintained temperatures or humidity, some are contaminated by bacteria, while others simply have bad genes.


The main indication that an egg is a quitter is the development of a blood ring. A blood ring looks like a well-defined red circle, which is visible on the inside of the shell. It forms when the embryo dies and the blood vessels supporting it pull away from the center and rest against the shell.Other indications that an egg is a quitter include the development of blood spots or blood streaks inside the egg. However, these dark patches can be difficulty to distinguish from a healthy embryo at this early stage.
If you are 100% certain that the egg is a quitter (the appearance of a blood ring is a very definite sign) then you should discard the egg immediately to prevent it from turning bad and exploding inside the incubator.

, A yolker is an egg that was never fertilized and has no chance of developing an embryo. You can tell if an egg is a yolker using the following signs:


The egg looks the exact same as it did when you first candled the eggs before putting them in the incubator.
The inside of the egg looks fairly clear, with no visible dark spots, blood vessels or blood rings., If you think you might have identified a yolker or a quitter, but are not 100% sure, do not discard them just yet. If you do, you run the risk of throwing away healthy eggs.


Just make a note of which eggs have a question mark over them, then place them back in the incubator. It is always worth giving them another chance.
Check the questionable eggs again on day fourteen. If there are still no obvious signs of development or if a blood ring has finally formed, you can discard them."

Shovel out the coop.,
Hose down the coop.,
Shovel again.,
Scrub down the coop.,
Rinse and dry the coop.",How to Reduce Salmonella Risk when Raising Backyard Chickens2," Cleaning your chicken coop regularly can prevent the build up of bacteria, lessening the likelihood of diseases like salmonella. This is why it's important to clean your chicken coop regularly. The first step to cleaning a chicken coop is shoveling the coop.Wearing gloves, use a shovel to remove dirt, cobwebs, shavings, feathers, and droppings from the inside of the coop.
For best results, use a square shovel.

, Once you've shoveled out the coop, take a hose. Spray down the inside of the coop to remove dust and stuck on dirt and debris. Spray down the floors, walls, nesting boxes, and roosts., Oftentimes, the hose will dislodge stuck on dirt and debris from the chicken coop. If you notice any new materials in the coop, take your shovel and once again scoop out the coop. You do not want anything like old feathers, droppings, or cobwebs to remain in the coop after cleaning., In a bucket, mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Use a broom or brush to scrub down the whole coop. Make sure to get all areas of the coop, including nesting boxes, beds, lofts, and so on. Remove any dirt or grime while you scrub.Make sure you wear gloves during this process.

, Once you've scrubbed down the coop, use the hose again. Spray down the coop until you remove al vinegar residue. Allow the coop to air dry. Keep the doors and windows open to encourage sunlight to dry out the coop."

See a doctor under certain circumstances.,
Take the proper medications.,
Stay hydrated.,
Help infected children stay hydrated.",How to Reduce Salmonella Risk when Raising Backyard Chickens3," For the most part, medical treatment is not necessary for a salmonella infection as it should clear up on its own. However, in some circumstances medical intervention may be necessary.If your illness lasts longer than a few days, see a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you have a high fever or bloody stools.
Infants or young children that have been infected should see a doctor.

, Certain medications can help with the symptoms of a salmonella infection. If you have a severe diarrhea, take over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications. Make sure you check to see if any medications you're taking interact with over-the-counter medications.If you're sick enough to need medical help, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. However, do not take antibiotics unless instructed to do so by your doctor. Antibiotics can actually be harmful for a mild case of salmonella.

, As diarrhea and vomiting are symptoms of salmonella, staying hydrated is important. Have water on hand for the duration of the infection. Sip your water on occasion to stay hydrated.If drinking water makes you feel sick, you can also suck on ice cubes.

, If your child has a salmonella infection, make sure they stay hydrated. Young children will benefit from oral rehydration solutions sold at drug stores and supermarkets.However, check with your doctor first. In some cases, your doctor may advise against such methods.

Hire a chick sexer for younger chickens.,
Have the chick sexer use vent sexing.,
If hiring a professional isn't an option, take a look yourself.",How to Determine the Sex of a Chicken2," These people are trained to be able to tell the sex of chickens from a very young age. This is the most reliable method.

, This requires him/her to squeeze the feces out of the chick in order to open the anal vent and look for a ""bump."" If this bump is present, then the chick is most likely male. This guarantees an accuracy of 90-95%. You'll still get one or two males per bunch., But note that this is very difficult and this is a paid profession for a reason. You may actually be doing it correctly and not be able to determine for yourself as well.


Again, vent sexing is hard and takes practice. You must squeeze the chicks stomach very lightly -- make sure you don't hurt the chick -- but hard enough to make him or her defecate. As it defecates, you should see either a little pimple-like protrusion or nothing -- if there's a pimple, it's a cockerel; if there's nothing, it's a pullet.
For specific instructions: Pick up the chick with your left hand with its head between your 3rd and 4th fingers, legs between 4th and 5th. Rump the ducktails up. Your left thumb will push on the lower abdomen, spreading the vent. Press your left thumb on the left edge of the vent up and over so that interior border is turned towards the chick's back. Ready your right thumb and forefinger to pinch the back right edge of the vent. Open the vent. The interior border is rolled back and genitalia is exposed. See anything? If you do, 'tis a male.(Or a very masculine female.)

Hire a chick sexer.,
Have the chicken sexer use feather sexing.",How to Determine the Sex of a Chicken3," You'll need a pro -- and this method is only good for certain breeds. Get someone with some experience. Did you know there's even a worldwide Chicken Sexing Competition?, He/She can use this method to look at feather lengths on chicks and determine their sex that way. It is less common, as it is only effective if the feather differences have been genetically selected for. If you are considering feather sexing, do this immediately. By about 2 weeks, cockerels have caught up to their female counterparts in feather length and volume.

Wait until your chicks turn six weeks old.,
Observe the chicks characteristics.",How to Determine the Sex of a Chicken4," This is an easier and extremely common method. It will take you time to wait but it's worth it as there is less hassle. There's usually one tell-tale sign when your chicks turn six weeks old and that's the wattle and comb., Females have smaller, pale combs and males have larger combs that are bright red. Baby roosters also develop their wattles faster than the females.

Males have tails that stick up-right and you may also see them doing a particular roo dance against each over and peck one another. But female pullets also tend to peck each over to establish a pecking order so it's not so certain.

Place wooden eggs in the nest.,
Place golf balls in the nest.,
Replace dummy eggs with real eggs.,
Allow her to gather a clutch of eggs.,
Consider dating your eggs.",How to Get Your Hen to Become Broody1," One of the most tried-and-true methods to encourage broodiness in your hen is to place dummy eggs in her nest. You may begin by using wooden eggs that can be purchased at most farm stores., Another common approach to using dummy eggs is to place golf balls in the nest. Oddly enough, some hens respond even better to golf balls than they do to manufactured “dummy” eggs., If you have encouraged broody behavior in your hen and she has begun sitting successfully on dummy eggs (wooden eggs, golf balls, or any other dummy eggs) you can swap these dummies for real eggs. This is most easily done at night when the hen is docile and less likely to reject the eggs.Always wash your hands thoroughly before handling eggs.
Some people prefer to swap eggs during the day, so that if an egg gets rejected they can quickly transfer it to an incubator. However, the evening method is still the most common.

, A different, though extremely common, method is simply to allow your hen to gather a clutch of eggs in her nest, that is, to lay numerous eggs without being disturbed. Once your hen has accumulated a few eggs (usually three to five) her broody instinct should kick in., If you are giving your hen the space and time to gather a clutch of eggs, you may consider sneaking into her nest and using a magic marker to write the date on her eggs. This way, you can remove eggs that have been in the nest for too long."

, Egg incubators are available in sizes that hold less than 100 eggs and commercial styles that are much larger and more industrial.


Think about how many eggs you want to incubate.
Consider buying something a bit larger than what you currently need. This will allow you to plan for growth so you will not have to buy another incubator in the near future.
Remember that you do not have to fill the incubator in order to use it. For example, you can buy an incubator that holds 200 eggs even if you only plan to incubate 50 eggs at a time.

, You will need an accurate thermostat in your incubator to ensure your eggs grow and hatch properly.

, Look for an incubator that can automatically adjust the humidity level based on the weight of the eggs.

, In order to grow into healthy chicks, eggs need to be turned during incubation. Most incubators come with a tray that allows easy turning, or rollers.


Choose between automatic or manual turning. Automatic turning capabilities will turn the eggs for you, while manual turning machines require you to shift the eggs yourself, either using a tray or rollers.

, Make sure your egg incubator is made from durable, sturdy products. If it looks or feels breakable, it probably is.

, If you are making money from the eggs that you incubate, you will likely consider this an investment. The price of incubators ranges from under $50 to over $100.

, You can find incubators for sale in home and garden stores, pet supply stores and animal feed retailers.


Check online for a larger selection and more competitive pricing. There are websites devoted to selling and maintaining egg incubators.

Check nesting boxes for insects and mice.",How to Get Your Hen to Become Broody2," Creating some subtle changes in your hen’s environment is another effective way to encourage broodiness. Try moving your hen into a calmer, quieter nesting house. This may bring out her broodiness., Another subtle change is to make your hen’s location a bit darker. (You can do this, for example, by hanging fabric over the front of her nesting box.) The darkness encourages her to be calm, and may help her instincts to arise., Many people advocate for the confinement of your hen to her quiet, dark nesting area. It may take some time alone in a calm, comfortable place to stir up a hen’s brooding instinct. Consider giving this method a try., If you have access to fresh herbs, the addition of some fresh herbs to your hen’s nesting box may encourage her become calm and broody. Lavender and chamomile are particularly effective., Your hen may avoid becoming broody (or even laying eggs) if she does not feel clean and safe in her nesting box. Check to be sure that her box is free from mites, insects, mice, and other intruders in order to ensure her comfort and safety."

Wait for the right season.,
Make sure your hen is a broody breed.,
Integrate a rooster.,

Set up a nesting box.",How to Get Your Hen to Become Broody3," Hens generally become broody during the spring or summer (the warmer months). If you wait for the right season, your hen’s natural instincts and broodiness should kick in on their own. Approach this endeavor with positivity and patience, and wait until the time is right., Modern day breeds (especially show birds) have had their broody instinct bred out by breeders who tend to use incubators. Because of this, it is important to start with a broody breed of hen, such as cochin, buff orpington, light brahmas, or dark Cornish hens., You will need a rooster in the mix if you want to end up with fertilized eggs and broody hens. The presence of a rooster near your hen is likely to encourage broody behavior., One rooster to every five hens is the ideal ratio for your chickens. If you are able to maintain this ratio of roosters to hens, you are more likely to get fertilized eggs and to encourage broodiness in your hens., Your hen needs somewhere safe and comfortable to both lay and sit on the eggs. Create a dry, clean, relatively dark place where your hen can have some privacy. You can purchase these, or construct them yourself out of wood.You will need one box for every two to four hens.
Twelve cubic inches (12"" x 12"" x 12"") is a good size for each box.
Add some sawdust and/or straw to serve as bedding for your chicken(s).

Decide between incubating the eggs yourself, or allowing the hen to raise her chicks.",How to Breed Chickens1," Some places have strict laws on keeping chickens whilst other places has ruled on keeping roosters and the amount of chickens you have. To avoid a fine it is best to check your local laws and regulations in your area.
, Many people don’t take into account that when you breed chickens, you will end up with significantly more chickens than you started with. Ensure that your chicken coop is ready for the new additions to your flock.


Keep spare coops and equipment around so you're prepared to separate roosters or bullies of the flock. Sometimes you just won't have enough room to keep all chickens in one coop or you might get a few more roosters than hens that are aggressive towards each over.

, Breeding chickens will result in about 50% male chicks. Male chickens will not contribute to your egg production, eat larger amounts of food, and will significantly increase the noise level of your flock. Be aware that breeding chickens will always result in having to deal with roosters., In order to fertilize your hen’s eggs, you will need a rooster in prime breeding condition. The rooster does not need to be the same breed as your hens in order to mate.You should have 1 rooster for every 10 hens.


Try to find a rooster from a good breeding stock. His eye color should be even, and his feet should be free from deformities. The rooster’s comb should look like a standard comb for his breed.
Be prepared for noise. Roosters are loud animals, and many cities and suburban areas have laws against owning roosters due to the noise. Make sure that you can legally own a rooster. If you cannot, you will need to purchase fertilized eggs to hatch.
Some breeds can be fairly aggressive. Make sure that you pick a rooster that is even-tempered, especially if you have children.

, Although you can breed chickens throughout most of the year, chickens bred in the Spring tend to be stronger. Chickens born in the Spring will begin producing eggs in Autumn. You do not need to do anything special in order to breed your chickens, just introduce the rooster to your flock and let nature take its course.


Make sure both your hens and your rooster are eating quality food. This will ensure that their reproductive systems are as strong as possible.
If you are breeding second generation or third generation chickens, be very wary of inbreeding issues. Try to tag your chickens so that you know which ones are related to the rooster. You can keep the rooster separate and only allow in the hens that you want to breed. You may also consider getting a new rooster each year., If you rely on your hens for egg-laying, letting the hen raise the egg will result in about 3 months of lost egg production (21 days to set and hatch her clutch, and another 2 months to raise her babies before she starts laying again). You will also need a “broody” hen, which means she is willing to sit on the egg for the entire incubation period.


Most chickens have had the broody trait bred out to keep them productive. Some of the broodiest breeds include: Silkies, Serama, Brahma, Jersey Giant, New Hampshire Red, Sussex, and others.
If you have a large number of eggs to incubate, or are incubating to sell, it may be worthwhile to invest in an incubator.

",How to Train a Chicken to Come to You," Some calls people use are things such as ""cluck-cluck!"" or ""here chickie-chick-chickie-chickie!"" Use whatever you want, they're chickens, they are not going to judge you.;
, When you use the call, you will be repeating the call until all of them come home.

, Have some sort of treat you feed your chickens that will be OK to give them daily. Some people use corn, some use ""scratch"" or use bread crumbs. While your chickens are enclosed, daily, feed this treat by scattering it on the floor in the chicken coop, just a little at a time. Every time you feed them this treat, make your ""call"" noise (remember to keep repeating until all of them come home). Do this every day. It is best to teach them that you give this treat in the same spot each time you give it. I do this with the food I give my hens every day when they are going to roost. if your birds are led by their bellies, they will pick it up quickly.

, Try this during a time when your chickens are out and don't normally come back to the coop all at once. While standing in the chicken coop, proudly give your ""call."" While calling, sprinkle the treat about, just as you have been doing when you were training them. They will come running to you.

Use a soft basket to hold the eggs while you collect them. This will help keep them from getting damaged. A little straw in a hand basket makes for a perfect egg basket.
Handle the eggs delicately to keep from upsetting the membrane and other internal parts.
Clean your hands before gathering eggs. This will help prevent you passing on bacteria to the egg.

, Although you should always be keeping the coop and nest boxes clean, it is especially important when breeding. Mud and droppings can increase the amount of harmful bacteria that can infect the egg, which will hurt the egg’s chances.


Make sure the hens always have clean bedding.

, Choosing the right eggs will significantly increase your chances of a successful hatch. You will want to avoid eggs that are noticeably larger or smaller. Large eggs have difficulty hatching, and small eggs often produce chicks that are too small to live.Do not choose any eggs that have been cracked. Also avoid eggs with thin shells.
Do not choose eggs that are noticeably misshapen.
Only keep the clean eggs. Washing or wiping dirty eggs removes protective coating, making it more vulnerable to bacteria.

, If you are hatching a lot of eggs, or are breeding different types of chickens, you may find it useful to mark the eggs with dates or breeds to help you keep track of them all. You can use a pencil, marking pen, or a stamp.

, Eggs can be stored up to 7 days after they have been laid and before you start incubating. Eggs should be stored for at least 24 hours before you start incubation, otherwise they may not hatch as well.


Try to maintain a temperature of 55 °F (13 °C) and high humidity.
Store the eggs with the pointy end down.

, While you are storing the eggs, they will need to be turned once a day to keep the membrane from sticking to one side. You can do this by placing a piece of wood underneath one end of the carton and then switching it to the other end the next day.

Find your broody hen.,
Sneak the eggs under the hen.,
Separate the brooding hen and her eggs from the other chickens.,
Keep the mother well fed.,
Let the hen hatch the eggs.,
Let the mother raise the chicks.,
Try to keep them separate.,
Provide plenty of clean water and fresh food.,
Introduce the chicks to the flock.",How to Breed Chickens3," You can use fake eggs to test for hens that may be more broody than others. If your hen will sit on the fake eggs for 24 hours, then she will most likely successfully incubate eggs for 21 days.

, This will be easiest at night, while the hen is sleeping. Depending on the breed, she may be able to incubate up to 12 eggs. Smaller breeds may only be able to fit 6 or so. All the eggs need to be able to be covered when she roosts.

, If you can, separate the new mother and her eggs from the rest of the flock to prevent them from getting dirty or damaged. If your hen is resistant to moving, then leave them where they are or move the hen and her nest overnight.


Warning: Moving any hen while she is setting may cause her to abandon nest, so if these are expensive eggs, have a back up plan in place.
If you can’t separate them, try to keep the other chickens from bothering the new mother as much as possible.

, Make sure that the mother hen has plenty of fresh water and food. You can switch the hen to chick starter food so that the chicks have the correct food right away. The hen won’t eat as much as normal. Watch her and make sure that she is eating and drinking. You may have to remove her from the nest or set her a food and water dish right beside her nest. Hens will sometimes refuse to leave the nest to eat or drink and starve to death.

, When the eggs start hatching, don’t disturb the hen. She will help the chicks hatch. Eggs begin hatching around the 21st day, and the process can take up to 24 hours or more. Most of the eggs should hatch around the same time. After hatching has started, remove any unhatched eggs after about two days.

, If you opted to have the eggs hatch naturally, the mother will provide all of the necessary warmth and care for the chicks, and you will not need to put them in a brooder.

, For the first six weeks, try to keep the chicks and the mother separate from the rest of your flock. This will allow them to get their bearings without being picked on by the other chickens.


Provide a brooding area that the hen can enter and leave but the chicks can’t leave. This will help keep them out of trouble.

, Chicks need specific blends of food to grow up healthy, so make sure that there is plenty available. Different feeds will recommend changing types after a certain amount of time (6 weeks, 3 months, etc.).

, After about 6 weeks, the chickens will be ready to be introduced to your flock. Introduce them slowly, and ensure that everyone is getting along before moving them in permanently. The mother hen will help keep other chickens in line during the transition process.

Obtain an incubator.,
Set your incubator up in a temperature-controlled room.,
Mark your eggs if you haven’t already.,
Preheat your incubator.,
Place your eggs in the incubator.,
Turn the eggs.,
Candle your eggs.,
Allow the eggs to hatch.,
Move the chicks to a brooder.,
Keep a constant supply of fresh water and feed.,
Introduce the chicks to the flock.",How to Breed Chickens4," You can build your own incubator, or you can buy one from a farm supply company. If you are buying one, make sure that it has easy to control temperature and humidity, as well as good egg-turning options.


One of the biggest factors when choosing an incubator is the number of eggs you intend to hatch. Usually only about 50-70% of the eggs that you incubate will hatch, and then half of those will turn into roosters.

, A stable room temperature will allow the incubator to keep a stable internal temperature much easier. Avoid placing the incubator next to a heater, or next to a window or door.


You will need to check your incubator often, so make sure that you can access it easily.

, If you didn’t mark your eggs when you collected them, you should mark them before putting them in the incubator. This will help you know if the egg has been turned or not.

, Allow the incubator to run for a few hours before placing the eggs in. This will allow the incubator to reach the heat and humidity it needs. If your incubator has fans it should maintain a constant temperature of 100 °F (38 °C). If it does not have fans, keep the temperature at 102 °F (39 °C).


Humidity for the first 18 days should be around 40%.

, Eggs should always have the large end facing up, or be lying horizontally with the large end tilted up. The small end should never be facing up, or the eggs will not develop properly and chick will most likely die trying to hatch.

, Eggs need to be turned around 5 times per day. Turn the eggs gently to avoid damaging the embryo. Do not turn the egg in the same direction each time. They do not get turned on the last 3 days before hatching.

, Candling eggs allows you to tell if embryos are actually growing inside or not. You will need a bright flashlight and a dark room to candle the eggs. Hold the egg with the large side upwards, and shine the flashlight through it. You should be able to see blood vessels beginning to develop, as well as the air sac on the top.


You should be able to start seeing blood vessels after a few days of incubation.
You should see a developed embryo after about 7 days.
Throw away any undeveloped eggs between days 10 and 14.
Humidity needs to be increased to 60-70% the last 3 days to prevent membranes from drying out.
Do not open the incubator in the last 3 days.

, The hatching process can take the better part of a day. As soon as you notice pipping, increase the amount of oxygen that is entering the incubator by opening vents. The newly hatched chicks will not need to eat or drink for 48-72 hours, so allow the incubator to keep working as later chicks hatch.


Avoid helping the chicks hatch. Chicks that cannot hatch on their own will most likely not survive into adulthood.

, One the hatching process is complete and the chicks are dry, you can transfer the chicks to a brooder where they will be raised. You can either build your own brooder or purchase one from a farm supply store.


A 40-watt bulb in a bedside lamp makes for a good source of heat. Use a red bulb to hide injuries so that the other chicks will not pester an injured one. The chicks need a temperature of 99 degrees F the 1st week, dropped by 5° each week until brooder temp is equal to outside temp or chicks are fully feathered. Keep the box in an area that is as draft-free as possible, and use wire to prevent cats from gaining access.

, Your chicks will need to always have an ample supply of food and water. Chicks need a specialized feed formulated for chicks. As they mature, they can graduate to standard chicken feed.


Make sure water dishes are shallow, as chicks can easily drown in their own water dish. Add marbles to waterer to prevent drowning.

, After about 6 weeks, the chickens will be ready to be introduced to your flock. Introduce them slowly, and ensure that everyone is getting along before moving them in permanently.

Provide a suitable area for laying.,
Check the comb and waddles.,
Observe nesting behavior.,
If you have a rooster(s), the hens will begin to allow him to mate with her.",How to Tell when a Hen Is Ready to Lay," Before she begins to lay, be sure that she will have a dark, private place to go when she needs to.
, When the hen is near the point of laying, these will grow noticeably and redden in color. The comb and waddles act as a cooling system for the bird, because they do not sweat. The blood runs through the comb, for instance, and cools as it moves further away from the body.

When hens lay, the cloaca (vent) becomes bright red in color and expands to allow the egg passage.

, Often, the day before the hen lays her first egg, she may practice sitting in the nesting box if there is one available., If not, then a hand placed over the hen's back will often stimulate the hormones, and she will crouch and spread her wings slightly."
"
Prepare your chicken coop.,
Check the temperature inside the coop.,
Keep your chickens confined to the coop for a week.,
Allow the chickens to leave the coop after a week.",How to Train Chickens to Return to Their Coop1," Before you can train your chickens to return to the coop in the evening, you need to ensure the coop is set up properly for your chickens. A basic chicken coop should provide at least twenty-four square feet of space and multiple places for chickens to perch.Make sure there is a plentiful supply of food and water inside the chicken coop.
Wood beams mounted horizontally can provide good perching space for chickens.
If you are raising chickens for egg production, make sure there are enough chicken nesting boxes for each hen (usually one box per four hens will suffice).;
, Coop training requires that you keep your chickens inside the coop for a prolonged period of time. It’s important that you make sure your chickens won’t be too hot or they could suffer from health issues.Your chicken coop should not exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit during coop training.
Install fans to reduce the temperature of your coop if it is too hot.
You may want to consider relocating your chicken coop to a shadier area of your yard if high temperatures continue to be an issue.

, Chickens are often stressed by a transition from one coop or yard to another. Young chickens that are transitioning into living in a coop may take even longer to adjust. Forcing the chickens to remain inside the coop for a week will force them to roost in the coop and begin to consider it a home.Make sure your coop allows you to easily replace food and water dishes without allowing the chickens to escape the coop. Most coops have small doors designed specifically for this purpose.
The bedding at the bottom of the coop will be very messy after a week, so make sure to remove soiled bedding at the completion of the week.

, After a week, open the door to the coop and allow the chickens to wander out into your yard or the area you have fenced in for them. Try not to interfere with them and instead allow them to wander freely.If the chickens do not return to the coop at dusk, it means they have not properly adjusted to it.
You may have to confine the chickens to the coop for another week in order to ensure they accept it as their home and a safe area.
Once the chickens have adjusted to the coop as their new home, they will return to it naturally when they sense danger, want to rest, or at sundown each day.

"
Choose one consistent sound as your call.,
Use treats to train your chickens.,
Let the chickens see you with the treats.,
Use your chicken call and toss treats into the coop.,
Be patient.,
Start concealing the treats when you call your chickens.",How to Train Chickens to Return to Their Coop2," Chickens are not as skilled at interpreting human sounds as dogs are, so it’s important that you choose one distinct sound as your chicken call. Using a consistent sound of any sort may work, but by using a tool instead of your voice, others can call the chickens for you if you aren’t present to call them.A whistle or bell are both excellent options to use as a chicken call. You could also try banging a bowl or cup on the side of the coop.
If you choose to use your voice, make sure it is a distinct sound that you do not make regularly when not calling your chickens.

, You will need to train your chickens to associate the sound of your chicken call with getting a treat in order to get them to come whenever you call. Choose a treat that your chickens do not normally eat otherwise they may grow tired of the treat.Bird seed mixed with meal worms serves as an excellent treat that you can spread around inside the coop each time you sound the chicken call.
Watermelon wedges also serve as good chicken treats, but because they are hard to scatter the less dominant chickens may not be able to get to the treats.

, As you train your chickens to respond to your chicken call, make sure they can see the bag or box of treats as you approach and make the sound. Your chickens do not necessarily need to see the treats for the training to work, but it will often go faster if they see the treats during the early stages of training.Let the chickens see you approach their coop with the treats as you prepare to sound your chicken call.
Chickens will come to associate your behavior with getting treats as well as the call itself.

, By scattering treats into the coop while you use your chicken call, you will help the chickens begin to associate the sound with both treats and returning to their coop.Repeat this process two to three times per day for about a week to establish the pattern in the chicken’s minds.
If your chickens aren’t interested in the treats you are using, try switching to bits of corn.

, Your chickens may not understand the process quickly. You may need to sound the chicken call and make sure they see you distributing the feed a number of times before they start to understand. Early on, the noise will not attract chickens, only the smell and sight of the treats will.Once one chicken figures out the process, it will begin to respond more quickly. Other chickens will follow suit soon after to ensure they get a share of the treats.
Chickens are less likely to respond to this training if they have eaten recently or have only left the coop a short time ago.

, Once your chickens are starting to respond well to the chicken call, start approaching the coop without keeping the treats visible. Once you sound the call, remove the treats from where you’ve hidden them and distribute them like normal.Hiding the treats will help ensure the chickens respond to the call and not the visual que of the treats.
If your chickens become accustomed to coming without seeing treats, that is one step closer to simply coming when they’re called.
Continue to repeat this process until the chickens return to the coop reliably each time they are called.

Identify the source of the stressor in the coop.,
Catch your chickens.,
Confine your chickens to the coop for a week.",How to Train Chickens to Return to Their Coop3," Sometimes chickens that have been coop trained will vacate their coop and refuse to re-enter it. This is often caused by a predator entering the coop or the conditions in the coop being unhealthy for the chickens.Look for any areas that a predator could have gained access to the coop and secure it.
Ensure the coop is relatively clean and the food and water are easy to access. Also check the temperature to make sure it is not exceeding 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
The stressor that caused the chickens to leave must be identified and resolved prior to retraining your chickens to return to the coop.

, Once you have made sure the coop is safe for your chickens, you will need to catch or corral them all back into the coop. If your chickens are able to walk around a large yard, it may be difficult to catch them all.


Try approaching sleeping chickens at night slowly with a flashlight. Don’t shine the light directly on the chickens as it may wake them. Once you’re close, gently pick each chicken up and return it to the coop.
Use food to distract a chicken during the day, then approach it slowly from behind. Once you are close enough, gently pick the chicken up and return it to its coop.

, Once all of the chickens are back in the coop, secure the coop and keep the chickens confined to it for a week. This will re-establish the coop as their safe haven and home in the minds of the chickens.Release the chickens again after a week. If they do not return to the coop that night, check the conditions of the coop again to make sure the water and food can be reached by all chickens and the temperature is below seventy degrees.
Secure the chickens for a second week if they do not begin returning to the coop at dusk and the coop is in good condition.

, You may find older breeding pairs from local breeders, by attending poultry auctions, or by looking online for breeders within your area. Sometimes it may be hard to find the older pairs and you may have to start with chicks.

,, You can ask your local feed store to determine what your exotics need to be fed.

, You should provide separate housing and yards for each type of chicken that you raise.

, Once you have raised your exotic chicken breeding stock and the chickens have begun to produce eggs, you must decide whether you are going to let the hens raise the chicks or if you are going to incubate the eggs and raise the chicks separately from the breeding stock.


If you choose to incubate the eggs, remove the eggs from the hens as they are laid until you have enough to incubate.

The breeding pair should be healthy, happy, clean, free of diseases and definitely purebred. You can purchase purebred chickens from breeders, shows or take a search online.


Keep at least four chickens with a rooster so that you can easily collect eggs into a clutch. This also stops over-breeding between the hens which reduces stress onto them.;
, Purchase a small coop with an attached run for your breeding pair. The coop and run should be secure and clean. The coop should also have inside of it bedding, nesting material, nest boxes, roosts and a full drinker and feeder.


Clean the coop at least every two weeks depending on how dirty it gets. Use proper cleaning equipment.

, Ensure your breeding pair gets a high-quality feed which you can purchase at ranch stores or from another breeder. Give them treats weekly and supplement the hens diet with calcium which can be found from crushed oyster shells or crushed egg shells.

, You can purchase incubators online or from any ranch store nearby. The equipment you will need to hatch and raise chicks are chick drinkers and feeders, chick starter feed, bedding, heat lamp and of course a brooder.

, Collect eggs from the nesting boxes until you have the amount that you want or a full clutch. Store the eggs at room temperature, safely up to a week. After they reach a week old their fertility rate will go down.


If you have a rooster living with a flock of hens all eggs will be fertile.

, Chicken eggs usually take around 21 days to hatch. Be sure to check on the eggs more often around the due hatch dates and do not disturb the hatching process when it begins.

, A brooder is basically a box where the chicks grow up at a young age. First choose the base of the brooder, such as what it is going to made out of. You can use a cardboard box or a plastic tub as an example. Then set down absorbent bedding such as wood shavings. Thirdly set up the heat lamp which should be kept at 95 °F (35 °C). Lastly is the chick feeder and drinker to set up.


The heat lamp should start off at 95 °F (35 °C) and be lowered by 5 degrees every week until it reaches room temperature.

, Once the chicks have hatched and become dry, move them onto the brooder. Show them how to drink and eat by tipping their beaks in the water and feed. Remember to keep an eye on any leftover eggs.

, The chicks, just like chickens, need daily care such as cleaning out the brooder, turning the degrees down by 5 weekly, refilling the drinker and feeder and checking up on the chicks hourly.


The brooder should increase in size as soon as the chicks increase too.

, This will be for the baby chicks once they grow up and can move out of the brooder. It should have the same equipment, security and set-up as the breeding pairs you keep.

, Depending on the weather you get in your location, you have to decide on a time to move chicks out of the brooder. If you get high temperatures then you might have the opportunity to move chicks out at an early age of four weeks. If you get colder temperatures you might have to wait until six weeks and even at that age they may require a heat lamp in the coop to keep them warm.

, Roosters have larger wattles and combs, a longer tail and crow whilst females usually have stubbier tails and smaller wattles and combs. Hens reach maturity once they start laying eggs.

, If you have quite a few roosters in your flock, sell them in pairs. You can post online in poultry forums which is the best source to sell purebred chickens from. You can also try poultry shows too.


Provide a good description of the Ancona chickens including that they are purebred, how old they are, their breed, temperament, etc.
You don't have to sell all your birds. You can keep some to use as another breeding pair or choose to show them at poultry shows.

It is a good idea to search for town ordinances and to check with your homeowner’s association. They may have additional restrictions.
Most cities have stricter laws about roosters than chickens. If you want a rooster in order to grow chickens for meat, you may have more trouble.;
, Chickens make a fair amount of noise. In order to quell their fears, choose not to have roosters, if you have close neighbors.


Although chickens will still squawk, they will not crow like roosters.
Consider offering your neighbors free eggs every few weeks. They may be more amenable to the idea if they reap some benefits. , You will need to stay at home the first day the chicks arrive, and clean and harvest eggs most days of the year.

, If you are raising the birds from chicks, you will have a little bit of time to build it while they grow. If you are buying older hens, you will need the coop immediately.

, Search online for people who make chicken coops in your area, and you may be able to pick up a newly made model to avoid shipping. You can also get plan to build a coop online.


Look for a coop or design with lots of light, so your chickens will be happy.
Choose a coop with a run, so that chickens can roam, but be protected during the day.
You can buy a chicken coop from Amazon, Williams Sonoma, Petco and numerous other outlets.
Find chicken coop plans at http://www.backyardchickens.com/atype/2/Coops.
You can also buy a chicken tractor, which is a portable chicken run.

, Predators, such as raccoons, mountain lions, bobcats and even dogs, can slip through cracks or underneath coops. Invest some money in extra chicken wire, nails and wooden or stone borders.

, Add bedding, feeders and a heat lamp.

, They are often available in the fall, after people have raised too many chicks for their needs. However, it is hard to distinguish hens that are near the end of their egg-laying years (over 2 years old) from those who are young with many egg-laying years ahead of them, so vet your farm or seller well. , Hatching eggs are available through purchase by mail order and in stores. While they may be cheaper than chicks, they may not have the sex determined and some eggs do not hatch.

, A brooder is a heated nesting place that will keep chicks warm. They cannot regulate their body temperature for the first few weeks of life.


Find a thick cardboard or plastic box. It should be smaller when the chicks are small, and then you should replace it incrementally as they grow.
Place the box in an area of your house that has a steady temperature.
Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of pine shavings into the bottom of the box.
Place a heat lamp on the side of the box. Use a thermometer to keep the temperature at a steady 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius).

,, You can usually buy them between February and April. Look for “pullets” because they are female. A full grown chicken between 2 months and 2 years old will lay approximately 5 eggs per week. In order to get a dozen per week, buy 3 to 4 chickens.
Make sure your coop size is large enough to accommodate them. There should be 3 to 4 square feet (0.9 to 1.2 square meters) of space per chicken inside the coop and 10 square feet (3 square meters) of space per chicken outside the coop.

, A mixed group will provide varied sizes and colors. The following are some breeds to consider:


Americana chickens, sometimes called “Easter Eggers” are prized for their colored eggs.
Other popular breeds are Rhode Island reds, Cochin chickens and Barred Rocks.
Breeds called Australorps, Orpingtons and Faverolles are considered “winter layers” so it may be worth buying them in cold-weather areas.
Breeds that are considered “fancy” will lay fewer eggs. They are developed genetically for their looks rather than their egg-laying abilities.

, Keep it at 95 degrees the first week and decrease by 5 degrees each week until you reach 65 degrees (18 degrees Celsius).


The week after you reach 65 degrees, you can take the lamp away completely.
Keep a thermometer in the box so you can accurately judge the temperature. , They are possibly dehydrated and don’t know how to drink yet. Keep an eye on water levels for the next few months to ensure they are staying hydrated.

Thirsty/hot chicks will have their beak open and pant.







, Chickens need food with a little sand in it, and baby chick crumbles have already accounted for this. When you replace chickens in later years, you can try mixing your own scraps with sand.

, If it is still very cold in your area, you might want to wait a little longer.

, They can eat store-bought chicken crumbles, food scraps, insects from the lawn, night crawlers, grass and corn. Cracked corn is essential in the winter to keep their body temperature up.


Free-range eggs have lower cholesterol and saturated fats than store bought eggs. They also have higher omega-3 fatty acids. , Although you may want them to have freedom, they will become prey.


Let them out to run around when you are doing yard work or playing in the lawn.
Keep them in the run until nightfall, and then close up the coop.

, Make sure it is not a real egg, or they can get into the habit of eating eggs. They need to be shown where to lay their eggs.


In later years, having chickens of varying ages helps teach new hens how to behave. Most sources suggest replacing 1/4 to 1/3 of the flock each year.

,, Mother hens produce this coating to protect their eggs from disease.

, They should be stored in the refrigerator rather than at room temperature. Warmer temperatures can promote bacterial growth.

, The following habits will prevent backyard hens from producing contaminated eggs.


Wash eggs that are covered with chicken feces. Roll them around in a sanitizer with 1/2 oz. (14.8 ml) of chlorine to 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water.
Eat eggs quickly. Older eggs have a higher risk of contamination as the egg white breaks down.
Place chicken manure in a composter for 45 to 60 days before adding it to vegetable beds. Fresh chicken manure may contaminate vegetables with salmonella.
Keep potentially contaminated eggs away from pregnant women, young children or chronically ill people, who have a higher chance of infection. "

Advertise your eggs.",How to Sell Chicken Eggs," The first thing you'll need to set aside to do before you start selling eggs is to research the laws on egg selling where you are located or where you are planning to sell. Some states may require you to have a licence whilst others are perfectly fine with egg selling.
, If you are going into an egg selling business, only getting about four eggs a week isn't going to cut it. Keep a flock of twenty or more to ensure you get a good amount of eggs weekly.

Choose egg laying breeds. Do not purchase breeds that cease to lay eggs and go broody far too often such as silkies. You also won't want to purchase bantams which lay smaller eggs and tend to lay less, purchase a stand breed instead. The top egg laying breeds are leghorns, Rhode island reds and Plymouth rocks.
Do not keep a whole heap of roosters. You want a 100% hens so that you get all the eggs you need. If you want to keep a rooster, keep only one in the flock.
Purchase pullets. When starting off with a flock avoid incubating eggs. You will get 50% roosters and 50% hens. By purchasing sexed pullets this will ensure you get eggs and no quarrelling or loud crows between roosters.

, Nesting boxes are essential to the egg selling business. The chickens will learn to lay their eggs in the nesting boxes, making it easier for you to locate them. Also, make sure you have easy access to the nest boxes such as a life up hatch to them., The hens should be kept on a base of a high-quality feed whilst supplemented with calcium to avoid malformed eggs. Calcium can be found in crushed oyster shells or crushed eggs shells.

Make sure that when you reuse the egg shells they are fully rinsed from yolk. This is to avoid egg eating in the flock.

, With a large flock there will be freshly laid eggs all day (hopefully). The eggs should be collected every morning when you let the flock out and every afternoon when you shut the flock in for the night. This will ensure you collect all eggs throughout the day.

Keep track of the date and time of when the eggs were collected. You may need to inform the customer or store of when the eggs were collected.

, You are doing this to ensure the egg has no cracks, isn't malformed, has a strong shell and is freshly laid. Any eggs that have problems with them mustn't be sold. Be sure to take care of the problem too (malformed eggs can be from a lack of nutrition or calcium in the chickens diet)., There may be laws on the condition you sell your eggs in - meaning they might be required to be washed before sold. Even if there isn't a speck of dirt on the eggs it might still be necessary for you to give them a quick rinse before they get packaged up., The eggs should be stored in egg cartons and sold in dozens (12 eggs to a carton). Store them at room temperature unless the climate is hot and humid, in that case they should be stored in the refrigerator.

Again, check your local laws and regulations on egg selling. The eggs might have to go in the refrigerator and might not be allowed to be stored outside of the fridge.

, The eggs should be packaged in egg cartons and labelled with your address, name, contact details and the date of when the eggs were collected. Possibly include a picture of your hens on the front of the packaging and a description of the hens lifestyle - such as whether it's free-ranged, what it eats, it's living conditions, etc.

Check local laws and regulations on egg selling once again. You may be able to use recycled egg cartons or have to purchase non-recycled ones. Visit a local recycle centre to get access to recycled egg cartons.

, Try selling to local stores or people you know such as neighbours, friends or family. Also take a try of selling in online poultry forums, groups, sites or places such as Craigslist.

Keep a good description of you, your hens and the eggs. Including whether your hens are free-range, what diet they're kept on, the collection date, whether you can drop of, etc. Also post a picture of your hens in action - this is proof of their free-range lifestyle.

Spend time with the dog outside.,
Give reprimands suited just to the occasion.,
Leave the area.,
Repeat until you are assured that your dog has the message firmly imprinted in its mind.,
Train your dog to ""leave it"" or ""drop it"".,
Do not ever leave your dog unattended outside with the chickens for a long period of time.,
Give the dog plenty of enrichment opportunities.",How to Train Dogs to Leave Chickens Alone," As the two of you are outdoors together, aim to get close to the chickens. Introduce the dog to the chickens only when the dog is on a leash. It's a good idea to sit near or among the chickens, talking to them gently and to the dog gently too, keeping everything as calm as possible. If the dog can see that you care about the chickens and treat them as important, it may realize that the chickens are off bounds. It is very important, especially with puppies and young dogs, not to ignite their excitability.


If your dog gets too close, reprimand it strongly and tug on its leash or distract it (see next).;
, There are two ways to approach this:


1. Reprimand the dog if it gets too close or seems overly interested in the chickens. Only use the one word, the same word, each time, so that the dog associates that reprimand with not harming the chickens. Haul the dog back on its leash at the same time.
2. If your dog tries to attack or pays too much attention to the chicken, start yelling at the chicken. While it sounds counter-intuitive, your canine will realize something is wrong and it will not want to be involved.

, If the dog seems fixated on the chickens at any time, take the dog away. Making a break will help the dog to let go of its impulse to attack the chickens. Breaking eye contact with the chickens and being distracted will help the dog to calm down.

, This may take a number of weeks, with repeated introductions to the chickens and walkaways, but it is worth the effort to calm the dog and take away any desire to view the chickens as prey. When the dog starts to ignore the chickens, you know you've succeeded and can simply keep an eye on things from this point.

, You'll need treats that are only used for this training. Work out where the dog is watching the chickens from at a safe distance (it is best from inside the house to begin with), then set the following training in place:


Whenever you spot the dog watching the chickens, say something like ""Leave it"" or ""Drop it"".
If the dog breaks its focus and looks at you, reward it with the treat. If it does not, no reward and a repeat of the reprimand.
Once the dog has mastered it from the safe distance, restart the training from a closer distance, with the same responses. Keep the dog on a leash if you're concerned about any potential for bolting after the chickens.
Once the dog has mastered that distance, move in a little closer until you are both among the chickens. Always be with your dog whenever the dog is with the chickens. Once again, reward no looking, no snarling, no chasing and pull the dog away for bad behavioral responses.
Eventually, you should find your dog will obey your command to ""leave it"" or ""drop it"". You can also use this command for other animals or things that the dog won't otherwise leave alone.

, If you go out for long periods at a time, either lock up the dog or the chickens, or perhaps both, so that they can't encounter each other. Always be at the dog's side or very close whenever the chickens and dog are interacting closely.

, Dogs will only attack if they get bored, so always keep your dog entertained. Leave toys, chew toys/bones and things to do for the dog left to its own devices. If possible, get a companion to distract the dog but beware that two dogs after the chickens can form a pack mentality and that is not good news, so train the new dog from the beginning to avoid the chickens.

Buy or build a suitable chicken coop to protect your hens.,
Give your hens fresh food and water everyday.,
Build nesting boxes in their coop.,
Add bedding in the boxes such as wood shaving or straw.,
Clean the coop at least once a month.,
Provide more crushed oyster shells if the eggs are too soft.,
Gather your eggs once a day.",How to Promote Egg Laying in Hens," Give them enough space and make sure it is safe from predators to prevent your hens from getting stressed and not laying any eggs.;
, Feed your hens layer pellets and provide a bowl full of grit and crushed oyster shells, they love table scraps as well.

, Now your hens will have some privacy when they lay their eggs and not feel too stressed.

, This is to keep your hens comfortable and warm meaning they will most likely nest in the box.

, A dirty pen will not be very good as it reduces the comfort and health of your hens.

, Mix the crushed oyster shells in their feed and the calcium in them will make the egg shells become harder.

, This way you will know you are getting fresh eggs and you are keeping track of all the eggs you are receiving.

Monitor her appetite.,
Observe her behavior.,
Look for physical signs.",How to Cure a Chicken from Egg Bound1," If you are concerned that your chicken is egg bound, there are several signs you can look for. In addition to noticing that she hasn't laid any eggs, there are other symptoms of the condition. For example, you can pay close attention to her appetite.If your hen has not eaten any food or shown any interest in her feed for a day, she could be egg bound. An egg bound hen will likely not drink any water.
When you are observing her eating habits, pay attention to whether or not she defecates. An egg bound hen will sometimes have trouble relieving herself.;
, Egg binding is extremely uncomfortable for chickens. The physical pain can cause her to act differently than normal. If your chicken seems apathetic or depressed, that is a sign that she might be egg bound. There are other behavioral signs to look for. Take notice if she goes in and out of her nest repeatedly.
Remember that hens will sometimes take a break from laying for other reasons, such as an intense heat wave. That is why it is important to look for multiple behavioral and physical symptoms when monitoring your hen.

, Your chicken might look different than normal if she is egg bound. For example, her face and comb might appear pale. She might also walk differently. Egg bound chickens often waddle, similar to penguins.Your chicken will appear like she is trying to lay an egg. Abdominal straining is a symptom of being egg bound, along with a hard abdomen.
Pay attention to your hen's feces. Egg bound hens will often have watery diarrhea.

"
"
Reduce egg breakage by preventing overcrowding of the nests.,
Set up your nesting area in a dark, quiet area.,
Provide enough nesting material to cushion the eggs once they are laid.,
Don't let your hens get bored.",How to Keep Chickens from Eating Their Own Eggs1," At minimum, you need one 12"" x 12"" (31cm x 31cm) nest for every four to five hens.Too few nests or small nests can cause eggs to be trampled or squashed and broken, or can stress the birds and lead to more pecking. You want to reduce the chances of a broken egg as much as possible so the chickens never get a taste for them.


Nests should be at least two feet (61cm) off the ground, and four feet (1.22 m) from roosts.Remove any broody hens (hens that insist on sitting on their eggs to hatch them) from the nesting area so they don't occupy valuable nesting space and contribute to higher traffic in the other nests.Consider a nest designed to allow the eggs to roll away into a tray after the hens stand up, keeping them safe from pecking and getting stepped on and broken.;
, Bright lights will stress out your hens and make them nervous, which increases pecking. Turn the nest box away from the opening of the coop and away from the direct sunlight and don't install bright lights. You may need to cover any skylights or windows to create a more comfortable environment.


Remove anything that creates loud noises or sudden movements, as this can frighten the hens. If they get scared and run from the nesting box, they may break the eggs.Reducing light sources can also help keep the coop at a comfortable temperature--if it becomes too hot, the chickens can get irritable and start pecking more., Make sure each nest has a few inches of clean, dry nesting material (such as wheat straw) at all times.If you can keep the eggs from accidentally breaking (by knocking into each other in the nest or being laid onto a hard, unpadded surface), your hens will not have the opportunity to learn how tasty eggs can be.


If an egg breaks in the nest, quickly clean out all the soiled nesting material., A bored and irritated hen is more likely to start pecking, so make sure they have plenty to do. Hang a cabbage for them to peck at and give them adequate space to walk around and exercise.Try to set up an area where they can roam and climb or jump on different obstacles, like tree stumps or roots. If you don't have anything like that in your yard, set up a ladder or a swing for them to climb on.Place a pile of hay in the chicken run. The hens will busy themselves scratching and rearranging the hay into an even layer."

Get a full-size seed of black pepper.,
Catch your suspected hen and place the hen in a pen on her own she might be broody this meaning that she is a fake mother and wants to sit on her eggs, however without a cockerel in the flock she won't be able to hatch the eggs so collect the egg she lays every day.

,
Stick the pepper seed under the hen's tail.,
Know that the itching will make the hen think that she needs to lay an egg, so she will run to her hidden nest.",How to Find Where Your Hen Lays Eggs,";

Prevent your chickens from eating eggs.,
Keep yourself clean and safe.,
Gently scrub off debris.,
Run warm water.,
Wash the eggs clean.,
Dry the eggs before storage.,
Buy new egg cartons.,
Arrange your eggs in cartons.,
Keep eggs refrigerated.,
Use your eggs in a timely fashion.",How to Collect Chicken Eggs," One of the most important factors when you're raising chickens is keeping their environment clean and conducive to nesting. Make sure the chicken pen is spacious enough to accommodate your chickens and that the nesting area is well-maintained.


Make sure you have at least one nest for every three to four chickens. The nests should be large enough to accommodate your hens.Use hay or wood shavings as litter in the pen and coop. This will help keep the eggs cleaner and reduce the chances of them being stained by mud or manure.Nest boxes should be cleaned out at least once every week, and the nesting materials (hay or wood shavings) should be replaced at that time.;
, The longer an egg sits in the nest, the greater its chances of becoming broken, dirty, or unsafe to eat. An egg sitting out in extreme hot or cold weather is even more likely to be unsafe to eat, which is why regular collection is important.Go out to the chicken coop and gather your eggs twice each morning, preferably before noon.Some experts recommend listening for the sound of hens cackling loudly, as this can indicate that they're actively laying eggs.Try to space out your morning collections by a few hours to ensure you get all the eggs that are laid.
Eggs with cracked or broken shells should be discarded immediately.Make sure you do not accidentally mix these eggs in with the ones you are keeping to prevent contamination.

, Depending on how many chickens you have and what kind of climate they are laying eggs in, you may need to consider a third collection. This should ideally be done in the late afternoon or early evening. That way your first two collections will gather any eggs laid overnight or in the morning, and your third collection will gather any eggs laid during the afternoon.Follow the same procedure for evaluating eggs. If any eggs are cracked or broken, discard them immediately.

, Chickens are opportunistic eaters. A chicken won't know instinctively that she can eat her own eggs, but if she encounters broken eggs she will eventually try them. Chickens who have gotten a taste for eggs will quickly grow to like them, and may even begin breaking and eating eggs on their own.Remove broken eggs promptly to prevent your chickens from developing a taste for eggs.
Throw out any straw or wood shavings that have egg yoke on them, and replace them with clean straw/shavings. Check for signs of yoke when you collect your eggs each day.

, Raw eggs can carry bacteria, and so can just about anything in a chicken coop. Manure, mud, and even rodents can introduce harmful contaminants to your eggs. It's extremely important that you keep yourself clean and prevent the risk of disease by maintaining good personal hygiene and having any rodents exterminated.


Do not use poison baits, as these may inadvertently poison your chickens, household pets, and other wildlife.Call an exterminator to deal with rats and mice so that they do not contaminate your eggs.
Wash your hands with soap and warm water any time you handle eggs (whether or not they're broken), chickens, their bedding, or anything else from their environment.Never use your kitchen sink to wash food/water dishes that your chickens use. You may want to also wash your hands in a bathroom or outdoor faucet to avoid contaminating any dishes/cutlery in your kitchen sink.

, You won't need to do this with every single egg, but some eggs may be dirtier than others. Whether it's from mud, manure, or just environmental dirt, sometimes debris can become stuck on an eggshell that won't come off from mere washing.


Use a brush to scrub dirty eggs clean. You can also use an emery cloth or a piece of fine sandpaper, but these materials will be far more difficult to disinfect.Do not scrub too hard or grip the egg too tightly or you may crack the shell.
When you're done, you'll need to disinfect the brush. Dip it into a cup or small bucket containing warm bleach water after each batch of eggs that you scrub., If eggs are washed in water that is cooler than the internal temperature of the eggs, it can cause the shell to contract, pulling water and microbes into the egg. This can lead to contamination, so it's very important to use warm water.


Use water that is approximately 20 degrees Fahrenheit (6.7 degrees Celsius) warmer than the eggs. That means the water should be about 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32.2 degrees Celsius).

, Once you've collected the eggs, it's important that you wash the eggs before storing/refrigerating them to ensure their safety. Wash them indoors using a sink with clean, potable water (your kitchen sink is ideal). You can wipe, spray, pour water over, or dip eggs to clean them, but you should never let them soak in water for any period of time.


Soaking eggs for even 60 seconds can let dangerous microbes through the porous shell. Never let eggs soak, and take great care when cleaning them.If you use detergent to wash the egg, choose a mild, non-foaming, unscented soap that is gentle on your hands, like unscented dishwashing liquid.There are a number of commercial cleaning products designed for use with eggs. Unlike household cleaning chemicals, these are safe to use and can be purchased online or at farm supply stores.
You can make your own cleaner by using distilled white vinegar diluted in half with water. Simply take a clean paper towel for each egg, dip the towel in your solution, and wipe the egg clean.
Another way to sanitize eggs is by briefly dipping them in a solution of one tablespoon of bleach diluted in one gallon of warm water.Just be sure to rinse the eggs off afterwards to ensure that no bleach residue remains on the egg.

, It's very important that you dry the eggs before putting them in cartons or in storage. Eggs can be left on drying racks in your refrigerator, or dried with clean paper towels. Do not use cloth towels, though, as you'll need to discard the paper towels after drying your eggs., Eggs can be stored in egg cartons like the ones you get store-bought eggs in. However, because cardboard (and to a lesser extent, styrofoam) can easily absorb contaminants from the eggs, it's important that you use brand new cartons for each batch of eggs.Do not reuse cartons, as this can spread bacterial contaminants.

, Once you've purchased enough cartons to store your eggs, you can arrange them for storage. Place eggs ""upside down,"" with the small ends down, in each carton.Write the date and the number of eggs in each carton on the exterior of the container. This can help ensure that your eggs are not past their shelf life., Once your eggs are cleaned and arranged in a brand new egg carton, you'll need to keep them refrigerated. Store them in the main section of your refrigerator, as the shelves on a refrigerator's door tend to be warmer than the interior.


Eggs should always be washed before they are refrigerated.Store your eggs at 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (1.67 to 4.44 degrees Celsius).Keep your eggs away from any foods or materials that have a strong odor, as the eggs will take on the environmental odor. Onions, fish, and potatoes are some of the worst offenders that you'll want to keep away from your eggs., Store-bought eggs are usually sanitized and coated in a protective oil, which can increase their shelf life. However, your eggs will obviously not have such protections in place. Eggs also begin to lose quality once they're washed, so it's important to use them before they go bad.


Eggs typically have a shelf life of less than five weeks.If you have too many eggs and they're at risk of going bad, you can freeze them. Crack the shells and pour the eggs into a freezer container, and add a small amount of salt or sugar to prevent gelling.Only freeze fresh eggs. Eat the ones that have been in storage the longest first.

Gather your supplies.,
Keep her warm and comfortable.,
Use massage.,
Apply lubricant.,
Consult your vet.",How to Cure a Chicken from Egg Bound2," It is possible to treat an egg bound chicken at home. You will need a few things to help you cure her. Gather a tub warm water and epsom salts.You will also need some type of lubricant. You can use vegetable oil or petroleum jelly.
An egg bound chicken can die within 48 hours of not being able to pass an egg. If you are going to treat your chicken at home, do it sooner rather than later.

, Your chicken will likely be very anxious if she is not able to lay an egg. Do your best to make her feel at ease. Handle her gently and make sure that she is in a warm space.If she doesn't object, have her sit in a warm tub of water for about 30 minutes.
Try keeping her in a steamy room. A small bathroom with a hot shower running is ideal. The temperature should be between 80-90 degrees. The heat will help her muscles relax so that she can more easily pass the egg., You can apply gentle pressure to try to help your chicken pass the egg. Using one hand, carefully rub her abdomen. Stop immediately if the hen is uncomfortable or anxious.This method is often successful, but it is important to very carefully handle your egg bound chicken. Use light pressure so that you do not accidentally break the egg inside of her.
While you are treating your chicken, keep her hydrated. You can offer her water with electrolytes.

, You can help your chicken expel the trapped egg more easily. Using your hand, apply lubricant such as vegetable oil to her bottom. You will want to wear latex gloves for this step.Give your chicken some time to relax. Leave her alone in a warm space for about 30 minutes and then check back on her.
If the egg has not passed after massage and lubricant, you may want to consider taking further action. It is possible to insert a sharp object into your chicken to break the egg. However, this is not recommended. The egg shell could shatter and puncture the chicken's uterus.

, If you are unable to help your chicken pass her egg, you will want to seek medical help. Call your vet and ask if you can bring your chicken in for treatment. Your vet will have treatment options that are not available to you.He may recommend giving her a calcium shot, which will help the hen to pass the egg.
If this problem is chronic or hereditary, the vet may recommend spaying your chicken.

"
"
Learn about the causes.,
Provide proper nutrients.,
Make sure she is active.",How to Cure a Chicken from Egg Bound3," When you are keeping chickens, it is important that you understand common health concerns. For example, you should be familiar with common causes of egg binding. Age can be a factor. First time layers or senior chickens are most likely to become egg bound.Egg binding can be passed down between generations. There may be nothing you can do to prevent your hen from becoming egg bound.
An abnormal egg can also cause binding. This occurs when an egg is overly large or an odd shape.

, Your hen's diet is important to your overall health. If she is not receiving the right nutrients, she is at a higher risk for becoming egg bound. Calcium and vitamin D are especially important for chickens.If her calcium levels are low, you can try placing a calcium block in her coop. Ask your vet before giving her any supplements.
If you live in an area with limited sunshine, your chicken might need more vitamin D. Consider adding sun lamps to her enclosure.

, Chickens need to move around in order to be healthy. Provide her with plenty of space to roam around. Make her enclosure as big as your yard allows.Scatter her food widely so that she will have to walk in order to get to it. Let her remain outside of her coop for a few hours each day.

"
"
Provide your chickens with a well-balanced feed that is at least 16% protein and has lots of vitamins and nutrients.Look for a feed that is specifically for egg-laying hens.The feed should be high in vegetable fat and proteins.Keep in mind that additional starch (from kitchen scraps or scratch grains) needs to be supplemented with more protein, as it will lower the average protein content of their diet.,
Supplement your chicken feed with calcium.,
Make sure your hens have plenty of water.",How to Keep Chickens from Eating Their Own Eggs2,", If your chickens have a calcium deficiency, they will be unable to produce strong egg shells. If the shells are weak and crack when a hen sit or step on them, the hen will eat the broken egg. Once she discovers it contains protein and fats, and that the shell provides the calcium she needs, she will begin cracking and eating them intentionally.Other hens will observe her behavior and follow her lead.


Ground oyster shells or limestone are great sources of calcium for your chickens. Add 2lbs. (1kg) to every 100lbs. (45kg) of feed or provide a side-feeder with these supplements for the chickens to eat.
Give your hens a dish of fresh whole milk every day for several days to increase their calcium intake.Avoid using egg shells as a source of calcium for your chickens, as they may recognize them by sight or smell and begin eating them on their own. If you choose to do this, grind the shells into tiny pieces so the hens can't tell what they are.You may notice your eggs have softer shells when it's hot, as chickens don't retain calcium as efficiently in hot weather. Increase your chickens' calcium supplements on warmer days., Even if they have a balanced, calcium-rich diet, a lack of water can cause your hens to eat the eggs for their liquid content.Hens need more water than most birds, so check to make sure they always have fresh, clean water to drink.


You can add a vitamin supplement to the water to help your hens absorb calcium."
"
Identify and remove the egg-eating chicken (or chickens) as soon as possible.,
Collect the eggs as soon as possible.,
Use a dummy egg to trick the hens.,
Use blinders, debeak, or cull the egg-eating chicken if you cannot break her of this behavior.",How to Keep Chickens from Eating Their Own Eggs3," You may not be able to catch the chicken in the act, but if you watch the flock for a few days, you should be able to identify the chicken who is responsible. The hen will have dried yolk on her beak or the side of her head, or you may see her searching the nests for eggs to eat.Isolate the hen from the other so she can no longer eat their eggs and they won't pick up on her bad behavior.Watch the rest of the flock to see if the egg eating stops.
If eggs continue to be eaten, the behavior may have already spread and you may need to isolate other chickens.Isolating the hen may be enough of a disruption to stop her from eating the eggs., Most hens lay their eggs before 10am, and the faster you remove them, the less chance there is for one of them to break and encourage the hens to eat the eggs.Gather eggs at least twice a day or more often if possible., Place a golf ball, a rock painted white, or a dummy egg from a feed store in each nest. Gather the real eggs as usual, but leave the dummies. When the hens peck at the ""egg,"" they will find that it is unbreakable and no longer a source of food. They may give up trying to break the real eggs.You can also blow out a raw egg by poking a hole on the top and bottom and blowing out the contents with an egg. Then fill it with mustard and replace it in the nest. Chickens do not like mustard and this can teach them very quickly that eggs are not tasty at all., Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to get chickens to stop eating eggs once they have started. If you have tried everything and your hen continues to go on egg-destroying rampages, you may need to go to extreme measures by debeaking (removing the sharp tip of the hen's beak with a hot blade) or killing the chicken.If you are not willing to go take those measures, you can buy special blinders that will prevent the hen from seeing things straight on. If she can only see from the side, it will be difficult for her to successfully find and peck an egg.You can also permanently isolate the hen or keep her separated from the others until after most of the eggs have been laid and collected. She may continue to destroy her own eggs, but the other eggs will be safe (unless the hens lay more eggs once she rejoins the flock)."
"
Spray the chickens with water.,
Sprinkle spices around the area.,
Use citrus peels.,
Plant unappealing herbs.,
Weed selectively.,
Fence off the plants.,
Cover the ground with wire cloth.,
Surround the base of a plant with stones.,
Plant in containers.,
Keep bare patches away from the garden.,
Plant a separate garden for the chickens.",How to Repel Chickens," When you see chickens wander into your garden, give them a quick spray with a standard garden hose. Keep the water pressure light so that it scares the chickens without hurting them.


The chickens will usually return shortly after you spray them the first time, but if you do this consistently enough, they may eventually associate your yard with the water and start to avoid it.
Since spraying them with a garden hose requires you to actually be present when the chickens invade your yard, you may not catch them all the time. For that reason, you may want to consider installing motion-activated water sprinklers to catch the chickens when you're not around.;
, Dust the ground in between plants with cinnamon, paprika, garlic, curry powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, salt, or a spice blend containing one or more of these options. Apply the spice to the perimeter of your garden, as well.Most chickens don't like the pungent smell of strong spices, so they will tend to avoid areas that reek of them.
If a chicken does wander onto spice-covered ground, the spices will coat the bottom of its feet and create a burning or tingling sensation. The chicken will not actually be harmed, but the feeling will usually be so unpleasant that the bird will flee from your yard in response.

, Gather old lemon peels, lime peels, or orange peels. Scatter them around the perimeter of your garden and in between separate plant beds.


You can also try spraying the ground with lemon juice or lime juice. Use the juice instead of or in conjunction with the citrus peels.
For the maximum effect, you can even cut lemons or limes and scatter the fruit halves over the area.
Chickens generally don't like the smell of citrus, and that smell might be enough to repel them. If a chicken does take a nibble of the fruit, the sour taste will usually repel them, too. The fruit shouldn't actually hurt the chickens, though.

, Some plants are naturally unappealing to most chickens. If you plant these species in your garden, positioning them around and in between rows of other, more appealing plants, the odor of the unappealing plants might be enough to help ward off uninvited chickens.


May perennial herbs work well for this purpose. Some options worth considering include oregano, thyme, lavender, mint, lemon balm, marjoram, chamomile, and sweet woodruff.
Established perennial herbs are also rooted firmly into the ground, making it difficult for chickens to scratch them out even if they do get curious.
When possible, transplant established plants instead of using seedlings or seeds. Only established herbs are strong enough to withstand rummaging chickens. Younger forms might be too weak.
Other plants that have been known to discourage chickens include many standard annuals, such as nasturtiums, impatiens, alyssum, petunias, and marigolds. In areas with little food, however, even these plants can fall victim to the occasional wandering chicken.

, Chickens prefer bare ground, so areas with plentiful weeds and other dense plant material are less likely to attract them than well-groomed gardens with patches of empty soil.


If weeds bother you, a similar option is to plant your flowers or vegetables closer together than you usually would. This can limit the growth of some plants, but ultimately, dense plant beds might be the key to saving the plant bed as a whole.
Some plants are unable to thrive in crowded soil, though. If the weeds are causing your plants to wither, try pulling up some without completely clearing the area. Avoid creating chicken-sized patches of bare dirt anywhere in your garden or yard.

, The easiest way to prevent chickens from attacking a specific plant is to built a fence around it. A simple fence made with chicken wire and some form of support will usually be enough to keep the pests away.Insert a tomato cage over the plant you need to protect or surround the plant with two to four stakes.
Wrap the chicken wire around the stakes, weaving the stakes into the mesh vertically so that the entire structure remains secure.
The entire structure only needs to be 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) tall to keep most chickens out.

, If you want to protect a broad area of mulch, recently sown seeds, or seedlings, you can usually do so by spreading a wire cloth over the entire patch of ground. Most chickens won't like the feeling of wire beneath their feet, so they will tend to stay away.Purchase wire deer netting with relatively small holes and spread a sheet over the entire area you wish to protect. Secure the edges of the of the netting with heavy stones or bricks to prevent it from coming off.
Alternatively, purchase wire hardware cloth and cut a rectangle large enough to cover the area you wish to protect. Cut a small square out of each corner and bend all four edges down at the newly cut corners, creating perpendicular ""legs"" for the wire mesh to stand on. Place the makeshift wire box directly over the area you want to protect. It should remain secure without additional help.

, Another way to protect an individual plant is to completely surround the base of the plant with bricks or medium to large stones. The stones must be large enough to prevent the chickens from moving them.


Wait until the seed sprouts before surrounding the area with stones. That way, you'll know exactly where the base of the plant is located and won't accidentally cover or block it.
Try to use stones that are at least 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter or width. Anything smaller than this might be too lightweight and could be knocked over by notably aggressive chickens.
Keep the base of the plant completely surrounded by a perimeter of brick or stone. Leave as few gaps in this ring as possible.

, Most chickens won't bother with plants grown inside high containers because of the extra effort they would need to exert to do so. It may not be practically to plant your entire garden in containers, but if there is a particular plant you feel especially protective of, container gardening might keep it a little safer.


With notably aggressive chickens, you may need to take a few extra steps even with container gardens. Place the plants on a deck, porch, or other place that is completely out of reach for the chickens. Alternatively, surround the base of the newly sprouted container plant with stones or bricks as though it were planted in the ground.

, Chickens are attracted to bare patches of ground. If you keep the ground of your garden densely covered but have a separate area of bare ground within view, most chickens will leave the garden behind and gravitate toward the uncovered soil.Clear a square space roughly 1 yard (91.4 cm) long and 1 yard (91.4 cm) wide. Remove all plant life from that space, including weeds and grass, leaving only the bare soil behind.
The chickens will gravitate toward this area. They may scratch and poke around for insects, and they'll often use this space for dust baths. If they have a space dedicated for these purposes, they may not be inclined to do these things elsewhere in your yard.
It is also a good idea to sprinkle diatomaceous earth over this patch of ground every few months to keep chicken mites away.

, If you're trying to repel your own chickens, you might want to consider planting two separate gardens: one for you and one for your chickens. Fill the chicken garden with plenty of appealing and healthy edible plants for your chickens to nibble on.


This trick works best when used in conjunction with other chicken-repelling techniques. Creating a separate chicken garden may not be enough to solve the problem if it is the only thing you do.
Your chicken garden should include bushes and low-growing trees that can provide shelter for chickens needing to hide from the sun or from potential predators.
Include an evergreen shrub so that the chickens have cover in the winter, as well.
Planting edible bushes will be a bonus feature for the chickens. Berry bushes, like elderberry and blueberry bushes, are usually good options. When you're trying to manage your own chickens, the use of edible bushes can also reduce the cost of feeding your chickens.

Build your coop off the ground.,
Bury fences underground to keep vermin out.,
Try an electric fence.,
Use a roof to protect your chickens from flying predators.,
Opt for a tall mesh fence.",How to Protect Chickens from Feral Animals1," When building a coop, elevation can help protect your chicken from potential predators. This can prevent rodents from nesting near your chicken coop, as they will be more exposed. Ideally, have your coop elevated about a foot off the ground.Unless you're very familiar with building yourself, it's best to have professionals build your chicken coop.;
, If your coop is already in place, it may be hard to elevate it. However, you can actually insert fences under the ground. This can help protect your chickens from animals that burrow, such as rats.You should bury about six inches of fencing wire under the ground to protect your chickens.

, Make sure the electric current is not too strong. You do not want your chickens to be harmed by an electric fence. Look for electric wiring that aims to stun predators rather than kill them.If you're not familiar with building fences or working with electronics, have the fence installed professionally. You do not want to end up electrocuting yourself while building the fence.

, Chickens are also vulnerable to attacks from flying animals such as hawks. A wire mesh roof should be installed over the coop and run. This can prevent hawks from sweeping in and picking up chickens., Your chicken's coop and run should be surrounded by a fence. A fence should not just serve to keep your chickens inside. It should also protect them from predators. A mesh fence is the ideal material to keep things like foxes and raccoons out of your chicken coop.Your fence should be at least five feet high to protect your chickens.

Distract him with snacks.,
Equip yourself with a rooster shield.,
Dress for beak and chicken-feet resistance.",How to Protect Yourself from an Attacking Rooster1," A fabled rooster-defense tactic with proven effectiveness, tossing out a bit of feed will likely distract your rooster with remarkable consistency. Handfuls of grain may actually be all the protection you need.One of the benefits of feeding your rooster is that this shows him that you are not another rooster. While you may think they’ve already figured this out, they probably haven’t.
Essentially, feeding your rooster will help them recognize that you’re just the giant, uninteresting creature that occasionally feeds them – and, more importantly, not a threat.
Do this repeatedly to both distract them and make them more comfortable with your presence. They’ll likely start calling the hens out to come enjoy the spoils too.;
, If you simply need to get in and get out quickly, perhaps to grab eggs, bring yourself a shield. No need to visit the local armory – a shovel or even large lid will do the trick.Protect yourself by holding your shield between you and the rooster. Never strike at the rooster.

, Wear leather gloves for protection, as well as long sleeved shirts and pants when dealing with an aggressive rooster. Wear boots too, as roosters tend to be much shorter than humans and default towards fighting with their feet.Make sure you boots aren’t too floppy, as floppy boots may agitate roosters.

"
"
Keep your rooster as far away from sleeping quarters and residences as possible.,
Keep him occupied.,
Avoid keeping more than one rooster.,
Use an artificial light source.,
Keep enough food in the rooster's house to keep him occupied.,
Give him things to amuse him.,
Bribe your neighbors.",How to Minimize a Rooster's Noise," This is an easy way to reduce the noise if you live on a farm or a lifestyle block.;
, Ensure that the rooster has hens for friends. If he has only a few hens, he may be noisy because he'd like a larger flock. Add more hens if you can.

, Even keeping them apart (for safety's sake) won't dampen their need to vocalize their territorial claims and they'll set one another going!

, Leave it on at night to make the rooster think it's daylight for longer. Switch off the light before going to bed, hopefully delaying wake up time.

, Give him corn cobs to nibble on and plenty of food to scratch up. Hide some to turn it into a game.

, Provide perches, cubby-holes, boxes, and other things to climb on and through, and to explore. Roosters like having something to do.

, Talk to them about how your rooster needs to be noisy and that in return, they can have lots of fresh, free eggs! If that doesn't work, try swapping him with a less noisy rooster. If he proves too noisy, find someone who lives where noisy roosters don't matter and swap him for one of their quiet roosters.

Keep your chickens in a secured location at night.,
Take precautions with food.,
Be vigilant about cleaning the coop.",How to Protect Chickens from Feral Animals2," Do not let your chickens roam the backyard at night. Many nocturnal predators, like raccoons, may prey on the chickens at night. Before bed, always secure your chickens in their coop to keep them safe., Be very careful about storing food. The scent of chicken feed can attract predators to your coop. Chicken feed should be stored in secure, closed containers. You should also be careful with food if you have other animals. Do not leave dog or cat food outside overnight, especially not near the chicken coop., Make a daily habit of cleaning the coop. You want to clear out any material that may attract predators. At the end of the day, scoop up and discard any fallen chicken feed from the coop. If you give your chickens table scraps, remove the table scraps as well.If you have fruit trees near your chicken coop, be on the lookout for fallen fruit.

Use cats for protection only if they are familiar with chickens.,
Invest in dogs.,
Use light to scare off predators.,
Be wary about setting traps.",How to Protect Chickens from Feral Animals3," Cats can help target many predators such as rats and vermin. However, cats may also view chickens as prey. Only use cats as protection if they're comfortable around chickens.New cats and kittens can be introduced to chickens gradually, especially at a young age. Have them interact through a fence or enclosure for a few weeks. Then, try a face-to-face interaction in which the chicken and cat are both restrained.
All cats are different. Some cats will always target chickens as prey, even when properly introduced. If your cat seems aggressive towards chickens, even after controlled interactions, you should not let the cat outdoors near the chickens.

, Farm dogs can be great for protecting chickens. Working breeds like Border Collies will chase off potential predators. However, dogs may sometimes target chickens as well. It's a good idea to keep dogs outside of a chicken coop. If you notice a dog being aggressive towards a chicken, scold the dog in the moment. Eventually, your dog may learn to leave chickens alone., Install a bright security light or a motion activated light near a coop. Bright lights can help deter predators at night when you and your chickens are sleeping. Lights may scare potential predators away from the coop., If your chickens are being targeted frequently by a predator, you can set baited traps. However, traps should only be used in extreme circumstances, as their effectiveness is questionable. Predators like raccoons often travel in groups, so you will have to take out an entire family for traps to be effective. If you do set traps, you will need consistently keep them up for awhile to catch all predators.You should also make sure to release animals like skunks and raccoons far away from other people's homes. You do not want to simply make predators another person's problem.

Move with haste.,
Don't incite him with any indications of aggression.,
Avoid other common mistakes that set roosters off.",How to Protect Yourself from an Attacking Rooster2," You shouldn't rely on avoiding your rooster as this is only a temporary solution to dealing with an aggressive animal. However, if you simply need to get in and out of the coop or chicken enclosure and don’t have time to do some rooster behavior-adjustment training, its fine to use some avoidance maneuvering. Move at a steady pace and give him a wide berth., Avoid walking directly towards the rooster. On the other hand, don’t obviously creep around him either, as a show of weakness may also provoke him. Avoid staring at him too. This is a classic, albeit unintended, act of aggression that has led to untold numbers of human-chicken battles., Summarily, if you’re simply trying to prevent human vs. rooster conflict, wear the appropriate clothing, give the rooster some space, and avoid doing anything to overtly challenge his monarchy. Roosters are quite literally looking for a challenge at all times. Don’t give them one, unless you’re ready to wrangle.


If you’re carrying a bucket, don’t swing it around lackadaisically, as this may be perceived by your rooster as a call to arms.
Don’t chase the hens. He will defend them to his last rooster tooth, or worse, may even get jealous if he thinks you’re flirting with one of his lovers.

"

Recognize when he’s about to attack.,
Take ownership of the coop.,
Cuddle him into submission.,
Walk around while holding the rooster.,
Be patient.",How to Protect Yourself from an Attacking Rooster3," Roosters will warn you that they’re coming for you by lowering their heads and initiating their war dance. Prior to this show of force, early warning signs include prolonged staring and running up on your from behind., When a rooster attacks, you have a choice. You can run and forever be looked down upon by a multicolored bird with a jiggly throat, or you can send a message that it’s your yard, and it’s about time he acts right.Immediately leap into action as soon as the rooster become visibly agitated by scooping him up with gloved hands and sleeved arms.

, Place him beneath one arm, with his wings held against his sides and his feet beneath him. You may need to use your other hand to hold both of his legs together at first.Hold onto him for at least 15 minutes, not matter how angry, loud, and recalcitrant he becomes.

, Relax. Do whatever you had intended to do as though he wasn’t there. It make take him 30 minutes to fully calm down. Don’t put him down until he is settled.If he gets sassy as you set him down and begins squawking and kicking again, repeat the process until he walks off calmly when you set him down.

, You will likely have to repeat the process for weeks, as the rooster will not readily cede power to you and your less attractive feathering. Eventually, however, he’ll accept your gentle tutelage and resort to only bullying everyone else.If you have small children that interact with the flock, and you are unable to train your rooster to chill out around humans, consider getting rid of him."

Repeat introducing the dog to the chickens on a leash.,
Let your dog sniff around inside the coop.,
Introduce your dog to one of the chickens.,
Keep a lookout for any discomfort in the dog or chickens.,
Deal with a dog that cannot be trusted with chickens.",How to Introduce a Dog to Pet Chickens1," Prior to introducing your dog to the flock, you will want to tire them out. Make sure they get plenty of exercise beforehand so that they will not use the chickens for play or exercise.Take your dog for a long walk.
Go for a swim with your dog.
Play a game of fetch.;
, Make sure your dog is well fed and has had plenty of exercise. You don’t want them to be hungry or too energetic for the first meeting. If you leave them hungry, they might want to eat your chickens., Your chickens should be in a fully enclosed chicken coop. The chicken coop should be predator proof, without any holes or gaps in the wire mesh.

, You will need to have strong command of your dog for the introduction. A short leash will give you greater control, allowing you to keep them on heel throughout the introduction and hold them if they get too excited., Start by slowly walking your dog around the perimeter of the chicken coop. On the walk, keep a close eye on your dog’s body language. Depending on their behavior, you may want to take them closer to the coop or, if they get aggressive, take them inside.If the dog doesn't react towards the chickens, give it a treat.
If they exhibit aggressive behavior, you should take them inside and try the perimeter walk at a different time or the following day. Do not reward the dog for the bad behaviour.
If they seem relaxed but also interested, you can take them a little closer and let them smell the area around the coop.
Look for warning signs such as barking, growling or staring hungrily at the chickens. If they exhibit these behaviors, you should take your dog inside.

, Once this has been completed, let the chickens out of the cage so they can wander around. Keep the dog on the leash at all times.


If the dog doesn't react to the chickens, give it a treat.

, If your dog has exhibited good behavior in training outside the coop and is able to walk around the perimeter of the coop without exhibiting aggressive behavior, you could try going inside. Walk into the coop to check for eggs with your dog. Let your dog sniff the chickens and explore the coop a bit, while leashed.If your dog seems comfortable with the environment, they will hopefully get used to the chickens as part of the house.
If your dog gets aggressive, you should restrain them and bring them inside.

, This step will require two people. Pick a chicken that is completely comfortable being handled. While one person holds the chicken, the other person holds the lead of the dog. The first person needs to be cuddling and talking to the chicken in a soft, soothing voice; this will let the dog know that the chicken is a friend.


If the dog behaves well, you can reward it with a treat.
If the dog barks or growls, you should take it away. You will need to do additional training away from the chicken coop. You may need to hire a professional trainer.

, Remember, you know your dog; if you feel or think that something bad might happen, remove the dog from the situation. It is better to be safe than sorry.

, Despite your best efforts, it may be the case that your dog will always want to hunt the chickens. If this is the case, don’t blame your dog or the chickens. Rather, take practical measures to keep your dog away from the chicken coop. Make sure the chicken coop is secure. Keep your dog on a leash whenever you are working in the coop or whenever the dog is close to the chickens."

Pour the sour milk into a container with a lid.,
Place the container in a warm and sunny spot.,
Wait a few days.",How to Use up Sour Milk for Hen Food," Put the lid over the milk to help generate heat and to cover the odor.;
, If you can deal with any odors, place it indoors. If not, put it somewhere outside where it cannot be attacked by vermin.

, When the milk has solidified and become crumbly (about 3-4 days), it is ready to become chicken feed. Crumble it loosely and share with the hens! If preferred, place it into a feeding container of some sort to prevent it mingling with soil.

Provide your hens with the right food and nutrition at the right time.,
Add calcium to the hen’s diet, at the right time.,
Allow your hens to roam free.,
Maintain appropriate amounts of protein.,
Find some good layer feed.,
Provide your hens with a bowlful of grit.,
Avoid feeding your hens large amounts of table scraps.,
Feed your hens mealworms, sometimes.,
Maintain a healthy coop.,
Start your chicks on a healthy diet geared toward egg laying early.,
Switch your chicks to grower feed at the right age.",How to Feed Laying Hens," When your hens are mature enough to start regularly producing (18 to 24 weeks depending on breed), you need to make sure that they have the right feed and nutrients to produce eggs suitable for human consumption. Otherwise, your hens' egg production will be poor and their eggs might break before they make it to the table. The proper diet will also make sure that your hens look and feel healthy., After about 20 weeks, you need to up the amount of calcium your laying hens consume. Laying hens need 2.5% to 3.5% calcium in their feed, which is higher than other chickens. The calcium will help provide the proper nutrients to support healthy eggs. Consider:


Oyster shells.
Calcium grit.
Feeds with added calcium., Free range chickens are able to supplement their diet with a variety of insects, berries, seeds, and grain. This will not only help them secure the nutrients for healthy egg production, but it will also improve the taste of your eggs. In addition, you’ll have happier hens, and you might even be able to sell their eggs for more money to a population that is increasingly concerned with the well-being of farm animals., You don’t want your laying hens to have too much protein in their diet. While meat hens need 20-24% protein in their diet, laying hens only need 16% or less protein. As a result, be alert to the type of feed you buy, and what your hens are consuming. To boost protein, consider:


Letting your chickens free range for worms.
Extra grower feed.
Feed that is formulated for laying hens., Layer feed is feed that comes with the nutrients that laying hens need to produce healthy eggs. If you don’t want to spend a lot of time overseeing your hen’s diets, consider purchasing a pre-mixed layer feed. If you do formulate your own layer feed, make sure that it has the protein (16% or less), and calcium levels (2.5% to 3.5%) to insure that your eggs will be strong enough to make it to the table.


Typical laying hens will consume a quarter a pound of feed a day.
Provide your hens with all of their food at one time, preferably in the morning.
Always check feed levels to make sure your chickens have enough feed., Grit is tiny pieces of stone or gravel that stay in the hen’s gizzard and help to grind down their food. Grit is important for hens as it helps them digest their food. Otherwise, your hens won’t be able to digest and use all of the nutrients they’re supposed to be getting in order to produce healthy eggs. Adding grit to your hens' diets is especially important if your hens are confined and you don’t allow them to roam., While table scraps can supplement the diet of your hens, you need to be careful about what you’re feeding them. Some foods will hurt the egg production of your hens, rather than help it. Consider:


Egg laying hens should not be fed more table scraps than they can consume in 20 minutes.
Potatoes, pasta, beans and even stale bread are all ok.
Avoid avocado, chocolate, citrus fruits, and tomato stems.
Avoid foods with strong tastes like garlic and onions, as the eggs might take on those tastes.
Table scraps could also increase the fat intake of your hens, making them overweight and unhealthy., Mealworms are little worms that provide hens with lots of protein and other nutrients. As a result, you should consider mealworms only as a treat for your hens. While they might make your hens happy, feeding them too much could undermine your egg production by raising their protein levels too high.


Give your hens mealworms maybe once a week.
Mealworms are probably unnecessary if your hens free range, as they’ll be able to find their own worms and other insects.
You can grow your own mealworms, if you don’t want to buy them., The overall status and quality of your coop is going to impact egg production, and will impact your hen's feed consumption. Unhealthy coops are breeding grounds for bacteria and disease, will contaminate your food, sicken your chickens, and potentially lower your egg yield. A few simple steps will prevent such problems. Consider:


Cleaning out the coop every month or so.
Allowing your chickens to roam free a couple hours a day.
Not overcrowding your coop with too many hens. Recommended size is 4 square feet per hen for birds that are allowed to free range and 10 square feet per hen for birds that are confined at all times., Chicks should get starter feed until they are 6 to 8 weeks old. Starter feed will give them all of the vitamins and nutrition needed to develop into healthy egg laying adults. The amount of feed chicks need per day vary on breed and on age, so consult the back of your feed bag or someone at your local feed store. A sound investment and good care early on, will help you get more eggs later., After 6 to 8 weeks old, you should switch your chicks to grower feed. This will help them grow, mature, and develop into the egg layers you want them to be. At 20 weeks, you’ll have to switch them to a feed more suited toward egg-producing. Consult the back of your feed bag or an employee at your local feed store for information on how much to feed different types of chicks at different ages."
"
Avoid feeding your chicks within an hour after they have hatched.,
Purchase a chick started feed.,
Purchase a chick feeder and drinker.,
Provide water and food at all times.,
Refill and clean the food and drinker once every week.",How to Feed Chicks," You might want to wait until the chicks are a day old first instead of feeding them straight away. Meanwhile, you'll need to purchase a suitable feed for them if you haven't already done so.;
, Chick starter is a type of feed for chicks. The difference between chick started and regular feed is that it contains all the nutrients that the chick needs in life, so you don’t need to feed your chicks any extra treats. The crumbles are also smaller so it's easier for the young chicks to digest, where-as they might choke on regular feed because of the large size of the grains.


Chick starter can be found at your local ranch supply or pet store. The higher the quality of the brand the better the feed is, but it may be more expensive. There are two types of feeds; medicated and non-medicated. The medicated feed simply helps prevent Coccidiosis which is an illness in chickens.







, A feeder and drinker is where the chicks will be eating from. Using a feeder is better than placing the food on the floor or feeding the chicks out of your hand as this can create a mess and use up most of your time. Make sure the feeder and drinker is for young chicks and not grown chickens.


Drinkers prevent your chicks from drowning; however you can always put some marbles or pebbles in a shallow water bowl to prevent chicks from drowning. The shine from the marbles will encourage the chicks to drink too.
If you wish, you can feed the chicks out of your hand. Place small amounts of food in the palm of your hand and let the chicks come to you and eat. This is great for taming the chicks and it grows a bond between you and them too.







, Chicks need access to food and water all throughout the day. If you don’t they will become thirsty or hungry. Although you don’t have to provide the food during the night, but that is your choice.

, Hygiene is important for young chicks, and if you don’t clean their brooder frequently it will get very dirty and the chicks will be prone to diseases. Rinse the feeder and drinker every week and refill the water/food every day or two. Every two or three weeks you’ll want to bleach the feeders and drinkers."

Do reward training away from the chickens.,
Take your dog with you while you do chicken coop chores.,
Practice ‘sit,’ ‘off’ and other skills near the chicken coop.",How to Introduce a Dog to Pet Chickens2," You should start by training your dog away from the chickens. Teach them basic commands such as sit, stay, heel, off and take it. Once they have these commands down, you will be well prepared to begin training them near the chickens. Most importantly, you should use reward training to get them to understand ‘off’ and ‘take it.’


Hold a treat in your closed hand. Don’t let your dog get at the treat until they have moved their mouth away from your hand. Once they move their muzzle away from your hand, give them the treat. Then, associate these behaviors with the words ‘off’ and ‘take it.’

, While you are doing the chicken coop chores, take your dog with you. It is best to start while your dog is a puppy. Your dog will gradually get used to being around you and the chickens. If you need both hands, you can tie up your dog away from the chicken coop. While you are doing your chores, keep an eye on your dog’s body language.


If your dog shows any signs of aggression such as barking, take them out of the coop and try again another time., Once your dog knows basic commands, try doing some training exercises near the chicken coop. Choose an area that is close enough to the coop that your dog can smell and see it but not right beside it. Practice basic skills such as ‘sit,’ ‘off’ and ‘take it.’ If your dog can follow these commands near the coop, they should get better at following them in or near the coop while you are doing chores.Watch their body language. If your dog loses focus on the training and gets very excited by the chickens, you may need to move further away or try again another time.
Start training them on leash. If they perform well, you can try training them off leash near the chicken coop. Make sure you can catch them if needed.
Try training them at different times of the day so they get used to being near the coop in different situations.

Learn about your dog’s breed.,
Recognize whether you have a breed with a high prey drive.,
Notice if your mixed breed dog is large and playful.,
Identify the risks of a toy dog.",How to Introduce a Dog to Pet Chickens3," Some dogs are bred for hunting, some for herding and some for companionship. Depending on the history of the breed, your dog may be more or less suitable as a guardian of chickens or other livestock. You should research whether you have a breed that is suitable to keep with chickens, since not all breeds will be easily trained to guard or even coexist with chickens.Shih Tzu are trained for companionship. They are generally happy and very affectionate.Some dogs are particularly well suited to guarding birds and chickens, such as Anatolian Shepherds. They will herd and take care of birds if properly trained.Large guardian dogs such as Great Pyrenees are also known for their ability to herd and guard flocks., Some dogs, like Greyhounds, have a high prey drive. If you have one of these dogs, they will be very hard to train for the purposes of guarding or getting along with chickens. Their natural inclination will be to hunt the chickens, following the characteristics of their breed.Golden retrievers are also bred for hunting.

, Some mixed breeds may not have a high prey drive but could still kill one of the chickens by virtue of their size or an attempt to play around with them. If you have a mixed breed that is playful but large, it could inadvertently kill a chicken in an attempt to play., If you have a toy dog such as a Chihuahua, it may want to make friends with the chickens but stress them out by chasing them around all the time. Although it may not kill the chickens, it could otherwise damage the flock by, for instance, separating chicks from their mother."

, Pre-crush them a bit and then spread them on a tray with baking paper if you wish. The egg shells should be prepared to go in the oven.

, Once you collect the egg shells you may notice some yolk or whites leftover. If fed straight to your hens they may start to eat their own eggs after they've laid them due to the leftover yolks and whites stuck to the egg shells. Because of this you'll want to cook the shells.


You can also microwave the shells for up to a minute or more for a quicker method. Chuck them on a plate or bowl and then heat them up.

, Once baked, the egg shells tend to be easier to crush. You can decide on whether you want to crush the egg shells with a rolling pin or grinder of some sort or you can blend them up in a food processor to make a fine powder.

, You can provide them separately or mix them with their feed. If you're providing them separately avoid chucking them on the floor. Instead place the egg shells in a small bowl for the hens to eat from as they please. The hens won't eat the shells like their usual feed, they'll eat them if they're in need of calcium.

Give your chickens the freshest fruits and veggies.,
Feed them sunflower seeds.,
As for the fruit and vegetables, stay particular to blackberries and carrots.

,
Feed them grass.,
Prepare the food correctly.,
Feed them fruit and vegetable peels.,
Be aware that this method is made for the purpose of the chicken's best enjoyment, activity and egg production.",How to Feed Chickens Organically1," In the wild, chickens wouldn't have dried corn bits, fruits and seeds. They would have to get their food themselves, so the best choice would be to feed them the fresh versions of those. Corn bits right off the cob, mashed fruits and vegetables, and fresh seeds make great food for your chickens.;
, Sunflower seeds have many essential oils, so they are highly recommended.

,, Surprisingly, grass is very good for the chicken's immune system. Additionally, the chlorophyll helps the chicken's eggs gain a good pigment and may even increase their size. Make sure you feed them soft grass; this is the only case where it is okay to give the blades to them whole. They will usually eat it vertically.

, You can grow these food items yourself to ensure extra freshness, but buying them from the store is also okay. If bought the food from the store, make sure you wash the food items and that they are at room temperature. Cold foods could cause discomfort or discourage the chicken from eating. Everything should be mashed or diced in order for the chicken to eat it without choking, or to actually be able to eat it at all!

, When you cook and use vegetables or fruits and peel them, giving these to your pet would be a good idea. Except for potato peels. It is difficult for chickens to eat and digest these. Zucchini peels, carrot peels (washed) and squash peels are all great.

, This method could cause your chickens to remain at a median weight for their breed, so they would be skinny. This is why you should use these steps and feed them often (depending on the breed).


Small breeds (3-6 pounds or less, female) should be fed approximately half a cup of mix every 8 hours.
Medium breeds (7-12 pounds, female) should be fed approximately 3/4 cup of mix every 6 hours.
Large breeds (13-20 pounds, female) should be fed one full cup of mix every 6-8 hours. If you are seriously concerned at any point about your chicken's health, weight, or behavior, do not hesitate to call your local vet and get your pet checked out right away.

Feed your chickens the right foods to bulk them up.,
Make a broccoli and flaxseed mixture.,
Make a carrot mixture.,
Make a tomato mixture.,
Remember this method may not work because some breeds of chickens were bred to fight and are not meat or egg sources.",How to Feed Chickens Organically2," You may be a chicken owner that breeds chickens for meat. The first method is good for keeping them healthy and happy, but not so good for bulking them up for slaughter or consumption. This method will teach you to feed them organically, but to help them bulk up, too.


For bulk, you can feed your chickens the following: Broccoli, carrots, leeks, peas, leftover bread crumbs, dried tomatoes, flaxseed, pumpkin seeds and red grapes. These are all great for immunity and bulk, but your chickens may be less active.

, Here's what you'll need: one cross section broccoli, about 15 red grapes, 1 cup flaxseed, one stem of a leak and a few blades of grass. Here's what you do:


Take the whole broccoli cross section and split it as much as you can by hand.
Then cut the green flower heads until they are just little bits on the plate (resembling green seeds).
Take the red grapes and mash them however you see fit (by hand, by blender or dicing). #*You then take the leak and split it vertically until it is just a few thin twigs of leeks.
Mix the broccoli flower heads, the red grapes and the flaxseeds, but not too much, not like a mush. Stick the leek twigs in and stir once. Throw blades of grass on top and give to your chicken.

, For this recipe, you'll need the following: A carrot, 1 cup of peas and  3/4 of a cup of pumpkin seeds and some blades of grass. Here's what you should do:


Cut the carrot into wheels from the tip to the leaves.
Dice until smaller than pinky fingernail.
Mash half the cup of peas (this half heated) and leave the other half whole (no heating, cold but not frozen).
Mix carrots bits and peas along with pumpkin seeds.

Watch for difficulty as the chickens molt.",How to Clip Chicken Wings," They're quick little things, so this is easier said than done. If your chickens are in a pen, it helps to have a partner to corner the chicken and catch it. Consider using a box to enclose the chicken quickly.


If the chicken starts flapping its wings, gently hold them down with your hands, pressing them against her body, until the chicken calms down some.
During the procedure, be careful of their claws and beak. Use two hands to hold them them by the breast with their legs tucked back and their wings secured. This usually makes them go fairly docile, making them easy to manage.;
, Flight feathers are the longest wing feathers, and look the most like the traditional ""feather"" you might see in a picture or drawing. They're also sometimes a slightly different color than the other feathers. The feathers you'll clip are the first ten, which are the longest feathers and are used for taking off.It helps to have a partner hold while you clip, or vice versa.

, Clip about halfway between the tip and the quick. If you aim for the halfway point of the feather, you won't even be close to hurting the chicken but will take enough of the feather off to make it difficult for the chicken to fly. In general, you don't need to remove more than 6 centimeter (2.4 in) of the feathers. You want to make the procedure as comfortable as possible for the chicken, so take off as little as possible.


Either wing is fine to clip, but only clip one. This will throw the chicken's take-off off balance, keeping them flightless. A strong chicken could take off with symmetrical wings, even shortened.If you want to clip the feathers shorter, hold the wing up to the light so you can see how far the blood vessels start toward the quick. Clip just above that point to remove most of the flight feathers.

, Sometimes, the clipped feathers won't molt as easily and you'll need to help them along slightly. Repeat the procedure of catching the chicken and work the feathers out gently with your fingers if the chicken seems to be having trouble molting them.


Re-clip the wings in the same process after the chicken has finished molting.

Saw or cut four half moon holes on the bottom side of the bucket.,
Take the larger lid.,
Make small holes in the bottom of the bucket.,
Pour the food in the top of the bucket.",How to Make a Chicken Feeder1,";
, Screw it on the bottom of the bucket so that the bottom part of the lid is facing up.


This lid should be larger than the bucket; this will make it easier for the food to be reached.

, Thread through string or wire for hanging the feeder. Hang it about crop height, in an enclosed area of the chicken coop or barn.

, Screw on the lid. The idea is that if you pour the food into the top of the bucket, some of the food will go through the holes and fill up the lid on the bottom until the food can't go out anymore. But if you take some food out of the bottom lid, it will fill back up again.

Purchase or salvage a 10 foot (3.0 m) PVC plastic pipe, of about a 4-inch diameter.,
Measure the pipe into three even divisions.,
Measure in from the ends to account for the end caps for the pipes.,
Draw guidance lines down the side of each pipe indicating the trough area to be cut away.,
Cut the top quarter of the pipe off.,
Drill holes for the screw hanger attachments to each end of the pipe, with the end cap intact.,
Remove the end caps.,
Attach the screw hangers to the end caps.,
Repeat for each length of pipe you're turning into a chicken trough feeder.",How to Make a Chicken Feeder2," You'll also need six end caps.

, Mark, then cut each division to make three sections. This will allow you to make three separate trough feeders for the chickens.

, Leave these sections intact; mark where they are. When cutting out the trough, leave both of these ends intact.

, Start at the cap end point on end, and end at the cap end point on the other side. It is recommended that you cut away about one quarter to not quite a half of the pipe, ensuring that there is plenty of pipe left to contain the chicken feed, but enough space for the chickens to get their heads inside the pipe trough.

, Discard of this unless you have another purpose for it.

, That way, you get the hole size exact.

, Smear glue around the end section, then reattach the end caps, carefully aligning with the hole you've just drilled. The glue will ensure that no amount of bumping or nibbling will cause the end caps to fall off.

, Attach the other hanger or chain and hang in place in the chicken shed or coop.

, Then add feed, and watch the chickens enjoy their meal.

Find a clean piece of PVC gutter of a decent length.,
Stand the wood blocks each end of the gutter.,
Measure the width of the gutter.,
Drill holes into the end of the gutter and through into the wood block ends.,
Place the gutter trough feeder where you wish to feed the chickens.",How to Make a Chicken Feeder3," Also find two lengths of scrap 2x4 wood that measure the same as the gutter and two blocks of the same scrap 2x4 wood for the frame. You'll also need some nails or screws and a drill/hammer.


The length of the gutter should be sufficient to accommodate the amount of chickens being fed. You may wish to make more than one trough if you have a lot of chickens.
The length of the wood blocks should be the same as each other but longer than the width of the gutter, to ensure stability. At least a 2 inch/5cm extra length either side is essential, perhaps more, depending on the length of the gutter used.
Both the wood lengths and the block lengths should be the same height/width from the ground, to ensure it all sits level.

, The wood should stand upright, to lift the gutter right up off the ground. The gutter should sit about halfway onto each wood block.

, Mark this on the wood block ends. Attach the two wood lengths to the wood block ends, following this measurement; nail or screw into place. This creates the wood frame on which the gutter sits.

, Add the nails or screws to keep the gutter firmly attached to the block ends. You may wish to attach a few nails to the length support through the gutter as well, but only do this if it seems necessary.


Drill a few extra holes if using this feeder outdoors; this will allow rainwater to drain out quickly, these holes will need to be away from the wooden support.

, It's now ready for use.

Don’t feed chicks any food within one hour of their birth.,
Give newborn chicks a mixture of one gallon water to one-fourth cup sugar and possibly one tsp.,
Purchase a starter feed from a supply store.,
Consider purchasing a medicated starter if your chicks have suffered from coccidiosis in the past.,
Set aside about 30 lbs.,
Change the starter feed to “grower feed” purchased from a feed supply store at 8 to 10 weeks.,
Begin giving your chickens small kitchen scraps when they are 10 weeks old or bigger.,
Place a bowl of grit nearby.,
Don’t feed chickens any layer feed before 18 weeks.,
Keep in mind that chickens only eat during the day.,
Begin feeding your laying hens layer feed at 20 weeks of age.,
Provide a supplemental source of calcium in a bowl.,
Give your layers limited treats each week to supplement their diet.,
Supplement a chicken’s diet with “scratch” in the winter.,
Don’t feed your chickens citrus fruits, salty foods, rhubarb, chocolate, onion, garlic, lawn mower clippings, uncooked beans, avocado skins or pits, raw eggs, sugar/candy or raw green potato peels.,
Allow your chickens to graze around your lawn.,
Purchase broiler starter for meat chickens until they are six weeks of age.,
Buy broiler finisher pellets to feed your chickens from six weeks until slaughter.,
Consider making food available to your broiler chickens at night as well as in the day.",How to Feed Chickens," Wait to start them on regular feed until they are one day old.;
, of terramycin. Terramycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections., These mixes should contain 20 percent protein, which is higher than the amount you will feed to older chickens. Feed them starter feed from day one to eight weeks old., If they have been vaccinated, choose unmedicated starter feed.

, (14 kg) of starter feed to feed 10 chicks for six weeks., The protein level should be around 16 percent protein. Birds that will be used for meat can have up to 20 percent protein in their grower feed.

, Treats should be very small, since they will replace part of the nutritious grower feed that day. Chickens can eat just about anything such as toast, cereal, biscuits, corn, noodles and even meat!

, Grit helps the chickens digest vegetable and fruit treats. Purchased feed is already mixed for adequate digestion without grit and free-range chickens don't need grit as they find plenty of things in the ground that helps them digest their food.

, The calcium content can hurt the kidneys and reduce the chicken’s life span.

, Cover any leftover food to protect it from pests at night. If you don't cover the food there is a chance that you will attract bugs, mice, rats and other creatures seeking for food.

, You can also use all-purpose feed; however, layer feed can have up to 2 percent more protein and more calcium content to promote better eggshells. You will need 18 to 24 lbs. (8 to 11 kg) of feed per week for 10 chickens.You can purchase layer feed in pellet, mash or crumble forms, the choice is up to you. If the eggs turn soft provide the hens with more calcium. Keep in mind that it is common for a hens first egg to be a bit unusual such as double yolks and soft shells.

, Crushed oyster shells or crushed eggshells can increase the calcium. Never mix the calcium into the layer feed.

, The healthiest treats are mealworms, pumpkin and pumpkin seeds. Provide a bowl of grit (unless free-range) to help them digest it.

, They eat more when it is cold out. Scratch is made of cracked corn, oats, wheat and other grains. It should be given in limited quantity and taken away almost entirely in the summer.

, These are toxic to chickens., Lawns with weeds and tender, young plants can increase nutrition. However, lawns sprayed with pesticides or featuring only one type of grass can take the place of more nutritious food sources.


The benefits of having your chickens graze around your lawn is that they don't need to be provided grit and most of their diet is made up from the things they find inside the grass and ground., This is different than layer starter. It has a protein content of 20 to 24 percent.


You will need 30 to 50 lbs. (14 to 23 kg) of broiler starter for 10 chicks.

, The protein content is 16 to 20 percent. You will need 16 to 20 lbs. (7 to 9 kg) of feed for 10 birds.

, Some birds that are bred for meat are given feed day and night, with light placed in their coops to encourage them to eat more. You may choose to do this near the end of their lives.

Be prepared to take care of chicks.",How to Keep Chickens in a Backyard," To save money and space, see if there is an existing structure in your yard that can be converted into a chicken shelter. It costs a good deal of money to hire people to build a shelter, so converting space can help with this.Something like a small playhouse, staircase, or the space beneath a deck may work.;
, To build a chicken house, you need proper supplies. For the floor, you should opt for knotty cedar. The rest of the house can safely be built from pine.If you've never built a structure before, or never built one for animals, hiring professional help is highly recommended. You can find blueprints for chicken structures online and follow them, but they can be complicated if you're unfamiliar with building. A flimsy or poorly built structure can be dangerous for your chickens., The floor of a chicken coop will rot if it's on bare ground. You should make sure to elevate the floor 2.5 (approximately .7 meter) off the ground. You will have to provide some kind of foundation, such as cinderblocks, to do so., Certain features are key to keeping your chickens warm and safe. Make sure to include the following:You will need grates on the top of the house. This helps with air circulation.
The house should have a hen-sized door on one side and a human-sized one on the other.
The coop should be properly insulated during the cooler months. Placing your coop against your garage can help with this.

, It's vital that you provide locks ot secure your chickens at night. During the night, your chickens should be in the coop with the doors locked. Chicken wire or hardware cloth should surround the perimeter of your chicken coop.You should also have chicken wire or cloth on top of the chicken coop to protect against predators like owls.

, You want to make sure you follow any rules regarding raising chickens in your area. In some areas, for example, you may be required to keep your chicken coop a certain distance from your home or your neighbors' homes.

, You should clean your coop regularly to keep your chickens healthy and happy. Regularly scoop out the coop, removing stray feathers and droppings. Then, hose down the walls. Do one more round of shoveling to get anything your missed. Using equal parts water and white vinegar, scrub down the chicken coop with a brush. Rinse it again and allow it to air dry before letting chickens back into the coop., The staple of your chicken's diet should be a healthy commercial chicken feed. You can buy chicken feed at a local livestock store or purchase it online.You should distribute food using a chicken feeder. You should check the feeder every other day and remove moldy or wet food.
How much food your chickens need depends on the number of chickens. Feeding guidelines should be provided on the package.

, Chickens are healthiest when raised with a variety of types of food. In addition to chicken feed, supplement their diet with table scraps. Produce like watermelon, apples, bread, and scraps of meat like bacon can be tossed into a chicken coop instead of thrown out.Chickens actually do enjoy eggs and eggshells as well. Do not hesitate to toss egg shells into your chicken's coop instead of discarding them.

, It's important that your chickens stay hydrated. You should keep a large water bowl in their coop and make sure it's full at all times. A 5-gallon bucket is a good option. Check it each time you check your chickens. Fill it up as needed and replace the water if it gets dirty.Go for a heated bowl or bucket in the winter to keep water from freezing.

, Keep a light bulb on in the coop as this encourages egg production. You can remove eggs when you see them and use them as food. You can expect each hen to lay about six eggs per week.If you have a rooster in your coop, do not collect eggs. They may be fertilized.

, Before committing to raising chickens, check the laws. Look into your city, state, or local homeowner's organization. You should also check with the local Department of Natural Resources. In some areas, it may not be legal to keep chickens in the backyard., Chickens can spread salmonella. To keep yourself safe from the virus, you should take some safety precautions. Do the following to protect yourself from salmonella:Wash your hands after handling your chickens or anything in or near the chicken shed.
Minimize contact with your birds. Do not pet, snuggle, or kiss the chickens and discourage children from doing the same. Do not let chickens in your home.
Do not eat or drink near the chickens.

, It is not expensive to raise chickens. The upfront cost of building a home, especially if you hire help, can run between $300 and $400. There will also be monthly expenses, such as food, water, and heating systems. Make sure you can afford chickens before committing to raising them., Even if you're careful to select only hens; roosters sometimes slip in by accident. Just in case chickens lay fertile eggs, have a brooder set up. You can use a large cardboard box filled with pine shavings. You should also install a heat lamp to keep chicks warm. Any potentially fertile eggs should be transferred to a brooder.Make sure to keep your brooder away from predators, especially cats and dogs. It may be safest to store the brooder in an enclosed space, such as your garage.

Set goals.,
Develop a plan.,
Assemble materials and tools.,
Start building.,
Inspect your work.",How to Build a Simple Chicken Coop," Develop a plan for your chicken coop based on current or future needs. Ask yourself how many chickens you plan to keep, how much space you have, and for what purpose you're keeping chickens. Your answers to these questions will affect how you build your coop.






;
, You can purchase chicken coop plans, or create one of your own. Here's a list of basic design considerations for most coops:









Height. Most chicken coops are raised two or three feet off the ground. Increased height makes the chickens less accessible to predators. Having your coop too close to the ground could also provide space for rodents to nest.
Insulation. Depending on where you live, your coop might require more or less insulation from the outside elements. Select your materials based on how much protection from the elements your chickens will require.
Ventilation. Because your chickens will be eliminating inside the coop, you'll need to keep air flowing through it. Most vents consist of hinged flaps on the sides of the coop that are propped up, with the openings covered with chicken wire.
Food and water. Your chickens will need access to food and clean water inside the coop, away from the litter. The system you use for this can be simple or elaborate depending on your needs.
Perches. Perches inside the coop will provide a place for your chickens to roost at night. Remember that chickens prefer to sleep on a perch, and that the perches need to be far enough apart that the chickens won't be in full contact with each other.
Litter. Because chickens don't control their eliminations, you'll need to provide some sort of litter beneath the perches such as straw or wood shavings. Having the waste attached to filler will make the coop easier to clean; additionally, used litter can make excellent fertilizer.
Nest boxes. Your nest box should be a small, shallow space where your chickens can lay eggs. Avoid making it too spacious or comfortable, so that the chickens aren't encouraged to stay there for too long. Some coops are designed such that the eggs from the nest box can be accessed via a small door on the outside of the coop.
Ramp. To exit the elevated coop, your chickens will need a small ramp going down to the yard. Paint the ramp with a mixture of sand and paint to make it less slippery, and add cross strips (like frets on a guitar) for the chickens to use like little steps. If your ramp does not go into an enclosed yard, you'll want to be able to close it up at night to keep the chickens safe in the coop.

, At a minimum, you'll need wood or plywood in several sizes, nails, chicken wire, hinges, screws and litter. If you're building a more complicated coop, you'll need more varied materials. Additionally, you'll need a measuring tape, sander, power saw, hammer, drill, workbench, face mask and leather gloves. You might be able to purchase these items from second-hand shops.








, When you're constructing the coop, try to build methodically so that you don't have to go back and fix mistakes.









Join the bottom frames first, then the side frames and supporting frames. In assembling the frames, where they are to be joined, use wood glue to hold them in place and drill very small pilot holes for the nails. To ensure that the nails go in straight, drill pilot holes. Better yet, use a miter joint or end lap joint. The lap joint and the miter joint are the two most common joints you need to use in building your chicken coop to ensure stability and sturdiness of your project.
Put on the sidings (plywood and/or chicken wire) and the roofing material of the chicken coop when the frame is ready. Make sure that you double the length of the wood supports and the size when increasing the size or dimensions of your chicken coop. For example, from a 25mm x 25mm x 2m wood, increase it to 50mm x 50mm x 3m, to ensure that the frame is strong and sturdy!
Add the windows and doors. The windows and doors should be the last ones you should work on.

, As soon as everything is finished, do a once-over inspection and plug all seams and joints with insulation material to prevent cold air from entering your flock's new house. You can also paint the chicken coop in any color you like to match the overall character of your home.

Create a safe home (coop, run and nestbox) for your chickens, with enough space per bird.,
If you live in an apartment then you probably live in a city that has a university of college.,
Get the best book on Chickens: The Chicken Health Handbook, and read it.

,
Chickens should have access outdoors for sunshine as much/often as possible.,
Clean the coop, run and nestbox every week.,
If you purchase ""juvenile"" birds (about 14-16 weeks old) from a hatchery you will get birds whose beaks have been cut.,
They love treats: commercially prepared dried meal worms, apples (peeled and cored), alfalfa (you can grow it yourself from health food sprouting seeds), 12-grain bread with cod-liver oil, yoghurt (plain, no sugar added).,
Maintain a safe environment for your chicken - do not leave poisons, cleaning supplies, etc.,
Keep your apartment a healthy environment for you and your friends or family, as well.,
If you take your chicken for a walk, harness your chicken to avoid traffic.

",How to Care for a Chicken in an Apartment," Each Chicken will need at least 4 or 5 square feet, more if you can provide it. Get only as many chickens as you can give comfortable space. (If they are too crowded they will cannibalize.) Chickens are flock animals; that is why hatcheries sell them in groups of at least 3, in case one dies the other two will still have each other. You can buy a coop, or build the coop yourself, or modify a dog house and add a run. The roost should be about 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) above the floor, so the birds can jump onto it but not get injured jumping down when they leave the roost. They should have free access to the run, coop and nestbox at all times.;
, That institution will probably have animal care for its research, and that is a good place to find resources for feed and litter. You will need to provide oyster shell and grit mixed into the feed. Add commercial poultry vitamins in the water (follow directions); Enviro-dri is excellent litter and is compostable. Or you can find everything online at such places as Meyer's Hatchery www.meyerhatchery.com or MyPetChicken.com.

,, They should have ZooMed's avian lamps indoors to provide the proper light for their vision and for their bodies to create the hormones etc.

, The chickens will learn to expect this and cooperate by moving into the coop when you clean the run, into the run when you clean the coop, etc. Remove all old litter, feces, etc., wash the floor and roost and sides with nontoxic soap and hot water (Murphy's Oil Soap is good), let dry and refill with clean dry litter. Wash the feeders with white vinegar. Wash the waterer with white vinegar. If you are using a waterer that has a narrow opening you can clean out any algae or green moss by swishing white vinegar and rinsing with hot water.

, This is necessary for shipping them but creates a lifetime of pain for the birds. If you can buy day-old chicks and raise them yourself (a whole other story of caring for them) then your birds will have whole beaks. Be sure to get the immunizations that the hatchery offers. Juveniles will be ""wild"" due to lack of human contact. Buying your own chicks and raising them in your apartment will make them truly your pets; they will bond to you (and you will bond to them).

, Be careful not to let them eat too much, it is a treat, not a food. Also they must have grit to grind up the fibrous material after they swallow and it moves inside their crops. Not too much fibrous material or it will impact the crop.

, within reach of your chicken - They'll eat anything. Don't allow potted plants within range of the chickens unless you intend for the plants to become chicken treats (especially poisonous plants).

, This means, cleaning up after your chicken or, preferably, diapering your chicken. Diapers can be found online in several spots. Place the housing near (not next to) a window and put a box fan into the window to exhaust the air. A second window across the room or apartment will bring in fresh air. An old-fashioned manual carpet sweeper will silently pick up debris that the chickens scatter outside their coop.

To prevent water damage, stick with lumber from trees that are naturally resistant to rot, such as cedar or redwood.Buy heat-treated wood to avoid termites and other infestations without having to use chemicals that may harm your hens.A square box measuring 2’6” (0.8 m) on each side is adequate for anywhere from five to ten hens. For this, purchase a 2’ x 6’ x 10’ (0.6 x 1.8 x 3 m) board.
Larger or smaller boxes can be scaled accordingly to accommodate larger or smaller flocks.
When scaling for larger or smaller boxes, stick with 2x6’s, regardless of length. These should be thick enough to stand the test of time.;
, First, measure your 2x6x10 board lengthwise. Mark each quarter-length with a carpenter’s pencil or similar writing tool. Then saw your board at each mark to create four smaller pieces of equal length, with each one 2’6” (0.8 m).Keep in mind that lumber dimensions are determined when they are freshly cut. Actual dimensions may change as the wood dries and shrinks. Therefore, your 2x6x10 may not be exactly 10 feet long.Always measure the board’s exact length and divide by four to determine its quarter-lengths, rather than assuming each quarter-length will be 2’6” and ending up with one piece that falls short.

, Butt the sawed end of one quarter-piece against the face of another to form an L shape. Use a screw gun to attach the two pieces with two 4-inch wood screws. Repeat with each remaining piece to create your square frame.If working by yourself, use clamps to secure one piece at a time to your worktable as you drill another into it.
Alternatively, ask a partner to assist you in keeping one piece still by pushing it toward you from its far end, where their hands will be clear of any danger from screws., First, note that hardware cloth has two sides: a rough side and a smooth side. Now line up the roll’s free end with the top of one side to your box, making sure that the smooth side will face up as you unroll the cloth. Keep the hens’ feet safe from cuts by keeping the rough side faced down. Then:Adjust the cloth so it’s entirely on top of the wood, without any sharp ends projecting over the edge.
Staple or nail the hardware cloth to the top of your box’s side with poultry staples or finishing nails., Now that one end of the cloth is attached to one end of your box, begin unrolling the cloth along the box’s top. As you do, staple or nail the cloth along the top of each side to the box. Continue until you reach the far end of the box and do the same there.Always staple or nail as you unroll, rather than unroll the cloth all the way first. This should help you keep the cloth pulled taut between each staple/nail for a tighter, more secure fit.

, Once the cloth is attached to the top of each side to the box, use wire cutters to snip the roll free. Do your best to make your cuts over the wood, so the cloth’s sharp ends don’t project over the sides. If they do, use your hammer to tamp them into the wood so your hens don’t cut themselves on it.If your roll is wider than the box itself, go back along the sides and do the same. Trim any excess cloth from the frame and tamp any sharp free ends into the wood.

, The seeds you plant will need watering, so choose a spot that you can access easily. You don’t want your seeds’ roots to drown, though, so avoid areas prone to flooding or standing water. Additionally:Keep in mind that, once the grass you plant grows, it will become exhausted over time from continual grazing (possibly three to four months).To accommodate this without missing a beat, consider creating multiple paddocks areas so you can rotate grazing between boxes.

, Before you set your box down, prepare the soil. Give your seeds plenty of nutrients by topping or mixing it with a premium topsoil or composted manure. Then scatter your seeds by hand and cover them with a thin layer of topsoil or compost.Popular grasses for chicken grazing include alfalfa, barley, and wheat.
Boost the hens’ diet by also planting calendula, garlic, parsley, oregano, and sage.

, Once the seeds are planted, set your grazing box around the soil, with the hardware cloth on top. If you allow your chickens access to the area immediately, cover the box with a large sheet of clear plastic. Keep the hens from defecating in the box during the seeds’ stages, while still allowing them plenty of sunlight.The exact time it will take for your grass and herbs to grow high enough for grazing will vary depending on type, climate, and region. However, expect it to take a few weeks.
You will need to water the box’s soil periodically as it dries out, so however you cover it, make sure it can be removed and replaced easily for convenience’s sake.

, Once your grass and herbs have matured and grown high enough to reach the hardware cloth, remove the cover and let the hens have at it. At this point, their droppings can help feed the soil. Wait for it to dry on the hardware cloth and the edges of the box, then hose it off, into the box, when you water the plants.Too much can still be a bad thing, though, so inspect the plants whenever you water them.
If the leaves appear burned, hose the hardware cloth off from the side, keeping the stream level with the top of the box, instead of aiming from above.
This will help wash some of the dropping over the side of the box, instead of into it.

Choose the materials that you will use to build your nesting box.,
Design your nesting box(es).,
Make a nesting box out of a kitchen cabinet.,
Build a 12"" x 12"" x 12"" nesting box out of wood.,
Try building a quick nesting box from a clean wooden half-barrel.",How to Build a Chicken Nesting Box1," If you'd like to build upon an existing structure, consider re-purposing a crate, a cabinet, an old pet carrier, or a barrel. Otherwise, feel free to build a comparable box from scratch using wood, metal, or plastic. The box should be sturdy, heat-retentive, and easy to clean, so choose your base materials accordingly. Review the following steps for a few straightforward box ideas.


Try re-purposing storage containers: kitchen cabinets, barrels, milk crates, wash basins, old pet carriers. Make sure to thoroughly wash these things before use, especially if they've held something that can be toxic to chickens.Construct boxes from found materials, when possible. This can save on costs, and it may give character to your backyard coop. Build a box from wood, metal, or plastic—whichever is available.;
, You will need one box for every 2-4 hens. Each ""nest"" should be roomy enough to contain a laying hen and small enough to feel secure.Twelve cubic inches (12"" x 12"" x 12"") is an ideal size. The interior should not be higher than two feet, as hens like to roost in cozy spaces.


Make sure to add a comfortable access point for the chickens to enter and exit. Make sure to add a slight lip to the entryway so that the chickens' bedding (sawdust, straw, etc.) cannot easily spill out.
If you're building a nesting box from scratch, pitch the top of the box at a 45 degree angle to discourage chickens from roosting and pooping up there. If you're using a cabinet or another found object, consider nailing a plank the roof with one side lifted at a 45 degree angle.The boxes need not be square or absolutely symmetrical. The important thing is that your chickens are comfortable.

, Find an old wooden kitchen cabinet. The cabinet should be at least 18 inches deep, and it should have working doors that are at least two feet high. Try asking around at secondhand stores and recycled furniture stores. If you already have any old cabinets, or if you plan to replace your current kitchen cabinets, this is the perfect opportunity to reuse them toward a productive end. Make sure that the cabinet is sturdy; it need not be in perfect shape, but it shouldn't be falling apart.


Ask friends if they have any kitchen cabinets that they aren't using. Poke around junkyards, demolition sites, city streets—anywhere someone may have thrown out a perfectly good kitchen cabinet.
Realistically, you can use any cabinet-like box as long as it is large enough, warm enough, and sturdy enough.

, Use plywood or any other large cut of cheap wood. Follow these steps to construct the basic nesting box:


Cut your wood. Measure one square foot out of a piece of wood—this will be the bottom. Cut another square of the same size for the back, and one more for the bottom of the side piece.
Your three squares should form a rough triangular shelter. You will need to make two such triangles.
Ask a helper to hold the back of the box against the bottom while you nail/screw the pieces together.
Have your helper hold one of the sides to the bottom and the back while you nail/screw the pieces together. You will need to use several nails or screws to connect the sides solidly to the bottom and the back. Repeat this process for each side. You should have an open box.

, Turn the barrel onto its side so that it is easily accessible from the ground. Nail or screw a 2x4 to the edge where the opening of the barrel meets the ground. This forms a lip that will hold in hay and eggs. Fill the barrel with two inches of straw, wood shavings, or sawdust—and you are ready to go."
"
Divide the box into two nests.,
Add a sloped top to the nesting box.,
Fill each nest 2-3 inches deep with bedding.,
Cut a door into the back panel.",How to Build a Chicken Nesting Box2," Try to make the nests equal in size. If you used a cabinet, lay it onto its side. Build a one-foot-deep divider across the center of the now-bottom section so that you will have two nesting boxes.


You can use a shelf, a piece of plywood cut to size, or any flat slat of wood. Drive nails or screws through the back of the cabinet and into the slat.
You can use the top section of the cabinet to store sawdust and egg cartons. If you need the space, you can convert it into two more nest boxes.

, You don't want your chickens to roost or poop on top of their nesting boxes—that would be a big mess. Angle the top of the nesting box at about 45 degrees to dissuade hens from perching on or above the nesting boxes.

, This will keep your chickens comfortable and protect the eggs that they lay. Replace the bedding every few weeks to keep the nest sanitary and attractive. Wood shavings, straw, and sawdust are cheap but effective choices. Consider the pros and cons of each material:


Wood shavings tend to be easier to clean out than hay or sawdust. They are generally more absorbent, less messy, and better-smelling. Try to find a wood mill or woodcutting center in your area to keep the cost down. If you have a wood-chipper, you can make them yourself.Hay is not as absorbent as pine shavings; it retains more moisture and mold than the other materials. However, many people favor hay, and chickens often enjoy pecking through strands of hay. You can buy hay at a feed-and-supply store or ask around your community.
Sawdust is relatively easy to sweep out of the box, making it ideal for chickens that poop in their nests. Bear in mind, however, that there is a risk of your chickens eating some of the sawdust, and thus ingesting toxic tannic acids. Sawdust remains damp long after it is wet, and it can be difficult for birds to work with.The dusty material may also stick to fresh eggs and dry on the shell., It should be at least six inches wide, and tall enough for your chickens to pass through without much effort. Don't make the door too large—chickens like their nesting box to be dark and draft-free. Use a handsaw to cut the door, and make sure not to leave any jagged edges.

"
"
Place the nesting box in a low-traffic part of the coop.,
Install the nesting box two or three feet (0.6-0.9 meters) off the ground.,
Consider building the cabinet into the outside wall of the hen house.,
Build a roost bar and a protective lip at the entrance of the nesting box.,
Introduce the chickens to the nesting box.,
Keep any eye on the box.",How to Build a Chicken Nesting Box3," Finding a good location is imperative when installing nesting boxes. Place nests in the least-traveled part of the coop to prevent disturbances while hens are laying.

, This will discourage predators from invading, and it will prevent debris from collecting on the floor of the coop. You can prop it up on bricks, cinder-blocks, or tightly-pressed earth; nail it to the wall or hang it from the ceiling; put it onto (sturdy) stilts, or nail together a simple wooden base.


Make sure that the nest boxes aren't so high that the hens have a hard time accessing them. If the nest boxes are higher than the roosts, you'll have hens sleeping inside the nest boxes.

, Arrange the six-inch-wide back-panel door to face inward, and set the ""front"" of the cabinet facing outside. This way, you will be able to open both cabinet doors from outside the hen house., Put a roost bar or step in front of the entrance for the chickens to jump up onto. Make sure that there is space for the chickens to clutch the roost with their talons. Use a 2x4 plank, an old broomstick, or any sturdy wooden pole.


Add a ""lip"" to the front of the nesting box to keep the bedding material and/or eggs from being pushed out: affix a small (2-5 inches high) piece of wood to the front so the eggs do not fall if the chickens move.

, Encourage chickens to use nesting boxes by placing plastic eggs or golf balls in the nests to simulate recently-laid eggs. You should collect the eggs daily, but bear in mind that chickens are more likely to add to an existing clutch of eggs than to start a new one. Keep boxes clean, and do not disturb laying chickens. Once nesting boxes are accepted as a safe and serene laying site, chickens will return daily without prodding.


To introduce chickens to the nesting box, try putting them in the box at night, when they are blind. They will find their way out in the morning when they are all calm and at ease. This way, they won't forget where to find it later on.
Nesting boxes are not meant to be used for sleeping. Encourage your chickens to use nests only for laying.

, If your hens aren't using the nesting box, figure out where else they are laying their eggs. Try to understand why they aren't using the nesting box. Consider comfort, safety, and ease of access. Perhaps the box is too small; too high off the ground; too open; too dirty. Make any adjustments that seem necessary to set your chickens at ease.

Feed your chickens more food than you would in the spring and summer.,
Make warm snacks like oatmeal.,
Get your chickens more protein in the winter.,
Feed your chickens extra leafy green vegetables.,
Make sure to use a trough when feeding in the winter.,
Store extra food safely to keep mice and rats out of the coop.,
Hang a ""green piñata"" in the chicken coop's run.,
Make sure your chickens are properly hydrated.,
Consider adding supplements to your chickens' water.,
Watch for signs of sickness.,
See a vet if your birds get sick in the winter.",How to Feed Chickens during the Winter," Over the winter, chickens need more food as they're usually resting from summer and spring egg production. Aim to feed your chickens around 1.5 times what you would feed them in other months.Feeding your chickens over the winter is not an exact science. It's okay to roughly guess how much is 1.5 times the normal amount.
In general, chickens will not overeat. If you're upping their food intake too much, you will probably notice as they will be leftover food in the feeder in the morning.;
, Carbohydrates are very important in the winter, for hens especially as they're recovering from laying eggs over the warmer months. Oatmeal is a good source of carbohydrates, and can be served to chickens warm. This can be a nice treat on particularly cool mornings.Be careful how you feed your chickens oatmeal. It does not spread as easily as grains and other forms of chicken feed. If oatmeal is confined to one space, chickens may fight over the food. When spreading the oatmeal in the trough, make sure to spread it evenly throughout.
If you want to add some variety, try adding maple syrup and bananas to your oatmeal.

, Protein helps chickens grow the added feathers needed to stay warm during the winter months. Also, egg production slows down in the winter. If you want your chickens to continue laying eggs during these months, added protein may encourage them to lay a few eggs over the winter.Try switching from regular chicken feed to game bird grower feed. These types of food generally have extra protein.
Try laying a board down in your chicken coop, as long as the material the board is made from is chicken safe. Bugs may crawl under the board, which chickens may capture and eat. Bugs provide extra protein for your birds.
If you have a cat, try adding a bit of cat food to your chickens' diet. Cat food is rich in protein and safe for chickens in moderation. Just make sure the cat cannot get into the chicken coop. If your cat goes into the coop searching for his food, he may behave in a predatory manner towards your chickens.

, It's a good idea to add leafy greens from your own kitchen to your chickens' diet during the winter. Winter will likely kill most natural plants near your chicken coop, so you'll have to supplement your chickens' diet with leafy green vegetables.Kale, collard, chard, and spinach provide a lot of essential nutrients for chickens.
Avoid iceberg lettuce, as it has very little nutritional value.

, Do not feed chickens by sprinkling the pellets on the ground during the winter. This is not safe for your chickens and could result in food contamination. If you do not already have a trough for your chickens, purchase one at a hardware store and use it to feed your chickens during the winter months.If the ground is frozen, pellets will get wet and soggy when thrown on the ground. Chickens are unlikely to eat soggy pellets.
Troughs are much easier to clean. It takes a lot less of an effort to clean a trough than to clean food off the ground. This makes lessens the likelihood of rats and other predators entering the chicken coop due to the smell of food.

, Rats and mice are tempted to enter warm places over the winter. If they can smell food, they're much more likely to enter a chicken coop. As rats and mice prey on chickens, store excess food in sealable containers if you store it in or near your chicken coop.Never store food in a bag. Not only will this attract rats, your chickens may get into the bags.
Instead, use a metal container with a lid, like an old trash can, to store bags of food. If you have a garage, you may want to store food here so it's away from your chicken coop altogether.

, A green piñata is simply a head of leafy greens, like a head of romaine lettuce, you tie up in the run. This will give chickens something to snack on during the winter months that's rich in the vitamins they need to thrive. If you hang it up, it will be off the ground and will not get too cold and wet for the chickens to eat., Food is not the only thing that's important for chickens during the winter months. You want to make sure your birds get adequate water. Make sure your chickens have access to water at all times, and that you take measures to make sure the bowl does not freeze.You can use a heated water bowl, which you can find at most pet stores. You can also place small rubber balls in the water, as long as you clean them first, if you live in an area with a slight breeze. The breeze will move the balls around, preventing the water from freezing.
You should also check the water each time you check on your chickens. If it's frozen, or has been knocked over by wind, replace it with fresh water.

, It may be a good idea to add supplements to your chickens' water during the winter, as this can help your chickens get the increased vitamins they need for their coats and feathers. You can use leftover vegetable stock, add dried herbs to the water, or ask your vet about any nutritional supplements you can add to your chickens' water., With proper care, chickens should thrive even in winter. However, keep an eye out for signs of sickness. Chickens may get colds or flus during the winter.Listen for heavy or labored breathing, as well as wheezing or coughing.
Watch for changes in movement, like limping.
You should also keep records of food consumption and water consumption. If your birds are suddenly consuming less food or water, one or all of them may be sick.

, If one of your chickens gets sick, remove her from the flock and contact an avian veterinarian in your area. You do not want the sickness to spread to the other birds. You may have to quarantine a sick chicken and give her antibiotics until the sickness passes."
"
Make sure you have the resources to raise chickens.,
Look into the legality of keeping chickens in your area.,
Plan to keep at least 3 to 6 birds.,
Choose your breeds.,
Find out where to source baby chickens.,
Think about the space and equipment you will need in advance.",How to Raise Chicks1," Raising baby chickens is a rewarding experience, but it is not something you should jump into too quickly. Before you raise baby chickens, think long and hard about why you want to keep chickens and whether you have the time, money and space to provide for them.


In terms of expense, keeping chickens is relatively cheap compared to other animals. However, chicken feed is a necessary and ongoing expense, and vets' bills can add up if one or more of your chickens falls ill. You may also need to invest in a breeder and/or a coop if you are raising chickens for the first time.
Chickens are not terribly time consuming, but you will need to feed and water them daily, keep their coop clean (which involves shoveling manure) and collect their eggs once or twice daily. If you you are planning on going away for more than a couple of days, you will need to seek out a chicken-sitter, which can be tricky. If you let eggs accumulate in the nest boxes, the hens may become broody, which is where they will hiss and growl if you attempt to collect the eggs. To discourage this, loom into a broody box.;
, Before purchasing birds or planning for a coop, it is important to check local regulations and homeowner association rules. Many municipalities ban roosters (due to the noise they make) or place a limit on the number of hens a household can keep.


Some communities also require permits, signed agreements from neighbors, or an appearance before the zoning board, while others have ordinances that restrict the size and placement of outbuildings., Chickens are very sociable creatures, so you should plan on keeping at least three to six birds for company. Having an extra one or two is also not a bad idea should any of your chickens fall victim to predators or disease.


In addition, hens typically lay 5-6 eggs a week, so four birds will provide you with almost two dozen eggs per week.The more chickens, the more eggs!

, The breed of chickens you choose to raise should be based on qualities such as temperament, egg-laying ability, size and color of the eggs, climate suitability, aesthetic value and meat quality, depending on your preferences.


For dependable egg production, choose ""layer"" breeds, such as Black Australorps, that were bred to lay reliably. Leghorns, also, produce about 325 eggs a year.Dual-purpose breeds (which provide eggs and meat), such as Buff Orpingtons and Laced Wyandottes, and Plymouth rocks, are bigger than layers but have better egg production than ""broilers"" (Cornish Cross) or (White Rock Cross), which are breeds used primarily for meat., You can find day-old baby chickens at your local farm store in springtime, or order them from a mail-order catalog. Be aware that mail orders usually have a minimum order policy, requiring a shipment of at least 25 chicks. This is because larger numbers of chicks are easier to keep warm in transit, resulting in fewer losses. However, open the box in front of the mail carrier to account for any losses.Place your order in spring. You don't want to be ordering in the middle of autumn or winter. Colder weather can hold you back and be much harder to care for your chickens. If you order at the start of spring it'll be easier for you and the chicks. Besides, most chicks are only available to order in spring.
If you only want three or four chicks to start off, consider combining your order with the orders of other local chicken breeders or farmers to overcome the minimum shipment requirement. Alternatively, you can ask a farm-supply store if they will include your order in their own.If possible, specify that you want all females when you place your order. Roosters can be loud and aggressive and are not recommended for first timers. The hens will also lay better without roosters around., Initially, the chickens will need a brooder, which is a small enclosure like a cardboard box or rabbit cage, which can be kept indoors or in a garage. Then, once they move outside, they will need a chicken coop; a safe place where they can lay their eggs and be safe from predators. In the chick stage, the chicks might do something called feather picking. This is where the chicks pick at another chick new feathers, the shafts of which are filled with blood. The chicks are attracted to the color red, and will therefore pick all the feathers, resulting in the crippling or death of the chick. To discourage, buy a brooder light that is red. The blood will look less interesting because everything will be red.


Once grown, chickens don't necessarily need a whole farmyard to run around in, in fact, city and suburban chickens are becoming increasingly popular amongst those who have even small-sized yards. However, you will need some semblance of a yard, preferably with grass for the chickens to peck around in.

Make a small wood house for them to walk in and out of.,
Put a small ramp for them to fly off of.,
Make a swing perch for them.",How to Build a Playground for Baby Chickens," Put some comfy shavings or straw in there as a bedding, some food, and maybe a little mobile at the ceiling. Don't make it look too scary to them- just tie a few simple pieces of straw, a few small pieces of ribbon, and maybe a small bell to a string or a piece of yarn. You can even paint the wooden house from blue to red to green-get creative! Your chicks will love it! They will be sleeping in here every night so make sure it's a very nice place to be!;
, Chicks love to flap their wings, and a ramp will fit that requirement just right! Don't do it too high, though! They could hurt themselves when they hit the ground, this is because chicks can't fly yet but it's good for them to try at a young age. Also, make sure they will land on soft grass, soft shavings, or something soft so they won't hurt themselves. You can get creative and make it like an airplane's takeoff ramp. If you do get creative, it will take you far.

, Tie a chain around a piece of metal, hang it up somewhere low, and you're complete! This is a nice place for them to rest.

Prepare a chicken brooder and a lamp.,
Use the correct flooring.,
Monitor the temperature carefully.,
Make sure they have food and water.,
Share play time with them.",How to Raise Chicks2," The chicks' first home is called a ""brooder"". For one-time or once-in-a-while use, a cardboard box or plastic storage box works just fine. A cage suitable for a rabbit or guinea pig is another good option and is also easy to clean. Brooders can also be purchased in farm supply stores or you can build your own.


The brooder should be placed indoors or in a garage - somewhere that is free from drafts. Keeping the chicks warm is essential.
The size of the brooder is not overly important, as long as the chicks are not overcrowded and there is enough space for a feeder and water. The walls also need to be high enough to prevent them from hopping out once they get a bit bigger.

, The floor of the brooder should be covered in a layer of clean litter, made from pine shavings or something similar. Newspaper can also be used, but it is not the best option as it is slippery and the print ink can rub off on the chicks. This litter should be changed every couple of days and should never be allowed to remain damp.


Cleanliness is very important at this stage of the chicks' development as baby chicks are prone to a number of diseases, most of which can be avoided with proper sanitation.

, A lamp should be placed in the brooder to keep the baby chicks warm. Use a light bulb with a reflector, which can be purchased in any hardware store. A regular 100-watt bulb will also work, though some people use an actual heat lamp. Place a thermometer in the brooder so you can monitor the temperature exactly. The temperature should be 90–100 °F (32–38 °C) for the first week or so, then can be reduced by 5 degrees each week thereafter, until the chicks have developed their feathers around 5-8 weeks old.


Alternatively, you can tell if the brooder is warm enough by how the chicks behave. If they are panting and/or huddling in corners farthest from the light, they are too hot. If they huddle together in a ball under the light, they are too cold.
You can adjust the temperature by altering the distance of the light or changing the wattage of the light bulb until it's just right.

, Chicks start out eating special food called ""crumbles"", available at farm supply or pet stores. It is specially formulated for their dietary needs and comes in both medicated and non-medicated versions. If you choose the non-medicated versions, be particularly aware of cleanliness. This feed is a complete food and no other food will be necessary. You will also need to ensure that your chicks always have fresh, clean water as it is imperative that the chicks stay hydrated. You should change the water once or twice a day to prevent it from becoming contaminated.


Special waterers are available at farm supply stores, they are inexpensive, light-weight and can't be overturned by the chicks. Any shallow bowl will also work, but you need to watch that it remains upright and free of poop.
Even baby chicks will naturally scratch at their food, so a feeder that keeps all of the food in one place is helpful. Special feeders made of galvanized steel are available in farm supply stores, though any shallow bowl will do.

, Baby chicks are playful and curious creatures. It is important that you spend time with them, handling them frequently and talking to them until they learn to love and trust you. After a week or two, the baby chicks can be brought outside to explore for short periods of time, provided the weather is warm. Just watch out for predators - that includes the cat!


Although the baby chicks get all the sustenance they need from their feed, it can be fun to feed them treats. After the first week or two, you can give them a worm or a bug or two from your garden to play with and eat. However, greens are not recommended just yet, as they can cause diarrhea-like symptoms which can be dangerous to small chicks.You should also wipe the chicks' butts, because they're poop can become crusty and cause infection, use a napkin with lukewarm water on it.
Once the baby chicks are about a month old, you can place a low perch in the brooder. The chicks will jump on it and may even begin to sleep there. Just don't put the perch directly under the light as it will be too hot.

"
"
Move your chicks to an outdoor coop.,
Protect them from predators.,
Change their food and give them treats.,
Interact with them.,
Know when to expect eggs.",How to Raise Chicks3," Once the chicks are about two months old you can move them to an outdoor coop, provided its not the middle of winter. Coops can be purchased from a farm supply store, or you can build your own. The coop provides shelter for chickens, protecting them from drafts and predators. It keeps them warm in winter and cool in summer. There are several important considerations when buying or building a coop:



Run space: All coops should have enough space for chickens to forage and get some fresh air. In terms of size, a chicken coop with a footprint of 4x8 feet should comfortably house 3 to 5 chickens.

Elevated roost: Though open-air roosting coops are an option, you should really provide your chickens with an elevated and enclosed roosting space, if possible. As with most birds, chickens have a natural roosting instinct and are partial to roosting in high areas. The roosting area should also include a roosting perch where the chickens can sleep.

Nesting boxes: All coops should have nesting boxes in their roosting area. These are just little 12”x12”x12” spaces for hens to lay their eggs. One box will do for every two chickens, as they don't mind sharing. You can line the nesting boxes with straw or wood shavings.

Cleanliness: You should clean your chicken coop once every 4 months, and change the straw and floor shavings every week and a half.

, A good chicken coop should protect your chickens from predators. In fact, security should be the number one priority when choosing a chicken coop, as chickens are helpless at the hands (or claws and paws) of predators such as weasels, minks, cats, raccoons, dogs, and even hawks. Make sure your chicken coop is wrapped in 360 degrees of wire cage, with holes no larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm). Regularly check to make sure there are no cracks or loose boards where predators could slip inside.

, Once your chickens reach the two month mark, you can swap their feed from ""crumbles"" to ""laying mash"", which is also available at the farm supply store. Along with the mash, your older chickens will also appreciate any tasty leftovers from the kitchen and garden weeds (as long as they're free of pesticides).


You should also place a bowl of gritty sand in the chicken coop. The chickens need this sand to grind up and digest their food, as they have no teeth.You can also give them a crushed oyster shell supplement from your local farm supply store to provide extra calcium for strong eggshells.Leave the chicken feed in a durable chicken feeder and make sure to clean it regularly. You should also check the feed itself every other day to may sure it isn't mouldy or wet.
Remember to give the chickens access to plenty of fresh, clean water. Large waterers can be purchased which don't need to be filled as often and heated waterers can be used in winter to prevent the water from freezing.

, Chickens appreciate human interaction, so make sure to talk to them and call them by their names. Tame chickens can also be picked up and rubbed, and if they're shy you can encourage them with a handful of grain. Some chickens will greet you at your door or will answer or come running when you call. The friendliness of your chickens will depend somewhat on the breed, but also on the level of attention you give them.

, Young hens (known as pullets) will begin to lay eggs between 20 and 24 weeks of age and they will lay approximately 5-6 eggs a week.


Hens will lay through the spring and summer months and into the fall, as long as they have 12 to 14 hours of daylight. In the fall, their egg production will dwindle, before increasing again the following spring. You can expect to collect eggs daily, or even twice a day. The larger the chicken, the larger your eggs will be.
Although hens can lay as long as they live (8 to 10 years isn't uncommon), they start producing fewer eggs after 3 to 5 years.

"
"
They lay fresh eggs.,
They provide compost.,
They provide insect control and landscaping services.,
They're fun to watch.,
They provide food.,
They make great pets.",How to Raise Chicks4," The major perk of raising chickens is that you will have a flock of egg-laying hens in under a year. The eggs your hens produce will be fresher and tastier than anything you can buy at the supermarket. Plus you can control exactly what goes into them through what you feed your hens. Eggs can be white, brown or blue-green depending on the breed of chicken.

, Chickens are veritable compost factories, they will turn their feed, plants, insects and almost any kitchen scraps into a nutrient-rich garden additive through their poop.

, Chickens will eat almost any insect unlucky enough to cross their paths, along with mice, snakes and minnows if they get the chance. They also love pecking at fresh grass and plant shoots and will happily weed your garden for you.

, From adorable, chirping chicks to squawking, squabbling adolescents, to beautiful, full-feathered birds, chickens are a joy to watch. They are entertaining and lovable, each with their own distinct personality. They are also very handsome birds, some breeds with plumage to rival even their most exotic, tropical cousins.

, Chickens don't just provide eggs, they also provide chicken (who'd have thought it?). Hens will stop laying eggs after 3-5 years and at that point you can decide whether to keep the older hens on as pets, or turn them into stew. It may sound harsh, but that's the way of the farmyard. If you unexpectedly raise a rooster instead of a hen, you can eat it after 5-6 months.

, Chickens are very sociable creatures and if you raise them from chicks (or hatch them yourself) they will form a bond with you and be very loyal pets. Tame chickens will sit in your lap, feed from your hand, cluck at you in greeting and might even come when they're called.

Coop without an outdoor pen: This is the most basic type of chicken coop, consisting only of the physical indoor structure. The chickens will be confined to the indoor space until someone specifically lets them out, so allow at least 5 square feet per chicken.

Outdoor chicken run: This is slightly more difficult to build than the simple coop, but it will allow your chickens more space, as well as the option of being outside. Allow 2 to 3 square feet per chicken for the coop, and at least 4 square feet per chicken for the outside run.

Winter only coop: This coop is used to keep chickens inside during the winter months. Since it is unlikely that the chickens will be allowed outside during sad months, allow between 7 and 10 square feet per chicken.
Note that egg-laying hens will also require a nesting area of at least 1 square foot per 4 hens, as well as a roosting area of 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) per chicken. Roosts should be at least 2 feet (0.6 m) off the ground (the elevation will keep your chickens dry during wet weather).;
, If possible, place your coop partially underneath a large tree, which will offer shade in the summer and keep your chickens from overheating.Sunlight encourages egg-laying, so try not to place your coop directly in the shade. Alternatively, you can use warm yellow lights inside the coop to increase egg production (white or blue light will have no effect).

, The more you add inside the coop, the less space the chickens will have. Therefore, it is important to have a clear idea of the objects you will be putting inside so that you can account for the loss of space in your building plans.



Perching Area. Often just a thick stick or piece of wood hung between the walls in the coop, and elevated perch allows for extra space, as well as a comfortable sleeping area for your chickens.

Nesting Area. You can make a nest by stuffing boxes or baskets with straw or sawdust. Without enough nesting space, your chickens will lay eggs on the ground, increasing the likelihood that they will break. Keep in mind that the average chicken will lay an egg every one to two days.The size of your nesting area should reflect both the number of chickens and how often you plan to collect eggs. In general, one nesting area per 4 to 5 hens should be sufficient.Other than the fact that elevated nests will discourage predation, the height of your nests is not as important as the location. Be sure that the nests are placed in a clean, dry place, and that they are separate from the roosting area (or you risk chicken manure on your eggs!).Ventilation. To avoid disease caused by stale air, proper ventilation systems are necessary. If you plan to build a year round, closed coop, be sure to include little windows covered in chicken wire to allow for proper air flow.

Dust Boxes. Chickens often clean themselves with dust bathing. To keep your chickens happy and smell-free, consider adding a couple boxes filled with dirt or sand.

, If you have an unused garage, shed, or even a large dog crate, you may be able to save yourself some work and repurpose it as a chicken coop by adding the amenities mentioned above. If you are building the coop from scratch, choose a plan that fits your needs as described above. The method outlined below will help you build a simple coop, ideal for using in conjunction with an outdoor pen. If that does not fit your needs, you can find hundreds of plans by searching ""Chicken coop building plans"" in your favorite search engine.


Consider convenience. Remember that you will need to clean out the chicken coop, as well as regularly change the food and water. If you do not want to build a coop that is large enough to stand up in, look for a plan that gives you a few options, such as multiple ""access doors.""
If you decide to repurpose an old structure, avoid lumber that's been coated with lead paint or that was used to house harmful chemicals, or you risk damaging the health of both you and your chickens., This basic coop is 4 feet (1.2 m) by 6 feet (24 square feet of floor space). If you need more or less space, feel free to scale the measurements accordingly.

, To make both building and cleaning as easy as possible, start with a piece of plywood cut to the ideal size (in this case, 4 feet by 6 feet). Be sure that the plywood is between 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) and 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.


If you are cutting the plywood yourself, use a straight edge and an easy-to-see pen to make lines before you cut.
Screw on the frame. To keep the floor sturdy, screw 2x4s around the bottom perimeter. You may also want to screw one across the middle of the floor for extra security. To ensure a tight joint on the corners, use a long pipe clamp.

, This is the only one of the walls that will not have an opening, and thus it is the easiest to build. Use a 6 foot (1.8 m) long, 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick piece of plywood. Screw 2x2s to the underside of the vertical edges. Be sure that the 2x2s stop 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the bottom of the plywood.

, Place the wall on the floor so that the extra 4 inches (10.2 cm) of plywood covers the 2x4s on the underside of the floor. Then, secure the wall in place using 1 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) screws and construction glue.

, Use 1 and 1/2 inch screws and construction glue to attach a 4 foot (1.2 m) long, 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick piece of plywood to the front of the coop. Screw the plywood into the 2x4s on the bottom of the coop and the 2x2s on the solid side wall. Then, cut the door opening.


Plan the front door opening before you cut. The door opening should be 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) wide. Cut the height according to your preferences, but keep in mind that you should leave 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) between the edges of the door and the top and bottom of the plywood panel.

Use a Jigsaw to make the cut. This will give you the easiest, smoothest cut. When you are done, reinforce the top of the door using a piece of scrap wood about 20 inches (50.8 cm) long and thick enough to attach using plenty of screws and glue.

, Attach the second 4 foot (1.2 m) piece of plywood to the back of the coop using the same method as you did for the front panel. Then, cut and reinforce the door opening, again as you did for the front.

, This will be done using 3 smaller pieces of plywood, rather than one large piece. To begin, cut two 2 foot (0.6 m) long pieces of plywood, and one 4 to 5 foot (1.2 to 1.5 m) long piece of plywood that is 1/2 as wide as your coop is tall. Then, attach a 2x2 to the underside of one of the vertical edges of a 2 foot (0.6 m) long piece of plywood. Repeat this step on the second 2 foot (0.6 m) long piece of plywood.


As with the other side, be sure that the 2x2s stop 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the bottom of the plywood. This will allow the plywood to hang down over the 2x4s on the underside of the floor.

, Screw one 2 foot (0.6 m) long panel directly next to the front of the coop, and the other directly next to the back. Attach the longer panel between the 2 foot (0.6 m) long panels. Be sure to line the edge up with the tops of the 2 foot (0.6 m) panels so that the opening is near the floor.


Reinforce the middle panel by attaching two pieces of scrap wood where the panel joins with the two side panels. Be sure that the scrap wood is as long (vertically) as your middle panel.

, A gable is a triangular piece of wood that sits on top of the front and back walls of the coop, supporting the roof. Therefore, in this case, both gables should be 4 feet (1.2 m) long. Use a Jigsaw to cut the gables out of 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) thick oriented strand board.


Use an angle finder to determine the exact pitch of the roof. If you don't have an angle finder, you can eyeball the pitch (just make sure it's the same for both gables!)
Notch the gables. In order for the gables to fit correctly, you'll need to make notches where you reinforced the openings. If the wood you used for the front is exactly the same size as the back, you can make exactly the same cut on both gables. However, if you used scrap wood, you'll need to make unique cuts for each gable.

, Place the front gable against the inside of the front wall and attach it using construction glue and screws. Repeat for the back gable.


It's okay if there is a little bit of wiggle room between the reinforcement wood and the notches. The important thing is that the gable is sturdy once attached to the wall.

, The truss, like a gable, supports the roof. However, rather than supporting the ends of the roof, the truss supports the middle. To ensure that the angle of your truss matches the angle of your gables, clamp two 2x2s to the slanted edges of one of your gables. Be sure that the 2x2s hang slightly longer (2 to 4 inches) than the edges of the gable.


Strengthen your truss by cutting a crosstie from 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick plywood. Cut it to the same measurements as your gable, and then screw it to the 2x2s.

, Once you've screwed the crosstie to the 2x2s, you can remove the clamps. Rest the truss in the middle of the coop and mark where the side walls intersect the 2x2s of the truss. Then, make a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) notch in the wood where you put each mark. This will allow you to slip the truss onto the top of the side walls.

, To make a simple roof, join two 40 inch (101.6 cm) by 84 inch (213.4 cm) pieces of plywood with some inexpensive hinges. Be sure to join them along the 84 inch (213.4 cm) sides so that the roof with cover the entire chicken coop.


Place the roof on top of the coop. Check to see that there is an overhang at both the front and back of the coop. The overhang is necessary for both structural and aesthetic reasons.

, Screw a pair of 2x2s to bottom edge of the front and back overhangs. In addition to looking nice, this will stiffen the roof and help prevent structural failures.

, Screw the roof to the truss and gables. Then, add a roof top cap to keep the roof weather-proof. The easiest way to do this is to cover the roof with a layer of tar paper and galvanized roofing. Attach the tar paper with staples and use exterior-grade screws for the galvanized roofing.

, Use a well finished medium-density fiberboard for the doors. The size of the pieces will depend on the chosen height of your chicken coop. Each door should be as tall and half as wide as the door opening.

, Screw a 2x2 along each side of each door opening, as well as along the tops. This will give you a sturdy place to screw the the door hinges.

, Screw in two hinges per door—one about four inches from the top of the door and the other about four inches from the bottom. Note that you may need a third hinge directly in the middle, depending on how tall your chicken coop is.

, You can use the same measurements for the back of the coop as you did for the front, but remember to take new measurements for the doors on the side of the coop.

, Brass hook catches are an inexpensive, efficient closure to use, but any type of closure will work, so long as it is not easily opened by common predators such as dogs or skunks.

, While not necessary, a raised chicken coop with give your flock added protection from predators, as well as help to keep them dry during rain or snow.Use four 2x4s for the legs. Use beefy screws to attach them to the 2x4s on the bottom corners of the chicken coop.

, Attach 2x2s to a 2x4 to make a ladder that will be easy for you chickens to use, while still being too narrow for predators. Attach the ladder with a small hinge.

Purchase a suitable chicken coop for your flock.,
Set up nesting boxes and perches.,
Purchase absorbent bedding.,
Purchase nesting materials.,
Add drinkers and feeders to the coop.,
Add additional items.",How to Set Up a Chicken Coop1," You'll need to decide upon the size, security, run and price. The larger the flock, the larger the coop. The more expensive the coop the more secure and size. If your chickens aren't going to be free-range (let out to roam in the garden) then you need to purchase a coop with an attached run.


You can find chicken coops online, in pet shops or at nearby ranch supply stores. Second-hand coops will be found at a cheaper cost but if you have a large budget, take a look around at a pet shop in town.
A standard chicken needs 4 square foot of floor space in the coop and 8 square foot in the run. Bantams only need half; so 2 square foot in the coop and 4 square foot in the run.
Set up the coop once delivered. What is meant by setting up the coop is constructing it if it wasn't bought set-up already.;
, If the coop doesn't already come with nesting boxes or if the nest boxes are limited to your flock, consider setting up some more. For every four hens there should be one nesting box. Perches are essential to coops so that the hens don't get dirtied in their own waste and can sleep during the night.

, The bedding will layer the floor of the coop and possibly the nesting boxes. The bedding needs to be absorbent to soak in the waste meaning you don't have to clean the coop as often. The top bedding to use is wood shavings whilst the worse would be sand and/or newspaper.


Some people like to layer their coop with two different bedding materials such as newspaper at the bottom and wood shavings at the top to make clean up easier and the material more absorbent.

, This will go inside the nesting boxes to cushion the chickens and the eggs and for the chickens to make nests if they ever want to go broody. Hay and straw is what you need to purchase.

, These are, like many other items, essential to the coop. Depending on your flock size you can choose upon a large drinker/feeder or a smaller one. They can be placed either inside or outside the coop/run.

, Sand tubs for dust bathing, chicken toys, treat bowls, wading water tubs, etc can be added to the coop for extra fun for the chickens.

Set up a fencing system.,
Get rid of poisonous plants.,
Do not use chemicals or pesticides on your lawn.,
Keep a supply of grit nearby.",How to Set Up a Chicken Coop2," Chickens do wander just like an outside cat. The last thing you want is the chickens walking across the road or ending up in the neighbours garden. Set up fencing or chicken wire for your flock to be sure that they are safe. It also keeps predators out.

, Some plants can be toxic to chickens just like some types of foods. You can find a list by researching online. If you know what types of plants you have in your garden give them a search online.


Although chickens will avoid plants that are dangerous to them, there are always exceptions with them.

, These are bad for chickens as they like to graze on grass often. If the chickens ingest these chemicals it can make them possibly ill.

, All the foraging around the garden can be bad on the crop if you don't maintain the chickens well. Grit helps the chickens digest the nutrition they come across.

"
"
Replace the bedding every two weeks.,
Clean the drinkers and feeders.,
Scrub down the nesting boxes and perches.,
Secure the coop every night.,
Do a whole-coop secure check monthly.",How to Set Up a Chicken Coop3," No matter how absorbent the bedding, it will not last forever. Waste will pile up so you will need to chuck the bedding and nesting materials and then replace them with fresh bedding/nesting materials.

, The drinkers and feeders should be cleaned thoroughly every two weeks whilst they should be refilled daily to ensure that they are clean and fresh.

, These two should be scrubbed down every to weeks or less. Waste can pile up otherwise, which is bad for the chickens.

, The chickens should be rounded up inside and shut in. Lock the doors and nesting box access so that no predators can sneakily make their way in.

, This is different from securing the coop every night. You're looking for holes in the coop and run, weak wood wearing away, pest infestation (such as mites, mice or termites), digging signs around the coop, etc.

Avoid using chemicals and pesticides.,
Avoid mowing or cutting the lawn.,

Keep the garden clean.",How to Build a Chicken Friendly Garden," You need to be sure that there are no escape routes, holes through the fencing (if you have any) or poisonous plants about. Come up with a bullet list of problems that need fixing in the garden and work your way through them.;
, This is vital, especially if you keep chickens. It keeps the chickens in and the predators out. You may want to opt for a more expensive option that works better for your flock if you have trouble with predators.

, Cats and dogs may pose as a stressful, and even harmful risk to your flock. If you're not too confident of your other pets being with the flock then it's best to be on the safe side and keep them indoors.

, Chickens love grass and it plays part of their balanced diet. They also love to delve beneath the grass to gain plenty of hidden nutrients. Try keeping weeds about too; your chickens may enjoy them.

, There are a list of plants that are poisonous to chickens so you might want to stay on the safe side, especially if you have a wide range of flowers in your garden. Chickens will usually go with their senses and avoid plants dangerous to them but there are always exceptions.

, Chickens love vegetables and they will love them even more when they get to pick upon each plant in the garden. If you don't mind the vegetable plants getting picked at, grow an accessible veggie patch for the flock.


Herbs are actually really good for chickens. They reduce stress and have health benefits. They're also quick and easy to grow. You may even have your own use out of the plantings.
Be aware that some vegetables are toxic to chickens such as potatoes, tomatoes and avocados.

, Chickens will explore and peck at everything available to them in the garden. If you have a cherished plant that you'd hate to be destroyed then make sure you protect it. You can do this by putting a barrier of chicken wire around it.

, This is a big and obvious no, especially if you have pets at home. The chemicals can irritate them whilst pesticides can make your animals very ill. Instead, opt for organic remedies.

, Your chickens will finish the job for you! Chickens love digging through long grass and it's essential to their free-range lifestyle. The leftover grass from the mower may also be unsafe to your flock.

, Chickens dust-bathe to groom themselves and to prevent parasites from occurring on their bodies. A basic pile of sand or dry dirt patch is enough to encourage your flock.

, They might find themselves a bit peckish or thirsty after a hard days work of exploring the garden. Water is especially important to keep your chickens hydrated, especially on a heated day.

, Every now and then one of your hens may need to lay an egg due to the fact that they lay daily. You should keep the coop open for easy access or at least the nesting boxes.

, Chickens do make a mess of the garden and waste can build up. Some people like to rake things in place and hose down the waste if it builds up. Other than that chickens don't usually make a mess and their waste provides a great, organic fertiliser for the grass and plants.

Hold the chicken down on a flat surface.,
Wiggle your finger.,
Let go of its legs.,
Draw a line in front of its beak instead.,
Wake it up by clapping.",How to Hypnotize a Chicken1," Hold the chicken with one hand supporting the breast. Place it down so that its breast is carrying its weight and rests on the ground. Continue to hold its feet so the grand experiment can continue.


You can place the chicken on its breast instead. Press gently down on its back, and gently move its legs back if it tries to stand up.;
, Hold the bird down gently with one hand. Put one finger on your other hand just in front of its beak tip, without touching it. Move the finger backward to about 4 inches (10 cm) away, then back again.Repeat until the chicken stops moving or squawking.

, The chicken should be ""hypnotized"" and cease to struggle. It will lie there for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes.

, If the chicken wasn't hypnotized, try this alternative. Using chalk, a stick, or your finger, draw a line on the ground 12"" (30 cm) long. Start near the chicken's beak and draw the line slowly outward, in front of its head.Some people use a horizontal line in front of the chicken instead.Are chickens afraid of lines? Is there any reason this would work better than wiggling your fingers? Great minds still search for an answer.

, Be nice to your feathered friend and let it get back to its business. Clap your hands or give it a gentle shove until it jumps up and walks away."

Find a box made from wood or plastic.,
Fill the box up with soil.,
Place it at the opposite end to the food.,
Check it regularly to clean out bird feces, particles, etc.",How to Make a Dust Bath for Chickens," Avoid using cardboard because it will not last long around chickens and after it falls to pieces, they'll finish the job off by eating it. Good dimensions for the dust bath box are:


Height of sides approximately 15–25 centimeter (5.9–9.8 in) to keep soil in when chickens scratch about
The overall dimensions are about 30 x 55cm.;
, Only fill to about three-quarters of the box height.

, This will prevent the chickens from kicking dust into their food when they clean themselves.

, and to top up the soil as needed. Other than that, stand back and let them enjoy it!

Understand the hypnotic effect.,
Keep the chicken upright or on its side.,
Keep hypnosis short and infrequent.,
Get your chickens used to humans and novelty.,
Watch for signs of stress.",How to Hypnotize a Chicken2," Researchers call this effect ""tonic immobility."" When a chicken or another animal with this tendency becomes frightened, its heart rate lowers and it stops moving.This may be an attempt to play dead, discouraging predators that prefer live prey. Unlike an opossum, the chicken gives an unconvincing act, as it continues to blink and breathe in an obvious way., While it's not uncommon to transport a chicken by its feet, this upside-down hold risks breaking the chicken's hip.Hypnosis techniques that involve laying a chicken on its back may ""succeed"" by cutting off its air supply. This can cause the chicken significant discomfort, leading to fainting or even, rarely, death., It's not completely clear how much stress this hypnosis causes. Even if it does, the chicken shouldn't suffer as long as you let it go soon afterward. Hours of stress, or regular exposure to stressful situations, can cause serious health problems., Chickens cope with stress better if they are used to contact with humans. Even prolonged eye contact seems to have an effect.Living in stimulating environments with new objects may also help.Hens raise in battery cages stay ""hypnotized"" longer, possibly because of greater fear., Abnormal feathering, constant preening, or delays in egg-laying are all signs of a stressed chicken.While hypnotizing is unlikely to cause serious harm, any type of stress is more damaging to a chicken in this state.

Pick your chicken.,
Find some edible food dye.,
Use a toothbrush to color the feathers.,
Allow the dye to fade on its own.",How to Color Chickens1," If you want to make your chicken's feathers look fancy, you can safely do so using a little food coloring. The color will come out best on white-feathered chickens.;
, Find some vegetable-based food colors in an array of colors -- blue, green, red, yellow. Pour a few drops of each color into its own small bowl.

, Dip a clean toothbrush into the food coloring and use it to gently rub the dye onto the chickens feathers.


You may need a helper to hold the chicken and keep it calm while you are completing your work.
Be careful to avoid the chicken's eyes and orifices.

, The food coloring should fade from the feathers over time, or be replaced with clean, new feathers as the chicken molts. This can take some time however, so don't use dye if you intend to show or sell your chickens in the near future.

Find out where you can get day old chicks.,
Keep your chick in a decent cage with a heat lamp.,
Provide a dish for feeding and drinking and clean them daily.,

When your chicken is about 8-10 weeks old change its diet to a fully grown chicken feed and provide your chicken some grit.

,
Keep your chicken in a bigger cage when it grows older.",How to Keep a Pet Chicken," You can ask at pet shops, farms, vet clinics, or poultry farms. Most day old chicks are available at a farm store whilst you can a range of week old chicks online at any time.


Decide what breed of chicken you want. Choose a breed that is suitable for your lifestyle. When choosing the best starter breed it's best to go for a bantam breed as they are a small breed that are cheap, easy and requires less space and food than standard chickens.;
, Make sure that the cage is in a warm place (preferably indoors) and out of reach of predators.

Clean the cage daily and provide a bowl full of sand to prevent mites.

, Whilst you only need to feed your chick a little amount per day, it needs a constant fresh supply of water to keep it hydrated.

, Chick feed has smaller grains than normal chicken feed and gives a balanced diet which is required for your chick.

,, Provide the cage with a run so your chicken can scratch about freely in the grass/dirt and get access to sunlight.

Examine the size of your bird.,
Check the body shape and proportion.,
Look at the wattles and combs.,
Inspect the feathers.,
Review the colouration.,
Purchase a chicken-breed guide.,
Research online.,
Ask on a public forum.,
Ask a knowledgeable breeder.",How to Identify Chicken Breeds," Chickens are separated by two size groups which are bantams and standard breeds. Bantams are miniature breeds of chickens such as Pekins and Silkies whilst standards are the original (AKA standard) sizing of chickens.
, The body proportion is determined by the purpose the chicken was bred for such as meat and layers breeds. Meat breeds are heavier and have a larger bone structure to support their body weight whilst laying breed tend to have smaller bodies in order to put all their nutrients and resources towards their egg production.Dual purpose breeds such as Australorps and Orpingtons have an in between body proportion of a meat and egg layer breed. They tend to have a large mass but still lay an adequate amount of eggs.

, Primarily the combs are the parts you want to be looking at as different breeds have different shaped combs. There are eight distinctive combs which are single, pea, cushion, strawberry, walnut, buttercup, V-shaped and rose.Most common breeds have single combs whilst breeds such as silkies can be seen with walnut, Chickens can have close-fitted or loose-fitted feathers. It's all up to the breed and their purpose. Decorative breed such as silkies have more exotic feathering which are more fluff/hair like than feathers., The colour of your chicken can really help you determine what breed you have. You could have a blue chicken or red, orange, black or white. Or perhaps a mixture., A book can become really helpful in this specific situation. You want books that provide pictures and descriptions of each breeds., Type in the comb, colouration, feathering and body shape and enter into your search bar. You should get some results showing up on your computer (or whatever device you're using)., Chickens are popular pets and you're not the only one who's been in this situation. Go onto a chicken forum online and create a thread on there. Include pictures and a description of your chicken., A chicken breeder should have some knowledge on your specific breed. Aim for a person who specialises in breeding various chickens from bantams to standards."
"
Decide where to get your chicks.,
Have a water container prepared.,
Have a heat lamp pointed at one spot of the cage/box at all times so the chicks can keep warm.,
Know the different breeds and their standards.,
Make sure you pick a breed suitable for the environment you live in.",How to Properly Care for Your Chicks and Older Chickens1," You can buy them at a local feed store or find someone who hatches them often. It is suggested that you buy them from a feed store, because those stores sex them (find their gender) and give them vaccinations that will protect them from various diseases later in life. Before you get your chicks, have a box or a cage to put them in.


Line the bottom with newspaper for now and start to introduce hay and straw later. Have a food container with chick pellet designed especially for young chicks.;
, Be warned that the waterer must be small enough that the chicks cannot fall in and drown. Put clean, colorful marbles in the water to prevent drowning and entice the chicks to peck at it (this method trains them to drink from the waterer).

, Other lamps work too, just be sure it is at least a 60 watt and is not too close to the chicks (you don't want to cook them alive!). Remember to have loads of newspaper; despite their size, chicks and chickens poop a lot.

, Some are hardy for surviving in the cold and lay in the winter, and others for a more warm or hot place. Some breeds are even more likely to go broody (which means then hen will stop laying and prefer to sit and hatch eggs).


The breed you choose depends entirely on what your purpose is. Some people have chickens to get eggs for themselves, others to get eggs to sell, and others just want pets or show chickens ( yes, there are show chickens and those kind of competitions out there).

, Also be sure that you will have a place to build an outdoor pen when they get bigger.

Decide on whether you can raise a chick at home.,
Decide on how and where you're going to get your chicks.,
Set up a brooder.,
Care for your chicks as they grow.,
Handle the chicks as they grow.,
Move the chicks to a run at 4-6 weeks.,
Care and handle your pullets (young females) more.",How to Hand Raise a Chicken," Think about your lifestyle, career, free time, schedule, finances, housing, etc. Your chick will need four main things; shelter, space, time, and money.


Finances is one of the most important sources you need to bring up a young chick. You need to cash out on a brooder set-up, coop, feeder, drinker, feed mix, incubator, heat lamp, etc.
Space is the second source you need to think about. Do you have the space for a brooder? Do you have the space for a large coop? Do you have the space to free-range your hen? Every fully grown hen should have at least 4 square feet each in the coop.;
, You should decide on getting, at least, two chicks as they are social birds and live in flocks. You have the choice to incubate a batch of fertilized eggs, order online from a hatchery or purchase day-old chicks.


Incubating your own eggs means you'll have to invest in an incubator. There is a caution to hatching your own eggs as you may get some males along with females and not all eggs might hatch.
Ordering online or purchasing day-old chicks may be easier for you than incubating your eggs yourself. Many hatcheries let you choose on a breed of chicken you want and choose the sex of your chick. Opt to having a female chick instead of a male as females lay eggs, are less noisy and do not fight.

, Before you receive your chicks it is essential that you set up a brooder station. A brooder is primarily a small box with a heat lamp where your chicks will be staying for the first few weeks of their lives. You'll need a few things to set up your brooder;


A large boxed container of some sort. Most types of boxes should be fine such as a large plastic container, tub, wooden box or cardboard box. Most people opt with making their own square wooden box.
Absorbent, dry bedding. There are a lot of choices you can go for such as hay, straw, wood shavings, paper towels, etc. Wood shavings are the most absorbent whilst you should avoid using newspaper which can cause splayed leg.
Feeding and drinking stations. Most feeders/drinkers can be found in pet, feed, ranch or warehouse stores. Look for a chick feeder/drinker which tend to be smaller so the chicks can easily eat and drink out of them.
A chick feed. Again these can be found where you get your feeding/drinking stations. Chick feed is different to a chicken mix as it is higher in protein and contains all the nutrients your chick will benefit from. It is important your chicks stick to this diet.
A heat lamp. Chicks need to stay warm for the first few weeks. Purchase an effective heat lamp and set it to 95 °F (35 °C). Every week turn the temperature down 5 degrees until the heat lamp reaches room temperature.

, Chicks need food every day and their drinkers should be filled with clean water. The bedding should be cleaned regularly and so should the feeding/drinking stations. Remember to check on the chicks all throughout the day.

, Handling the chicks at a young age is an important process in taming them. It's easy to handle chicks and they become tame as you do so. When you handle the chicks often it imprints on them that you are their mother., As the chicks begin to grow you must provide them with more space and once they reach a certain age they should get use to the outside world. Move them onto a large, spacious run and a coop as this should be their new home., You can begin to give the chicks small treats such as fruits, vegetables, and/or bugs. Feed them straight from your hand to tame them a bit more. If you've been handling them well they should already have imprinted onto you.


You can supplement your pullets diet with crushed egg/oyster shells for calcium when they start laying. This creates strong eggs.
Do not feed your pullets food that is bad for them such as chocolate, caffeine, candy, avocado, citrus, salt, tomato stems, raw potato skins, etc.

"
"
Choose the right time.,
Gather your dye and needle.,
Inject the dye.,
Replace the eggs in the incubator.",How to Color Chickens2," It's possible to inject dye into chicken eggs during the incubation period, to help distinguish one group of chicks from another after hatching.


This process is completely safe if done correctly, but can harm or kill the chick if done incorrectly or at the wrong time.
The safest time to inject the chicken embryos with dye is between the 11th and 14th day of incubation, though it can be done as early as the 10th and as late as the 19th.

, To inject the chicken egg, you will need a 2 or 3% solution of simple, vegetable-based food coloring.


Any color can be used to dye the embryos, though blue, green and red tend to work best, especially on naturally white chickens.
You will also need a hypodermic needle to inject the dye with.

, Remove the eggs from the incubator and rub the small ends with a 95% alcohol solution to disinfect them, then allow them to dry.


Use a 22 to 27 gauge needle to inject between 0.2 and 0.5 cc of your chosen needle into the egg, approximately one-half inch from the small end of the egg.
Insert the needle just below the inner shell membrane and inject the dye slowly and carefully to avoid overflowing and to prevent it from harming the embryo.

, After you have removed the needle, cover up the hole with a drop of melted paraffin wax to protect the embryo from infection. Return the eggs to the incubator, where they should continue to develop and hatch as normal."
"
Build a coop sizeable to the number of chickens you have.,
Protect your flock.",How to Properly Care for Your Chicks and Older Chickens2," You can move the chicks to an outdoor pen between four and five weeks of age.


Your big pen should have a door you can walk through, a big water container (chickens drink lots a water in the summer ), a big food container, roosts ( or pole the chickens fly up to, to sleep), and last but certainly not least, nesting boxes.
You need at least one nest per two chickens and no more than one nest for three. Make sure there is a roof, and a place to go to avoid the wind. Don't rush yourself into making bad nests, they don't start laying until between eight and fourteen months old. If the nests are on the wall, slightly tilt them forward when nailing them in.
The tilt will make the nest slightly uncomfortable; the hen doesn't roost there and doesn't become broody. (You can let a hen go broody, but it is best to move her out of the big pen and move her to a small pen by herself ). Put some straw or hay in the nests to soften the fall of the eggs when they are laid so they don't crack.

, While constructing you pen, make sure the wire is in the ground so nothing can dig its way in and so your chickens don't dig their way out. Stray or neighboring dogs and cats might try to make their way in, make you pen double wired (Try normal wire or fencing, then line it with chicken wire after ).


Don't forget about wild animals, like raccoons, possums, snakes, bobcats, or even birds of prey. Don't leave any holes in your pen, for most of wild raccoons and possums, if they can get their heads in, their body might follow.
Always check around your pen for scratches in the ground or ""attempts to breaks in"". A rooster is a good line of defense when protecting you chickens from harm. A rooster though should have at least ten hens to prevent them from losing feathers (if a rooster has less than ten hens, he will end up over mating them and making the hens' backs featherless).
Some roosters can be ""trained"" to know not to attack you when you enter the pen. Others, however, will always be aggressive and should be taken into precaution when entering the pen. If a hen gets hurt, don't lose hope. You can give them Neosporin, bandages, and antibiotics for chickens. If a hen does get hurt, don't leave her in the pen. Chickens instinctively peck red; in this case, the red is blood.

Give your chicks a special chick starter feed.,
Give your older hens normal feed.,
Provide fresh water at all times.",How to Properly Care for Your Chicks and Older Chickens3," Chick starter provides more protein and a balanced diet for your chicks to grow properly. Give them chick starter everyday until they are 6-8 weeks old.


Don't give your chicks a lot of feed as they are small and do not need as much as the older chickens.
Do not feed your chicks straight after they are born, feed them a day after hatching.
There are two types of chick starters, medicated and non-medicated. Consider giving them medicated if your chicks have suffered from coccidiosis in the past.

, Fully-grown hens do not need the special chick starter as they do not require as much protein, but there is a number of things that you can supply them with.


Mix crushed oyster shells in their feed for calcium so that they can lay healthy eggs (this is important if their eggs are soft).
Provide grit to grind down their food. Grit is only needed if your hens live in a shed or coop all their life, if they are free-ranged they will not need this as most of their diet is made up on the stuff they find in the ground.
Provide your hens with laying pellets at about 8 months old. Laying pellets is good for them to lay healthy and yummy eggs.
Give your chickens table scraps.They love it and its very good for them, just be aware that they cannot eat some foods such as citrus fruits, avocado, garlic, onions or raw potatoes.

, Make sure the water is not too deep for your chickens as they can fall in and drown, a water-feeder is best in this case.


Clean the feeder once a week (or every 2 weeks) and fill it with fresh water everyday.
Provide more than one water feeder if you have over 10 chickens. If you have free-ranged chickens provide one outside and one inside their coop.

"
"
Clean the coop at least once a month.,
Clean your chicken if it is very dirty and stands out because of its filth.,
Let your chickens be free once in a while.,
Groom your chickens.",How to Properly Care for Your Chicks and Older Chickens4," If you do not do this your chickens will become dirty, they will most likely get a disease, the eggs will become bad and the coop will probably get infested by mites, so make sure you put on some gloves and clean!


Throw away any bad eggs. If There are good eggs, keep them. To tell if an egg is bad put it inside a glass filled with water, if it floats it is bad but if it sinks it is good.
Dispose of all bedding (including the bedding in the nesting boxes). Do this by putting them in a garbage bag and throwing them in the bin.
Hose the coop down. This will dispose of all the chicken waste and clean all the dirt. If needed, scrub the coop down to make it extra clean.
Rinse all the feeders, bowls or tubs. If some dirt/food will not come off, scrub them.

, Chickens naturally keep themselves clean but occasionally it is best to wash them to keep them looking their best.


Fill two tubs with water, one soapy and one clear. Put the chicken in the soapy tub and clean them. After, put the chicken in the clear tub to rinse off the soap. Dry your chicken properly to keep them from freezing to death.

, If your chickens live in a coop/shed consider letting them outside in a run or an enclosed garden. They can get lots of healthy treats from the ground and the grass is really good for them!


If you prefer not to let them outside, at least throw some grass in their coop.

, To keep your chickens looking their best (and for other needs) consider grooming them.


Trim your roosters spurs. this is mostly important if you don't want to get stabbed by them when your rooster attacks.
Clip your chickens wings. Chickens can fly very high and escape, in this case it is best to clip them to avoid any injuries or escapes.
Trim your chickens beaks and claws. Beaks and claws can become very sharp at times and will do you some harm if you do not trim them.

Consider waiting until Nighttime to catch your chicken.,
Approach the chicken quietly with a flashlight.,
Grab the chicken.",How to Catch a Chicken1," It is often easier to catch chickens at Nighttime.


Chickens roost at night, making them less mobile and easier to catch off guard.
If you have a coop you can catch them after they roost for the night on the roosting rods. If a chicken has escaped, find where it is roosting and catch it there.
You should try to be as quiet and gentle as possible.;
, Avoid making too much noise or sudden movements. Point the light towards the ground.
If you are in the coop and shine the light directly at the birds on the roosting rod, you risk waking or startling them.
Approach the chicken slowly.

, You can do this slowly and gently without disturbing the whole coop.Cup your hands and grab the chicken over the wings.
This will prevent the chicken from flapping its wings and disturbing the other birds.
Hold it close to your body tightly, like you would a pet.

Use chicks in their 11th to 14th day of incubation.,
Sterilize the egg and needle.,
Puncture the eggshell.,
Insert the dye.,
Seal the hole.,
Insert dye and seal the hole within 30 minutes.,
Return the eggs to the incubator.",How to Dye a Baby Chicken," It is possible to inject eggs that have been incubated anywhere from 10 to 19 days, but the 11th to 14th period is ideal. Only one injection is necessary if done at this time., Sterilize the outside of the egg and the hypodermic needles. You do not want to introduce bacteria to the embryo which may harm it.Use alcohol pads of 95 percent isopropyl alcohol to thoroughly wipe down the egg and needles.Let the eggshell and utensils dry.
Make sure they not become contaminated while drying. For example, place them on a sterile gauze pad., With the hypodermic needle, slowly and carefully make a small hole in the shell about one half-inch from the small end of the egg.


Do not insert the needle too far as this will damage the embryo.
Use a different needle for each egg to ensure sterility.

, Extract .5 milliliters of dye from the bottle and insert the tip of the needle into the hole.Slowly and carefully inject the dye into the egg to prevent overflowing.Insert the dye just under the shell and membrane.
Use vegetable food coloring as the dye.
Use a different needle for each color to keep colors pure.

, Close the hole in the shell with a small drop of melted paraffin, making sure to cover the entirety of the hole.


Paraffin can be found at many craft stores.
You can use an adhesive bandage if no paraffin is available., Do not keep the eggs out of the incubator longer than 30 minutes for the safety of the embryos.


Embryos can be damaged if not kept at a high temperature., Chicks typically take 21 days to hatch.


Incubate chicken eggs between 99 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit with 50-65 percent relative humidity."

Feed ducklings and adolescent ducks a diet that is 18-20% protein.Young ducks grow quickly, and as a result, they need food that has a lot of protein and is high in calories.,
Feed ducks over the age of 3 weeks a diet that is 14% protein.,
Feed laying ducks a 16-17% protein diet that has 3-4% calcium.This amount of calcium is needed for laying ducks to make quality eggs.,
Offer occasional treats like corn, carrots, and greens like cucumber or broccoli.,
Provide food at all times during the day.Ducks should be allowed to graze freely on their food.,
Buy small amounts of fresh food more frequently.,
Provide cool 50-70°F (10-21°C) and clean drinking water.,
Keep newborn ducks in a brooder for 4-6 weeks.Ducklings cannot yet regulate their body temperature, so a brooder (a heated poultry box) is necessary.,
Keep adult ducks at their optimum temperature.,
Provide a pen large enough for the ducks to walk around.,
House the ducks in a pen with adequate protection and flooring.,
Keep the housing clean and well-ventilated.,
Provide the ducks with 14-17 hours of light every day.,
Allow nesting mothers to hatch their eggs.,
Talk to your ducks.Just like humans, ducks can hear and respond to sound.,
Play gently with the ducks.,
Take your ducks to the vet if they look ill. During feeding time, observe your ducks for any health problems.",How to Care for a Pet Duck," For the first 3 weeks of life, feed them a starter diet that is 18-20% protein and consists of small pellets (about 1/8"").


Duck food can be bought at your local pet store. Some reputable manufacturers of duck food are Purina, Mazuri, or Gunter.
Though chicken feed can be substituted for duck food, chicken feed should not be fed to ducklings.Once the ducklings reach 20 weeks of age, you can substitute duck food for chicken feed with the same amount of protein.;
, Male and female ducks will both need the same amount of protein. Check the back of your duck food bag for nutritional information.

, You can begin to feed the female ducks this higher protein diet in the spring time, when they are likely to begin laying eggs.

, These treats should compromise no more than 15-20% of a duck’s diet. Cut all treats into small pieces. You can also let your duck graze outside, provided the area they are grazing has no pesticides or other toxic materials.


Don’t season or cook these treats. Feed them raw.
Bread, chocolate, onion, garlic, popcorn, avocados, and citrus fruits should not be fed to ducks.

, Remove the food at night so it does not begin to rot or attract ants and rats. Each duck will consume about 6-7 ounces of food per day, but bigger ducks may eat a bit more.

, Buying duck food in bulk will work for feeding large flocks, but for smaller flocks, buy small amounts of food frequently so they will have fresh food all the time. Moldy food can make ducks very sick.Store leftover duck food where it can keep dry.

, This water can be provided in a trough, an outdoor pond, or a shallow bucket. Any large, open container the ducks can fit their bill in will suffice. If you decide to use a watering system, such as those designed for chickens or turkeys, just make sure the ducks can reach the water.


The water should always be clean, as ducks are especially prone to botulism.
Change the water daily.

, Newborn ducks need to be kept at 86°F (30°C) for the first week and at 81°F (27°C) after that.


After 4-6 weeks, ducks can regulate their temperature and no longer need to be kept in a brooder.
Brooders can easily be bought online or at a pet store.
If your ducklings seem to be panting, turn the brooder temperature down a couple of degrees.

, Ducks that are 35 days old or older and ducks who are laying eggs need to be kept at 55°F (13°C). Ducks that are clustering together are likely cold, and if they are panting, they are too warm. Watch for this, and adjust the temperature accordingly.Provide cool water for ducks to swim in if the weather is extremely hot.
Keep the ducks somewhere you can maintain the temperature.

, Newborn ducklings only require 289 square centimeters (.31 sq ft) each to roam, and this amount increases as they age. Ducks 3 days of age need 1024 sq cm (1.10 sq ft), ducks 1 week old need 2304 sq cm (2.48), and ducks laying eggs need 2500-2809 sq cm (3 sq ft)., If the pen has wire floors, floors for ducklings under 3 weeks should be constructed of 1.9 cm (3/4 inch) mesh and 12-gauge welded wire. This should be attached to a frame designed to keep the wire flat and minimize manure accumulation. For ducks over 3 weeks, use 2.5 cm (1 inch) mesh. Vinyl coated wire or smooth galvanized wire is preferred.


The pen should be secure enough so the ducks do not escape.
The shelter should protect from raccoons or bobcats, especially if the shelter is outside.
Non-wire floors are fine, as long as there aren’t lots of places the ducks can scrap their fragile feet.

, Ducks are messy birds with liquid excrement, which is why you must sanitize the housing with a non-toxic disinfectant at least 3 times a week.Their housing also needs ventilation, such as an open window. If your ducks are being kept indoors, be sure they are getting air.

, At many points during the year, the sun is not out this long. Turn on artificial lights once the sun sets to provide 14-17 hours of light for the ducks.

, During the spring time, female ducks will begin to lay eggs, so you should provide them with plenty of peace and quiet, food, and a nearby water source. If you do not want more ducklings, simply remove the eggs from the laying duck soon after she lays them. Ducks like to hide their eggs, so you may find them unexpectedly.


It is normal for a duck to abandon her eggs. She may hatch them next time.
Ducks can lay one egg at a time or 14, depending on the duck.
Once she has laid about 1 dozen eggs, they will hatch in about one month, though some may not survive.Place newborns in the brooder.

, Talking to your ducks will help you bond with them. You can name them, too.

, Ducks have been known to do tricks and be somewhat affectionate. You can buy some bird toys to play with them, or simply take the ducks in the bathtub for a swim. Every duck has a different personality. They may even play with string or try to dig holes.

, If they seem lethargic, are losing feathers, or don’t have an appetite, you should take them to a vet. The vet will provide care and necessary medication.

Bait the chickens.,
Approach the chicken slowly from behind.,
Grasp the chicken.,
Try using a poultry hook if you can't grab a chicken by hand.",How to Catch a Chicken2," Try putting a little bit of feed out and they will flock to it.


Try doing this in your chicken coop if you have one. It is a more contained area and it will be easier to catch the chicken you want inside of it.
If your chickens won't come to you for regular feed, you can try pieces of bread as a treat, but these should be used sparingly.
Once chickens have flocked to their food, you can approach them.

, If you move quickly, you will risk disturbing the hen and scaring her into a run. Be as quiet as possible.
Don't make sudden movements.
Hover over the chicken.
This may cause the chicken to stop, crouch down and open its wings. This is what they do during mating.

, You can do this a number of ways. The easiest and gentlest way to grab a chicken is to bend down and gently scoop up the chicken. Keep your hands or arms over her wings so she can't flap them to get away.
You can also grab the chicken by the back and tail. Cup your hands and scoop up the chicken gently, scooping up from underneath. If the chicken runs forward grasp the tail feathers and grab the chicken from the front by the shoulders.
Avoid having to grab the tail feathers as much as possible, as chickens dislike this.
You can also try to grab the chicken by its legs underneath. Avoid holding the chicken upside down from its legs if you do this.

, This is less gentle and quiet, but it is effective.Poultry hooks are long handled sticks with a hook made of wire on the end.
Try hooking the chicken by the leg and pulling her toward you.
You can also use a handled net to catch particularly stubborn bird.

Prevent chickens from escaping by building a chicken coop.,
Plan the chicken coop size.,
Consider making elevation platforms for your chicken coop.,
Make your flooring.,
Build the sides and door of your chicken coop.,
Build nesting boxes.,
Place roosting rods high in the chicken coop.,
Build a secure roof.,
Add bedding to the floor and nesting boxes of the coop.,
Keep regular maintenance of the pen.",How to Catch a Chicken3," You should use a quality wood and high grade chicken wire. A chicken coop is a structure that will house chickens.
Most chicken coops will be elevated structures with latched doors and chicken wire windows.
Chicken wire will prevent the chickens from escaping and it will keep predators out.
Most chicken coops will have roosting bars for the chickens to roost on and nesting boxes for the chickens to lay their eggs in.

, You will want the chickens to have enough room in the coop. Plan for at least 2-4 square feet of floor space per chicken in your flock.
You will need a nesting box for every 3-4 chickens.
For example, if you had 12 chickens, you would need at least 24 square feet of floor space and at least 6 nesting boxes.

, Elevation is necessary to prevent predators from digging into the coop. You can elevate your coop with cement blocks, bricks, or a wooden platform.
Lay out the size of the coop on the ground and place your elevation platforms at each corner.
To make these more sturdy you might drive them into the ground to steady them.

, Most chicken coops have a wood flooring if they are raised from the ground. Plywood covered with inexpensive linoleum is a preferred and cost-effective chicken coop flooring.
Linoleum covering on a chicken coop floor will be durable as well as easy to clean.
If you have decided against elevating your chicken coop you can use a dirt floor, but this won't prevent predators.
If you don't have an elevated coop, you can also lay out concrete for flooring. This will keep out predators and be simple to clean.

, You can start with a plywood frame. Make sure the coop is ventilated. This means that most of the sides should be windows rather than a solid wooden wall.
Cover the open sides of the frame with a high-grade chicken wire. This will keep your chickens in the coop and predators out.
Make a door with a latch. This latch should be a locking eye-hook type. Raccoons and other predators have been known to open sliding latches.

, This is where chickens will lay their eggs. These should be about 12 inches square. You will need one for every 3-4 chickens in the coop.
You can place these at floor level or on a platform.
If they are on a platform, build a small ramp or ladder so the chickens can climb into them.

, These should be above the nesting boxes.


If the roosts are placed below the nesting boxes, the chickens will be tempted to sleep in the nesting boxes. This will cause them to be soiled and unsuitable for eggs.
Plan on using a wooden rod with at least 8 inches of space per chicken.
Avoid metal roosting rods. These will get cold in the wintertime. Plastic should also be avoided as it can get slippery.

, This can be sloped to avoid rainwater from collecting or flat.


Make sure it is solid and free of holes. You don't want your chickens to be wet in the rain.
You will also want to make sure your chickens have shade.
Some chicken coop kits and plans have shingles for sealing the roof. You can use these or make your own.

, This will provide a cozy cushioning for the birds. Avoid using hay, as it can get moldy.
Sand and sawdust can become wet, soiled, and harbor bacteria.
Straw or pine shavings make the cleanest and best bedding.

, You will have to make sure the coop is clean and free of escape points.


You should plan on cleaning your chicken coop often.
Chickens will soil the coop, so you need to replace the bedding and wash down the flooring regularly.
Make sure the latches, chicken wire, and platform are secure and free of holes.

Determine your chicken's gender (male or female).,
You could give your chicken a name according to its favorite action or activity.,
You could also give your chicken a name according to its appearance.,
You could name your chicken after a loved one - living or deceased.,
Once you choose a name for your chicken, call the chicken by its name.",How to Choose the Perfect Name for Your Chicken," In order to choose a perfect name, you'll need to know whether you can use male names or female names. To distinguish the difference between a male and a female chicken, males usually have a larger comb than a female's on the tops of their heads. Also, while female chickens have plainer feathers, roosters usually have more colorful, attractive feathers.


You could also ask someone experienced in chicken sexing to come down and take a look at your chicken to determine the gender if you have trouble doing it yourself.
Once the gender of your chicken has been confirmed, you should have an easier time knowing which names go with it and which names are out of the question.;
, Study the chicken for a while. Note what action it seems to be doing the most and where it usually likes to go. For example: If your chicken normally likes to sit in the sun, you could give a name related to the sun, such as ""Sunshine"".

, If it appears skinny, similar to a tall, dignified gentleman, you could give it a name that describes its appearance. However, if it appears fat and short, the name you give it would be entirely different from the skinny chicken.

, This is both an act of affection and a sign of love for the person you name it after. Also, it will seal the memory of your loved one into your mind forever and that chicken will also become precious to you because of that.

, Depending on the chicken, it may or may not respond to you. However, don't be disappointed if it doesn't respond, for not all chickens will do that. Instead, patiently keep calling it by its name and it'll probably respond to you later in time.

Choose your ducks.,
Establish trust with them and wait for them to understand that this is their new home.,
Feed your ducks.,
Ducks lay eggs mid-winter through mid-summer.",How to Care for a Flock of Ducks," There are about 5 different breeds of ducks that would be suitable for you to keep.


The Saxony is a large breed that can lay about 150 eggs per year. They are practical, but the females are noisy.
The Indian Runner is pretty hardy and they stay in an unusual upright position. They can lay about 300 eggs per year. They are good-spirited and they don't make much noise.
The Muscovy is a gentle breed and are very quiet. The females are very maternal. These birds are good for butchering.
The Khaki Campbell is an amazing egg layer, sometimes laying more than 300 eggs per year! They are quiet and practical.
The Rouen Clair is large but docile. They are fairly good at egg-laying and they have tasty meat. They are very quiet.;
, Keep them in their shelter with a bit of outdoor running for the first few days. If you leave them out at night when they first come to their new home, they may fly away, so lock them in their shelter at night for the first few days.

, Ducks always need fresh water. They also need grass, grain and grit to feed on. Grit is needed for digestion, so put it in a flower pot or box for them to eat. Ducks will usually also forage for slugs, snails, and worms as a snack. All you need to supplement the bug diet is basic grain ration. If you want to fatten up your ducks to butcher, feed them corn and mixed protein foods.

, Healthy ducks will produce for up to three years. The dark part of your duck shelter should have separate sections for comfortable egg-laying. If your ducks won't lay eggs, put china eggs in the nest to encourage them to lay eggs. Take the eggs out daily, since foxes are attracted to them and to avoid brooding and damaged eggs. Before cooking, wipe the shells since they are more porous then that of the hen.

Think about the purpose of your potential flock.,
Consider your lifestyle.,
Measure your home.,
Consider the year-round weather in your area.,
Think about eggs.",How to Choose a Chicken Breed," Do you want eggs? Meat? Or a bit of both. You might want them as a pet by making sure you get a friendly breed. Or maybe you want to make money by entering your chickens in poultry shows? There are plenty of breeds to choose from that have different pros and cons.

Rhode Island Red, Buff Orpington, Australorp, Leghorn and Plymouth Rock chickens are fantastic egg laying breeds. They lay large, strong eggs almost every day.
The best meat breeds (or broilers) are the Cornish Cross and Jersey Giant. They are large birds that grow rapidly.
You can also research more into dual-purpose breeds meaning that you can get two in one. Most breeds are friendly and great egg layers such as the Buff Orpington. The Australorp is a friendly breed that can also be slaughtered for meat along with many other breeds.
If you want a friendly breed consider a bantam chicken. Bantams are miniature chickens with big, friendly hearts such as pekins (a very common breed).
Showline chickens can be bought from reliable breeders but cost a lot more money. Some breeds can go up to $500. You can easily find inexpensive showline breeds for $50 that have stunning feathers.
If you want to breed chickens consider a popular breed. Australorps, Buff Orpingtons, Pekins and a few other breeds are highly wanted (although it may range depending on where you live). If you don't have an incubator or the money to buy one then consider a broody breed. Silkies and Pekins are guaranteed to go broody and make good mothers too.;
, Time, money and family should be weighed out here! Do you need an inexpensive breed that is cheap to buy and cheap to take care of altogether. You may also need a breed that is more low-maintenance than others or a friendlier breed that is good around kids.

Bantams are smaller breeds that cost half the amount of a standard breed to keep. They are also friendlier and get along with kids well. Buff Orpingtons and Australorps are also friendly breeds but simply in a standard chicken form (meaning they are much larger).

, Chickens tend to take up a lot of space if you're not careful. They need storage for all their food and a large home to stay in. The bigger the flock the more space that is needed.

Chickens don't have to free-range. They can stay inside their coop all day as long as it has an attached run. But the run may be costly to buy. At least they will take up less space in the garden and avoid destroying your prized plants!

, Do you get a lot of heat or a lot of cold? Some breeds are sensitive to too much heat due to their fluffy feathers whilst some cannot deal with the winter snow. However, you can find some hardy breeds out there if you look., Would you like a colourful egg basket? You can get beautiful chickens that lay beautifully coloured eggs in an array of colours. What's best is that you get a varied flock too! You can get eggs from colours of brown, white, cream, pink, green and blue!

For a brown coloured egg you might want to go for Isa Browns or Buff Orpingtons. These are common breeds so won't be expensive or hard to find.
For a cream or white egg look for Leghorns which are top egg-laying breeds or Pekin bantams.
If you're looking for a beautiful and exotic green, pink or blue egg then purchase an easter-egger breed such as the Araucana or Ameraucan.

Grow aquatic plants both inside and around your pond.,
Plant Chufa, a breed of nut-grass.,
Create an environment that includes millets, reeds and tuberous plants on dry land.,
Incorporate rice plants into the environment.,
Avoid using insecticides on your property.,
Ensure your duck has clean drinking water.",How to Attract Ducks1," Ducks eat a variety of aquatic plants and will settle in areas where they will be able to feed. Some examples of aquatic plants that ducks are attracted to are Widgeon Grass and Wild Celery.Wild celery grows under water up to the surface and produces seeds that ducks feed on. Ducks will also dive down to eat the tuber part of the plant.To plant the wild celery, be sure the bulbs are covered with a cheesecloth to prevent sunlight from getting to them. Be sure to plant the wild celery in less than 3 feet of water.Widgeon Grass grows completely underwater and provides food for ducks, geese, and fish. It is grown similarly to Wild Celery, with bulbs planted carefully in shallow water away from direct sunlight.;
, Chufa can be planted anywhere near a pond and is a great source of fat and protein for waterfowl. It grows easily in wet environments and attracts ducks, who love to eat it. It is a simple grass to plant because it does not take much upkeep, and it does not require fertilizer once it is planted.Plant chufa seeds approximately 1 to 2 inches deep into soil near your pond and in rows 2 to 4 inches apart., When the plants mature and then are hydrated by a pond close by, ducks will be attracted to them when they are migrating. Rotating these plants every third year is recommended so that the soil doesn’t become nutrient deficient.

, Ducks are very attracted to rice, which also needs a wet environment to grow. Try adding Japanese millet to your plot. This is used by duck hunters to attract ducks. The millet should be planted in a dry area near the pond. It grows quickly, and stands about 2 to 4 feet tall when it is fully mature., Insecticides and herbicides kill off bugs that ducks love to eat and are also poisonous to them. To attract ducks, don’t use these chemicals on your your lawn or near the pond where you’re hoping to attract them., Be sure that any ducks you attract to your pond are kept healthy by providing them with clean drinking water. Ducks can easily contract botulism, so be sure that their pond is clear of dead animals and pesticides.You can also try keeping a galvanized steel dish or tub of fresh water near the pond. Be sure to clean it daily to make sure the water remains clear.

Gain experience with chickens.,
Decide on a reasonable salary.,
Create your advertisements.,
Discuss expectations and needs.,
You might have to feed the chickens or put them inside of their coop.,
Acquire any necessary contact details.,
Follow any tasks asked.,
Interact with the chickens.,
Don't leave the area messy.",How to Chicken Sit," If you want to become a superb chicken-sitter, then you could start with gaining some experience with them. Surround yourself by chicken's and gain some knowledge about them. Chicken's are fairly interesting birds and are enjoyable to be around too.

Avoid advertising yourself as a chicken-sitter without the proper experience with chickens. You don't have to own your own flock, but at least offer to care for a friend or neighbours chickens. Becoming a paid chicken-sitter without the experience can be setting yourself up for failure.
Volunteer if you must. Like other part-time jobs; the more experience the better chance of getting hired. Experience usually starts out from volunteer work and with the experience gained you can put it in your flyers/resumes. It's also a way to get references which are a notable source to put down on your flyers.;
, Don't advertise your salary too high of an amount that isn't reasonable to the customers. You might find yourself with little to no enquiries., You can choose from a flyer, poster, resume or online ad (or maybe all four!). An advertisement is a way to reach out to people about your position for work, and the more the better.

Put your contact details down such as your name, email and phone number.
Provide a friendly description about yourself.
Jot down any past experiences and references.
And of course; make it clear that you're a chicken-sitter looking for work!

, Like any other customer who is relying on you to take care of their pets, they will discuss the necessities of their flock and what is required by you as their chicken-sitter., Or you might possibly not have to do anything but supervise the flock. You should still discuss with the owners about what you're required to do however.

Ask for any possibly hazards such as predators nearby, other dangerous pets (dogs, cats, etc) or areas that the chickens aren't allowed in.

, You will need the phone number of the owners if anything goes wrong. Sometimes the owner will provide you with details of an avian vet just in case anything becomes catastrophic. But it's rare to be given out any veterinary contact details for chicken's., The owner may provide you with a list or explain to you what is expected which may be anywhere from cleaning the coop, collecting the eggs or feeding the chickens. Make sure to do what is told and at the right time if there is a schedule., If the owners hire you as a frequent pet sitter or possibly might then make-sure you're gaining a bond with the chickens to get them use to you as a person., If your job is about to end, restrain from leaving the area messy even if it was beforehand. Some owners expect the place to be clean when they arrive even if they haven't clarified with you that they want you to clean up. A simple tidy up won't harm and will leave the owners impressed."

Be sure to have a pond nearby.,
Buy duck decoys to place around their habitat.,
Position decoy ducks near the water's edge next to your food plot.,
Refrain from housing other animals near the pond.,
Allow grasses around your pond to grow tall.",How to Attract Ducks2," In order to attract ducks, you must have an environment that is like their natural habitat. Your backyard, for example, is poorly suited to attracting ducks. However, if you have a lake or large pond on your property, then you will likely be able to attract ducks to it.


Ducks are notoriously difficult to attract. It’s definitely possible to attract them, but It’s also important to remember that they are migratory birds at heart.

, These decoys will attract migrating ducks to come take a closer look at the surrounding area. Be sure to invest in realistic-looking duck decoys.


There are different types of duck decoys, including mallard duck, black duck, and goose decoys. Geese make excellent decoys, as ducks and geese frequently live together in similar habitats, so ducks are naturally drawn to them., This way, the ducks will be attracted by the decoy and stay for the food. It's important to position the decoys in a realistic manner that mimics how real ducks might gather.Avoid placing lots of decoys in a neat group on your pond. Instead, spread them out, placing two or three on your pond and a couple nearby on land. The key is to make the decoys seems as believable as possible to the ducks you're hoping to attract., Ducks are skittish and will not want to nest if there are other animals in close proximity. They may also become defensive.

, Ducks are attracted to places with long grasses where they will blend in and be protected from predators. Avoid trimming the grasses and brush surrounding your pond.

Build a coop.,
Build the coop with wood planks.,
Keep the coop floor dry.",How to Attract Ducks3," Ducks need a house with good ventilation and plenty of space to move around. When you Build a Wood Duck House, it's important to make it spacious enough for the number of ducks you anticipate housing. Six to eight feet by four to five feet is a good, standard size for a duck house.


Your duck house should have a solid floor (vinyl tile works well). They can lay on the ground, but having this solid flooring prevents predators from burrowing into their coop., Keep 1 to 2 inch gaps between the planks for ventilation, and make sure that the coop is at least 3 feet tall. Because ducks spend a lot of time in water and exhale a lot of moisture when they breathe, proper ventilation is essential to preventing frostbite in the winter and mold/mildew growth in the summer., The ducks can get infections if they are laying in urine or feces, so try to keep the coop floor clean. Covering the floor with some absorbent materials can help keep it dry and make it easier to clean.


Try covering the coop floor with sand, straw, or pine shavings to give the ducks a soft, clean space to lay down. It's important to provide them a space where they can lay down and keep their abdomens dry."

Provide a big enough house for your ducks.,
Heat your duck's environment.,
Use proper lighting.,
Protect the ducks from the ground.,
Find duck feed with proper amounts of protein.,
Provide greens for your ducks.,
Provide high-fat, high-calorie treats before bedtime.,
Make sure your ducks have access to fresh water.,
Make sure to protect ducks from the wind.,
Ventilate your ducks' shelter properly.,
Allow your ducks to bathe on sunny days.",How to Care for Ducks in the Winter Time," Ducks benefit from outdoor housing. In the winter especially, work on having a warm outdoor shelter for your ducks. Your ducks will need a small wooden shed or shelter. Make sure the shelter you install is big enough for all your ducks to live comfortably.As a general rule, opt for two square feet per duck. For example, if you are housing four ducks, your house should be eight square feet.
Make sure your house has walls and a ceiling. In the winter, ducks need more than just a pen for health and safety.;
, In general, ducks are pretty good at regulating their body heat in the cold. However, your ducks will be more comfortable if you opt for heating in the shelter. This is particularly important if you're housing ducklings over the winter.Use heated lamps, kept out of your duck's reach, in order to heat your shelter. Do not use anything that goes on the floor, like a space heater. Such items are a fire hazard.
If you have ducklings over the winter, use a 250 watt lamp for your duck house.

, If you're concerned about egg production, lighting is key. If you're trying to breed your ducks, or are using them for eggs, artificial light is necessary in the winter.Use artificial lighting for half an hour at the beginning and end of each day. Turn your artificial lights on half an hour before the sun rises, and then half an hour after it sets.
If you don't need your ducks to produce eggs, artificial lighting is not as important during the winter.

, The ground will get cold and snowy in the winter. Lay a thick layer of straw or hay down on the floor your duck's pen. This will prevent their feet from becoming cold.You can also lay wooden boards down in the pen to keep the ducks warm.

, You will need to feed your ducks the proper diet throughout the year. In the winter especially, however, ducks need nutrients to thrive despite the cold. You can purchase duck feed at a local pet store or online.Protein is vital to a duck's health. Check the protein percentages on the duck food you choose. The protein content should be between 16 and 18%.

, Ducks generally eat bugs in the ground to supplement their diet. They may also eat grass and other plants. As bugs and grass may be more difficult to find in the winter, give your ducks extra treats like fruits, vegetables, corn, and greens.Good greens for ducks include things like kale, cabbage, and chard.

, The temperature will become very cold overnight. Digestion can help ducks stay warm. High-fat, high-calorie treats will take more effort to digest, warming up a duck during nighttime.Peanuts and corn are good options here. Peanuts are a lot more healthy than corn, so opt for peanuts when possible.

, You should keep a bowl of fresh water out for your ducks at all times. During the winter, keep the water inside the heated shelter so it does not freeze.Check the water each time you check on your ducks. If the water has frozen, or if it has become dirty, replace it right away.

, Ducks tolerate cold very well, but tend to dislike wind. Make sure your ducks have some protection from the wind over the winter. This is important to their health and overall well-being.Hang a tarp up in one corner of your duck's pen. If it gets windy, your ducks can shield themselves behind the tarp.
You can also purchase a small outdoor wind shelter for your ducks.

, When they breathe, ducks tend to emit a lot of moisture. This can cause health conditions, such as frostbite, in the winter. A duck shelter should never be completely closed off from outside air. Keep some air vents in the shelter. You can use mesh material on some parts of the shelter, or install small windows.In order to protect your ducks from the cold and from predators, vents should always be up high. Do not install any air vents on ground level.

, Ducks enjoy swimming, even in the winter. While most ducks can tolerate water at cold temperatures, it's best to err on the side of caution. Wait until a sunnier, warmer day arrives to set out a pool for your ducks. Use a deep, wide pool on warmer days to allow your ducks to swim and bathe."

Move the ducks to a larger space.",How to Take Care of Ducklings," After ducklings have hatched from their shells and spent about 24 hours getting used to their new surroundings, they're ready to move to a brooder.A plastic storage container, sturdy cardboard box, or large glass aquarium can all work for this purpose.


The box should be well-insulated, since the ducklings need to stay warm. Don't choose a box with too many holes in the sides or the bottom.
Line the bottom of the box with wood shavings or old towels. Avoid using newspaper or other slippery material. Ducklings are still wobbly on their legs for the first few weeks after they hatch, and they can slip easily and hurt themselves on surfaces like plastic or newspaper.;
, Baby ducks need to be kept very warm in the first few weeks after they hatch, to give them the chance to get used to the chilly air outside their eggs. Buy a brooding lamp at a feed store or hardware store and affix it to the top of the brooder.


Use a 100-watt bulb to start. For very young ducklings, this should create the right amount of heat.
Make sure part of the brooder is located away from the heat, so they have a place to cool off if they need to.
Make sure the bulb isn't too close to the ducklings. This may cause them to overheat, or if they touch the bulb, they could get burned. If you're using a shallow brooder, prop the lamp up higher using blocks of wood or another sturdy prop

, Periodically check the lamp’s placement, ensuring that the ducklings are getting an appropriate amount of warmth.


The heat and wattage of the lamp should be altered based on your ducklings' behavior as they get older.
If the ducklings tend to huddle close together under the lamp, they may be too cold and you should move the lamp closer or get a higher wattage bulb.
If the ducklings are scattered out and breathing heavily, they're most likely getting overheated, and you need to move the lamp further away or use a lower wattage bulb. Comfortable ducklings should be warm and settled.

, As the ducks grow older, they will need less heat. Raise the lamp or change the bulb to a lower heat when they stop sleeping under it.

, Put a shallow drinking bowl inside the brooder that is deep enough for the ducklings to dip in their beaks, but not their entire heads.Ducklings like to be able to clear their nostrils as they drink, but if you give them access to deeper water they could climb in and drown.Change the water and clean the bowl every day to make sure the ducklings don't get sick from drinking dirty water.
If you fear the bowl you have is a little too deep for your ducklings to drink from safely, lining the bottom with pebbles or marbles will make it safer for them., Ducklings don't eat for the first twenty-four hours after they hatch, since they're still absorbing nutrients from the yolk inside the egg they hatched from. After that, they graduate to starter crumbs, tiny pellets of duck food available at feed supply stores.Buy a plastic feeder, fill it up, and place it in the brooder.


If the ducklings seem hesitant to eat, try adding a little water to their food to make it easier for them to swallow. You can also add a very small amount of sugar to their water for the first couple of days to help them get off to a good start and give them energy.

, Very weak ducklings may need a little extra yolk nutrition before they're ready for starter crumbs. Feed them a bit of mashed duck egg yolk until they become more interested in the starter crumbs.

, Make sure the ducklings have access to food 24/7. They need to be able to eat whenever they're hungry since they grow so quickly at this stage of life. They also need water to help them swallow their food, so keep the water bowl full at all times.


After about ten days, ducklings are ready for grower's pellets, which are the same as the starter crumbs, only bigger.

, When the ducklings become adults, after about 16 weeks, they're ready for adult duck food.

, Many foods humans eat, like bread, don't provide them with the nutrition that ducks need, and some can even make them sick.Even if the ducks are interested in food such as bread, it is not good for them.
Ducks can have very thinly cut fruits and vegetables as a snack, but make sure their main meal is duck food.
Don't give ducklings food made for baby chickens. It doesn't have the right nutrient makeup for ducklings.
Never use medicated feed for ducklings. It can cause organ damage.

, Ducks love to swim, and they'll start as soon as the first day after they hatch if you let them. Do not let them swim unattended. Baby ducks are covered with down, which isn't waterproof, and their bodies are still too fragile to cope with swimming alone at this stage., The paint roller tray makes a great environment for starter swimming.You can supervise them closely, and the slope in the tray creates a little ramp to help the ducklings get in and out safely.


Don't let the ducklings swim too long, or they'll get chilled. When they're done swimming, dry them off gently and place them back in the brooder so they can warm up.
You can also let them sit on a heating pad covered with a clean towel for a few minutes.

, When ducklings are fully feathered with their waterproof, adult feathers, they can swim without your supervision. Depending on the type of duck, full feathers should be in place by 9-12 weeks of age.

, Make sure the ducklings are supervised at all times while they're still growing their adult feathers and learning to swim, particularly if letting young ducks swim in an outdoor pond. Older adult ducks that may share the same pond or water source may try to drown or kill the younger ducks.

, Ducks, particularly when young, can be targets for predatory animals. You can free range your ducks when they are adults, but remember you may lose ducks occasionally to predators. You should make every effort to keep them safe from predators.


If you're raising ducklings in a garage or barn outside, make sure no other animals can get near them. Wolves, foxes, and even large predatory birds could harm your ducklings if you aren't careful.
Ducklings raised inside your home need to be kept safe from dogs and cats, which may try to attack or even play too roughly with the ducklings.
Once the ducklings move from the brooder to a larger pen, make sure there's no way for predators to get in.

, It's tempting to cuddle with the sweet, fuzzy ducklings, but if you get too close to the ducklings, they might imprint on you too strongly. To make sure your ducklings grow up into an independent, healthy adults, enjoy watching them play with each other, but don't join in the fun too much.

, Once the ducks are too big for the brooder, move them to a large dog kennel or a shed with a latching door. Feed them adult duck feed and let them spend their days swimming and splashing in a pond. Make sure to bring them back into their shelter at night to keep them safe from predators.

Wait 2 days.,
Understand how botulism is produced.,
Control the fly population.,
Remove carcasses.,
Remove dead fish.,
Take care of shallow water.",How to Treat Botulism in a Duck," Botulism poisons the duck, causing what's sometimes known as ""Limberneck Disease."" It causes paralysis, starting with the duck having trouble taking off or going under the water. The duck's legs will be paralyzed, and you may see the duck trying to move only with its wings. The duck's eyelids and neck will droop. The paralysis may also be accompanied by diarrhea., Once you realize a duck is sick, move it away from the area where it was infected. You should provide some basic shelter for the duck. Leaving the duck where it is means the duck will continue to be infected with the bacterium. You have to move it away from the source if it's going to recover.However, not all ducks will recover. Only a duck that didn't get a lethal dose of the bacterium will be able to recover., When you first notice the symptoms, it's important to provide fresh water for that duck. The water may help flush out the bacterium.If the duck won't drink, use a syringe to give the duck fresh water., The two main antitoxins are Trivalent (A, B, E) Botulinum Antitoxin and Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) Botulinum Antitoxin. You can get the first from the CDC (your local office), and you will likely need to get the second through a vet, who will get it from the CDC.The second is recommended for more types of botulism.Ducks are most often affected by Type C Botulism, which generally doesn't cause problems for people, dogs, or cats.Sometimes, they are affected by Type E Botulism.Generally, this treatment is not used. It's not very practical, as it must be given early on, when symptoms aren't as obvious., Botulism can sometimes be caused by a wound that lets the bacterium into the blood. If your duck has wounds, you should have a vet look at them, as they may need to be treated surgically., Most ducks who are going to recover from botulism will do so withing 2 days. If your duck makes it that long, it will likely be fine., Often, ducks get botulism from living, drinking, and eating in stagnant water. The water grows the bacterium, and the ducks ingest it.Ducks can also get botulism from eating from eating small, dead invertebrates, as well as maggots that feed on the carcasses.Bad food and dying plant life can also give botulism to ducks., Limiting flies limits the number of maggots in the area, which can carry the bacterium. Flies can spring up for a number of reasons, especially if the ducks are being raised around other livestock.Control manure. Manure is one of the biggest fly attractions. Make sure to remove manure at least 2 times a week. It's also important to dry out manure, as the moisture attracts flies. To dry it out, spread it out thinly in a sunny area, and then scoop it up once it's dried.Clean up spills quickly. Both feed spills and manure spills can attract flies. Clean them up to help keep flies at bay.Avoid having drainage ditches with weeds. These murky areas can attract flies.Introduce fly-eating species. For instance, a small form of wasp, the fly parasitoids, has young that eat the pupa of flies, and they don't bother humans., If several ducks have died of botulism, it's important to remove the animals quickly. Other ducks can catch it from the dead animals, and it can infect the water even more.The best solution is to burn the animals or bury them away from other ducks., Dead fish can cause some of the same problems as dead ducks. If dead fish are in a pond with the ducks, it's best to remove them if possible., Shallow water tends to be stagnant, and in warm weather especially, it can breed botulism. It's best to either drain the water off or flood the area to avoid these shallow breeding grounds."

There are four main types of duck: domestic, dabbling, diving and sea ducks. Domestic ducks are the type most people choose for their needs. All breeds of domestic duck are descended from the common Mallard duck except the Muscovy duck.


Non-domestic ducks, or “Wildfowl”, spend a long time on the water and will need their wings pinioned when they are very young or else they will fly off. They require a large pond or lake and are unlikely to tame.;
, All of these breeds are visually appealing and make good pets.


Call ducks are named for the noises they make so be careful of getting a call duck if you do not want to upset your neighbors. They are small and gray or white, and many people choose them for their smallness of size but they are good fliers and will need their wings clipped every so often.
Cayuga ducks have beautiful iridescent green plumage and are very quiet, but can be hard to find.
Pekin ducks are large and white and one of the most popular breeds of ducks. They are calm and have a relaxed temperament.
Rouen ducks have the same coloring as mallard ducks (green neck and head and iridescent areas on the body) and are very calm and sociable.
Muscovy ducks are very quiet and have been bred in many different colors. They are descendants of tree birds and thus might need their wings clipped periodically to keep them from flying away.

, You will want to choose a breed that matures quickly, produces tasty meat and are heavier. Many people prefer ducks with a white plumage because it is easier to get a clean looking carcass.Pekin ducks are one of the most popular ducks for meat production because they are ready to butcher at 7 weeks, high meat-yielding and have a white plumage. They also lay a decent number of eggs in the year (varies according to location- in the UK they are low layers) so they are a good general purpose duck. They can be crossed with Aylesburys for great meat-producing ducklings.
Muscovy ducks produce tasty dark meat that is leaner because their oil glands are underdeveloped. They are poor egg producers whose eggs take 35 days to hatch as opposed to 28 days but are very good brooders and mothers and so do not require an incubator. They can be crossed with Pekin for a very good meat-producing duck but their progeny will be sterile. They must be butchered by 16 weeks of age or their meat becomes too firm.
Rouen ducks are good meat-producers but take 12-15 weeks until they are ready to be butchered. They also are decent egg layers (~100 eggs per season) but have colored feather shafts and the carcasses will be harder to clean.
Aylesbury ducks are prized for meat production due to their large size and while plumage but true Aylesburys are very rare and most are rather mixes of Aylesbury and Pekin, which also makes a good duck for meat production. White crested ducks are said to be a mix of Aylesbury and Pekin ducks. They are not great egg layers.

, These breeds can sometimes even surpass the production levels of egg-laying chicken breeds and ducks produce a larger, more nutritious egg than chickens.The Khaki Campbell duck is quite hardy, excellent foragers, can produce over 300 eggs a year and do not require special care or lighting to produce many eggs. They produce an pearly white egg and are the main breed used for commercial egg production. Their meat has a typical “game” flavor and is not usually eaten.
Indian Runner ducks are upright birds that have a running gait. Some strains can produce over 300 blue-tinted eggs a year. They are great foragers, small in size and hardy.
The Welsh Harlequin duck is a rarer bird but a good egg-layer as well as good meat bird and has a placid nature.

, All ducks will eat snails, slugs and insect pests in gardens but certain breeds are better foragers and cover a large area. Ducks will also clean algal slime and duckweed from ponds.


Indian Runner ducks are very active and some of the best foragers and have been known to even eat flies from the air. They cover large areas of land and can be used to control pests in fields. They are often used in rice paddies in Asia and have even been used to control pests at an organic wine farm in South Africa.
Khaki Campbell ducks are also good foragers. They can control pests on both land and water and eat large quantities of slugs, snails, insects, algae and mosquitoes.
Call ducks are also decent foragers but are of smaller size than other ducks and so will eat smaller prey.

, Domestic ducks do not need large ponds or lakes but they will need a small pool so that they can duck their heads in. They have no tear ducts and rely on this water to wet and clean their eyes. You can use a small kiddies pool or other plastic tub to hold water.


Plastic tubs are actually better for your ducks because the water can be replaced easily, keeping it clean from mud and feathers.
Move the plastic tub around so that your grass does not turn to mud.

, Ducks that do not obtain the appropriate nutrition will not grow properly. This is especially true for ducks being used for meat or egg production. While some breeds are good at foraging for food, they will still require additional feed. Feed ducks commercially prepared duck pellets.


If you feed chick crumbs they must not be medicated as this can seriously harm your ducks.
Ducks used for production will need a higher protein content (~16% and can come from raw oats but no more than one-fourth of diet) than other ducks.
Egg layers will also need higher calcium content to effectively produce eggs and you can supplement this in their feed.Provide a clean source of drinking water close to the feeding areas. It helps to raise this off the ground to avoid it getting filled with mud.

, Ducks should be locked up at night to protect them from predators. They do not need perches but the doorway should be as wide as possible to accommodate the whole flock going in together. It is important that this area be kept well-ventilated.


The house should have about four square feet (3700 square cm) of floor space per duck and be at least 3.5 feet (1 m) tall.
They can be spooked by lights at night so face openings away from the moon or lights if possible.
Place the enclosure against a wall or fence to help herd ducks indoors at nighttime.
Use a layer of clean straw as bedding and change it out regularly to keep it clean.
If you want to collect the eggs then you should provide nest boxes. These make it easier to find the eggs.

, Some predators will attack ducks so it is important to protect them with a fence. The fence should keep predators out as well as keep ducks in. The heavier meat-producing ducks cannot jump very high but some of the lighter breeds such as call ducks can get up to 6 feet (1.8 m) in the air.


Ducks can be kept in the same enclosure as chickens. Different breeds of duck can also be kept together but be careful when keeping the smaller breeds with a male of a bigger breed because he can injure the ducks., Different breeds have different sizes, conformations, egg production rates, fertility, hatchability, feed consumption and productive lifetimes. Research your breed to find the expected characteristics of your ducks.

, Keep track of your ducks through proper identification. In a small group you may recognize individual ducks but if you cannot, it may be helpful to use wing or leg bands to mark individual birds.

, Trap nests are designed so that ducks can go in but cannot come out until released. This way you can record the identity of the duck and whether or not it laid an egg.

, Keep track of the number of eggs a duck lays, the number of ducklings hatched by a particular duck, the number of ducklings which were then marketed for sale or after butchering and the age of those ducklings when they reached suitable weight for slaughter.


All this information will help to choose the most effective and productive ducks to breed for production.

, Breeders should have sound bones, straight toes and tight, well-fitting scales on the feet. Breeders should not have crooked breast bones or split wings.

, Younger ducks will have bright colors on their legs and bills, a pliable, gristly breastbone and a soft and easily dented windpipe. Older ducks will have dull legs and bills with hardening of the skin, a hard breastbone and strong windpipe.


Breeders should not have been treated for any major diseases. Breeders must be healthy with thick sleek feathers, bright eyes, dry nostrils and plentiful tail furnishings (according to the breed).

, The main factor when selecting breeders should be weight as this is highly heritable. Do not allow ducks to mate who display deformities, abnormal size or other defects.


After weight you should consider the other factors that you have recorded such as number of eggs laid and ducklings hatched.

, This will require a little research for the particular breed of your ducks. Heavy breeds such as the Muscovy and other meat production breeds will usually have a ratio of one drake to five ducks maximum. Lighter breeds such as the Khaki Campbell and Indian Runner can have a maximum ratio of around one drake to ten ducks.


Keeping too many drakes with too few females can cause injury to the females as they can be mated too often.
If you are attempting to cross breed, be careful about the size difference between the drake and ducks because this can also potentially cause injury.
If you have too many drakes you can keep them in a separate pen during the breeding season.
You can mate ducks as a pair if you choose. The problem comes when there are multiple drakes and not enough space and females.

, You should mate young animals to keep the generation interval low and achieve the greatest genetic progress. First-year drakes and ducks are best for breeding but do not mate birds younger than 6 months old., While some domestic ducks will mate year-round, the typical mating season goes from late winter through spring to early summer. This is the most likely time that your ducks will show mating behavior and lay eggs.


Mating behavior will include head bobbing, pecking, neck biting and attempts at mounting by the male.

, Ducks will typically mate with any other duck including those of different breeds. If you want to create particular crosses you must keep breeds separate that you do not want mixed in. If you do not want your ducks mixing and you have multiple breeds then you should separate them during breeding season.


Muscovy ducks that mate with another domestic ducks will produce mule ducks. Mule ducks are sterile but can be good meat producers. Mixes between other domestic ducks will not be sterile.

, This will depend on the number of ducklings you want to produce. For most breeds, one duck can produce around 100 marketable ducklings per season.


You will get better results when you have less birds being mated and housed together. However, commercial breeders will have to have mass mating for economic reasons.

, This will allow the ducks proper time for mating and result in a high fertility in the eggs. It also gives the ducks and drakes time to settle down into mating.

, Collect eggs daily and store them in a cool, not cold, location while turning them once a day to prevent the membrane from sticking to the shell. They can be stored for 7-10 days before incubation. It is better to incubate them all at the same time so that they will all be at the same stage.

, Follow the instructions for your incubator (if you do not have them you might be able to find them online). Set your incubator to 99.5 degrees with a humidity of 86% to start out.


Run the incubator for a day or two before placing the eggs inside. This helps to check that it is keeping an even temperature.
Humidity can usually be maintained by filling the water pans on the incubator and following the instructions. You can also spray the eggs with water every time you turn them.
Muscovy ducks are very good brooders and mothers and will not necessarily need their eggs incubated. This also makes them easier to manage and breed.

, Eggs need to be turned. Some incubators will turn them automatically but if not then turn them an odd number of times per day.


Turning is most critical during the first week of incubation. Turn them as often as you can.

, Use the candling technique to check if your eggs are fertile and remove any non-fertile eggs. Make the room dark and get a small flashlight. Hold it up to the egg and wrap your hand around the meeting place so that no light shines into your eyes. If you see clear, distinct veins then the egg is probably alive.


Repeat candling once per week and remove any eggs that are not alive.

, Different breeds take different times to incubate. Mallards will take about 26.5-27 days, Runners will take 28.5 days, and Muscovies will take longer, around 35 days. All other breeds will take around 28 days.

, The hatching process can take 3-5 days or even a bit longer and the ducklings may stay in the shell for an extra day or two to absorb the yolk so be patient and do not worry.


Call ducks are notoriously bad at cracking through their shells. If you really think your duckling needs a little help then you must be very careful and use tweezers to try to create a small hole in the shell. If you see any bleeding or anything then stop right away.

, This gives them time to dry out fully and allows time for the other eggs to hatch undisturbed if they haven’t hatched yet. They will be stumbling and wobbling around but this is normal for newly hatched ducklings.

, You can use a plastic container with a small enclosure. A shielded 250-watt bulb should be used to provide the light and heat needed by the young birds for the first few weeks of their life. In week three they should no longer need a heat lamp.


If they are huddling together under the lamp then they are likely too cold and you should move the lamp closer.
If they move away from the lamp then that is a sign that the lamp is too hot and you should lift it higher.
When they stop sleeping under the lamp it may be time to remove it completely.

, Do not let ducklings follow anyone for the first three days either. This can cause them to imprint too heavily on you and cause problems later.

, Make sure to provide a drinker that is deep enough for the duckling to submerge its nostrils to clean them but not so deep that the duckling can drown. Food is not required in the first 24 hours but after that you can provide starter crumbs from your local feed shop. After ten days on starter crumbs, switch to growers pellets.


If your duckling is particularly weak or won’t eat, try feeding it a little mashed boiled yolk. This can help it start to eat its starter crumbs.
After 16 weeks you can switch the ducklings to normal pellets as you would feed an adult.
If you wish to allow your ducklings to swim then you must supervise them so they do not drown. Additionally ducklings do not yet produce the oil on their feathers that protects adult ducks from the cold so the water must be warm rather than cold. Mother ducks would normally apply oil to their ducklings feathers in nature.

, Whether you are keeping your ducklings as pets, for meat production, for egg production and/or as biological pest controllers, you can now continue to raise your ducks. You can move them outside when they are around 6-8 weeks old.


They should lose their down feathers before they are moved outside.
Predators can easily carry ducklings off so be wary when moving them outside.

Think about whether chickens are the right pets for you.,
Decide whether you want to spend time caring for chicks.,
Realize that chicks aren't all that bad.",How to Care for Chicks1," Chickens do cost money and take up your time. You'll need to feed them every morning, provide them with fresh water, clean up their coop (which is a big task), make sure they are safe, provide extra space, collect eggs, worry about diseases, check on the chicks, and much more. However, you shouldn't let worries overcome you. Most of the problems you hear about chickens are less likely to happen, you should still be aware though.;
, Chicks are harder to care for than hens and can take up much more time. Also, you might not know the sex of the chick and you probably won't want noisy roosters that will fight each other.


Think about whether you want to purchase chicks or incubate chicks. Incubating your own chicks is a great experience, but isn't the easiest thing to do. You can also get already hatched chicks sexed but you' won't know the sex of the chick if you decide to incubate.

, The information above are all the cons of keeping chicks, now it's time for the pros. If you take care of your own chicks they will turn out to be friendlier and tamer towards you, it's a wonderful experience, and chicks are cute and a lot of fun! And besides, when the chicks grow into hens you will get fresh eggs everyday, fertiliser for your garden, and the chickens get rid of unwanted pests such as snails and slugs.

Ensure that your chickens have the opportunity to dust bathe.",How to Care for Chickens," If you live in an urban environment, it is probable that there are restrictions on chicken ownership, either in terms of the amount of chickens or even whether it's allowable at all. Call your local municipality or check out the relevant website and find out what rules are in place governing chicken ownership.;
, The breed of chicken is important because some chickens are better egg producers, others are better as meat chickens, while some chickens are great for showing and having as companions. Do some background reading on the different types of chicken breeds to get a good idea of the profile of each kind; your local library should have a decent book with both photos and descriptions, or check online sites devoted to chickens.


The Leghorns are the best ""egg machines"". Rhode Islands are good too, along with Plymouth Rocks. Hens usually start laying around 5 to 6 months of age and are good layers for two to three years, after which the laying will drop off dramatically.
If it's your first time with chickens, a dual-purpose breed may be the easiest, so that you can get a supply of eggs, followed by some chicken meat or a beautiful pet.
Aside from breeds, you can also choose chickens for less ""scientific"" reasons, such as because you like how the chicken looks (for example, the cute Bantams often melt the heart), the neighbors have spare chicks going for free or you just happen to want the same chickens you grew up with.You can also rescue hens from factory farms. At around 18 months, hens take a natural break from egg laying. In the factory context, it is cheaper to buy new pullets than to have these hens waiting around. Given the hens will lay for a good 18 months to 2 more years once the laying resumes, you can rescue these hens for next-to-nothing and give them a good home.Check with your local animal welfare agency to see if they rescue these hens for adoption.
Chickens have two sizes. These are known as standard and bantam. Within the standard, there is a lot of size variety, broken down to heavy, medium and light. Bantams consist of small and light chickens and ""true bantams"", the latter term referring to the fact that the bird has no standard equivalent. Standard birds will eat a lot and produce medium to large eggs, while bantam birds will eat less and produce smaller eggs, which may be a more economical choice for you., Chickens need a safe place to roost at night, away from predators, distractions and cold air. Providing housing gives them a place to settle in for each night, and to lay eggs in during the day. They may also like to eat food inside their shelter.


A chicken coop, shed or shelter should be fairly large. If it is a permanent coop, making it a size you can walk into will ensure a lot of space for the chickens, and makes it easier for you to clean and place feed inside. Alternatively, use a mobile coop that can be moved around a yard and set down over new areas of grass on a regular basis; there are many good mobile coop designs available, such as the A-frame chicken ark.
If you have predators in the area, such as foxes or coyotes, the shelter will need to be predator-proof. You will need strong wire or boards to prevent persistent predators from finding their way into the coop. Be sure that there are no gaps in the fence and that you have completely chicken wired. If the predators are very persistent, electric wire fencing is probably the most secure option.
Add a gate or a door for access to and from the chicken house. This should be solid and have a very sound catch or lock, so that predators cannot gain access through it.

, If you don't let the chickens out, the housing will need to be a lot bigger than for roaming chickens, and must include chicken runs. If you do let your chickens roam, expect lots of poop, digging and munching of anything they come across; if you don't mind this, free-range chickens will appreciate your generosity.Keep the run over grass as much as possible. This gives the chickens a chance to forage for bugs and worms and to exercise on a nice texture. Moreover, grass is essential for chickens (see below).
A run that can moved around is the best option, as it renews the grass the chickens forage in and gives the ground underneath it a chance for a regular break from the chickens.

, Put items on the floor that help to keep it clean and prevent soil from being the only thing under the chicken's feet. For example:


Put a layer of newspaper covering the floor of the house and then cover it with wood shavings, sawdust, or any other suitable material. Wood shavings are considered an ideal choice by many chicken owners.Don't add any hay or straw at this point.
Add a few handfuls of straw or pine needles and strew it around on top the the bedding. Hay is not usually absorbent enough to be effective as floor bedding but you might like to experiment.Clean out regularly; clean out the whole lot and replace with completely fresh bedding, at least weekly.

, When choosing or building a coop, the following considerations should guide your choices:Chickens need ventilation but cannot cope with drafts. The ventilation is essential for removing ammonia and carbon dioxide build-up inside the coop, so ventilation holes high up where they cannot cause drafts, are an important part of any coop design. Ventilation also reduces the likelihood of respiratory diseases.Removable perches are important. That way, you can regularly remove them, wash and disinfect them and replace them clean. This assists with lowering the potential for disease.
Place egg laying boxes so that they can be accessed from the outside as well as inside. There will be plenty of times when you wish to access eggs without disturbing the whole hen house.
Nesting boxes should be dark, above the floor and have a ridge or lip to stop the hens from scratching out the nesting bedding. Nesting boxes should always be located well up off the ground, giving the chicken security and a bird's eye view of what else is going on in the coop; remember that she will feel vulnerable and exposed during laying, so the more you can do to reduce this fear, the better.

, Stick to very regular times for rounding up and releasing, allowing for seasonal changes, so that the chickens know when to expect you. This is even more important as darkness falls and predators may be lurking around waiting; even if the chickens have helped themselves to returning to their coop, an open door is an unwanted invitation for a predator to enter.


Round up outdoor chickens every night into the coop. Always count the chickens before closing the doors; keep an eye out for any laggards or escapees. Close the door of the house at night and switch on any electric fences or activate other defenses you've put in place.
Let the chickens out again in the morning. Keep the coop door tied or blocked open, to allow the chickens access to the coop at any time.

, Use a small collecting basket or box and go around collecting the eggs. This is a great task for the kids to do.


If you can, collect the eggs once in the morning and once at night. This will ensure that all eggs are picked up while fresh. However, once a day is also fine if that is all you can manage, provided the eggs are not left sitting in hot weather all day long.

, Try to use the type that lets you fill the tube, while the outside area gradually fills up over time. Put one right outside the house and the other next to the food. Keep it off the ground, away from litter and soil.

, Food feeders that are filled from the lid, allowing the feed to filter down slowly into the tray around it are the best to get. Fill it and place it a little way away from the house on flat ground. If feeding in the house, choose a suitable feeding location. Again, the feeders should be off the ground, away from litter, chicken feet and dirt.


Just fill the containers whenever they empty.

, Good eggs come from good food; what you put into the chicken is what you'll get back out. For eggs high in protein, the diet must be protein-rich and well balanced. For meat, more carbohydrate along with the protein is needed, to promote growth. Commercial layer's rations can be purchased from feed stores, and they are the result of many years of careful research, so are good for the hens. It is also a good idea to supplement any commercial food with a range of natural foods, for variety.


Provide laying hens with about 100g/3.5 oz of dry food per bird per day.However, this is a rough average, as a larger hen may need around 125g/4.5 oz of feed per day, while a small and light hen might only need 25g/1 oz per day.For egg-laying, the hens need calcium; without it, the shells will be brittle. Add some grit to the feed for this purpose.Grit is especially important if the chicken is unable to access it in any other way.If growing food for chickens, wheat and barely have higher levels of protein than corn but corn is easier to grow.You can also purchase grains instead of growing them yourself. Always combine grains with a high-protein mash, so that you can be reassured that the chickens are getting sufficient protein.

, Grass forms an essential part of a chicken's diet and its nutrient content changes with the seasons.Hence, either allow chickens to roam and find the grass, or shift runs or coops to cover fresh grass on a regular basis.

, Chickens are prone to many diseases, of which a lot can be attributed to poor hygiene. Hence, it is important to clean out the house with regularity, including disinfecting perches, cleaning out nesting boxes and cleaning and disinfecting eating and watering containers.


This is a great task for pocket money earning; show the kids how to clean properly, impressing upon them the importance of good cleaning for the sake of the hen's health. Keep a watchful eye on the cleaning processes until you're sure the kids know how to do it properly.
Always wear gloves. It is a good idea to wear a respiratory mask when raking or shifting chicken droppings and feathers, to prevent fine bacterial or other particles from being breathed in.

, These include lice, mites, ticks, fleas and worms. There are herbal, natural, veterinary and commercial treatments available for different infestations, but it's always best to talk to your veterinarian or pet health specialist first. If reading up on treatments, be wary of information for treatments that is older than a decade or so, as it may well be suggesting toxic solutions; as for antique books on chicken raising, treat them as lovely collectibles but not as useful for resolving what ails your chickens.

, This time will increase as the hen ages.Chickens also stop laying as much or at all when the daylight hours go below 14 hours and the days are colder and if their nutrition levels fall.Artificial lighting can stimulate more laying.


Molting occurs usually in summer or autumn (fall). Laying ceases until the feathers have grown back. As well as seasonal molting, it can be triggered by heat, stress or dirty drinking water.Expect laying to drop temporarily if the coop is moved or if the hens have been scared by predators.

, Sometimes hens will go into a mode of brooding but not laying; some breeds are more prone to this than others, such as the Rhode Island Reds. This natural behavior will cause the bird to stake out a nesting box and fail to move from it, sitting on her batch of eggs constantly. Unfortunately, the behavior can result in aggressiveness from the bird, which can cascade into crowding when other birds try to share the nesting area, pecking at other birds and breakage of eggs, or attempts to eat eggs.When a hen behaves like this, shift her out of the nest box and into her own separate place in a different part of the coop.Leave her be there for a few days and it will pass, after which time she should be okay to return to the rest of the flock. She should be back to laying a few weeks later.


Other alternatives include picking her up several times a day and putting her down somewhere else, breaking up her nest and removing the eggs so that she can't return to her cozy spot and either adding frozen water bottles to the nest or dunking her backside in cold water, to cool her down (broody hens run a higher temperature)., Hens peck one another to ensure that the social order is defined. The more a hen is pecked, the lower her social order. Hence, when you want to add new hens to the pen, try doing so by allowing them to see one another behind fenced off areas, to allow for familiarization without being able to get at one another.Another alternative is to slip in new chickens after dark; they will all wake up with one another, none the wiser., This is the easiest and best form of enrichment for chickens, as they will pass many a pleasant day simply wandering about finding bugs and feed around the garden or yard.

, This will give the chickens both something to peck and eat. Hang it at a height that is just above the hen's head; the hens will jump and peck at it, providing a source of activity as well as the food. One note of caution: Once you introduce this activity in a coop where chickens do not roam outside, it must be kept up regularly as it will become a source of expected stimulation. If it is removed after the chickens are habituated to it, they may take out the pecking on other chickens or their own feathers., As with most birds, chickens are highly social and get bored and lonely without company of their own kind.

, This is a natural behavior for chickens and it helps them to get rid of parasites from their body.It's also a lovely chance for chickens to sunbathe comfortably.


Dust baths should be sheltered from rain or other water sources.
Insect repellents can be added to dust baths to help ward off mites, etc. This can include derris dust or rotenone powder; powdered quassia chips; charcoal or coal cinders; dried leaves from bamboo, white cedar or neem trees; diatomaceous earth, dolomite or lime; dried or powdered wormwood, pennyroyal, tansy or pyrethrum."

Gather the right supplies to care for your chicks.,
Decide where the chicks will stay.,
Set up the brooder.",How to Care for Chicks2," Your chicks will need something to eat, some shelter, a source of heat, and some bedding. See a list of equipment below:


Heat lamp. Chicks need something to keep them warm for the first few weeks of their lives. A heat lamp is a common choice to go for but you can also use a 100 watt light bulb to keep them warm.
Bedding. The bedding is needed so you can easily clean up the chicks mess. For good bedding look for a material that is absorbent since baby chicks leave a lot of mess. Paper towels and wood shavings are good choices of bedding to use but try not to use newspaper since they are less absorbent, slippery and cause leg problems in chicks.
Feeder and drinker. Make sure the chicks have easy access to them and that they are away from the heat source. If you don't have a drinker you can use some other container instead. Make sure it isn't too big or deep and add pebbles to the container if you think its too deep for the chicks.
Chick starter. Unlike normal chicken feed chick starter contains more protein since the chicks need it. Chick starter can be bought from a local feed store and you can buy it in mash or crumbles and medicated or non-medicated. Medicated feed prevents Coccidiosis in chicks.
Thermometer. This is optional, the thermometer is to tell the temperature of the brooder. Although a thermometer is accurate, you can tell the temperature of the brooder by the way the chicks act. If they are huddled under the heat source, they are too cold; whilst if they are trying to get away from the heat source, they are too hot.

, Chicks need a sheltered, draft-free place to stay, such as a garage, shed, basement, etc. Since chicks grow quickly, you will need to have a lot of space to raise them before they are old enough to be transferred to a coop, chicken run, or yard.


The chicks should be kept in a calm, quiet, warm, well-ventilated, and predator-proof room. You should also have easy access to the room and brooder so that you can check and care for the chicks daily. You will probably need to check on them at least twice a day at the early stage of their lives.

, A brooder is a box-like container to raise your chicks in. You can use a simple cardboard box as a brooder or an aquarium, pet carrier, or something similar. The brooder has to be warm, but well ventilated to keep the chicks happy and healthy.


Add the bedding. Spread your choice of bedding around the brooder. You must clean the bedding daily so make sure the brooder is in an easily accessible place for you.
Set up the heat lamp. The heat lamp should be at 95 degrees for the first week of the chicks' lives. Drop the temperature 5 degrees every week until the chicks are around 6 weeks old or have their feathers.
Put the feeder and drinker inside the brooder. Make sure they are both away from the heat lamp and the chicks can easily get to them. Fill the feeder up with a chick starter and the drinker up with fresh and clean water.

"
"
Feed the chicks.,
Provide fresh, clean water at all times.,
Increase the available food and water as the chicks grow.,
Prepare a coop and/or run for your chicks.",How to Care for Chicks3," The chicks should be fed a chick starter feed since they need a lot of protein. Feed them on a chick starter diet every day but don't feed day hour old chicks.


You have a choice of feeding them chick crumbles or chick mash. The difference is the size of the pellets. You can also feed them medicated chick starter to prevent Coccidiosis.

, The water shouldn't contain any chemicals and should be available in a drinker at all times. Refill it daily so that you know it is fresh and clean. Make sure the chicks have easy access to the drinker and that it is away from the heat source.


A bowl of water should have clean pebbles in it if it is too deep so the chicks can't fall in and drown. The pebbles also encourage the chicks to drink.

, At 8 to 10 weeks, the chicks should be fed a grower feed and can now be given all sorts of treats including table scraps. However, they should not be fed avocado, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, or salted treats.


The chicks should also have more space since they are a lot bigger than they were before. At least 4 square foot of floor space is necessary.

, You can prepare a coop before you get the chicks, when the chicks are still young or before the chicks have to be transferred to a coop. Whichever one, you must be prepared as chicks grow very fast and will soon need a lot more space (4 square foot each).

Before adopting any pet, you must be sure you actually want them, and if you can take the responsibility to care for him/her.,
Now buy the equipment.,
Now you can finally adopt your chickens.,
Bring your new chickens home (or have the rescue centre bring them to you).,
If you bought multiple chickens, at first they will fight to establish their pecking order.,
Feed your chickens treats.,
Clean out your chicken coops regularly.,
It takes 25 hours for a hen to lay an egg, therefore, a chicken lays an egg everyday except on one day per month (usually, depending on when they start laying) when the hour laps over.,
There are many different illnesses a chicken can pick up so keep an eye on your chickens and if one is behaving strangely, separate it from the others so if it is contagious it won't pass on.,
Bond with your chickens.",How to Care for a Pet Chicken," Once you're absolutely positive, choose whether you want them for eggs, or as a family pet/member. Chickens used for their bodies like battery chickens (food industry or breeding) are good for family pets/members (and they are completely loving and grateful and know what it's like to have a horrible life. Hybrids are usually better at laying than thoroughbreds so bear that in mind. Well done, you've done the hard part.;
, You will need: A coop with a run (chicken breeders may supply these, if not ask at a farm or DIY store), two hoppers, (specially made chicken feeders, ask for them in any good pet shop) that is one water hopper and a food hopper, and chicken feed (ask for it at any good pet shop).

, Find a reliable rescue centre and collect them (you should contact them first).

, Put them down in the run and shut the gate. Make sure the hoppers are already filled and everything is ready. They will probably run straight inside the coop. Regularly check on your chickens, and top up their food and water, but don't let them out of the run for a week. This lets them know that their coop is ""home"" and after a week you can let them out free range, and when it becomes dark they will return to their coop.

, This should only last for 1-2 weeks and you should NOT stop them unless it is getting serious (e.g a chicken pecking violently at another chickens neck/head). Though you should not stop them, you can draw their attention away by hanging up some broccoli in the run.

, You can feed them vegetables from the table, and you can purchase mixed corn or whole wheat which they also enjoy.

, They should be cleaned out once to twice a week.

, If you are getting small eggs (known as wind eggs, with no yolk), try feeding your chickens more calcium. If you are getting eggs with a very fragile shells, again, feed them more calcium. You can purchase vegan poultry tonic and put it in their water (always read the label). Note: When you take your chickens home they won't lay for up to two weeks until they settle in (unless they already were in the process which may cause them to lay on the first day but not on the next few) and they won't lay as much in winter as there isn't as much light. Also, if your hen is waddling around a bit like a penguin, it may have an egg stuck in the system. To cure this, bring her inside and place her in a comfortable cardboard box (with no lid on) with some hay inside, a heat mat and/or a heat lamp, if you don't have any of these, just keep her by a radiator and rub some Vaseline around the vent (bottom).

, Then phone a vet to come and look at your chicken. If it is simply itching, part your chickens feathers and look there. If there are any mites/lice buy some chicken lice powder and follow the instructions on the pack. Treat the rest of your chickens too even if they haven't got lice. Also, if the comb (the usually red skin on top of the head, the one on the chin is called the wattle) is pale after two weeks of bringing chickens home, call a vet. In summer, however, chickens stop laying and moult; it may last for six weeks and the comb may pale though, it should return to normal and laying should resume afterwards.

, Cuddle them! They love hugs and kisses! Pick them up gently, supporting his/her body and holding the wings in (they may flap and it hurts) lift them up and give them a stroke.

A coop is a vital structure for your chicken's health, so purchase a coop built by professionals. A coop can be built over dirt or grass in your backyard.Chickens need three to four feet of space each. If you're short on space, you should only keep one to two chickens.;
, Chickens need adequate space to run outside of the coop. Make sure you provide a fenced in area for your chickens to get plenty of sunshine and exercise. If you only have a small backyard, stick to only one to two chickens. You need at least four square feet per chicken in your run.Make sure the fence you put up is free of any cracks or gaps where a chicken could slip through. There are a lot of hazards in the city, such as cars, your chicken needs protection from.

, A roost is an area two feet off the ground. You should use a wide bar or a plank of wood as your roost. A roost is important to chickens, as it allows them to sit slightly off the ground. This can help protect them when the ground gets wet., Chickens need a nest to lay their eggs. You should have several boxes around the coop about the size of a shoebox. The chicken should be able to fit inside the box comfortably.You should avoid pairing hens and roosters together in the city. Due to limited space, you do not want your hens laying fertilized eggs. It's best only to use eggs for food.

, You need to area for chickens to eat and drink in their coop. You can purchase a chicken feeder online or at a local hardware store. The feeder can stand on its own or be hung in the coop. You should have another similar container to hold water., You can buy chicken feed online or at a local store that sells livestock supplies. Chickens usually eat about half a cup of feed per day. Each day, measure out enough feed for all your chickens and place it in the feeder. For example, if you have three chickens, give them 1.5 cups of chicken feed., Grit helps with digestion and provides extra calcium. You can buy grit online or at a local livestock supply store. Keep a small dish of girt in the coop at all times. Chickens will can self regulate how to eat grit, and will do so when they need to digest food or lay eggs., You should also supplement a chicken's diet with table scraps. These provide adequate vitamins and minerals that are necessary for your chicken's health. Leftover fruits, vegetables, and grains are great for a chicken's health.While most table scraps are safe for a chicken, there are certain foods you should not feed your chicken. Do not feed your chicken: raw potatoes, rotting food, peanuts, dried beans, chocolate, junk food (chips, candy, etc.), eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, avocados, or raw meat., You should make sure the water container is full and free of debris each time you check on your chickens. Add more water as needed or replace water that's been contaminated. Chickens usually drink between 1.5 and 2.5 cups of water per day., You should check nests every night for eggs. If your hens are cackling loudly overnight, this is a sign they are laying eggs. Remove eggs in the morning. If any eggs have broken, you should remove any shells and yolk.Prior to eating your eggs, wash them. You can wipe eggs with a dry cloth, but if you notice any manure use a wet cloth to wipe down eggs. Use warm water to wipe down eggs, as cold water can make eggs shrink.
You should let eggs air dry before storing them in cartons for use later.

, It's a good idea to talk things over with your neighbors before getting chickens. This is especially important if you live in area where houses are close together. Your neighbors may have some concerns, which you can talk over with them. You also do not want your neighbors to be alarmed by unusual noises coming from your home.Say something to your neighbors like, ""Just a head's up, but I'm planning on getting chickens. I just wanted to let you know so you can come to me with any questions or concerns.""

, You can check regulations at a courthouse or on your city's government website. There may be different rules and regulations regarding keeping livestock. You may only be allowed a set number of chickens, or you may have to keep your chickens a certain distance from your home or your neighbor's home. Unfortunately, some cities may not allow you to house livestock at all, so you may not be able to keep chickens in your city., Since roosters can be noisy, they may be included in your city's noise regulations. Chickens also generate a smell, so work on keeping these issues under control.Do not keep more than five chickens in the city at once. More than five chickens is likely to generate a lot of noise and smell.
Make sure to clean out things like droppings once a day. This will minimize odor.
You may want to put up a fence around your yard to block some noise from your chickens.

, Rodents can be a major problem in the city and may attack chickens. If your city has a rat or other rodent problem, you need to keep your chickens safe. Sweep the coop daily and keep leftover food off the ground.A solid fence outside the coop can also keep your chickens safe from predators.

, In a city, chickens may develop illnesses due to things like smog and car exhaust. Some possible symptoms to look for indicating injury/illness/disease include things like coughing, wheezing, labored and breathing. Serious illnesses may be marked by things like warts/scabs, swollen joints, loss of feathers, a lack of appetite, and blood in the stool.If any of your chickens are showing signs of disease, consult a livestock vet.

You can use a variety of different types of housing, ranging from one you purchase to one you have around the house. If you have more than one chick, make sure the habitat can comfortably accommodate all of them. Consider some of the following options for your chick’s home:


A simple cardboard box
An aquarium
A cat carrier
A guinea pig cage;
, Because it is so young and small, your chick is especially vulnerable to falling from its habitat or becoming prey for other animals. Keep the habitat in a space where your chick can’t fall or escape and where pets can’t gain access to her.Consider putting a ventilated lid on the habitat for times when you are not home or unable to watch your chick. This can keep other animals out while protecting your chick from falling out of the cage.
Avoid putting the habitat in any spaces that are very high off the ground. This can protect your chicks from falling too far, which can be fatal

, Chicks and chickens are very sensitive to temperature.It’s important to line your chick’s habitat with materials to help keep it warm, which can prevent disease or death.


Line the housing with old towels or blankets for the chick’s first few weeks of life. Make sure the lining has no loose strings, which your chick can swallow or might strangle her.
Switch to a lining of straw and newspaper after a few weeks. Make sure to cover the bottom of the habitat with enough straw because the slippery surface of the newspaper can cause your chick’s legs to grow malformed., Chicks generally need to be kept warm but should also have a habitat that has a range of temperatures. Use a lamp to heat one side of the habitat while keeping the other side cooler. This allows your chick to freely decide at which temperature she feels more comfortable throughout the day.Construct a heat source using a 100watt light bulb in a reflective clamp style lamp or an infrared reptile heat bulb. Install either option on one side of the habitat. You can get both lamps at most pet and home stores.
Make sure the temperature is a constant 90-100 degrees for the first few weeks of the chick’s life. Your chick is the best thermometer for her habitat: if she is hiding on the opposite corner of the habitat from the lamp, then it is too hot. If she is smothering herself in the blankets or along with other chicks, then you need to increase the heat.
Consider keeping your chick’s habitat away from radiators or non-lamp heating devices to help maintain a warm and consistent temperature. You may also want to keep it away from drafty areas.

, Once you get your chick, it’s time to introduce her to her new home. You can do this by gently holding her and releasing her into the habitat. Talk to her and assure her with by patting her that she can enter and be comfortable.


Consider staying with your chick for an hour or so to help her get used to her habitat.

, While it’s tempting to pick up a cute colored chick at Easter or have one in a classroom, remember that baby chicks are animals and not toys. Many people think it’s acceptable to release a chick into their backyards or an animal shelter when it grows beyond the cute, fuzzy stage. Before you get your chick, make sure you are fully committed to caring for it over the course of its life., A clean habitat is key to your chick’s health. Help keep it clean with daily spot cleaning and a thorough cleaning once a week.


Remove any soiled lining and replace it as necessary. Replace all of the lining at least once a week.
Wash your chick’s water and food dish at least once a week with a mild soap and hot water. Make sure to thoroughly dry the dishes to prevent the development of bacteria that can harm your chick.Wipe down any soiled walls or bases. If you are using a cardboard box, consider giving your chick a new one if it is soiled or smells bad.

, Your chick will eat special food for the first few months of her life. Make sure she has plenty of food and allow her to graze throughout the day on it.Provide your chick food specially formulated for chicks for the first two months of her life. You may get either a medicated or non-medicated food depending on your chick’s needs or your personal preference. You can get chick food at either your vet’s office or a pet store.
Switch to grower feed, which is about 17% protein, when your chick turns two months old. After another two months, you’ll switch the feed again to a slightly lower protein choice or a layer feed.
Make sure your chick has a constant supply of food and water because she will grow quickly. Refill food as necessary and make sure you clean her food dish at least once a week.
Throw away any feed that is old, moldy, or stale., Just as your chick needs a constant supply of food, she also needs a steady amount of fresh water. Place a small dish of fresh water in your chick’s cage every day and refresh it as necessary.Check the dish a couple of times a day to make sure your chick has enough water and that it’s clean.

, Most birds “bathe” themselves and clean their feathers by flapping around in dirt or sand. Put a small dish of either material in the habitat for your chick to keep herself clean.


Be aware that not all chicks will take baths. Your chick may wait until she is older and this is entirely normal., It’s also important to the health of your chick that she receives plenty of attention from you. Chicks are friendly and curious and can form a bond with you. In addition, it can be fun to watch your chick’s interactions with you and other chicks.


Give your chick a name and make sure to talk to her using this name during your play. Hold and stroke her for at least a few minutes multiple times a day.
Consider allowing her time to roam outside of her habitat during the day. However, make sure you watch her during this time so she doesn’t injure herself or doesn’t fall prey to another animal., If you have to leave or go on vacation, it’s vital to your chick’s health to have someone check in on her every day while you are gone. Ask a trusted friend or family member to either stay at your home to care for your chick or check in on her and refill food and water every day., Maintaining the habitat and feeding your chick properly will go far in keeping her healthy. However, it’s good to check your chick and her waste every day to ensure that she is healthy and not showing potential signs of illness.


Check or listen for signs of wheezing or limping, which can signal a problem with your chick’s lungs or leg development.
Examine your chick’s poop, too. Diarrhea can cause matted feathers or clogged cloaca, which are the openings to the digestive and urinary tracts.Avoid introducing chicks from different flocks to your chick, as these can also introduce disease.
Schedule an appointment with your vet if you see any signs of illness or are concerned about your chick.

, One of the first signs of your chick developing into an adult chicken is her sprouting feathers. In most cases, you will see feathers developing a few days after your chick has hatched.Continue to monitor your chick over the next few weeks to make sure she’s properly growing feathers. The rate of feather development should increase over the following weeks and your fluffy chick will appear more like a grown chicken.
Be aware that it’s common for your chick to go through a phase of looking awkward while she is transitioning. Don’t be surprised if she has long, gangly legs and scraggly feathers. This phase is comparatively short.

, You may notice that once your chick starts sprouting feathers that her appetite also increases. Make sure to give your chick the proper food to her age and always provide a source of water.Feed your chick her starter rations until she is about 18 weeks old. At about 18-20 weeks, switch her food to a layer feed, which has extra calcium to help her grow. Consider getting a well-balanced layer feed at your local pet store or vet’s office. These feeds have the right protein, vitamins, and nutrients to help your chick grow into a chicken.
Avoid feeding your chick scratch if you can afford it. Although your chick might love the taste, it doesn’t necessarily have all of the nutrients need for proper growth. Consider giving her scratch as a treat.
Make sure your chick has a consistent source of clean food and water. Spread it in her habitat and keep a dish of water readily available. As your chick grows, you may want to check the habitat a few times a day to ensure that your chick has enough food and water

, Your chick will eventually outgrow her cozy habitat that you created. Even if you plan on allowing your chick to range freely on your property, she will still need a coop to protect her from predators and bad weather.You can either purchase a commercially constructed coop or build one yourself. Your chick will need 2-3 square feet of space to live comfortably. You can buy coops at many pet stores or consider getting one secondhand. If you decide to build the coop yourself, you will need to incorporate some of the following elements: four walls, a roosting bar, a nest box, windows for ventilation, and a door with a secure latch.
Take safety precautions when setting up the coop. Raise it 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) off of the ground to prevent rodent infestation and cover or replace any ventilation holes with cloth wire instead of chicken wire to prevent injury. Make sure to check the latch because raccoons are very good at opening latches.
Move your growing chick when it is at least 55 degrees at night inside the coop. Remember that your chick will still be sensitive to temperatures as she grows and may need to stay inside longer to promote healthy development.
Be aware that although there is usually no problem introducing your chick into a coop with other chickens, she may be hesitant at first. Introduce her gradually and gently to the flock through playtime outdoors or putting her in the coop for a few minutes a day until she is ready to move more permanently.

, Your growing chick will continue to need a clean habitat to promote her health and well-being. Sweep out the coop at least once a week and check the food and water dishes daily to ensure there isn’t any moldy or old food or algae growing on the water.

Quarantine your new chickens away from the old flock for several weeks, and watch them carefully for any signs of sickness.,
Make sure the new chickens are of the same size as the old flock.

,
Ensure adequate room in the coop or pen to reduce the chance of bad habits that come from over crowding.,
Implement a ""see"" but ""no touch"" policy by placing the new chickens in a pen inside of the coop of the established flock.,
Hang a distraction in the pen such as something shiny or nail a few ears of field corn in accessible places to keep the old chickens busy while the new chickens explore.

,
Put new chickens in with a flock during the night so that the flocks can wake up together.,
Ensure there are plenty of food and watering areas so that the old chickens cannot guard them all and keep the new chickens from feed and drink.,
Remove injured chickens from the flock at the first sign of bright blood and treat with an ""anti-peck ointment"" or pine tar to discourage the pecking from going further.",How to Add New Chickens to a Flock," The new chickens should not share the same ground or air as the old flock. Wash your hands and clean the bottom of your boots after you interact with the new flock to avoid inadvertently transmitting illnesses.;
,, Cannibalism is one of the worst results of over crowding. New chickens also do not have room to run and hide if need be from the older chickens as pecking order is established.

, This will allow the older chickens to satisfy some of their curiosity without instant squabbling.

,, This seems to reduce the squabbling and the pecking of the new chickens.

, Feed and water the new chickens before adding them to the flock.

, Chickens will naturally peck at fresh blood and can kill an injured chicken very quickly.

Breed or purchase hens that are good egg layers.

,
Collect the eggs soon after they have been laid.

,
Clean the eggs by sending them through automatic washers.

Check if it's a good day for cleaning your chickens.,
Prepare the washing containers (tubs).,
Pick the chicken you're going to wash.,
Put the chicken in the first tub, slowly.,
Transfer each chicken to the second tub and gently plunge up and down again to get all of the soap off.

,
In the third tub, just make sure the vinegar water gets all over the chicken's body.,
Dry your chicken!,
Trim their beaks and nails if needed.,
Dust with flea or lice powder to control any mites.This step isn't necessary unless you have a mite problem.

,
If preparing for a show, consider rubbing Vaseline on the comb and wattles of each chicken, to bring out the red color.

,
Take the opportunity to clean out the coop.",How to Bathe a Chicken," Obviously, check the weather to ensure that it's sunny and warm; you wouldn't want to wash and get a poor chicken all wet in the cold weather!;
, Prepare three tubs; plastic trash cans work well, or feed buckets, or other similar items. When selecting a bathing container, ensure that the container is just wider than the chicken, but deep enough to be half full and still submerge each chicken entirely, except for the head. This keeps the bathwater from displacing and spilling over. A narrow container also restrains their flapping, which is important to reduce panic and mess.


In the first tub, pour Ivory Liquid or Liquid Castile Soap. Then pour in the water (so it gets nice and foamy.) Use warm or lukewarm water unless it is a very hot day. Adding 1/2 cup of 20 Mule Team Borax to the bath makes it more effective, especially if your chicken is light or white.
In the second tub, just pour plain old water. This is the tub where you rinse the bird.
In the third tub, pour in a mixture of vinegar and water. (2 cups of vinegar to a gallon/3.7 liters of water). You might also add a tablespoon of glycerin for an extra 'poultry show shine', but make sure the chicken doesn't drink any, or it will be very embarrassing at the vet.


, This is the one that needs to be clean, or is the dirtiest.

, If they've never had a bath before, this tub is where they'll freak out. By tub two, they will hopefully be too tired to struggle.


Gently agitate them up and down in a smooth plunging motion. Do not scrub or rub or you will break their feathers.
After they're soaked through, pull them out and hold them with both hands over the tub to 'drain'. They will have soaked up a surprising amount of water! If you have an assistant, this is a good time to have them use a washcloth to clean their feet while they are 'draining'.
If the vent feathers are matted with poo, you may need to soak for a few minutes to dissolve it with light agitation of the water. Any scrubbing of matted feathers must be done with utmost care, and only in the direction of the feather tips. Be patient, as poo usually dissolves in warm soapy water.
Don't leave the chicken unattended, at any stage! Poultry can drown easily, even in a small container, if they panic or misplace their footing. Always keep the head above the water.

,, This will make their feathers shinier.

, Drain them by holding them over the rinse tub until they mostly stop dripping.


If it is a warm day, you can towel-dry them carefully by putting a dry bath towel over them and pressing without rubbing - simply pat very gently. Do the same under each wing.
If it is cold, you'll want to bring them inside and blow dry them completely on the lowest setting so the blow-back does not break and frizz the feathers. (Probably best not to tell your wife what you did with the blow dryer.)
Warning: This can smell a little funky. You'll also want to keep your hand between the blower and the chicken at all times. If it's too hot for you, it's too hot for the chicken.

, Do their beaks or nails need to be trimmed? If so, then start trimming! You'll only want to file back obvious over-growth so it returns to a natural shape. On the nails, cut tiny bits at a time and watch the blood line! (That's the little red line you may or may not be able to see in the nail.) If your chicken has dark nails, you'll want to cut teeny little bits at a time. If the nail starts bleeding, dip it into a powdery substance, like flour or baking powder.



Roosters may need their spur nails trimmed and filed blunt to limit damage if they get into a fight with other roosters.

,,, Don't return show-ready chickens to a dirty coop! Either clean it out or place them in clean cages in readiness for showing.

Find out the cause of the plucked feathers.",How to Treat Feather Plucking in Quail1," Again, there are many causes. You must find out what could be a possible cause and what couldn’t be a possible cause. A list of causes can be seen below:


Mating causes bald heads in female quail. If this is a possible cause, the female quail should be the only ones with bald heads and the males should be the cause.
Quail attacking each over causes plucked feathers. When quail attack they will pull out each over’s feathers. Usually only males attack each over but it is possible that you could have a female bully in the flock. The bully should be the one with full feathers and the victims should be the ones with plucked feathers.
Mites causes feather plucking. Mites are small black bugs that live in quails feathers. If this is the cause the quail will be pecking at their own feathers.
Malnutrition causes feather plucking. This means that if the quail are getting a bad diet they will pluck their own feathers.
Stress causes feather plucking. Many things cause stress in quail including lack of space, disturbances, prey, etc.
The quail could be hitting their heads on the top of the cage. When frightened, quail fly straight up to the roof which causes damage to their heads. It can also cause baldness on their heads.;

Provide suitable housing before you bring your silkies home.,
Decide whether your silkies will stay inside the coop permanently or be let outside during the day.,
Add bedding to the coop.,
Add a few other items to the coop.,
Make sure the coop is predator proof.,
Provide some feed in your silkies feeder.,
Feed your silkies a limited amount of treats.,
Provide water for your silkies at all time.,
Collect your silkies eggs.,
Keep your silkies away from aggressive hens.",How to Care For Silkie Chickens," Because silkies are quite small and are considered bantams, they don't need a large amount of space like a standard chicken but it's always great to give them plenty of room to roam!


Silkies can be housed in a garage, shed or in a simple chicken coop. Just make sure the housing is spacious enough so that you can clean it, collect the eggs, catch the chickens when necessary and so that the chickens have room to roost, lay, nest and wander around.;
, If you are going to raise your silkies inside the coop then it does have to be bigger than usual due to the fact that the silkies will be living there for the rest of their lives. You could also purchase a coop with a run if you wanted to.


The benefits of letting your silkies outside during the day are that they will be happier and healthier, they'll eat your bugs and provide fertilizer for your plants, most of their diet is made up from the stuff inside the ground and grass and you won't need to spend lots of money on a larger coop or chicken run.
The disadvantages of letting your silkies outside during the day are that there is a possible chance of them getting attacked by predators, they could escape and get lost, you would have to keep an eye on them constantly and they can get very dirty, especially during winter and autumn.

, There are many bedding available for silkies but the most recommended and common choice is to add wood shavings as the bedding. Wood shavings If you'd prefer something else, try sawdust, newspaper shredding, straw, hay, sand or pine needles.


Be aware that some beddings are better than others, e.g. wood shavings are very absorbent whilst hay isn't and sand is easy to clean but isn't a common choice as chicken owners have had many problems with using sand as their bedding.

, This includes a water container, a feeder, some perches and some nesting boxes (one per each chicken). If you have silkie chicks you should purchase a water feeder rather than filling a container up with water as there is a possible chance the chicks will fall in and drown.

, Silkies cannot defend themselves and all the fluff around their heads can cause them to not see well which is why you have to make sure the coop is predator proof or at least invest in a predator proof coop.


Silkies also need ample shelter to protect them from the harsh weather such as rain, hail, snow, wind and they also need a shady and cool spot to protect them from the sun during summer. If it gets really cold during winter consider adding a heat lamp in their coop so that they can stay warm.

, The amount of feed depends on the size of the flock and the type of feed depends on what you are keeping your silkies for such as eggs, meat or breeding. Here are some different types of feed:


Layer pellets. When your silkies begin laying they can be fed layer pellets to help them lay hard eggs. You can also supply them with crushed oyster shells or crushed egg shells if their eggs turn soft.
Finisher diet. This is for meat chickens and should be fed for six weeks until slaughter. Chicks should be fed a broiler starter instead of a chick starter if you want to keep them for meat.
Silkies kept as simple pets can be fed layer pellets or a normal chicken feed which gives them a balanced diet. You could also consider giving them grit which helps them digest their food. However, grit is not needed if your chickens are free-range (live on grass).

, Silkies love table scraps, fruits, vegetables, bugs and seeds. Silkies can be fed just about anything like pasta, rice, watermelon, cooked potato, broccoli, fish, cucumber, cooked egg, bread and they go crazy for meal worms!

, The water containers must be filled with fresh water daily and they should be cleaned at least once a week. It's also good to have more than one water container if you have a large flock.

, Eggs should be collected every day with a soft basket or something alike. Be careful when collecting the eggs as they are fragile and one drop means a small mess!

, A hard peck to the head can cause a severe injury. Silkies heads are vulnerable as they have a soft tissue which is why you should keep an eye on them if you think they are housed with any aggressive hens or roosters.

Prepare a safe environment for your quail chicks.,
Tame your quail chicks at an early age or as soon as possible.,
Do not make any threatening movements.,
Get comfortable.,
Visit your quail chicks regularly.,
Socialise with your quail.,
Get them use to your hand.,
Pull out any food from the brooder.,
Offer your baby quail food from your hands and fingers.,
Set up a regular routine.,
Don't pick up the baby quail.",How to Tame a Baby Quail," An adequate brooder with a heat lamp, hiding hut and dry bedding will make do for a secure environment for your quail chicks. If the environment isn't safe or comfortable for your chicks they will not feel secure and therefore taming them will be a lot harder to achieve.


Keep pets away from the brooder. Even smaller animals such as birds can be seen as a threat to baby quail. Dogs and cats should definitely be kept away out of the same room as they are predators to small quail chicks.
Reduce noise in the room. Talk in hushed tones and remove anything that creates a racket such as the TV, radio or perhaps a noisy budgerigar.
Optionally keep your quail in a busy (but still safe) room where they can get use to you and you only. Avoid a room with other pets, noises and children however.;
, You should begin to handle your chicks as soon as they have dried and are mobile after hatching. The sooner you begin to handle your chicks the quicker they will learn to trust you. They will imprint onto you as long as you show them trust and care.

, Quails are birds of prey. They are ground dwelling birds, so anything from above is seen as a threat from them. Do not stoop above them or reach to grab them in any way from above. They prefer movements at their eye level and it makes a much safer environment for them.

, If you're going to be taming your quails it takes time and patience so find yourself a seat or pillow to sit on while you're there. Stay at the quails eye-level instead of leaning over the bird because they will see you as a threat otherwise. If your quail are located on the floor restrain from a high-up seat. Instead, place a cushion on the ground for your comfort.


It's easier to have your quails brooder above-ground at a certain height so that you can pull a seat forward and view them in a comfortable position.

, This ensures that they will get use to you much quicker. You should visit them at least once a day but three times a day is ideal for eat least 30 minutes each visit. Your quail chicks need to get to know you as a person and your presence.

, Make small talk with your little pet, they will appreciate it. Your quail will need to get use to the sound of your voice so it won't receive a fright when it hears you talking by it's cage. Talk to the quail in a quiet, calm, soothing tone.Avoid jumpy and shouty remarks.


Make a vocal sound each time you enter the brooder. This will help the baby quail recognise who you are before you reach in.

, This can be as simple as placing your hand in their brooder. Once your chicks are comfortable with your hand they will begin to walk beside it or even walk over your hand. This will help prep you up for hand-feeding them.

, The main task is to encourage your quail chicks to come to you using food - the most effective trick to taming animals. This won't work if they have food available to them in their cage. Choose a time where your chicks are most hungry.

, Chick crumbles work best and they are easier for baby quails to digest. You can additionally use a mash feed or other treats suitable for quail chicks to digest. Do not chase your chicks around with the treats; you should keep your hand still inside of the cage.

, Quail chicks don't magically become tame over one taming process. Taming is a long process that requires a regular routine to get the baby quail use to you. A schedule will benefit both you and your baby quail chicks in getting use to each other. You should handle/tame your chicks at the minimum of once a day. The more the better!

, Instead, just rub them lightly under their beak and above their belly. They will eventually want to climb into your hand on their own. If you do pick up the chick you will make the situation a lot more difficult and scare the little quail!

Realize that all quail mate and it is common to get bald heads.,
Add more females to the flock.,
Separate males from females.",How to Treat Feather Plucking in Quail2," Before you go and cull or rehome the culprit quail, consider whether you’re being too harsh or your doing it for the good of the flock. Before you do rehome or cull the quail, consider trying the steps below first.

, Normally, when a female quail has a bald head due to mating it means that she’s the only female in the cage and the male is focused on her. If you add more females to the cage the male won’t be constantly mating with just one particular female.


Be aware that some quail can get stressed if they are housed in a big group, they don’t have a lot of space or they are taken away from their home. Before adding more quail to the flock create more space for them to prevent stress from close confinement.
The quail may chase each over for now. This is normal and it’s only to show dominance. However, keep a close watch on the quail just to be on the safe side.

, If your hens continue to get bald heads you might want to separate them. Whilst separating them you should put them in pairs or house all females together and give the males one female each.


Housing quail together is hard since they fight a lot, but it can be done. If you give them plenty of space, hiding spots and keep them happy they will live in peace. An occasional chase is normal; it shows dominance.

"
"
Realize that males will attack each over regardless the situation.,
Remove any quail that show signs of bleeding.,
Identify the bully.,
Realize that females will attack as well.,
Separate all male quail.,
Give the quail more space.,
Separate the bullying quail.,
If the quail still continues to attack, decide what you’re going to do.,
Be aware that the bullying quail might just not get along with its partner.",How to Treat Feather Plucking in Quail3," Male quail are very aggressive and territorial towards each over, which means they cannot be housed together. If you have more than one male in one cage, this is most likely the cause of the quail plucking feathers.


Although quail shouldn’t be housed together, there is a way. Give the quail plenty of space to roam around and provide hiding spots for the quail to retreat to if chased. This may be a possible may to house the males together and has been done before. The occasional chase is okay, it’s to show dominance.

, If any of the quail are wounded, you must remove them from the enclosure immediately. Otherwise the bloody quail will get pecked at and attacked even more. See How to Care for a Wounded Quail for more information.

, There’s usually just one quail that attacks the others, and there’s usually a reason for it.

, Although it’s more common for males to attack each over, females will attack as well. Females will even attack males.

, Males cannot be housed together, otherwise they will fight. This is why you must separate them. Keep in mind that quail are social birds, meaning they have to be partnered with someone and not be left alone.

, Quail will attack if they don’t have much space, it’s a territorial move. Give the quail at least 1 square foot of floor space each, more space is better as it’s possible for the quail to continue attacking even if they have 1 square foot of floor space each. Quail love to have room to roam around; it keeps them happy.

, If the quail still continues to attack the others, separate it in another cage and provide it with a partner.

, If the bullying quail continues to attack it’s partner, you might have to rehome or cull it.

, Provide the quail with another partner if this is the case, and see how they get along.


If the bullying quail is a male, provide him with more hens. At least two or three hens are fine. The feather plucking could also be because the male is over mating the females.

"
"
Identify the quail with mites.,
Treat the quail as soon as possible.,
Clean the infested quail cage.,
Provide sand for the quail.",How to Treat Feather Plucking in Quail4," If you keep your quail together it is most likely that they all have mites and that their cage is infested with mites.


Quail with mites will have a decrease in egg production, they will be less active, and they will be feather plucking as you should know already.

, There are many treatments for mites, you can decide from chemical treatments to natural treatments. See below for a list of treatments:


Use products available in local stores such as mite spray or mite powder. Most pet shops and feed stores will supply poultry mite products and these can be the most effective.
Use permethrin. Permethrin is a safe insect killer used by many poultry owners and can also be sprayed in the quail’s cage to get rid of mite infestations.
Use garlic remedies. Garlic is said to be a good mite killer when put in homemade remedies such as a spray mix with 10 ounces of water, 1 ounce of garlic juice and 1 teaspoon of an essential oil.

, If the cage is infested with mites the quail will soon get infested with mites themselves. This is why you must clean the cage after treating the quail.


Spray permethrin in infested area. Quail usually infest cracks, bedding and feeders. Dispose of all the bedding and clean the feeder and water container. After that, hose the cage down and start scrubbing.

, Get a large tub and fill it to the brim with sand. Place the sand in the quail’s cage and make sure the quail have easy access to it. The quail should soon start to dust bathe.


Dust bathing prevents mites, it’s the quail’s way of cleaning itself. If you provide clean sand daily the quail shouldn’t get any more mites.

"
"
Realize what makes a well-balanced diet for quail.,
Purchase a feed with at least 20% protein.,
Give your quail a limited amount of treats.,
Provide a source of calcium for your laying quail hens.,
Supplement your quails diet with grit.,
Observe the quail after a week.",How to Treat Feather Plucking in Quail5," If your quail are malnutrition it means that they aren’t getting a good enough diet. Quail need a feed with at least 20% protein, limited treats and extra calcium and grit. All these will keep your quail healthy and happy.

, A game bird feed, or turkey mix should contain a high amount of protein. You can find these in feed stores, pet shops, and possible your local grocery store. The bird feed should make up most of your quail’s diet.

, You can give your quail vegetables, fruit, bugs or table scraps to support their diet. However, do need feed them avocado, uncooked potato, uncooked egg, stems and leaves of tomato plants, lettuce, alcohol or salty treats. These can be toxic to your quail.

, Calcium will make the quail’s eggs become stronger. Crushed oyster shells or egg shells are a great source of calcium. Provide the calcium in a separate bowl rather than in the same feed bowl so that the males will not have to eat it too.

, Grit will help your quail grind down their food. They will not need grit if they live on the ground as most things in the dirt will replace the grit.

, After a week or so of feeding your quail the correct food, observe them to see if they still pluck their feathers. If they do still pluck their feathers the cause might be from something else.

"

Find out why the quail are stressed.,
Remove any pets from the room of the quail.,
Make sure the housing is predator proof.,
Make sure the quail get no disturbances.",How to Treat Feather Plucking in Quail6," Many things cause stress including pets, predators, high traffic, disturbances, fast movements, things above, too much light or too much noise.

, Many pets can be seen as predators of quail, including dogs, cats and birds. Remove these pets and make sure they can’t go near the quail housing.

, Dogs, cats, raccoons, rats, snakes and birds are all predators of quail. Also, if the cage is open on all sides and above, the quail will get spooked easily as they prefer a corner to retreat to when scared.


Make sure nothing can dig underneath the cage. Small dogs can easily dig underneath the cage and get inside. Add wiring at the bottom of the cage or add wiring all around the cage and underground.
Make sure the wiring spacing isn’t too big. Raccoons can reach their hands through the wiring of the cage and grab hold of the quail. Snakes will also get through. If you get this problem, make sure the wire spacing isn’t too big.
Make sure there are no holes or cracks in the cage. Rats and snakes will slip through them and get hold of the quail. Inspect the cage and fix it up.
Make sure the housing has a roof. If the housing is in an area where birds can fly by (e.g. outdoors), the quail will get spooked easily as anything above them they find threatening. Make sure the quail cannot see predators above them by adding a roof.

, Make sure they are in a low-traffic room and that you don’t disturb them unless necessary such as for feeding, cleaning or collecting eggs. Keep other pets out of the same room as the quail and make sure no young children are frequently going into the room and playing with the quail.

"
"
Realize that when quail are frightened they will fly upwards.,
Remove the cause of the quail hitting their head.,
Build or buy an appropriate home for your quail.,
Provide padding on the top of your quail’s cage.",How to Treat Feather Plucking in Quail7," This results in the quail hitting their head on the roof of their cage and causing harm to their head. If your quail continues to hit their head on the top of the cage they will form a bald head.

, If the quail is hitting their head it’s because something is frightening them. It could either be you, other people, pets, other animals, or predators. Find the culprit and get rid of them to keep your quail stress-free.

, Quail are birds that like to hide a lot; they often feel threatened when exposed. To see how you can acquire a better home for your quail, see below:


Make sure the housing has a flat, non-mesh roof. This is so that when birds fly over the housing the quail won’t be able to see them or get scared by them.
Avoid open meshed cages. Cages that have mesh on all sides aren’t the best for your quail. When frightened, quail like a corner to hide in so that they feel safe. Cages with corners in them are also a lot safer than open cages. Predators such as birds or raccoons can grab or peck at your quail and the quail will have no corner to go to in an open meshed cage.

, This is so that when your quail fly’s upwards, the padding will cushion its head resulting in no harm and no bald spots.

Decide which chicken breed you would like to have.,
Decide whether you want to incubate eggs or buy hatched chicks.,
Prepare the brooder and coop before you bring your chicks home.,
Find out where and how you are going to buy your chicks.,
Observe the chicks if you are buying from a store or breeder.,
Figure out where you want to get your eggs from.",How to Buy Baby Chickens," There are many different chickens out there and, as with all animals, they all have unique personalities. Do some research in the different types of chickens available, as different breeds will meet your needs and your lifestyle. For example, some chickens are considered to be better for egg-laying and others are kept for meat. You can also get a dual-purpose breed which is good for both eggs and meat. A decent book on chicken breeds from your local library will help you to sort out which breed you would like. Once you’ve decided on the breed, you will need to work out whether it’s available in your area, so it’s recommended that you choose a few different breeds, just in case you don’t get your first choice.


Good egg laying chickens include: Hyland, Shaver and White Leghorns.
Chickens that are good for both laying eggs and for meat include: Barred Plymouth Rock, Wyandotte, Black Orpington and Light Sussex.
Keep in mind that some breeds of chickens you like might not be available in your area but you might find a breed alike instead.;
, If you incubate eggs, you will most likely get some male chickens along with females but when you buy already hatched chicks you might get to know the gender of the chicks you buy. Moreover, you’ll need more equipment for incubating eggs, which should be factored into the cost of raising the chickens and keeping them. It might be a good investment if you plan on a large egg production effort or if you plan on continuously raising chickens for many years to come.


Check online trading or auction sites for secondhand incubators if you’d like to save money. You can also check out newspapers, magazines and newsletters devoted to farming and that include advertisements for used items.
Roosters are good if you want to breed your chickens but they do make a lot of noise, fight and they may be hard to sell or get rid of. On the other hand hens make little noise, get along better, lay eggs and can be sold easily.

, The brooder should be 95 °F (35 °C) at first. Chicken coops should be built to a size sufficient to house the chickens. Also check local laws about housing chickens, as there may be rules on size, placement and such for the building, along with limitations on the amounts of chickens you can have.


Consider having a generator backup in case of power failure, so that the incubator keeps humming along if this should occur.

, You can order chicks by mail, online (such as trading and auction sites or from breeder’s websites) or buy them from a local farm store or a breeder.


When buying chicks online, there is a chance that you will get some poorly ones. This becomes a matter of deciding that you want to care for the sick chickens or taking them to the vet for fast and kind disposal.
When buying chicks from a breeder or store, you can inspect them and pick out the healthiest ones. If you’re unsure, take along someone who is already experienced with raising healthy chickens.
If you are buying from a local farm store they may only have chicks in springtime. Call ahead to find out about availability.
Another possibility is to rescue chicks from a local poultry farm or from the abattoir. Call ahead and let such places know that you’re after unwanted chicks; just be aware that they may have problems, such as deformation or illnesses, so this is a labor of love as much as about getting eggs from them later.

, To tell if a chick is healthy, look for the following signs:


They are active but do sleep more than fully grown chickens.
They shouldn't be dirty.
They should not be panting or piling on top of each other.
They should have bright and non-dull eyes.
Chicks who occasionally eat and drink are normally healthy.

, Just like hatched chicks, you can buy them from a local farm store, breeder or online but there is a risk of the eggs not hatching.

Care for your quail properly.,
Get to know your quail.,
Choose which quails you wish to keep and which quails you wish to sell.,
Set a price for your quail.",How to Sell Quail1," The last thing you want to do is sell poor, weak or scruffy quail otherwise they won't sell.


Keep your quail on a well-balanced diet. Quail should be fed a feed with about 22% protein, a game bird feed is the best to go for and can be found in local pet shops and feed stores. You should also supplement your quails diet with calcium for strong eggs and grit to grind down food and always provide fresh, clean water.
House your quail in a suitable way. Your quail should have 1 square foot of floor space each and males shouldn't be housed together. It's also important not to house too much quail together and never isolate a quail as they are social birds.
Keep your quail healthy. Check the quail daily for parasites, wounds, diseases, etc. You should also keep them stress-free by keeping predators away and getting rid of disturbances.
Clean the cage daily. A clean cage can prevent parasites and diseases in quail, it can also keep the quail tidy. Clean the cage at least once a week to keep the quail happy and healthy.;
, When selling your quail to people you will want to answer all their questions and tell them about the quail such as whether one is quite aggressive, one will chase the other one or two of the quail dislike corn as a treat.


Inform your buyers on quail and tell them all about caring for quail such as what they must eat, what can be used as their home, how to identify illness, providing the right equipment and some extra information on breeding and chicks. If you don't know much about quail just give the buyers some advice or research on quail.

, You might want to keep the best egg layers, the tamest or perhaps the quail with the prettiest feathers. However, you don't want to sell ill, injured or plucked quail, keep that in mind.

, Unlike most birds quail are very cheap and the price differs on the breed, colour, age, sex and quality of the quail. Do some researching online to find out how much quail sell for in your area.


Male quail should be set at a lower price than female quail since males are hard to house together, crow more than females and don't lay eggs. The most common reason for someone purchasing a male is for breeding and fertilizing the eggs.
The price of your quail can be set higher if there aren't many quail selling in your area. Some people can be desperate to find quail in their area just because their quail needs a mate, they want a supply of quail eggs or they want to breed their quail. It's a supply and demand situation.
Different breeds of quail can be set at different costs. E.g. Coturnix quail can be sold for more money because they lay bigger eggs and have more meat on them whilst button quail have little meat on them and their eggs are too small to be eaten.

"
Purchase necessary hatching and raising equipment.,
Set up your brooder.",How to Hatch Quail Chicks1," To hatch your quail chicks you'll need a high-quality incubator with an egg-turner, a brooder (cardboard box, large plastic container, etc), chick crumbles, shallow water container, marbles or shiny pebbles, bedding and a heat lamp. You can purchase most of these items from hardware stores, ranch-supply stores or possible your nearest pet shop.;
, A brooder is a small box to raise your chicks, it should provide shelter, warmth, space, food and water. You can use a simple cardboard box to use as a brooder or a Tupperware container.


The brooder should have bedding lined up so you can easily and quickly clean the wastage. You'll be aiming at cleaning the brooder at least once a week because chicks are very messy! It's your choice on the bedding you want to use, but keep in mind that some types of bedding are more absorbent than others; which is a good thing. Straw, paper towels or wood shavings are great materials for bedding, where as newspaper is less absorbent and cause splayed legs in young chicks.

"
Sign up to a site which allows you to advertise your quail.,
Add a title if needed.,
Provide a picture of your quail.,
Provide a description and a way for buyers to contact you.,
Set the price of your quail.",How to Sell Quail2," Online sites such as craigslist or gumtree will allow you to advertise your quail and let buyers know that you are selling them.

, The title of your advertisement should be relevant and could also include the breed, age and sex of your quail such as ‘Female Japanese quail for sale’.

, Try to take a decent picture on a decent camera, the better the picture the more buyers it attracts. If you can, post some extra pictures of your quail. The pictures can be of your quail together, individually or of you holding them up to show.

, Your description should include the breed, age, colour, sex and any extra information of your quail but keep it short and simple. Additionally, you should add your email or phone number so that the buyers can contact you.

, If you’re looking for more money, be bold and set your price a little higher but if there is other quail sellers than just you consider lowering your price. You can also say that your price is negotiable in your description which might attract buyers.


Males should be set at a lower price than females and chicks should cost less than fully grown quail. The same goes if your quail have any problems with their appearance such as if they have plucked feathers or if they have an old wound.

"
"
Design some flyers.,
Add a title.,
Add a picture.,
Include a description of your quail.,
Include the price of the quail.,
Make sure the viewers have a way to contact you.",How to Sell Quail3," Flyers are paper advertisement that can be handed out to people, posted in mail boxes, or pinned up around the street. You can start by choosing the colour of the paper. Try choosing a simple and light colour but yet something that stands out. Be aware that this step is optional; you can stay with the original white paper if you feel like it’s better for you.

, The title on the flyer should state that you’re selling quail. You can also add the breed, age and sex of your quail on the title such as ‘Silver Button Quail for Sale’.


Consider keeping the title a dark/bold colour that stands out from the rest of the writing so people know the whole point of the flyer. The title should also be bigger than the rest of the information on the flyer.

, This is optional but it may attract more buyers than if you don’t add a picture. The picture should be of your quail but keep it small so you can fit a description on the page.

, The description should include your quails breed, age, sex and feather colour. If you feel like it, add any extra information in the description such as whether the quail are tame, their behaviours and if they lay good eggs.

, Make sure the price is reasonable, and if so state that it is negotiable. You can also sell your quail in pairs if you want to. Males should be cheaper than females because not many people are interested in males.

, You should include a phone number or email address on the flyer so that the viewers can ask you any questions or tell you that they are interested in the offer.

Find a local pet shop.,
Ask any employees in the pet shop if they sell quail.,
Clean your quails up and make sure they’re in healthy condition.,
Put your quail in a clean box.",How to Sell Quail4," You can locate a local pet shop on a map, through the yellow pages or just by asking someone. Check the pet shop out to see if they care for their animals properly and to see if they even sell quail in their shop.


The animals in the pet shop should be active, clean, clear eyed, eating and drinking, and they shouldn't be huddled up.

, If they do sell quail, ask them if they would like to purchase some from you. Negotiate the price if they want to purchase some cheap quails. If they refuse to purchase quail and you really need to get rid of your quail, consider giving them away.


Tell them the breed, age, colour and sex of your quail and consider bringing a picture of your quail along and showing them. This might encourage the pet shop owners to buy your quail.
Depending on the amount of quail they have in stock they might purchase your quail at a higher price or they might purchase your quail at a lower price.

, If you’re going to sell your quail to a pet shop you’ll want to make sure they look clean and looked after properly. You can clean them using water, trim their claws, and clip their wings.


Quail that are cloudy eyes, huddled up, panting, or have wounds on them are most likely poorly. You should get your quail checked out by a veterinarian if they show any of these signs.

, Before you take your quail to the pet shop, make sure they’re in a safe and secure container such as a cardboard box. Place fresh bedding in the box and poke some breathing holes in it. Be sure the quail aren't cramped up in their box so that they stay happy on the trip.

"
"
Ask other people if they are interested in buying some quail.,
Tell them how to look after quail.,
Offer some or all of your equipment to go with the quail.",How to Sell Quail5," You should ask relatives, friends, neighbours or even a nearby bird breeder.

, If someone’s going to buy your quail, they’ll want to know how to take care of them. Tell them what they eat, their type of housing, when they need to be cleaned up, how many space they need, and also tell them any extra information such as their behaviours or how many eggs they lay.


Along with this, also warn them about anything dangerous to quail such as predators, disease, fighting, temperatures, etc.

, If the buyers aren't so keen, offer to give them all the equipment they need to look after quail. If you’re short of money, mention that you’re selling their equipment as well. You can even lower the price of the equipment if you need to.

"
"
Purchase fertile quail eggs.,
Collect eggs from your current quails.",How to Hatch Quail Chicks2," You can order some quail eggs on online sites such as Craigslist, Ebay or Gumtree. Or you can order fertile eggs from hatcheries online. The amount of eggs you choose depends on the amount of chicks you want to hatch, and how many eggs can fit in your incubator. You might want to order more eggs than needed due to the fact that some may get destroyed along the way.

, If you have a male and a female together, the hen would have laid some fertile eggs for you. A rule of thumbs is to choose the best eggs you can find such as eggs with no cracks, are clean and they should have hard shells.


If you want your hen laying some great-quality eggs, provide her with more sunlight and supplement her diet with calcium (crushed egg shells or oyster shells).
Do not wash or rub the eggs. The eggs have a special coating which protects it from bacteria, and by causing friction or washing the eggs you get rid of the special coating.

"
"
Set the humidity of the incubator.,
Set the temperature of the incubator.",How to Hatch Quail Chicks3," The humidity should be set at 45% to 50% and keep note that on the 23rd day of incubating your chicks you'll need to change the humidity up to 65%-70%.

, Set the temperature at 99 °F (37.2 °C).

"
"
Place your fertile eggs in the incubator.,
Turn the eggs.,
Start checking on eggs before hatch due date.",How to Hatch Quail Chicks4," Eggs should be placed with the small end facing downwards and the big end sticking up, elevated.


The eggs should take about 17-25 days to hatch depending on the breed of quail which has laid the egg.

, Eggs should be turned 3 times a day to stop the embryo in the egg from sticking to the shell. You can set the turner in the incubator to do this for you. If you don't have an egg turner in your incubator, no worries; you can just turn the eggs carefully yourself.


Stop the process of turning the eggs 3 days before the hatch due date.

, Check on eggs 3 days before they are due to hatching to make sure everything goes okay and so you'll be there when the chicks start hatching. Chicks commonly hatch early/late so don't be worried.

"
"
Move hatched chicks to a brooder.,
Discard of eggs 1-2 days after hatch due date.,
Feed and check on chicks daily.",How to Hatch Quail Chicks5," Once the chicks are dry transfer them to a previously set-up brooder. The brooder should contain shallow water (stick marbles in the container to attract them to the water), chick crumbles (baby chicken food works best) and a heat lamp.

, Wait a while after the hatch due date just in case you get some late hatchers, after that discard of unhatched eggs including dead chicks.

, You'll need to feed them, provide them with water, check on them and clean the brooder daily. Also keep in mind the set the heat lamp below 5 degrees each week until it's at room temperature.

Realize the long process of taming quail.,
Know the things you should not do whilst taming your quail.,
Realize that not all quail can be tamed.,
Care for your quail properly.,
If your quail are new, give them time to settle in.,
Visit the quail often.,
Talk or vocalize to the quail.,
Once your quail gets less frightened of you, start performing actions around its cage.,
Get the quail use to your hand.,

Try petting the quail.,
Never approach your quail from above.,
Create a routine.",How to Tame a Fully Grown Quail," Quail are not usually the type of pets to tame as they are very skittish and hate being picked up (tame or not). Quail are especially hard to tame if they are fully-grown as it’s best to tame quail at a young age. Before you start taming your quail consider whether you actually want or need to tame them.


Remember; you can always purchase fertile quail eggs and incubate them. Then you will be able to hand-raise the chicks and get them to become tame by just interacting with them.;
, You shouldn’t rush the process of taming, make any sudden movements, shout, get angry at your quail, chase your quail, grab your quail, approach your quail from above or force your quail to eat food out of your hands. This will make the quail more scared of you – the opposite of taming a quail.

, It is quite hard to tame a quail, especially a fully-grown quail. No matter how much you try, some quails cannot be tamed – it’s in their nature.


Button quail are extremely hard to tame, they're more for watching than interacting. However, coturnix and bobwhite are great pets to keep once tamed.

, Feed them a high-quality feed, provide them with fresh water, keep their cage clean, get rid of disturbances, house them in a cage with plenty of space, etc. The more happy your quail the better chances of getting them tame. Also, if you interact with them daily from caring for them they will get use to your presence which is the first step to getting them tamed.

, Interacting with the quail straight away can get them stressed; they need at least a full week to adjust to you and their new surroundings.

, Before you tame the quail it must get use to your presence and know that you’re not a threat. Sit by the quails cage everyday and make sure the quail can see you.


Sit next to the quail for at least 20 minutes each day. This doesn’t mean that you have to do nothing during the time, grab a chair and read a book or do some other sort of time-passer. Just make sure your not moving about or shouting, you don’t want to frighten the quail.
If the quail are running along the sides of the cage this means that they are scared. Move a certain distance away from the cage (but still stay in sight of the quail) and stay still, the quail should soon calm down. Every day move a little closer until you are right next to the cage, the quail should soon know that you are not a threat.

, Talk to the quail just like you would with a friend or you could whistle or sing to the quail. Speak softly and do not shout or raise your voice, this step will get the quail use to your voice.

, At this point your quail should now stop running up and down its cage and feel calmer when around you. If your quail is housed inside of your home perform actions that you would usually do in your daily routine such as sweeping the floor, studying at a desk, playing games, etc. If your quail is housed outside perform actions such as watering plants, tending the garden, raking leaves, sweeping the pathway, etc.


Avoid noisy tasks such as vacuuming, mowing the lawn or dancing to loud music.

, Carefully and slowly place your hand in the quails cage, make sure the quail cannot escape. Lay your hand in the cage perfectly still and do not chase the quail with your hand. Do this for 10 minutes a day and the quail should soon get use to your hand, they might even come near your hand soon.

, Remove the quails feed from the cage and offer a treat that your quail enjoys out of your hand. A good treat to feed your quail is meal worms, or you can change it up by feeding the quail a different treat every day.


Don’t chase the quail around with your hand or force the quail to eat the treat, just lay your hand still and see if the quail will eat the treat. Eventually your quail will get less scared and take the treat out of your hand.

, If the quail is very calm towards you, try rubbing the quail underneath its head. If the quail is tame it shouldn’t run away.

, Prey (usually birds) attack quail from above which is why quail hate being picked up or patted on their back. Even a tame quail will like this; instead they will climb into your hand. Only grab a quail if necessary.

, It’s good to create a routine when taming quail, you will want to interact with them at least once a day.

Care for your quail properly.,
Provide your quail with a mate.,
Don’t stress your quail out too much.,
Feed your quail some treats.,
Scatter your quail’s food around.,
Give the quail more space.,
Pot plants in the quails habitat.,
Make the quail’s closure more exciting.,
Provide a tub of sand for your quail.,
Get rid of things that make your quail unhappy.,
Interact with your quail.",How to Keep Your Quail Happy," Make sure you know how to care for quail. You can start by feeding them a high quality feed, providing them with fresh and clean water, changing their bedding daily and checking on them to see if they are healthy.;
, If your quail is lonely or is housed by itself, consider getting it a partner. Since quail are social birds, they shouldn’t be alone, otherwise they will become depressed.

, Quail don’t like interacting unless tame, and they hate being picked up (tame or not). You’ll also be doing your quail a favour if you get rid of all predators, pets, disturbances, etc.

, Along with a high quality feed your quail will love some treats to eat. Quail are picky so they might not like everything you give them but they will eat what they like and leave what they dislike so you will soon know what to feed them. Lists of food that make great treats are seen below:


Fresh fruits including apple, banana, strawberry, melon, etc. Make sure you chop these up into small pieces so that the quail can eat them.
Fresh vegetables including broccoli, corn, cucumber, salad leafs, sprouts, etc. Chop these up as well as the fruits.
Bugs including mealworms, millipedes, spiders, woodlice, etc. Make sure you keep the bugs small so that the quail will have no trouble eating them.
Table scraps including pasta, rice, noodles, cereal, etc. Quail will eat most types of food but make sure to only give them a small amount.
Never feed quail avocado, chocolate, alcohol, stems and leaves of tomato plants, uncooked potato or egg, citrus fruits, lettuce and salty treats. These are all toxic to quail.

, Instead of putting the quail’s feed in a bowl, scatter it around so they can go foraging for it instead. This creates lots of fun for them during feed time.

, Quail love plenty of space to roam around in and it lessens the chances of fighting between the flock. You can purchase or build a run which is a great amount of space to keep your quail in during the day time.

, If your quail live outside on the ground consider planting a few shrubs in their enclosure depending on how big it is. They’ll love pecking around at the plants but make sure they aren’t poisonous to the quail.


Although you must be aware of the many poisonous plants there are to quail, you probably won’t come across these anyway. And quail will avoid plants that are poisonous to them.

, If you have a lot of spare space in the quail’s cage, add some extra items that they’ll love such as logs, rocks, rodent huts, hiding spots, plants etc.


The hiding spots will give any bullied quail a place to retreat to when chased, and it also increases the chance you can have males housed together.

, Quail love to dust bathe daily and it’s their way of cleaning themselves. Provide them a shallow tub of dry sand for your quail to dust bath in.

, There are many things that can cause unhappiness to quail, some can be seen below:


Too much sunlight or little sunlight. Quail need 13-15 hours of light per day, if they lack this consider providing them with a few light bulbs hung above their cage. However, the quail should always have access to shade if they become too hot.
Predators including pets. Racoons, birds, dogs, cats, rats and snakes are all predators of quail. Make sure the cage is predator proof and that no pets can get inside the quails room.
Lack of space. Provide your quail with at least 1 square foot of floor space, more will be even better.
Hot or cold temperatures. Bring the quail inside a warm room during winter and keep them in the shade during summer depending on how cold/hot it gets in your area. Cold quail will huddle up and hot quail will pant.

, If your quail is tame, consider playing with it. If your quail is not tame, either find a way to tame it or visit it in its cage. Just remember to not disturb the quail too much since they aren’t very interactive birds.

Figure out if you have female or male quails.,
If your quails are new, give them time to settle in.,
Give your quails more space.,
Mix crushed oyster shells in your quails feed.,
Give your quails access to light.,
Do not disturb your quails.,
Keep predators (including pets) away from your quails.,
Add hay/straw to their cage.,
Do not mess with or clean the cage a lot.",How to Get Quails to Lay Eggs," Like any other bird, only the female lays the eggs. It’s easy to tell a quails gender and there is more than one way.


Observe their behaviour. Male quails tend to be more aggressive than females.
Look at their feathers. Most male quails will have brighter feathers around their neck, head and back whilst females will have more plain colours.;
, Quails can get stress from all the new surroundings and from the long move. It can take up to 2-6 weeks for quails to settle in and start laying eggs whilst some quails can settle in straight away and start laying eggs 2 days after moving.

, You should have 1 square foot of floor space per quail. Any more space will allow your quail room to roam but any less and they will get stress from close confinement.

, These are high on calcium which is what a quail needs to lay good eggs.

, Either hang lights near their cage or move their cage to a sunny/light area, this increases egg production in quails.


Give them 14-16 hours of light per day. Any more and your quails may suffer from exhaustion as they do need time to rest and sleep.
If you move your quails cage outside make sure they are not near danger and cannot escape (it will be quite a task to find them again).

, Quails need a calm quiet area to stimulate laying and disturbing them may also cause stress.

, They may disturb or scare the quails which will be the reason for not laying eggs.

, Some quails like building nests to lay their eggs in whilst others will lay them anywhere.

, You will not only destroy their nest but you will also disturb them as well.


Clean the cage once every 2 weeks. This includes rinsing the water and food bowls, disposing of all bedding and scrubbing the cage.

"
Examine the colour and speckles of the quail's breast.",How to Determine Sex of a Quail1," Females will have light-coloured breasts (such as cream or pale brown) with brown speckles. Males, however, will have dark-coloured breasts (such as reddish-brown), and will not have speckles.;

Do you have the space for the quail? Although quail may not require much space, they do require special housing.
Can you afford the right equipment? Again, you may have to invest in housing, feeders, lamps, and more.
Do you have any potential predators of quail such as cats, dogs, coyotes, fox, even mountain lions? All of these animals may be potential killers of quail.
Is it legal to keep quail as livestock or pets in your town or city? Some areas (such as condo associations in America) may ban outside pets such as quail. Some cities may consider your pet birds as livestock and not allow you to keep them even if you do not consider them as such. Some areas (such as those affected by the bird flu) may have special rules about birds.;
, Before you start asking your parents that you want quail you must first learn how to care for them, the pros and cons of them, and the different breeds (and colors) of them. The more you know about quail the more you can educate your parents about misconceptions, and show that you have researched the subject.


There is plenty of helpful information online about quail, get searching now.

, If you know the pros and cons of keeping quail it will likely convince your parents that you have thought this through.


The pros of keeping quail are that they are very small which means they can be housed easily, they lay eggs that you can eat, they need little care and attention, you get different breeds and colours, they can be tamed and overall they are fun to watch and care for!
The cons of keeping quail are that some breeds of quail are quite noisy, they’re aggressive towards each over (mainly males), quail come with many problems, they’re skittish, they may be hard to tame, and they have many predators.

, You can usually get quail online, from a pet shop, or a local breeder. However, you might not have any quail in your area at all. Since quail are uncommon pets or livestock, there is a chance that there will be no quail available in your area.

, You need to consider the housing these birds need, and where it will be. Answer your parent’s question of ‘where will we keep them?’ by clearing a space somewhere for the quail to stay. Quail need 1 square foot of floor space each.


Remember, quail can be quite smelly and noisy sometimes which is why they are best housed outside, in a shed or in your garage.

, Although quail don’t require much attention you will still need to know how to care for them and what not to do. A list of information can be seen below.


Quail need to be fed a feed that has at least 20% protein such as a game bird feed.
The quail’s water container must be refilled with clean water daily.
You must clean the quail’s bedding weekly because quail’s waste is high in ammonia and quail are prone to diseases.
You must clean the quail’s housing monthly. If you don't the quail will get mites, diseases or the cage will get infested with parasites.

, There are different types of breed of quail just like chickens and dogs and they all have different personalities, purposes and appearances.


The two most common quail are coturnix and button quail. Coturnix are larger and make more noise but lay bigger eggs whilst button are smaller and make less noise but their eggs are too small to eat.
Coturnix and button have different colored feathers such as white, brown, blue, cinnamon, silver and many more. Some colors are rarer than others but in these cases silver and brown are common colors.

, Because quail are social birds you need at least two. It is recommended that you buy only one pair of quail since it is easier for you and your parents to care for them, especially as beginners.


If you are keen on getting a male only buy one, males will fight each over which is why they must stay separated.

, Before you do get some quail create a routine for them. This includes the time you must feed them, when you refill their water container, when you clean their housing, what times you check up on them, and so on. A chart of your routine will most likely impress your parents.

, If you do not wash the dishes on time, your parents may not think that the responsibility and expense of a living thing is a good idea. Or your parents may think that if you do get some new quail then you will be too busy playing or caring for them. Prove them wrong by finishing your chores without them asking you too or finishing them extra early.


It also helps if you finish your homework and try to get your grades up. Another worry of your parents is that you will be too distracted with your new quail to do your homework.

, Wash and dry the dishes, do the laundry, polish the sides, and do whatever you need to do. If you do this your parents will realize that you are being responsible and mature. Helping around the house to show that you would like a pair of quail is better than begging for them.

, Even if it’s a pet gold fish, if you don’t take care of any other pets your parents will use this as an excuse. Take good care of any other pets bond with them, and hopefully you will demonstrate to your parents that you are responsible enough to take care of your own quail.

, Posters are a great way to present things. Include pictures of quail (and cute quail chicks!), interesting facts and helpful information.

, Remember the information above and tell them facts about quail, the pros and cons, and correct them for any mistakes they make about quail.


Ask at an appropriate time such as at a dinner conversation or when your parents aren't busy but are still together (e.g. whilst watching TV).
Don’t argue, beg or shout. This will make you look immature and you won’t convince your parents into getting you quail.

, Once you ask your parents if you can get quail you must wait. Even if they say no they’re probably taking it into consideration so continue working hard and they may just say yes.

, If you get a yes or even a no continue working hard, you’ll probably convince your parents into saying yes.


Continue doing chores, homework, caring for other pets and researching about quail. You’ll show your parents how much you want a new pet.

, If your parents gave you a no, still be patient and wait as they may be taking it into consideration. However, whilst waiting, be prepared to get rid of any causes for not getting quail.


It may be because of money. Offer to spend as much of your money as you can towards the quail.
It may be because of responsibility. Take care of any other pets, do your chores, complete your homework and help around the house.
It may be because of space. Clean up around the house and clear some space, have a garage sale if you need too.
It may be because of other pets such as cats and dogs. Create a place for the quail where any cats or dogs cannot get to.

, Don’t stop caring for the quail overtime just because you get bored. You don’t have to interact with the quail but you must feed them, refill their water containers, and clean out their cage daily to prove that you're dedicated.

Securely hold the quail's body.,
Examine the cloaca.,
Press the cloaca.",How to Determine Sex of a Quail2," Make sure not to hold the quail by its legs, as the legs are very fragile. Have a gentle but firm grip on your quail, and then turn it upside-down.

, Blow the feathers underneath the tail to expose the cloaca. You may already be able to see a small bulge (if so, it is a male).

, If you can't see a bulge just by looking at the cloaca, place one finger above the opening of the cloaca and put another finger below the opening. Gently press down. If a bulge pops up, then it's a male. White foam may also come out of the cloaca when you press it, which also indicates that it's a male. If there is no bulge and no foam when you press the cloaca, the quail is a female.

Observe the quails behaviour.,
Listen to your quail.,
Watch your quails during mating season.",How to Determine Sex of a Quail3," Male quails tend to be more aggressive towards each over whilst the female is more calm.


Male quails will attack each over unless they are in a large space with lots of hiding spots. To see if they do attack, place them in a small box (but big enough for them to move around) and watch them for a minute or two. If they are males one should attack the other, if so remove them straight away to prevent serious injuries.

, Male quails will often call to the female quails but sometimes the female has a call that sounds similar in some breeds of quails (usually to call to her chicks).

Male quails will be loud and call a lot during mating season. Whilst calling the male will reach up as if stretching and then call. Male quails are even said to 'growl' during mating season.

, The female often builds the nest and feeds the chicks depending on the breed of quail you have. Sometimes the male will build the nest and feed the chicks so you shouldn't rely on this method.

"
"
Examine the feathers during mating season.,
Look at the difference between each quail.",How to Determine Sex of a Quail4," Female quails usually have a loss of feathers on their head and back due to mating.

, Male quails usually have brighter and more colourful feathers around their back, neck and head whilst the female quails are usually a plain colour.

Realize the pros and cons of clipping quail’s wings.,
Obtain the necessary equipment.,
Catch the quail you want to clip.,

Hold the quail for clipping.,
Hold one of the quails wings out.,
Clip the tips of the flight feathers.,
Repeat the process on the second wing.,
Return the quail back to its home.,
Clean up the mess.",How to Clip Quail Wings," The advantages of clipping your quails wings are that they are less likely to get hurt, get into danger, or escape. However, you must frequently clip your quail's wings, which can be difficult if you have many quails. Also, in the case they do escape, they cannot get themselves away from predators easily and will be very vulnerable.;
, You will need a pair of sharp and long scissors, gloves, and a helper. You may need a bird net to catch the quail. You might also need to clear some space in a room and make sure nothing in the room can harm your quail.

, The quail you want to clip should be the one that flies frequently and has long wing feathers. To catch the quail, chase it into a corner and quickly grab it or use a bird net if you’re finding the task difficult.


Once you have the quail you should gently cup your hands over its wings so it doesn't move excessively. Keep in mind that quail are adept at escaping predator's grasps, so you should hold it firmly, but not so firmly that you hurt it.

, You’ll need somewhere that is free from disturbances, pets, dangerous objects, and hiding spots. Close the door after entering so the quail does not fly out in case it does slip from your hands.

, You should hold the quail’s body in one hand. Be aware that the quail can scratch and peck. You will want to wear garden gloves if you have sensitive hands.

, Use your free hand to help carefully extend the quail's wing and expose all of its feathers. If you have trouble, a helper is useful. Ask them to spread the wing out or hold the quail.

, The longest tip of the feathers should be cut back to 1 centimeter (0.39 in) depending on the size/breed of quail you have.

, You MUST clip both wings or the quail will be unbalanced during flight. Sometimes, if only one wing is clipped, the quail will still be able to fly. Worse, it may try flapping its wings too hard and hurt itself.

, The quail should be in its normal state and not frightened or in an unusual behaviour at all. Clipping the wings doesn’t harm the quail in any way but does affect the way they fly.

, Once you clip the wings the feathers will fall down to the ground. You can sweep this up with a broom or dust pan and brush with little effort.

Know how to house quail.",How to Care for a Wounded Quail," If the quail is bleeding the most important thing to do is remove it from the flock. If you don’t the other ones will peck at the wound and most likely kill the injured quail.


An injured quail probably won’t run away from you, making it easy to capture it. But always be gentle with the quail as it is fragile whilst injured.;
, Make sure the box has breathing holes and is kept in a quiet, dark place away from predators. Put some paper towels, napkins or anything alike in the small box and place a heating pad in the box if the quail is cold. A hot quail will pant whilst a cold quail will fluff up its feathers.

, If you don’t have much experience with caring for an injured quail it might be better to take it the vet, but it’s always possible to care for a wounded quail on your own.

, Get a cotton ball and soak it in warm water and then carefully dab at the blood. Try not to cause friction or rub at the wound but just gently dab the wound to clean most of the blood.

, An anti-bacteria cream will prevent the wound from getting a bacterial infection which is why it’s important to apply this to the quails wound.

, Make sure the quail has easy access to the feed and water containers and don’t fill them to the brim as you don’t want them to spill.

, Check on the quail every 30 minutes or hour and see if the quail is doing fine or at least getting better.

, Bring the quail out to a room with light but isn’t too bright. Make sure the quail knows where the feed and water is, you could even scatter the feed out if the quail won’t eat.

, Keep the quail in a dark, quiet and undisturbed area for the quail to sleep. Make sure that no predators can get in the room and keep children away from the quail for now. Carefully check on the quail every hour or two but try not to disturb it. If the quail seems to be doing fine and is eating you do not need to check on it during the night if you don't want to.

, If the quail continues to get better and is now walking about, move it to a bigger cage so that it has room to roam.

, If the quail is perfectly fine and has no blood on it, reunite it with the other quails. Keep in mind that you shouldn't place it back in the home if it’s unsafe or if the quail was injured by another quail from the home.


Males cannot be housed together otherwise they will fight, see below for more preventions on quail getting injured.

, Lock the door of the quails entrance and invest in a predator proof home for the quails.


Quail have many prey including large birds, dogs, cats, raccoons, foxes, snakes and large rats. Dogs can dig underneath a coop on the floor, raccoons can grab quail through the wiring on a pen and birds can also peck at the quail through the wiring.

, If any bits of screws or sharp wire are sticking out of the cage you should remove it immediately. It is possible for the quail to cut themselves on sharp things.


If the housing has a hard roof the quail and fly up and hit its head on the roof, to prevent this add padding on top of the roof. Flat roofed pens are better than triangular roofed pens as the quail won’t get spooked from any bird flying above, or you can move the quail’s pen to a sheltered area.

, Males cannot be housed together otherwise they will fight each over. The only way to house a male with another male is if they have a spacious pen with lots of hiding spots to retreat to when chased.

Breed your quail if desired.",How to Care for Quail," Due to their small size, quail can live in most sorts of housing including guinea pig hutches, rodent cages, chicken coops, and aviaries. There’s two ways to acquire a house, you either buy one or build one.


It’s important to give quail no less than 1 square foot of floor space. A longer cage allows your quail room to roam but a smaller cage can cause them stress from close confinement.
Make sure that the spacing between the wiring is at most 1/2 an inch, as quails can squeeze their head through anything larger. Owing to their tiny feet, they do not do well with wire floor grids, as they can fall and slip through, causing discomfort and possible injury;
, Quail can be kept in any sort of housing but their home does need a few things to make it safe and suitable for your quail. These things include:


The home must have easy access so that you can grab the birds when necessary, feed and provide water for the quail every day, and clean the cage with no troubles every week.
The quails home should have shelter from the rain, wind, hail, snow and the sun. Keep in mind that although the cage should have shelter from the wind and sun, it still needs plenty of fresh air and a bit of sunlight. If you cannot obtain housing with shelter then you could try covering a water-proof sheet (e.g. tarpaulin) over the housing to keep it safe.
The home should be secure and predator proof. Dogs, wild cats, rats, snakes, raccoons and foxes will eventually kill your quail if the housing isn’t predator-proof or secure enough. It’s also possible for small dogs to dig under the housing and get in, birds can peck at the quail from the wiring and raccoons can reach through the wiring and grab the quail.

, Keep in mind that if you are going to do this then it is best to keep the quails and the small birds in a fairly large aviary. Housing them in a simple bird cage can cause stress on both the quail and the small bird.


You get advantages and disadvantages with this option. The advantages are that you do not need to spend a lot of money on a home for your quail and the quail will clean up the seed that the birds drop on the floor. The disadvantages are that the quail might attack the other birds or get attacked themselves, there is more mess to clean up in the aviary, and when the quail breed and hatch out chicks, the chicks might get attacked by the other birds in the aviary.

, Quail need a calm, warm yet cool, quiet and undisturbed place to stay to be happy. They should also be housed away from predators including pets. A suitable place to house quail is under a tree during summer or in a garage/shed during winter.

, For their habitat bedding you can use pine shavings, fir wood chips, sand, newspaper pellets, grass pellets, Timothy hay or non-skid kitchen draw liners. It is highly recommended that you give the quails some straw/hay to make their nests with. This will encourage them to start laying eggs and they may even want to have some chicks

, You may think that quails can't fly, but when frightened, they can fly straight up to the roof. So for their cage, make sure to add padding to the top to stop the quails from damaging their head if they do fly up quickly.

, Quail need more than just bedding to keep them happy. Some items they need are:


Water container. This shouldn't be too big or deep as quail need to have easy access to it and not be in danger of drowning.
Feeder. The quail should be able to get to the feeder easily as well as the water container.
Hiding spots. You can purchase a couple of large hamster huts and place them in the quail’s cage. Quail love a place to retreat to when they feel frightened or think they are in danger.
Sand tub. Quail love dust bathing on a daily basis, the sand also prevents annoying parasites such as mites. Because quail make a mess when they dust bathe it is best to keep the sand tub away from the water container.
Small plants. If your quails live on dirt or grass, growing or potting a couple of plants in the housing will make your quails very happy! Remember, quails are curious and love different types of plants in their habitat, just make sure the plants aren't toxic to them.

, Quail breeds are all different and generally chosen depending on their purpose (e.g. for meat, eggs or breeding). You should do some proper researching on which breed is best for you and your lifestyle. Some popular breeds are:


The coturnix quail. These are the most popular owned quail and are chosen because they are thought to be the best breed for beginners, they are easy to take care of, they lay good eggs and they are great quails for raising for meat.
The bobwhite quail. These are another recommended quail breed which are normally kept for breeding and meat. The male’s heads tend to be the colour white whilst the female’s heads are the colour ginger which makes bobwhites easy to sex.
The button quail. These quail aren't usually kept for meat or eggs due to their small size. The advantages of keeping button quail are that they are great breeders, some types have bright and beautiful colours and they are fun to keep as pets. Button quail are also known to be kept at the bottom of aviaries to clean up seeds that other birds drop down.

, Before you purchase quail you need to know the basics of housing quail:


Males cannot be housed together; otherwise they will start to fight. It is possible to house them together as long as they have a large amount of space and plenty of hiding spots to retreat to when attacked, but if you cannot provide this for your quail then it’s best not to try to house males together.
Do not house males with no females. This can sometimes cause stress to the males and they will also call a lot more than usual.
You must house at least two quails together. The reason for this is because they are social birds that will get lonely even if you visit or play with them every day.
If breeding quail, you need at least 1 male with every 2-5 females to ensure that the eggs get fertilized.

, You can purchase quail from any local breeders, online and possibly a nearby pet shop. Also, before you buy the quail, make sure the breeder is caring for them properly. The quail should be fed a high quality feed, their water and cage should be clean, and they should have plenty of space in their home.

, The last thing you want to do is end up spending lots of money on a pair of ill quails even if you think you are ‘saving’ them. Some tips on which quail is healthy and which quail is not can be seen below:


They shouldn't be huddled up in the corner. The quail is either cold or seriously ill.
They shouldn't be panting. This means that the quail is too hot or very thirsty and probably isn't being cared for properly.
Their eyes should be clear. Bad eyes are droopy and cloudy.
They shouldn't have featherless bodies or backs. If it is a lot of loss in feathers this may indicate stress in the quail.
The cage shouldn't be dirty. This includes the water, the only reason for the cage being dirty is because the current day is the day the cage gets cleaned and it hasn’t been cleaned just yet.
The quail shouldn't be injured or have blood on them at all! Never, ever choose a quail with injuries or any other quail that is housed with the injured quail. The only good excuse for a breeder to have an injured quail is because they were given the quail and are trying to raise it back to health.
They shouldn't have mites on them. If the quail do have mites it means that their cage isn't cleaned out properly. Mites are seen as little black creatures around the body and head of the quail.
They shouldn't be sleeping or at least appear to be sleepy. The quail should be awake and lively unless it is night time or very dark in the cage.
They should be alert and cautious. Quail should be frightened of sudden movements yet quite curious. But if the quail is tame it probably will not be frightened.

, Many people think that the quail looks ill or not cared for when they are perfectly fine, some examples include:


Bald heads. This is different to bare backs or featherless bodies as bald heads do not indicate stress but mating. Bald heads are mostly common with females during the mating season which is during spring and summer.
Quail chasing each over. These quail should be males and it is normal for them to chase each over to show dominance, do not think that it is due to a lack of space. However if they have a wound do not purchase the quail as this is usually very bad unless they are healing.
The quail are eating so much food! Most breeders give quail a certain feeding time and it is normal for quail to be inside the feeding containers and getting dirty with the feed. Remember, quail do not over-eat.

, Before you interact with the quail you must first let them settle in to their new surroundings. The quail might be seen running up and down and along their cage for the first week and the females will not lay eggs until they are settled in which might take a couple of weeks or more.

, For food you have a large range of choice. Suitable food includes: Game bird crumbles, finch/canary mix, turkey starter and some gravel or grit. You can also give them a wide range of treats which you can see in the steps below.


A common choice is to supply the feed in a feeder but if your quail live on dirt/grass you can try scattering the feed on the ground so that your quail can forage for the feed, they will love this.

, You could also put them on a layer pellets diet instead of their ordinary diet to ensure that you get the best eggs out of them.

, You can feed your quail many types of food including fruits, vegetables, seeds, small bugs, greenery and table scraps. Quail can even eat meat if you want them to.


Quail are quite fussy when it comes to treats. But don’t worry, they’ll eat what they like and leave what they dislike so you will soon get to know what to feed them.
Remember to dispose of foods that the quail do not eat instead of leaving them to waste away in the quails home.

, Make sure the water container isn't too deep or big for the quail and that it is in an easy to get to place. You should clean the container at least once a week to prevent a build-up of bacteria.

, Quail should not eat avocado, caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, salty or sugary treats, uncooked potato, tomato leaves and stems, parsley, citrus fruits and grape seeds as these all are toxic to quail.


Some types of plants are toxic to quail as well, so be aware of what plants you put in their habitat.
Do not worry too much on what not to feed your quail as they will avoid toxic foods unless they are at the point of starving hungry.

, Quail love new things and they are very curious! They’ll nibble at the grass, dust-bathe in the dirt, eat any small bugs they find, and peck about in ground. The sun is also good for laying hens! If you notice the female quail is not laying eggs, it may be because of her diet or a lack of sunlight, so it's a good idea to put the cage outside for a bit. Also, if you have an outside cage, be on the lookout for such birds as ravens and crows. These birds may view the quail as prey and peck their heads. If you have these birds in the area, it's recommended that you cover the cage with a tarpaulin or something alike when you're not watching them.

, Quail love to dust bathe daily! Dust bathing also prevents parasites in quail. To get them to dust bathe all you need to do is provide them with a shallow but wide tub of dry sand. They will soon start to dust bathe throughout the day.

, Cleaning the quails cage prevents diseases, bacteria, and mites and isn't a big task. You should dispose of all bedding, hose the cage down, rinse the feeders and water container, replace the tub with fresh sand and refill the feeder and water container with fresh food and water.


Since quail waste is high in ammonia you must clean the bedding at least once a week to prevent diseases. Just chuck the bedding in a bin or chuck it in your compost.

, Quail need plenty of sleep to stay healthy, happy and overall fun birds! Don’t leave any lights on or at least move the quail to a dark room so that they can sleep properly. Quail can only have up to 15 hours of light per day, otherwise they will not be able to sleep.

, Their is a possible chance that a dog or cat will try to kill the quail and if you have a noisy pet in the room they will disturb the quail and cause stress.

, You should collect the eggs once every day to ensure that they are fresh, especially during a hot day. You can put the eggs in an egg carton and leave them on the side or put them in the fridge to stay fresh for a longer period of time. Your female quail will lay about one egg every day so you should get 5-6 eggs every week.

, If your quail seems to be acting a bit unusual or isn't eating lately then it’s probably because the quail is unwell. Although you can take your quail to a veterinarian, you can also fix some small problems yourself. Some problems that may occur are:


Your quail is huddled up in the corner of the cage. This is either because the quail is ill or is cold. If the quail is ill you should take it to a veterinarian. If the quail is cold then take it out of the cage and place it in a warm box or something alike. The room should be inside and it should also be very warm. Provide a little bit of food and water in the quails box and wait until the quail is quite lively until you return it back to its cage. You should also observe the quail for a few days after it returns to its cage.
Your quail has mites. All the quail that live in the enclosure should be taken out and put in a suitable sized box together. After all the quail are out of the enclosure, clean the enclosure thoroughly. Treat the quails by either giving them a good dust-bath, buying some mite powder or any other safe method that gets rid of quail mites.
Your quail is injured. This isn't some sort of illness but it is just as serious. You should remove the quail that is injured as soon as possible and keep it separated in its own enclosure until it is fully healed. If you are going to put the quail back in its flock after it has healed, observe the quail for a few days to make sure it gets along with the others.
Your quail is too hot. This can easily be treated by moving your quail to a cooler room, providing the quail with shade or taking the heat source away.

, Although taming fully-grown quail is hard, it can be done. Taming quail is handy if you ever need to grab them when necessary, take them to a veterinarian or play with them for a little while.


To tame your quail you have to offer them food from your hands, visit them often, be very gentle to them, etc.

, Quail can fly very high when frightened, so if your quail manages to escape it’s handy to clip the quail’s wings so that it cannot fly away from you.

, If you don't know the gender yet, here are some helpful ways to work this out:


Vent sexing is the most accurate way to know the gender of your quail. The male should have a bump and some white foam coming out whilst females will not.
Male quails usually have brighter feathers around their neck, head and back and are more aggressive than females. You can also tell the gender by looking at the breast.
Females sometimes have a loss of feathers due to mating and aren't as colourful as the male quail.
Males will crow now and then. For coturnix quail this is obvious but button females might also call, usually for chicks.

, When breeding your quails do not disturb them or take any eggs out of their cage. They'll need to make a clutch of eggs before any of the male or female quail lays on them and it takes up to about 21 days for the eggs to hatch.

You will have to have a lot of space to house the quail, you will have to spend a lot of money on feed, water and housing for the quail, and you will have to give up most of your time on the quail.


Make sure that the seasons favor you. Breed your quails during spring or summer. These are the seasons when your quails start to mate and nest. Keep in mind though, some quail breed year round whilst others mostly go broody during the spring and summer time.;
, Although quails do not take up much space, they will hatch out a large amount of chicks, and males cannot be housed together. If you're going to continue to breed your quail as a profession, at least three large cages in your back garden, shed or garage is a good starting point.


Each quail needs at least 1 square foot of floor space. Any less and your quails will not lay any eggs due to stress from confinement.

, Quails need to be in a peaceful, undisturbed area in order to lay eggs and start to breed. You should not have the following in your area:


High traffic
Predators (including pets)
Loud noises
Other birds or animals

, Provide lights for 13-16 hours per day, it will increase the quails egg production. Never keep the lights on all day and night; this will exhaust your quails, they need sleep too.

, Quails need to build nests before they hatch out chicks or lay eggs. Give them time and they will soon clutch together about five eggs.


Sometimes quail will lay eggs in peculiar spots or all around their cage rather than in their nest. They'll lay about 5-7 eggs and then clutch them together in their nest and sit on them. Both male and female will take turns sitting on them or sit on them together.
Consider adding a nesting box for the quail. You can make a nesting box out of plastic container, pots or small cardboard boxes as long as they have an entrance to them. The nesting box should be a bit bigger than the quail itself and the quail should be able to fit through the hole/entrance.

, It might be more easy to let the quail hen to hatch the chicks as she will do all the work for you and you will not have to cash out for an incubator. However, some quail don't make good parents and some are hard to get broody.

, Whether you are choosing the quails from your flock or from a store, choose the healthiest quail you can see/find. Healthy quail will be:


Lively, playing around, quite curious and looking cautious.
Eating, pecking at bits of food or any nearby bugs.
Drinking, not all of the time but you should at least see the quail drink occasionally.
Out in the open, quails that are huddled up in the corner are often sick or cold.

, Any younger and the quails are considered as chicks and will probably not be laying eggs yet.

, Five females is the maximum amount of quails to have with one male, but you will have to keep at least one male quail in each cage to fertilize the eggs.


Do not house more than one male together. They will compete for the females and kill each over. Separate the quails in order to keep them from fighting.

, A high quality feed will help your quails breed healthy chicks and can be bought from most pet shops and feed stores.

, They will soon start mating, nesting and sitting on eggs. The occasional check up is okay as long as you are calm and quiet.

, Do not touch or mess with the eggs unless necessary, the quail might discard them.


You may see eggs lying about separate, leave them, your quails are making a clutch before they sit on them. It will take 17-21 days or more for the eggs to hatch once your quail hen has started sitting on them.

, By the 17th day your quail chicks will be close to hatching.

, Other quails (especially males) will attack or peck at the chicks, causing serious injuries. Put them in a warm place with bedding, food and water. Consider placing a heat-lamp if the area you live in is quite cold, otherwise, the quail hen will keep her chicks warm naturally.


Consider keeping the male with the chicks and hen. If he seems like a good father and doesn't peck or trample on the quail you can keep him with the chicks and hen. He might also help the hen care for the chicks.

, See if they care for the chicks properly and make good natural parents. If they abandon the chicks, peck at them, trample on them, or are quite aggressive towards them, they might not be good parents. If they feed them, call to them, and sleep on top of them they are good parents.

, Feed this to your quail hen and chicks soon after hatching. Try purchasing a chick starter with around 28% of protein to ensure that your chicks will grow into strong and healthy quails.


Chick starter meant for chickens or turkeys should be crushed up into little crumbles so that the chicks can eat it without any trouble.

, Make sure the water is refilled daily and is always fresh, clean the water bowl once a week and make sure it is shallow enough for your chicks to have access to but won't be at the risk of drowning.


If you cannot acquire a shallow container to supply the water in, put some marbles, pebbles or something alike so that the chicks will not fall in and drown. You should also keep the water away from the heat source.

, There are many ways to determine the sex of a quail. If you're planning on selling your quail, buyers prefer ones that are sexed and it's easier to put a price on your quail. Some methods can be seen below:


Use vent sexing. This is the most accurate way to tell the sex of your quail. If you press lightly above the vent you should see a bump and some white foam coming out. If so your quail is a male, if not your quail is a female.
Look at the feathers of your quail. Males usually have brighter colours around their neck and head whilst females are usually plain in colour depending on the breed. You can also look at the breast of your quail, common breeds that are male will have a rusty colour.
Observe your quails behaviour. Males are usually more aggressive than females, and the dominant male will chase the other males or fight them.
Listen to your quail. Males such as the coturnix quail will crow now and then and females do not. But if you have button quail, females might also crow mainly to call for chicks.
Observe your quail during breeding season. Males will mount on top of the female and hold on to the females head with its beak when mating. And females might have a loss of feathers due to mating.

, By this time you will know which ones are males and which ones are females. Here are some tips on separating quails:


Keep all males separate to prevent fighting.
Keep quails in pairs so that they do not get lonely.
Try keeping all the quails together (unless they are males) to reduce the noise volume. Some quails will call for each over if separated.
Try not to add new quails to an old flock. They will get chased because some quails consider this as invading the flock. If you are going to do this, supervise them.

, Buying one with an egg-turner is recommended, but you can turn the eggs yourself. You can purchase an incubator from a ranch, feed or pet store.

, Wash your hands before touching them and be very careful, the eggs are very fragile. Never wash the eggs; you will remove the coating which protects them from bacteria. Bad eggs will have:


Dirt on them.
Cracks.
Weak or thin shells.

, The temperature should be set at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and the humidity should be set at 60%.

,, The eggs should be turned five times a day and you should stop turning the eggs 3 days before hatching.

, Some eggs hatch early whilst others hatch late but they should all hatch on the same day.


Do not interfere with hatching. Usually if a chick doesn't hatch it's for a reason. Also, if the eggs don't hatch 1-2 days after they were supposed to, discard of them.

, A brooder is a place where are raised in, a simple box makes a great brooder. The brooder should include a constant supply of fresh water and chick starter feed, bedding and a heat lamp.


Keep the brooder at 100℉ (38C) and lower the temperature by 5℉ (3C) each week until it reaches room temperature.

, Make sure that they are healthy and are being cared for properly. The signs of unwell chicks are:


Chicks huddling up or piling on top of each over, this indicates that they are cold.
Panting chicks, this means that the chicks are either thirsty or hot.
Chicks that will not eat or drink. Your chick may be sick, it’s best to contact a veterinarian.

, You can put them in a spacious pen or in a simple rodent cage. As long as your quails have 1 square foot of floor space each they will be happy.


You should also sex them and find out their gender. Males will fight if housed together and they should be kept in pairs or in groups of 2-5. To breed your new chicks, follow this article through again and see the breeding ratio above.

Figure out whether you're allowed and can keep quail first.,
Consider the purpose of your quail.,
Find out where you can purchase healthy quail in your area.,
Consider buying at least two quails.,
Set up the home of the quail before you bring them home.,
Make sure the quail you are choosing are healthy and happy.,
Observe the housing of the quail.,
Place the quails you have purchased in their home.",How to Choose a Quail," You might need a license to keep game birds in your home or the landlord might not appreciate you keeping some quail in your house. Think about your neighbours as well, male coturnix quails can be noisy at times and your neighbours might get annoyed.


While your on the topic, think about whether you can actually afford to keep quail in your home. Quail take up space, time, money and come with a lot of responsibility. On the bright side they are fairly easy to look after.;
, Whether you are raising the quail for eggs, meat, and breeding or as a simple pet, there are various breeds depending on which purpose you choose.


Coturnix quail are the best starter breed, as they are easy to care for. Also, jumbo coturnix lay big eggs.
Button quail make great pets but they lay little eggs that most people wouldn't consider worth eating due to the small size. Though they are great breeders and some have bright and colourful feathers that are great for show.
Bobwhite quail are a common kept quail breed and normally kept for breeding or meat. They are also fun birds to look after and can be tamed.

, You can normally buy quail from a breeder, online or possibly from a local pet shop.


Keep in mind that you should always purchase from a reliable breeder or pet shop. It’s also good to know how to tell the difference between healthy and unwell quail.

, Quails are social birds that will easily get lonely, which is why they are much happier when housed with a friend. Even if you are going to play with your quail often, they don't consider you as a friend or partner.

, Whilst quail have a large choice of housing such as rabbit hutches, rodent cages and bantam runs, they do have a few requirements, but after setting up the housing you can bring your quail home!


Each quail should have at least one square foot of floor space or more, depending how much you can or want to give them. Remember, the bigger the cage the happier the quails!
Place bedding in the quail's home. Most bedding materials are suitable to quail, but they do need hay or straw to make nests with.
Provide a water container and a feeder for your quail. Fill the feeder with a high-quality feed, and supply fresh and clean water ready for your quail to come home.
Place a few extra items in the housing for your quail such as hamster huts, plants and a sand tubs. After this, your quail is sure to be happy!

, If you are going to care for quail the last thing you want to do is go through the trouble of caring for an ill quail and trying to raise it back to health. Some tips on telling which quail is healthy and which quail is not can be seen below:


The quail shouldn't be huddled up. If it is so, this means that the quail is too cold or sick.
The quail should have clear and alert eyes. If the quails eyes are cloudy or dull, then the quail has something wrong with it.
The quail should be active. Quail are cautious and curious creatures that should also be quite afraid of you, unless tamed. The only time quail should be asleep is when it is night time, or when the room is very dark.
The quail shouldn't be panting. If this happens, this means that the quail is hot or is dehydrated.
The quail shouldn't be sluggish or slow. Unless the quail is sleeping in the night (or the room is dark) they should be moving at a normal pace and very awake.
The quail should have feathers on its back, neck and body. If the quail doesn't have feathers on its back, neck or body it means they are stressed or have been fighting. Keep in mind that if the quails are bald on their heads this doesn't mean they have been fighting or are stressed, it also means they have been mating which is mostly common during the mating season.
The quail should be free of mites. Mites are little black bugs that live on quails. They are usually seen on the head or under the wings. If the quails have mites it means they aren't cared for properly or the cage isn't cleaned out often.
The quail shouldn't be bleeding, injured or moving funnily. This means the breeder is obviously very bad at taking care of quail and doesn't pay attention to them very much. Also, you don’t want to buy an injured quail that moves funnily.

, The bedding, housing and feed and water bowl should be clean. The quail should also be fed a high-quality feed and the water should be clean and clear.

, Keep in mind that each quail needs at least one square foot of floor space, and males shouldn't be kept together due to fighting. They also need time to settle in, so if you don’t get any eggs from your hens and the quails chase each over now and then, this is all natural and should soon be over in about a week or two."

Look for preening behavior.,
Make sure your bird is bathing.,
Look for vigorous wing flapping.",How to Understand Your Bird's Body Language1," Birds are typically very clean creatures and they spend a lot of time cleaning, preening, and grooming their feathers. This is natural self-care behavior that is important for birds to do.While preening, birds straighten out their feathers by pulling them through their beaks.This allows them to pull out dislodged feathers, clean out pests and debris, and spread preening oil across their feathers. Preening oil is produced from a gland near a bird's tail and the bird spreads it around to all of its feathers. This oil helps protect the feathers.
If your bird has stopped preening, has ruffled feathers, and looks shabby, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. This could indicate that it is not well.;
, Bathing is an important part of feather maintenance for birds.If your bird stops bathing itself, that is a sign that it is no longer taking care of itself. This could signal depression, body pain, or lack of mobility.Your bird may simply take a quick bath in its water dish once in a while, so you may not catch it every time. However, you may notice water splashed all over the place in your bird's cage. This is a good indicator that your bird has taken a bath.

, Wing flapping can signal a lot of things, but one reason that birds do it is simply for the exercise. Birds in captivity still want to keep their wings in working condition, so flapping them around keeps the muscles conditioned to some degree.Your bird may also do this to get your attention or simply because it is happy.

Do not disturb your quail.",How to Build a Quail Habitat," The type of habitat you build will depend on how many quail you plan to keep, what sex they are, and the reasons you are keeping them. You will need to factor these things in when planning the size of your habitat, how much feeding space to provide, and so on.Quail are social birds, so your quail will be happiest and most comfortable if you keep them in groups.
To minimize fighting and aggression, plan on keeping no more than 1 male for every 4 females in the group. If you plan to keep only males, they should be housed in pairs.If you are planning to keep quail for breeding, you may wish to keep them in relatively small groups, e.g., one male and two or three females. Females can be kept in large groups, as long as there is sufficient space for all the birds (125 sq. cm, or about 20 sq. in, per bird). However, even a group of females will quickly establish a hierarchy or pecking order, so you will need to use caution when introducing new birds to the group once your flock is established.;
, Quail need plenty of space to exercise, hide, and eat. Since they can fly, your habitat will also need enough vertical space to accommodate the birds’ vertical flight instinct that can kick in if they are scared or startled.As a general rule of thumb, your enclosure should offer 125 sq. cm (about 20 sq. in) per bird.
Your quail habitat needs to be at least 30 cm (about 1 foot) high in order to accommodate vertical flight without causing injury to the quail. If you are keeping quail in order to produce eggs, you may need to keep your birds in a relatively small habitat (like a hutch or pen, rather than a shed or aviary). Quail may hide their eggs in the litter on the bottoms of their habitats, so eggs can be difficult to find in a larger enclosure or pen. However, you should still provide at least 125 sq. cm (about 20 sq. in) per bird., Quail need plenty of light in order to produce eggs and to reach sexual maturity. Plenty of sunlight can also promote the growth of any plants you wish to add to your quail habitat. During the fall and winter months, you may need to introduce supplemental lighting in order to maintain egg production and fertility.Japanese quail, one of the most popular types of domestic quail, must have 14-18 hours of light per day to maintain optimum fertility and egg production. If you are keeping your quail for meat production only, less light (e.g., about 8 hours per day) is needed.

, The necessary supplies for building a quail habitat will vary depending on the type of enclosure you plan to build, but at minimum you will need:7 mm (approximately .25 in) wire mesh to secure the sides of your habitat.
Appropriate floor cover. Quails do best in enclosures with solid floors covered in litter made of sand, soft wood shavings, or straw.
Potted plants, artificial plants, shrubs, cut conifer branches, or small hay bales to provide cover and hiding places.Simple nest boxes.
Sand for dust bathing.
Flexible roof material to prevent head injuries during vertical flight. A soft net can be stretched just below the roof of the quail hutch or run in order to minimize the risk of injury., This can be as simple as converting a rabbit hutch, which should be well ventilated and big enough to house about 6 quail (750 sq. cm, or about 300 sq. in). If you are planning to keep a larger number of quail, you will need a bigger pen or aviary.The housing area for the quail should be on or near the ground. Quail like to forage or sleep on the ground. However, unless you are able to install wire mesh under the house or provide a solid floor under the house (like concrete), you may need to raise the house off the ground slightly in order to keep rats and other pests from burrowing in.
If you must raise the house off the ground, try to raise it no more than 10 cm (about 4 inches), and provide a shallow ramp that the quail can use to enter and exit.
Make sure the shelter is roofed so that the quail will have shelter from the sun and the elements.

, Your quail will be happiest if they are able to spend time roaming and foraging. If you house your quail in cages or a small hutch, consider attaching a flight pen or run to their shelter. A run is an enclosed outdoor area where your birds can walk around or (with a tall enough roof) fly.There are no particular size restrictions on the run or flight pen, although it should be larger than their shelter or hutch. It should be tall enough to allow the birds to fly, and preferably tall enough for you to enter in order to maintain the habitat and the birds. There should also be sufficient space for the quail to run around, and areas for hiding.
Create a frame for your run or flight pen out of lumber or PVC piping. Try one of the construction methods described here: http://quailranch-ok.com/flight_pen_design.html or here: http://www.poultry.msstate.edu/pdf/extension/birg_flight_pen.pdf

Consider running mesh under the run or installing a concrete floor to prevent predators from digging under.
Cover the sides of the run with fine (7 mm or .25 in) wire mesh.
Roof the run with soft bird netting.
Make sure there is cover in the run. Cover could include elevated logs, cut conifer branches, potted plants, or shrubs.

, Quail need to dust bathe regularly. They prefer fine particles, like sand (as opposed to sawdust). Set aside an area of your quail hutch or run for sand bathing., Food and water may be provided in troughs or in individual stations. Be sure to provide plenty of eating and drinking space for each bird, so that they do not have to compete for food and water.Quail should have at least 1.25-2.5 cm (about 0.5-1 in) of feeding space per bird, in order to reduce aggression and stress during feeding.
Quail need plenty of fresh water. Your habitat should provide .6 cm (about .25 in) of water trough space per bird. If you plan to offer water via cups or water nipples, your habitat should have 1 watering cup or nipple drinker available for every 5 birds.
To prevent food waste, don’t overfill your food troughs.
Make sure food and water stations are easy for you to access so that you can change, refill, and clean them easily.
Give your quail foraging opportunities by scattering grain in their floor litter, hiding it in cored fruits or vegetables, or mixing it in with scraps of paper in their feed troughs., Quail like to have plenty of litter to poke around in. Cover the floor with sand, softwood, or straw. Straw can also double as nesting material.


If your main quail home has a wire floor, make sure the quail have access to a solid floor with a soft litter cover, either in their run or as part of their pen/hutch. Spending too much time on wire can hurt their feet. One possible solution is to install a solid floor in a corner of their hutch and cover it with soft litter.
Twigs, straw, feathers, and leaf litter can add extra interest to their floor litter and provide nesting material.

, Keep in mind that your quail may prefer to simply nest under a sheltering shrub or branch. However, the option of nest boxes should be available.A nest box is typically a simple, open-fronted wooden box or cubby-hole.
Quail feel safest in covered nest boxes, although they show a preference for nest box covers with slits rather than solid covers. Place nest boxes in the corners of your quail hutch or pen, and line them with hay, chaff, or corn husks., Quail droppings will build up quickly, so you will need to clean out their habitat on a regular basis.If your quail live in a hutch with a wire floor, you can easily collect and clean up the droppings by placing newspapers or shallow containers (like litter trays) underneath the hutch. If you wish, you can use the collected droppings for fertilizer.
If you keep your quail in a deep litter habitat, you may only need to clean the litter once every couple of weeks., How much your quail will need depends on how many quail you have, how mature they are, and what breed they are. Adult Japanese quail, for example, eat approximately 14-18 g (.5-.63 oz) of feed per day.If you are unable to get feed specifically formulated for quail, you can give your quail turkey or game bird feed supplemented with calcium. Add a little shell grit or ground limestone to their feed to provide a calcium boost.Store the food you plan to feed the quail in a dry, cool, well-sealed container. Do not give your quail food that is more than 8 weeks old.

, Clean water troughs and containers daily to prevent illness. Wash water containers with hot water and a mild detergent, and rinse thoroughly before refilling with fresh water.If you have chicks, fill the water troughs with clean pebbles or marbles to prevent drowning., Regularly examine the quail habitat for damage. Look for rotting wood or holes in the wire or net that could allow predators in (or quail out).

, You may want to do an overall count of your quail daily, weekly or monthly. This is so you know that they’re all there and that the quail are living healthy lives in the habitat.

, Quail are easily startled, and excessive stress or handling can kill them. Don’t pick up or handle your quail any more than necessary, and enter their habitat only as much as you need to."

Entice your bird with a treat.,
Position your hand like a perch.,
Encourage your bird to step onto your finger.,

Remove your bird from his cage.,
Give your bird time to acclimate to being outside his cage.,
Have your bird step up on your finger in the bird-proof room.,
Place your bird back in his cage.",How to Tame a Bird," Your bird will probably need about two weeks to adjust to his new environment before you can begin taming him. Some birds will take longer, and some will need less time to acclimate. Place your bird’s cage in a busy room. Intuitively, a quiet room may seem ideal. However, housing your bird in a busy room will allow him to acclimate to, and become more comfortable with, human interaction and activity.Do not place your bird’s cage in the kitchen. Fumes released from nonstick appliances are toxic and potentially fatal to birds.
You will know when your bird feels secure in his new environment when he does not flutter his wings when you approach him. If he sits frozen on his perch, he is not yet comfortable with you or his new environment.;
, An important part of gaining your bird’s trust is making him feel comfortable and safe when you are around. You can do this by talking to him in a soothing voice.Of course, what you talk about is not important—he just needs to know that you are a calm and reassuring presence in his environment.


Talk to him throughout the day,and especially when you change out his food and water.

, Birds are naturally skittish animals.Therefore, any sudden movements can frighten your bird. Slow and gentle movements will reassure your bird that you are not a threat.


When you approach your bird, you should be slightly above his eye level. If you are too high above his eye level, you may scare him. Being too far below his eye level would make you appear submissive to him.It may be helpful to use a soothing voice as you approach him to make him feel even more at ease with your presence.

, Hand taming is a common way of taming birds. However, due to his skittish nature, your bird may be very wary of your hand. Moreover, birds who come from pet stores may associate hands with grabbing and chasing,making them even more wary of human handling.


Place your hand where he can easily see it.To reduce his anxiety, talk to him in a soothing voice while you hold your hand still.
Hold your hand near his cage for 10 to 15 minutes (or as long as you can hold your hand up), two to three times a day, for four to seven days.You may want to place your hand gently on the outside of his cage.
Getting your bird to be comfortable with your hand will take time and patience.

, When your bird no longer seems flustered by your hand’s presence outside of his cage, acclimate him to your hand when it is inside of his cage. It is very important that you place your hand in his cage slowly and without sudden movements.You should also avoid making eye contact with your bird when you put your hand inside his cage—direct eye contact may appear threatening to him.At this stage, do not attempt to touch your bird when you have your hand in his cage.
Practically speaking, you will need to place your hand inside your bird’s cage each morning when you change his food and water. By making a routine out of slowly reaching into his cage each morning, your bird should become increasingly more comfortable with your hand.It may take your bird anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to feel comfortable with your hand inside his cage.Continue talking to your bird in a soothing tone when your hand is inside his cage.

, If your bird is still not comfortable with your hand inside his cage, you may need to move things along by holding a treat in your hand. Millet spray is a very popular treat for birds. Dark and leafy greens, such as spinach, are another good treat to use.Whichever treat you use, make sure that it is one your bird is already familiar with and enjoys eating.Hold the treat in your hand and hold your hand still. Depending on how skittish your bird is, it may take several tries before he feels comfortable enough to get close to your hand and eat the treat.Hold a treat in your hand three to five times each day,and each time you change your bird’s food and water. Eventually, your bird will begin to anticipate the daily treat.Slowly move your hand closer and closer to your bird when holding the treat.With the help of the daily treats, your bird will become comfortable with your hand inside his cage.

, With your hand in your bird’s cage, create a perch with your hand by holding your index finger out and folding your other fingers in towards your palm.In a slow and non-threatening manner, move your hand towards your bird and position your index finger below his breast line, which is just above his feet.If you are afraid of getting bitten, you could cover your hand with a small towel or wear gloves. However, covering your hand will defeat the purpose of getting your bird comfortable with your hand. In addition, your bird may be scared of the gloves or towel., With your finger below your bird’s breast line, gently push up on his body to encourage him to step on to your finger.Do not be surprised if your bird jumps away and flies to another part of his cage. If he does this, do not chase him around his cage— remove your hand and try again later, or simply leave your hand in his cage until he calms down and is ready to approach your hand again.If your birds needs a little extra encouragement, hold a treat in your other hand. Hold it far enough away that he would have to jump onto your finger to reach it.You can try this if the cage door is wide enough for both of your hands to fit through.
If you would like, you can give your bird a verbal command (“Step up” or “Up”) when you push up on his body. Say the command each time you want him to step up onto your finger.Hold your hand still when your bird steps onto your finger., Give your bird a treat each time he steps onto your finger, even if only for a brief moment. Be aware that he may jump on and off your finger,or only feel comfortable placing one foot on your finger.Reward him with any progress he makes with stepping onto your finger.


Keep your practice sessions short: 10 to 15 minutes, two to three times a day.Along with an edible treat, you can also give your bird verbal praise when he steps up onto your finger.

, Teaching your bird to step onto your finger when he outside his cage is an important part of taming him. A bird-proof room is one in which your bird will feel safe and secure. To prepare the room, close the windows and blinds. Also, clear the room of pets and other hazards, such as blowing fans.Ideally, the room should have a door that you can lock so others cannot come in during your training sessions.Make sure the room is lit, tidy and clean.A bathroom is a common choice for a bird-proof room.

, Your bird’s cage is his comfort zone. Taking him out of his comfort zone may be a frightening experience for him—you do not want to make the experience more frightening by having to navigate through various perches and toys. Take the time to clear the exit path of any obstacles that could hamper your ability to take your bird out of his cage., With your bird perched on your finger in his cage, slowly move your hand backward to bring your bird out. Do not be surprised if he flies off your finger as you try to take him out—he may not be ready to leave the safety of his cage.If he does this, do not chase him around his cage.


If the cage door is large enough, reach in with your other hand and cup that hand behind your bird. Your other hand would serve as a shield to keep your bird from jumping off your finger, but would not actually be touching him.Do not force him out of his cage. Remember to be patient with him. It may take several days’ worth of training sessions before he is comfortable with being moved outside his cage.

, Your bird may immediately want to jump onto the outside of his cage.Once again, do not chase him with your finger if he does this. Patiently wait until he has settled down before having him step onto your finger again.


If you have not had your bird’s wings trimmed or clipped, he may fly away from you as you get him out of his cage. Slowly and gently approach him to retrieve him, making sure to talk to him in a calm and reassuring voice.Reward your bird with a treat when he stays perched on your finger.Keep your daily practice sessions short (10 to 15 minutes)., When your bird is comfortable with being outside his cage, walk to the bird-proof room with your back turned to his cage.When in the room, sit on the floor or on a bed.If he hops off your finger, have him step back onto it again.


To challenge your bird, use both hands as perches. With your bird perched on the index finger of one hand, use the index finger of your other hand to gently press below your bird’s breast line and get him to step up. Alternating between hands, move your finger perches higher and higher to mimic the climbing of a ladder.Reward your bird with a treat each time that he steps onto your finger.Practice with your bird in the bird-proof room for 15 to 20 minutes, one to times a day., After each training session outside the cage, slowly walk him back to his cage and place him back inside. Although he may want to fly off your hand as soon as he's back inside the cage, you should try to place him back on one of his perches. To do this, position your finger such that the perch is in front of your bird and higher than your hand.


When he steps onto the perch, give the verbal command to “step down.” Although he is stepping up onto the perch, this action is still considered to be stepping down from your finger.Close the cage door when your bird is comfortably situated in his cage.

Notice singing or whistling.,
Pay attention to soft chattering or talking.,
Identify beak grinding.",How to Understand Your Bird's Body Language2," If your bird is singing and whistling a lot that is a good sign, as this is the behavior of a bird that is generally content and healthy. A bird that is singing or whistling a lot is likely very happy.Try singing or whistling along with your bird. This can be a great bonding activity for you.

, A bird that is content is likely to chatter or talk a lot. In fact, if you spend time with them, they are likely to increase this chatter when you come around.If you pay attention to the sounds that your bird makes on a daily basis, you will be able to identify the difference between the contented chatter or talking and unusual sounds that signal other things.

, Beak grinding is a perfectly normal behavior in which a bird slides its top and bottom beak against one another. It is usually a sign of contentment. It may be done at any time of day but is usually done when the bird is settling down for the night.It is thought that beak grinding is done to keep the bird's beak in good condition.

"
Look for restlessness.,
Notice signs that your bird has spotted danger.,
Identify signs of aggression.",How to Understand Your Bird's Body Language3," If the bird is jumping from one perch to another continuously then your bird is restless. You should immediately pay attention because something is bothering your bird and it is trying to communicate with you. Birds also tend to show this behavior when they are seeking attention or just want to come out of the cage.


If this behavior is accompanied by clicks and vocalization, such as loud chattering, more often than not, your bird wants to play with you and is demanding your attention., If the bird remains still and its feathers are tightly packed close to the body, your bird has spotted some danger. It is trying to remain as still as possible to avoid being spotted. Birds have a lot of natural enemies and they exhibit this behavior to escape unwanted attention.


Birds tend to fix their eyes on the source of the danger. Watch the bird closely. It is trying to warn you and point you to the source of the threat.
Do not pick or move your bird while it is exhibiting these behaviors. If your bird is looking outside the window, close the window blinds and then go to your bird to comfort it.
Your bird could feel threatened by anything, including a new couch or a new lamp in your living room. To find out if your bird associates danger with a new article in the room, walk towards the article and then stay there for a minute. Touch the new article and be relaxed. Birds will quickly learn there is no reason to be worried.

, Your bird may be trying to show its dominance if it raises its head and perches above your eye level. It may also begin to ""growl"" to show its aggression.This behavior may occur if your bird feels threatened or protective due to having strangers in the room or a person nearby that your bird is not fond of.

Look for tail bobbing without previous exercise.,
Pay attention to panting.,
Notice changes in behavior.,
Pay attention to a lack of vocalization.",How to Understand Your Bird's Body Language4," Tail bobbing after exercise may be done while the bird is trying to catch its breath. However, if the bird is doing this behavior without having done any exercise, that can signal respiratory problems.If your bird is bobbing its tail without having done any exercise, have it seen by a veterinarian.

, Panting in birds can signal a variety of things, including that they are thirsty, that they have a respiratory infection, or that they just exercised. Make sure your bird has access to water immediately and monitor the panting. It it stops, then it was likely caused by physical exertion.If your bird likes to mimic sounds, panting can simply be a sound that they have heard that they are repeating. However, if your bird has had no way of hearing that sound, it is likely not a mimicked sound.

, Birds are generally sick for a week or two before they actually show signs of sickness. Birds tend to mask their sickness in the wild to avoid being spotted by predators and pet birds are nonetheless. Early diagnosis is the key to successful treatment. Rush your bird to an Avian Vet immediately.


Make sure you check your bird’s eating habits and food intake regularly. Reduced appetite is one of the first signs of a sick bird.
Never ignore it if your bird shows signs of sickness. There is no time to procrastinate. Get your bird veterinary care immediately.

, If your bird is usually very vocal but has not been singing or chattering lately, then you should have it checked out by a veterinarian. A lack of singing or chattering can be a sign that your bird it not feeling well."

Understand you shouldn't always pet every bird.,
Approach the bird calmly before petting it.,
Assess the bird's body language and make sure it's comfortable.",How to Pet a Bird1," Birds are very individual, unique creatures - some really enjoy being petted by anyone and everyone, while some others won't be willing to accept touch even from their owner.

If you're trying to pet a bird you don't own, understand that it may need to get to know you before it becomes comfortable with letting you pet it. It may be better to visit with the bird and gain its trust before attempting to physically touch it at all.
If you do own a bird, understand that not every bird will eventually warm up to petting. Some just do not enjoy it, instead preferring their personal space. If you find this to be the case, you should not try to force it to enjoy being pet. Instead, it's much better to try and find other ways to bond with your bird, such as teaching it tricks or letting it perch near you while you work.;
, Make sure it's aware you are there and sees your approach. Speak to the bird for a bit before reaching out to it; don't just grab for the poor thing. Make sure it's warmed up to your presence first and is aware of what you're doing, especially when you first try petting the bird for the first time or two., Birds have a wide array of communications, but a lot of it is nonverbal, so it's important to read any cues you're getting.

Is the bird extremely stiff and staring at you as you approach? Is it trying to move or lean away from you, or pushing you away? Is it attempting to bite you? All of these are more or less obvious signs the bird is uncomfortable with what you're doing, and you should stop.
Is the bird turning its head a bit, or even bowing its head on your approach? Is it closing its eyes? Is it ruffling or fluffing up its feathers a bit? These are signs that the bird is relaxed, trusting, and comfortable with what you're doing. Which is good!

Learn your bird's body language.,
Give your bird treats.,
Let your bird out of the cage.",How to Gain Your Bird's Trust1," Birds are social creatures that need to spend time with you or other birds.

By spending as much time as you can with your bird you will help it to relax and feel that it can trust you.Try reading a book or some other calm or quiet activity near your birds cage.
Gently and quietly speak to your bird to allow it to get used to your voice.
Birds need social interaction to be happy.;
, Even though some birds can mimic human speech it will communicate through their body language. Learning how your bird communicates with its movements will help you realize when your bird is feeling comfortable and when it's nervous. If your bird is showing signs of being nervous, take a break and try bonding some other time.

Birds may lower their head, tucking it in. This is usually a sign it are comfortable and want you to give it a head scratch.

, Food can be a great reward for good behavior and a way to build trust. If you bird is being brave or showing good behavior, try giving it a treat to make it feel even more comfortable around you. Try to find out which foods your bird likes the most. Offer many treats and see what it enjoy.
Birds should eat fruit, vegetables and seeds.

, Once your bird has had some time to become comfortable in your home or in a new environment you can try to let it out of their cage. Letting it out of the cage can help it feel more comfortable in your home and around you, building the amount of trust it feels.Hold some food in your hand near the open cage door.

House both birds in separate cages.For a gradual introduction, you should keep the birds in different cages.,
Look for signs of stress.,
Make brief introductions in a neutral room.In other words, if your bird lives in its cage in the living room, bring it into the basement or another room to meet its new friend for the first time.,
Let the birds play in a common area when they’re comfortable.Let both birds out of their cages in the common, neutral room and let them interact.,
Always greet your original bird first.When entering the room with the new and original bird, you should take both out of their cages for a short time so they can look around the neutral room and observe the other bird.,
Remain present when introducing the birds.,
Stay aware of potential problems.Keep an eye out for conflict between the birds.,
Do not expect the birds to act the same.,
Don’t force a relationship.",How to Introduce Two Birds to Each Other1," You can try placing the cages near each other, but if either bird seems stressed, place them at a greater distance.;
, If either bird experiences stress, you should try to minimize it. Signs of stress include picking at feathers or skin, squawking or vocalizing loudly, and pecking or flapping its wings aggressively.If you see any behavioral abnormalities, separate the birds and take them back to their respective rooms.

, Keep these initial introductions down to ten minutes or so. Place the cages in the same room for about ten minutes or so, then remove them to their separate rooms. Ensure the new bird has ended its quarantine period before introducing it to your original bird.

, You could provide a playstand for the birds to hop and fly around on.

, However, to ensure your original bird doesn’t feel that it’s being supplanted, take it out first. If you want to give your birds treats, give one to the original bird first, then give one to the new bird.

, Do not put two new birds together and leave the room, even if they are in separate cages. This could cause undue stress for both birds.

, Biting, screaming, squawking, or other negative behaviors should be dealt with by placing both birds back in their cages for a time-out. If your bird scratches or claws at its own feathers or skin, it might be appropriate to separate it from the other bird.

, All birds have unique personalities and temperaments.Certain actions or sounds might trigger one bird but not the other. For example, one bird might tire quickly of playing with another, and need to be put back in its own cage. Stay conscious of differences in personality between the two different birds when deciding how to treat them.

, Some birds get along great together. Others take time but will eventually warm to one another. Other birds will never get along well together. Recognize when birds do not get along and respect their wishes by not placing them together."

Get the bird while it is still young or buy a bird that has had some socializing with humans.Call your local wildlife rescue organization if you find an orphaned bird in the wild.;
, Consider the size of the bird. Pick a bird that you can carry comfortably. Make sure there is room in your home for a cage that is much bigger than your bird.Also assess how much time you can give your bird. Some birds require much more one-on-one time with their humans.

, Research which birds get along with others if you live with other people or have other pets. Find a bird that is a good size for children to handle if you have children. Some species, like lovebirds, may become overprotective of you after bonding and will not share you., Keep your bird healthy by trimming its nails. Use clippers made for birds, because scissors can cause injuries if not used properly. Trimming your bird’s nails will prevent them from becoming too sharp or uncomfortable when you cuddle., Buy a cage that is large enough for your bird to fly, climb, and jump. Get a cage that is wide enough for your bird to stretch its wings.

In return, it will be friendlier and more affectionate.Start by teaching your bird to step onto and off of your finger by luring it with treats.
Next, train your bird to ladder (step up from the finger of one hand to the finger of another).
Some birds can be trained to talk or imitate sounds.
Snuggly birds may enjoy training to climb in and out of your pockets and sleeves.

, Give your bird healthy treats, like fruits and vegetables and eat your own portion of the same food when your bird does. Or sit down for a meal with your bird. As flock animals, birds associate sharing food and meals as friendly, social behavior. Cuddle your bird before and after the meal so it associates mealtime with cuddling.Only feed your bird foods that it can tolerate at mealtimes.

, Give your bird plenty of time out of its cage. Supervise your bird when it’s not in the cage so it stays safe. Provide it with perches in areas where it’s allowed to fly and roam.

This is also essential for your bird’s health.

, Keep your bird happy with praise. Praise it for cuddling and being affectionate. Give it treats and cuddle it to reward good behavior. Focus on rewarding good behavior instead of punishing your bird for behaving badly.Don’t withhold affection, raise your voice, or punish your bird if your bird does something wrong. Doing these things can make your bird aggressive instead of cuddly.

Don't pet below the bird's neck.,
Start by lightly touching or petting the bird's beak.,
Pet towards the beak, not the tail.,
Gradually shift your touch to the sides of the bird's head.,
When the bird seems relaxed and more used to petting, try petting the back of its head and neck.,
Be patient.",How to Pet a Bird2," This is the golden rule. Many inexperienced bird owners don't realize that a lot of bird species, especially certain breeds of parrots, consider touch below the neck to be a kind of breeding ritual. As a result, frequently petting a bird around its back, wings, or tail can lead to all kinds of behavioural problems later on.

While this isn't the case for every bird, they also tend to prefer being petted on the head and neck more than anything anyway, because those are the only spots they can't reach by themselves. So, it's generally better to just stay above the neck. Everyone is happier that way.

, This will help it to get used to you, and works as a good starting point. Be sure to be very gentle, especially when the bird is just starting to experience petting., Unlike most pets, it's generally agreed that birds prefer being petted against the natural direction of their feathers, rather than from the head towards the tail. This is good to keep in mind., You can try to gently rub the skin just behind the its beak and the sides of its head, if it still seems relaxed and comfortable. Birds also tend to enjoy being petted around their ears. (Take care around the eyes, though.), Birds also tend to enjoy being scratched under their beaks. Again, though, don't go lower than the neck if possible, in order to keep the bird comfortable., Most birds require some time to get to know and trust a person before they will allow petting or other forms of affection. However, once you've gained a bird's trust, they prove to be exceptionally loyal. Be very gentle and very patient, and it's very likely you'll get there soon enough."

Let the bird sit on your hand.,
Bring your other hand up to the bird.,
Reward the bird for stepping up.,
Practice often.",How to Gain Your Bird's Trust2," The first step when teaching your bird the step-up command is letting it out of the cage and having it sit on a hand. After it sits on your hand you will be able to use your other hand to start teaching it how to step up.Once your bird steps out of the cage, offer your hand to it as a platform.
Move slowly and make sure your bird stays comfortable.

, The aim of the step up command is to have your bird step from one hand to the other. To do this you will need to bring your other hand up to the bird, offering a new platform for it to move up to. Keep some of the following tips in mind as you work with your bird:If your bird bites, move your hand in from underneath the bird.
Bring your hand up to the area just above where your bird's legs meet its body.
Keep your hand flat and level.

, Whenever your bird steps up successfully you can offer it a reward. Giving your bird a tasty treat will help it understand that stepping up onto your other hand will result in rewards. Always offer a reward when training your bird to step-up in order to get the best results.Try to give your bird their favorite treat as a reward.
Many birds love fresh vegetables, fruits, or seeds.

, Without enough training your bird may forget the step-up command or never properly learn it in the first place. Whenever your bird is feeling comfortable you should try working with it, spending time with it, and reinforcing the step-up command to build even more trust."

Avoid forcing your bird into doing something.,
Don't hit or yell at your bird.,
Avoid tricking your bird.,
Take a break if your bird is upset.",How to Gain Your Bird's Trust3," Pet birds have their own will and you will need to have patience and work with it. Never force your bird into doing anything that it seems uncomfortable or upset doing. Forcing your bird will only cause distrust and fear to develop between you.Forcing your bird into doing something can result in you being bitten.

, No matter how frustrated you may feel with your bird you can never hit or yell at it. Birds will absolutely not respond to hitting or yelling and doing so will only destroy any sense of trust in your relationship. Always be kind and patient when working with your bird in order to maintain trust., In order to maintain trust between you and your pet bird you will need to always be “honest” with it. Tricking it into thinking it is about to do one thing and then having it do another can destroy trust. Always keep your commands consistent and clear when engaging with your bird., Spending time with your pet bird can be a lot of fun for both of you. However, your bird might get tired or cranky for any number of reasons. If your bird starts to display signs of discomfort or annoyance it should return their cage immediately. Give it some time to rest in their cage before resuming any direct interaction again."

Ensure your birds are of different genders.,
Stay in the room with both birds when first introducing them to each other.,
Gradually introduce the birds to each other.Place the birds in two separate cages.,
Look for signs that either bird is stressed.,
Put the birds together in a new cage.,
Stop treating the birds as pets.If you treating the birds as pets and show affection to one or both of them, they might become jealous of each other.",How to Introduce Two Birds to Each Other2," Within a given species, larger birds are generally male and smaller birds are female. If your birds are of the same size, or if you are unsure of your bird’s gender, consult a veterinarian.

, The first time you introduce the birds, you should plan on staying present with both for at least one day. This applies whether you choose to put both birds together in one cage from the start or to introduce them to each other slowly. Keep two bird nets and a pair of gloves on hand to prepare for the possibility that you’ll need to separate them., Hang the cages next to one another. After a period of time, they will become comfortable with one another. How long it takes them to become used to one another depends on the birds. Since all birds are different, with unique personalities, likes, and dislikes, the rate at which they become comfortable with one another will vary.

, If your bird is stressed due to close proximity to another bird, it might pick its feathers or skin, lose weight or lose its appetite, drink and urinate excessively, peck people who handle it, squawk noisily, or pace back and forth on its perch.Look for these and other behavioral abnormalities particular to your bird in order to determine if it is stressed. Introduce the mates to each other when their stress levels have subsided.


If the birds show signs of stress, place the cages further apart from each other, rather than directly next to one another.

, If you do not want to introduce the birds to each other gradually, you can simply place them together in one cage as soon as the new bird has ended its quarantine period. Place both birds in a flight cage which both are unfamiliar with.The confusion of being thrust into a new environment with another bird will eliminate the sense of territoriality which might accompany a bird being introduced to a cage which another bird already identified as its home.

, To ensure a harmonious mating, act in a disinterested way toward your birds. Feed and water them regularly as before, but let their interactions replace the stimulation you would normally provide.


Do not hand the birds treats directly. If you want to give one or both of them treats, leave the treat on the floor or on a perch of the cage.
Do interact with them in any way, including by talking to them or taking them out to teach them tricks.
If other people in your household are also attached to the birds, they should stop seeing them as well.

"

Analyze your bird’s personality.,
Tell your bird it will soon get a new friend.Say to your bird in an enthusiastic tone, “Soon you will get a new friend,” or “Are you excited to meet another bird?” You can tell your bird of the impending introduction a few days or a few hours before the introduction.,
Permit your bird to see your preparations.Introducing two birds to each other often means introducing new equipment into the mix.,
Place a substitute in the new bird’s cage.To help your bird understand that it will soon have a new friend, you should add a stand-in for the new bird to the new cage before the bird arrives.",How to Introduce Two Birds to Each Other3," If you know your bird does not play well with other birds, do not introduce your bird to others. One or the other of the birds could get hurt. You could get hurt too if your bird is introduced to another while sitting on your arm or shoulder., While birds might not understand English (or any other language), they will recognize when something big is about to happen. Keeping your bird informed of situations that concern them is as important as it would be with any other member of your family.

, If you are moving a new cage into the house, for instance, let your bird see it. You can draw your bird’s attention to the cage by commenting, “This is where the new bird’s cage will be,” or something along those lines. You should let your bird see the new cage a few weeks before the new bird arrives., For instance, you could place a stuffed animal on the perch in the cage, or lay a sock similar in color to the bird you’ll soon be introducing to your existing bird over the perch.

"
"
Minimize disruptions to your bird’s schedule and lifestyle wherever possible.,
Respect your original bird’s boundaries.,
Don’t overwhelm your bird with many new experiences.",How to Introduce Two Birds to Each Other4," For instance, do not introduce a new bird to your bird during the time that your bird would normally be taking a bath or having a meal. If you need to move your bird’s cage in order to make room for the new bird, do so well in advance of the new bird’s arrival., For instance, do not give your old bird’s cage to the new bird without repainting it or altering its appearance significantly. If you do not, the bird that used to live in it will be jealous and could cause conflict. Similarly, do not place a new bird’s cage right next to your original bird’s cage if it makes your original bird uncomfortable.

, For instance, if you decide to purchase a new cage for your original bird at the same time that you purchase a new bird (and cage), keep the new bird out of view until your original bird has acclimated to the new cage. Depending on the bird, it may take a few days to a full week.

Identify birds which might need to be quarantined.,
Take your new bird to the vet.,
Keep your new bird in quarantine.",How to Introduce Two Birds to Each Other5," If introducing a new bird to your bird who has not received shots or been examined for potential illnesses, your bird could get sick. Birds that have come from closed aviaries do not need to be quarantined. Similarly, birds which have been check by a vet before leaving a reputable bird or pet shop do not need to be quarantined. For all other birds, take them to a vet and follow your vet’s quarantine instructions in order to ensure the new bird does not introduce any illnesses to your original bird., Find a vet who is familiar with avian illnesses and can provide directions on how long to quarantine your new bird. Use the Association of Avian Veterinarians database (http://www.aav.org/search/custom.asp?id=1803) to find a bird vet near you.

, Quarantine requires keeping a new bird whose health status you do not know away from a bird that you know to be healthy. Quarantine periods last from 30 to 90 days, depending on the bird.Before introducing two birds to each other, ensure both have seen a vet recently. If one has not, quarantine it in a separate cage and room.

Pigs are very social, so you need to be able to spend time interacting with the pig, and you need to be able to assert yourself as the leader or else you'll end up with a spoiled, pushy and possibly aggressive pig, which could be dangerous for children. Consider getting two pigs so that they can keep each other company, as well.Remember that pigs are very smart and curious. Once they learn how to do something (pull up the carpet, open the fence door, and so on) they won't forget, and you need to stay one step ahead of them. They can also be very sneaky, not unlike a toddler who'll try to manipulate you to get their way.It's important to keep them preoccupied and stimulated, or else they can be destructive when bored.Pigs should have an area outside where they can exercise their rooting instinct.
Consider the lifespan of a pig and the associated costs. Pigs can live up to 20 years, and they will need food, regular vaccinations, and hoof and tusk trims, in addition to being spayed or neutered. If you move, will you be able to bring the pig with you?

, A piglet from a pet store or farm might seem cute, but it might also turn into an unhealthy and unsocialized nightmare. Visit the breeder's facility and ask to see the parents of the prospective piglet (the sire and the dam) so you can judge their temperaments and know what to expect with yours., Pigs, like most animals, enjoy interaction with their 'person' and it is not unusual to see a pig lying down for a tummy tickle.

,,, This will minimize the extent and severity of rooting.

, Never feed your pig pig feed intended for a slaughter pig or other farm animals.

, Piglets burrow into a deep litter of hay to stay warm. An adult pig will be satisfied with wood shavings (not sawdust).

Be prepared to spend time with the pig.",How to Have a Pot Bellied Pig for a Pet," Pigs have special needs and characteristics that are very different from dogs or cats.;
, Contrary to some understandings, these pigs are not small. Nor are they easily transportable. Most of all, they do not belong in apartments. They can be contrary, or even aggressive, if you don't know how to handle them well. And although they form close bonds with humans and love to snuggle, they get bored easily, which can result in them wreaking havoc if you leave them home alone or fail to interact with them sufficiently. This can result in knocked-over trash, chewed household objects, etc. Do you have the willingness to train and time to play with and interact with your pig?


Pigs will do anything for food, including learning how to open food cupboards and even the refrigerator.
Pigs need a safe indoor and outdoor environment.

, Potbelly pig personalities are complex. You need a good understanding of their behavior and habits before getting one. Potbelly pigs are herd animals. They have a strong pecking order. If they are spoiled, they often become territorial, and can be aggressive towards humans who don't form part of their herd, especially house guests. Pigs have an instinctual urge to be ""top hog,"" which includes defending their territory. Those that receive lots of firm but subtle, daily discipline, and setting boundaries in the home, do not tend to exhibit this behavior (although anything is possible, after all, you're not a pig and it's not a human).


Potbelly pigs must be taught to respect humans from the outset. They must be trained to respect the word ""no"".
Pigs can learn to scream. This will be used to wake the owner for breakfast, beg for food, and raid pantries.
Potbelly pigs can be demanding, overly sensitive, or even neurotic. They can quickly be very jealous of other pets if not socialized properly.
Pigs will often pout if challenged by humans.

, In addition, they need to eat a fair amount. Can you handle the increasing size of the pig and its dietary needs? Too many pot bellied pigs are discarded after people think the ""cute phase"" has passed, which happens all too quickly. This is a commitment for the life of the pig.

, The pig will need room to run, play, and forage. It will also need an area to bathe and wallow. If you don't have an outdoor area to keep it, do not get one.

, Find reputable breeders through calling a national or local association responsible for pig breeding.

, Pigs are not good pets if left home alone, with no mental stimulation. They are very intelligent and trainable. First, a pig must be taught that it can trust its owner. Firm, gentle discipline works well. Because of their love for food, positive reinforcement is effective. Negative physical reinforcement is not. Pigs have a great memory, and respond well to commands. They are easily housebroken and can learn to do amazing things when properly taught.


Get a proper trainer for the pig if you don't know what to do yourself.

, You'll need to provide sufficient enrichment opportunities. Owing to the potbelly pig's food obsession, it can be aggressive with young children, in its eternal quest for treats. However, with the right kind of training, attention, and environment, it can be trained to behave. Ultimately, these pigs are steadfast friends and companions.

, Stimulate the pig's intelligence and playfulness. Learn to curb its willfulness. Spend time with it so that you can connect, giving it adequate stimulation through play. This helps to earn its trust.

Find a suitable mate for your pot bellied pig.,
Know what to look for.,
Vaccinate.,
Put your female with the male.,
Know about line breeding when it pertains to pigs.,
Wait for 3 and a half months.,
Take your female to a birthing area.,
Provide good bedding.,
Usually, a few days to a few hours prior to delivery of the litter, colostrum, a thin, yellow fluid may be secreted by the mammary gland of the mother.,
Know when to call the vet.,
Get a health exam.,
Know about when to wean the piglets.",How to Breed Pot Bellied Pigs," Do a little research on pig genetics to foresee the possible traits the piglets will have according to the backgrounds of both parents. Breeding for specific qualities and looks can help sell them faster and for better prices.


Most female potbellied pigs reach sexual maturity between the ages of 3 to 4 months of age. Female potbellies come into heat every 21 days. Heat can last 6 days, during which time your pig will have a swollen, reddened vulva. The males usually are sexually mature by 90 days. Some pigs can breed even earlier than 3 months, depending on their own genetics, housing, weight, and growth rate.;
, Some pet pig owners notice changes in their female pigs when they come into season. Their pigs may have accidents in the house and carry household items back to their bed. This will pass at the end of heat, but spaying is the only way to eliminate this behavior.

, Three weeks prior to breeding a vaccination is given to the female and to the male pig to aid in the prevention of reproductive disease. Another vaccination is given to the female two weeks before she has her litter. She should also be wormed at this time.

, Your female pig will need to go to the boar and be with him for two to three months. Even though your female has been having her monthly heat cycles, it usually takes a boar in close proximity to bring your female into ovulation. Thus, she will more than likely not be bred the first month. In the beginning of her stay, she will fight with the boar because he is not part of her herd. You can expect her to be bitten, scratched and possibly have her ear torn while they are fighting. It is important that both the female and the boar are up to date on all their vaccinations. It is also wise that the pigs be blood tested for the primary swine diseases prior to being placed together.

, It is important to note that line breeding is not an option with pigs. The rule of thumb for breeding potbellied pigs is no closer than five generations. The more closely related, the more likely the litter will have birth defects. For every generation “in” the breeder can expect a 10% increase in birth defects. Therefore, with the breeding of a very closely related pair, such as father to daughter, mother to son the breeder can expect at least 50% of the babies to be deformed or dead.

, The gestation or pregnancy period is 114 days.

, At least five days prior to her due date the female should be moved to a farrowing, birthing area. This farrowing area should be totally disinfected before the mother pig moves in. The surface of this area needs to be either earth or be covered with non-skid, washable rubber mat, so that the new babies are less likely to skin their knees or have leg problems as they nurse.

, Bedding for the mother and babies can be small amounts of clean hay, shredded paper or wood chips. The amount used of each type of material should never be so much that the baby piglet can become tangled in it. Household items such as rugs or blankets should not be used. This area needs a heat source, such as a heat lamp. Baby piglets have no control over their body temperature for about 3 days. They need to be kept in an environment of at least 90 degrees during this time; therefore, a heat source may be required even in the summer. The mother pig will move away from the heat, should be become too hot. The farrowing area needs to be big enough for her to do this comfortably. Size of the farrowing area also helps prevent the accidental crushing of the babies by their mother. Most farrowing areas have 2X4 boards attached to the sides of the area. These boards are placed about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the floor. This allows the babies to escape under or on top of the board, should their mother suddenly begin plop down in their direction.

, The average litter size for a potbellied pig is 6 – 8 piglets, but up to 10 – 12 may be born. An uncomplicated delivery may take up to 1 -2 hours, with about 15 to 30 minutes between the births of individual pigs. Baby pigs weigh somewhere between 6 and 12 ounces at birth.

, Veterinary assistance should be sought if the birth of the litter is prolonged, the female strains without producing pigs, few piglets are delivered and labor stops, if a foul discharge or decaying placenta is detected at the vulva, or, close to due date, the female has labored breathing, weakness and inability to rise.

, After the births of the entire litter and after the babies have had their first colostrum, they should be removed temporarily from their mother so that the breeder can give them a complete examination. You should look for any sign of birth defect. It is my observation that if you can see a birth defect, there is another internal defect looming that you cannot see.

, The piglets are weaned at about 6 weeks and no earlier than 5 weeks. All of the piglets should be vigorously eating solid food prior to weaning. This is a very stressful time for the babies and their mother. It is best to move the mother away from her litter so that she cannot see or hear them.

We're not talking about a jackrabbit, here. To process a hog, you'll need:


Sharp stainless knives, at least six inches long






A meat gambrel and winch, available at many outdoors and sporting goods stores






Sawzall or hacksaw, used to separate the ribs






A large tub or barrel with water, large enough to submerge the hog into, along with a heat source large enough to heat the water to boiling






A bucket






A large, flat surface outdoors, about waist-high–some wood planks on sawhorses make a good makeshift surface






A meat grinder for processing ground pork (optional)





;
, The ideal hog for harvesting is a young male that's been castrated before reaching sexual maturity, called a barrow, or a young female, called a gilt. Generally, hogs are slaughtered in the late fall when temperatures start to cool, at which point the hogs are ideally between 8 and 10 months old and between 180 and 250 lbs.Withhold all food for 24 hours prior to harvesting so the animal's intestinal tract will be clean. Supply plenty of fresh, clean water for the animal to drink.


Old, intact males are called boars, and will have a distinctively funky taste, the result of scent-gland hormones, while sows–old females–have a similar note of funk in the flavor.
If you're processing a wild boar, you need to remove the genitals and the scent gland near the hind quarters immediately to avoid subsequent “taint.” Some hunters will trim off a bit of fat and fry it up to check for a funky smell before going to all the work of dressing out the hog, or you can just go ahead and process it anyway, because some people don’t mind the flavor.

, Whether you're harvesting a farm-raised hog or hunting one in the wild, you need to make sure you start the process as clean as possible by using a quick kill, immediately draining the blood afterward to improve the flavor of the meat. The issue of killing the hogs by draining them is a common debate.


The morally preferred method of killing hogs is to use at least a .22 caliber rifle shot through the brain to kill the pig quickly and painlessly. Draw an imaginary line from the base of each ear to the opposite eye and aim for the intersection of those two points. Pigs' brains are extremely small, making the need for an accurate shot essential.Traditionally, many butchers preferred killing hogs by bleeding them out after first stunning them with a hammer, because shooting them is so tricky. A common belief is that, if the vein is cut while the animal is still living, the blood drains more thoroughly and the meat is eventually tastier. In many commercial slaughterhouses, hogs are stunned electrically and then killed by cutting the jugular vein. For some, however, this is unusually cruel.
In the United States, the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978 (HMSA) prohibits the inhumane slaughter of livestock, such as pigs, intended for commercial purposes. Technically, this only applies to hogs slaughtered in USDA-approved facilities, not private property.However, some states have issued rulings that livestock can only be processed in those facilities, making it important that you research the state bylaws that govern livestock. You can read the federal regulations here.

, After you've killed or stunned the pig with a shot, feel for the pig's breastbone, and insert your knife a few inches above it, making an incision across the front of the throat, at least, 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) long. Insert the knife into your incision, and push it about 6 inches (15.2 cm) upward, at a 45-degree angle toward the tail. Twist the knife and pull it out. This is the quickest way to ""stick"" the pig. The blood should begin draining immediately.Some people struggle to find the exact spot necessary to stick the pick quickly. If you're unsure about whether or not you've got it, all you need to sever is the jugular vein. Some will just cut deep across the throat, just under the jawline, all the way to the spine. You'll know when you've hit it by the volume of blood that comes out.
Be extremely careful when you move it to bleed the pig if it's still thrashing. If you've just stunned it with a shot, you may need to cut the throat before you get a chance to hang it. Use extreme caution. It may still be thrashing involuntarily, making it dangerous to move in with a very sharp knife. Shift the pig onto its back and hold the front legs in place with your hands, letting a partner use the knife.

, After killing or stunning the hog, you need to hang it, preferably using a meat gambrel, which is like a big clothes hanger made for hanging meat. Hook a chain onto the gambrel and attach it to a winch, or the back of a truck if you want.


Start by sliding the hooks at the bottom of the gambrel through the hog's heels, piercing them deep enough to support the weight of the entire hog. Then use a winch (or elbow grease) to raise the hog up and allow gravity to do the work of draining it. This needs to be done as soon as possible after the animal has been killed. A pig will take about 15-20 minutes to bleed out.
If you don't have a gambrel, you could also make a small incision behind the back leg tendons in the hog and insert a wooden dowel, or a length of pipe as a substitute. You can hook a length of chain onto the end and bootleg yourself a gambrel.
Barn rafters make perfect places from which to hang the hog, as well as low-hanging sturdy tree limbs. Find a suitable location, preferably as close as possible to the killing spot, before you've got 250 lb. of dead weight on your hands. If necessary, gather the hog into a wheelbarrow to move it to the draining location.
Use a clean, sterile bucket to catch the blood, if you want. Put the pig's entire head into the bucket to make sure you catch everything. Pork blood makes excellent sausage and is an actively sought-after ingredient in cooking.

, Many butchers will probably want to retain the skin, which includes the bacon, the belly fat, and the cracklings, making it useful, delicious, and slightly more labor intensive than if you just want to skin the hog. If you do, the best way to remove the hair is by dunking the hog several times into scalding water and scraping the skin thoroughly to remove it.The best way to heat the water is usually the most rustic: start a fire in a safe fire pit and settle the basin into it, or on top of a sturdy grate. It doesn't need to boil, but it should be at least 150 F. Make sure it is absolutely secure. Keeping the hog on the gambrel, dip it gently into the simmering water, no more than 15 or 30 seconds, and then remove it.
If you don't have an outdoor vat big enough to soak a whole hog in, some people have had success soaking a burlap sack in hot water and wrapping the hog in it for several minutes to soften the hairs and move in with the scraper.
Wild boars with super-thick coats will likely need to be trimmed with clippers or shears before being dipped like a domestic pig, whose fur is usually somewhat finer.

, After dipping the hog, place it on a flat work surface and get to work. A couple of sawhorses with plywood boards and a tarp can work perfectly in a pinch, as well as a picnic table, if you've got one. You want the hog about waist high. A sharp knife works extremely well in scraping the fine hairs off the skin.


Start with the belly-side up, placing the knife blade perpendicular to the hog and scraping toward your body in long, smooth strokes. This may take a while and involve several dippings to get all the hair off completely. Some people like to go back and use a small torch to singe off the remaining hair, if necessary.
Hog scrapers or bell scrapers used to be commonly used in processing hogs, but are increasingly difficult to find. Lots of people will go to the torch more quickly, as it's very effective at getting the little, hard-to-find hairs off the skin.

, If you don't have a vat big enough to scald the hog in, or just don't want to put in the effort, it's perfectly fine to go forward with skinning it and discarding the skin. Skip forward to the following method to remove the entrails, then work your knife around the hams to start stripping the skin.


To remove the skin, pull the skin back and work a very sharp boning knife underneath, working your way down slowly and trying to retain as much of the fat as possible. Skinning a hog should take anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour.

, To start removing the entrails, work a smaller knife around the anus (and the vaginal opening) of the hog, about an inch or two deep. Make the circle about two inches wider than the anus itself so you don't pierce the colon. Grab ahold and pull up gently, then use a rubber band or a zip-tie to pinch it off. This closes everything up, so you'll be able to pull it out the other side, when you open up the chest.


Some butchers wait to remove these organs until after removing the offal and the intestines, but it's good to take precautions, because these are the bacteria-laden parts of the animal that can contaminate the meat.
Remove the testicles of intact boars, if you haven't already. Wrap a rubber band around them to gather the testicles and sever them. It's better to do this as soon as possible after killing the animal. To remove the penis, pull it away from the animal, and work your knife underneath it, slicing along the muscle that works back toward the tail. Pull it lose and discard.

, Pinch the skin near the base of the sternum, where the ribs end and the abdomen begins, and pull toward you as far as possible. Insert your knife and gently work your way down the center line of the pig's belly, in between the two rows of nipples. Be extremely careful not to puncture the stomach lining and the intestines. Keep working your knife until you get all the way up between the animal's legs.


At some point in this process, gravity will likely work in your favor and the entrails will start falling out without you having to do much. As soon as you start opening the belly up, it's a good idea to have a big bucket or tray ready to catch the organs. They'll be heavy, and it's important that you handle them delicately.

, Everything in the digestive tract should fall out relatively easily with a bit of coaxing, including the lower intestine that you tied off earlier. Use you knife to trim away any stubborn connective tissue The kidneys and the pancreas are perfectly edible and popular items to reserve.


Some serious do-it-yourselfers will save the intestines to process into sausage casings, though this is a time-intesnive and difficult process.
Adipose tissue is a layer of fat found near the pig's kidneys, and is popular to reserve for rendering into lard.You don't need to remove it now, but be gentle with the cavity as you work the organs out and into the bucket. It can be harvested by ""fisting out"" the tissue, essentially by pulling it free with your hands.

, After the entrails are removed, you need to open up the chest to remove the rest of the organs. You can use your knife to separate the front of the rib cage, working your way in between the layer of cartilage that connects the breastbone. You shouldn't have to use the saw to do this. After separating the ribs, remove the rest of the organs. The heart and liver and commonly reserved and eaten.


Some people will start by reinserting the knife into the ""stick"" puncture made earlier and cut toward the tail, while others find it easier to start nearer the stomach and work toward the head. Do whatever seems most comfortable for you in your work space.
You should chill any organs you hope to save as soon as possible. Rinse them thoroughly in cool water and chill them, wrapped loosely in butcher paper, in the refrigerator. They need to be kept between 33 and 40 degrees F., Behind the ears, work your knife in a circular direction around the throat to separate the head, using the jawline as a guide. As you separate the meat and expose the neck bone, you might need to get in there with a cleaver to break through the vertebrae with firm chop.


If you want to remove the head and leave the jowls intact, cut toward the corner of the mouth, under the ears, separating the meat. The jowls are great for making jowl bacon, while others prefer to clean and keep the head intact for use in making head cheese.
You can also remove the feet at the ""wrist"" knuckle, just up from the top each hoof. Use a hacksaw or a sawzall to slice through the joint and remove the feet.

, Little hairs can be especially tenacious when you're processing out a hog. They'll stick to fat and be hard to find. Before you let the meat rest for a day to process it, it's important to give it another good rinsing with cool, clean water, letting it hang and dry thoroughly before moving it into the cold.

, To dry out the meat some, the hog will need to be aged for about a day in cold temperature, between 30 and 40 degrees F. A walk-in fridge is the easiest way to do this, or processing your hot during a very cold season, in which you'll be able to do it in a shed or garage.


Making the cuts necessary to break down the pork is almost impossible with warm, or even room-temperature meat. The whole process of making the necessary butchers' cuts are a lot easier with cold meat.
You can also do an ""ice brine,"" by filling a vat large enough to hold the hog with ice, with a few handfuls of table salt to keep the temperature down. Pack the meat onto the ice to cool it down.
If you just don't have the space and can't let the meat sit, you need to break it down into a manageable size and get it cooled down. If space is at a premium, some people will use the sawmill or a manual hacksaw to cut through the backbones, as well as the pelvic bone, separating the hog into two halves. This will be the next step, regardless, so it's a good idea to do it whenever it's the most convenient for storage.

, Lay one half cut-side up, and find where the spine ends, near the fleshy part of the thigh (that's the ham) on that side. Start with a sharp boning knife to expose the ham.


Trim back the belly by following the contour of the ham back toward the spine, cutting into the narrowest point. Turn your knife and cut straight down, until you hit the tip of the pelvic bone. At that point, switch your knife for the hacksaw (or your heavier cleaver) and cut through the bone to remove the ham. You should be able to see this point relatively easily, if your cut along the backbone was centered well.
Hams are typically cured or smoked, so it's also a good idea to trim it up to make it uniform, especially if you've got an especially fatty ham. The wedge-shaped meat left near the spine after removing the ham is a premium cut, perfect for roasts. It's, in fact, where the phrase ""high on the hog,"" comes from., To remove the shoulder, flip the side of pork over so the skin side is facing up. Pull the limb up, exposing the ""underarm"" of the shoulder, and work your knife into the connective tissue underneath. You'll only have to use your knife to continue working toward the joint, which should pull away easily by pulling it back on itself.


Pork shoulder or ""butt"" is the best pork for slow-cooking and making pulled pork. It's a fatty cut, and going low-and-slow on the smoker will make for an excellent fork-tender meal.

, Flip the side over again, cut-side up. From the smallest rib at the narrow end of the side, count up to the third or fourth rib and use the cleaver to cut through the backbone at that point, between the ribs. Remove everything below that line and reserve the meat for the grinder, or discard it. If you've got an electric butcher's saw, this is much easier.


To find the chops, turn the side look at it head-on, looking down the spine from the side that had the shoulder. Find the ""eye"" of the loin, which should run alongside the backbone. It's a thin quarter-sized (maybe larger or smaller, depending) dark patch of meat that runs alongside the spine, surrounded by a circle of fat. Perpendicular to the ribs, use the cleaver or saw to cut through the ribs, separating the tenderloin section, which you can separate into chops, from the lower section of ribs, which contains the bacon and the rib racks.
Turn the tenderloin section lengthwise, so you can cut slices and form pork chops, as if you were cutting slices of bread. Start with the knife, cutting through to the bone, before switching back over to the saw. You want them to be even, about 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick, cutting through the bone to retain it. It's difficult going, if you're doing it by hand, so use a sawzall or butcher's saw if at all possible.
It's a good idea to clean up the bone shards as even as possible, so they won't tear through the butcher paper in the fridge, which can promote spoilage. Have a partner go back over each chop with a metal scour pad to thin out any burrs and trim excess fat off, leaving no more than 3/4 of an inch of each. If there are bone shards, wipe them down with some cool water, cleaning them up as you work.

, The lower, thinner section of the side contains everyone's favorite pork: the ribs and the bacon. It's best to separate the bacon, first. It's just below where the ribs end, and should appear to be quite fatty.


To remove it, insert your knife under the ribs, cutting through the connective tissue and pulling the ribs back and away. Leave the cartilage attached to the rib-section, and not the bacon. Use that as you cutting line. It should come off quite easily. You can slice the bacon, or leave it whole for easier storage, until you're ready to do something with it.
Leave the rib section whole, or separate into portions of ribs if you want. It's more common to leave the side whole.

, The only remaining meat is usually best reserved for grinding up into sausage. If you have access to a meat grinder, you can grind pork to make sausage or basic ground pork. It's usually best to re-chill the meat before feeding it into the grinder, since cooler meat tends to grind up more uniformly.


Cut even with the bone along the neck to flay the meat out and separate the bone. It doesn't have to be super-clean, since it's going into the grinder.

, As soon as you portioned out the pork, it's important that you wrap it neatly in clean butcher paper, label it with the cut and date using a marker. You can refrigerate the meat you plan on using right away and find freezer space for the rest of it. There's going to be a lot of meat to deal with, so it's usually more common to freeze most of it immediately.


It's a good idea to double-wrap pork in butcher paper, which is particularly susceptible to freezer burn and spoilage from the cold. This is especially the case in larger portions that have sharp bone shards that can cut through the paper.

It has to be in the shade during warm weather in order to stay cool.You can provide shady spots with a porch, large trees, open air sheds, and other outdoor coverings.;
, Javelinas also need a steady source of water in order to survive. Offering a place where they can drink at any time of day or night is an important part of their habitat. It is useful if you have a pond, because they also like to roll around in wet mud to stay cool.You can also fill up a kiddie pool to provide water, or allow the javelina to chew on an irrigation hose.

, Prickly pear cactus plants are a favorite in the javelina’s wild habitat. The javelina is a native desert mammal, and prickly pear cacti are useful to them as food and shade sources. They are more comfortable when they are surrounded by cacti since this reminds them of home.You can plant a “pad” of prickly pear cactus plants, and each one grows several brightly colored flowers in spring and summer. The flowers turn into edible fruits. It will grow best in the desert, but is not picky, so can be grown in most locations., Javelinas like to eat things that they can forage for in the desert. They are mainly herbivores, meaning that they prefer to eat vegetation, although they have been known to eat lizards and dead rodents. Their preferred diet includes things like roots, nuts, beans, berries, grass, and cacti, especially agave.They will also nose through human trash for food.
You can easily provide these food items by using any fruit or nut trees on your property, or by purchasing them from the grocery store in bulk.

, The natural predators of javelinas are coyotes and dogs, so you must certainly keep your dogs away from javelinas, or they will become frightened, which can make them behave with aggression. It is wise to also keep cats and other pets out of the javelina’s way because it tends to become aggressive if it feels cornered or smells a dog.Javelina also carry distemper, which easily passes to pets through the air.

, Javelinas are wild animals and should be regarded with respect. They are not usually seen as pets, and since they are not bred by humans, you usually will not be able to find them at a pet store or for sale by neighbors. Javelinas can be dangerous because they have tusks, will bite, and carry diseases.


They can carry salmonella and can catch distemper and rabies.
They become aggressive if cornered, smell a dog, or if you get close to their babies., Javelinas are not usually made into pets. They are wild animals often on the list of prey targeted by local hunters, mainly because they can become pests because of their penchant for nosing through trash. Like wild deer, people do choose to feed them and interact with them, but authorities actually warn against doing this., Javelinas can die after being fed by humans because they lose their fear of humans. Although people who care for javelinas usually do feed them, this is never advised because their frequent visits can cause problems in neighborhoods, leading to the death of the javelina either by irritated local hunters or by their subsequent proximity to coyotes and dogs., Even though you may want to care for a javelina, the safest thing for both you and the javelina is to leave it alone. You may see some in your neighborhood or on your property if you live in desert areas of the U.S. like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, or in Mexico all the way down through Argentina, but if you feed them, they will start visiting your property, leading to a host of problems.These problems include making them pests in your neighborhood, opening them up to threats of coyotes (which tend live near humans because they scavenge for food), risking getting diseases like salmonella and rabies, and risking getting bitten or jabbed by tusks yourself.

, Javelinas live in desert areas, including those found in the U.S. state of Arizona. In this state, there is a law against trapping javelinas. Since the only way to come in contact with a javelina is by finding them in the wild, your only option for caring for a javelina is to offer to feed them, which is warned against by most government safety agencies., If you do decide to offer a habitat that a javelina would be comfortable in and a javelina does start visiting your property, you will need to sustain a source of clean drinking water. If you have a pond, you probably don’t need to think about it very much, but if not, a kiddie pool full of water will do.


Check this pool every few days to make sure that the water is clean and full. You may have to periodically empty the pool and add fresh water to prevent algae from growing, or mosquitoes and flies from laying their eggs in it. (Both insects like still water.)
You can also let the javelina chew on an irrigation hose.

, Purchase or grow the food necessary to sustain a javelina, and keep this food available to them so that they don’t start going through your trash. They are good at foraging for food like roots, and you can provide seeds, beans, and green vegetation.


If you can find them, you can grow agave plants and prickly pear cacti on your property to provide easy access to food for the javelina.

, Javelina can’t cool down on their own, so they prefer to rest in shady spots during the heat of the day. Make sure any trees, shrubbery, and shelter structures like porches and open sheds remain in place and in good repair.

, Javelinas area wild animals, and bringing them inside a home or barn is a very bad idea. Javelinas are usually docile, especially when alone, but will become aggressive if they feel cornered. They will bite and have tusks, so it is easy for them to harm humans. The enclosed spaces of houses can easily trigger their instinct to fight.


Instead, let them roam around outside.

, Javelina are known for picking up diseases like rabies, salmonella, and distemper, all of which can be passed to humans either through touch or bite. To keep you and your family safe, avoid coming in contact with the javelina. Let it run around in your yard rather than becoming a cuddle pet like a dog or cat., Keeping the javelina outdoors is a good way to keep it from feeling trapped, but you should also avoid making it feel trapped when it is outside. Don’t try to push it in any direction, use any sort of device to lead it to a specific place, and don’t close a gate when it is inside an enclosed area.


When a javelina feels trapped, it will try to defend itself by biting and attacking with its tusks.

, Since you can’t legally trap a javelina in Arizona, it makes sense that it is not to good idea to keep a javelina on your property indefinitely. Make sure that you have open spaces on your property so that the javelina can come and go as it pleases. Again, keeping a javelina locked into your yard can make it become aggressive."

",How to Give Your Pig a Bath," You'll need to figure out what snacks you'll need to give your pig so it will behave while you bathe it. Pigs will do anything for food, and since they have the propensity for obesity, it's best to choose snacks that are low in calories. You'll need a lot of treats to bathe your pig. Popcorn, cheerios, and raisins are good low-calorie treats to use for this task.;
, Don't use dish soap or anything harsh that can burn your pig's eyes.

, Take the water, shampoo, treats and a washcloth to the spot where you're planning on bathing your pig. A small confined area such as their pig run is best.

,, Your pig will want to walk away and will make a fuss, but the treats will always bring him back.

, Use care on your pig's face, avoiding his eyes. Piggies love to have their hind quarters and bellies scrubbed. Make sure to get the area between their legs and belly and behind their ears.

If you want to raise your potbelly pig indoors, however, it's important to set up the right environment so your pig can thrive.Pigs don't need to be confined frequently, but they should have their own space in the house. A dog or cat crate works well.
Make sure to fill the crate with blankets and bedding. If you have more than one pig, each pig should have its own bed.;
, If you prefer, and if you have a backyard, you can keep a potbelly pig outside. You should also have an outdoor shelter in place just to let your indoor pig out on occasion.Potbelly pigs are not very big and cannot jump high. They should have some kind of fenced in enclosure, but there's no need for the enclosure to be more than 4 feet high.
You should also have shelter and bedding inside the enclosure, especially if you plan to keep your pig outside longterm. There should be a small crate or shelter your pig can enter, filled with bedding and timothy hay.
If you live in an area where the heat ever drops below 50 °F (10 °C), it's necessary to have a heated shelter. You can also let your pigs indoors on night where the heat is expected to dip below 50 degrees.

, The staple of a healthy potbelly pig's diet is pellets. You can find pellets specifically designed for potbelly pigs online or at a local pet store. Feed your pig a serving of pellets twice a day. Refer to the label on your chosen pig food for instructions on how big a serving you need. How much food a pig needs depends on its precise size.
You should make sure you're not overfeeding your pet. An overweight pig is not healthy and will need to lose weight. If your pig starts gaining weight, talk to a vet about adjusting its diet.

, While pellets should be the staple of a pig's diet, they should not live on pellets alone. A pig should be allowed free time outside to graze on grass. You should also feed it a variety of fresh produce.Stick to low calorie vegetables like leafy greens, celery, carrots, and cucumbers. Avoid higher calorie veggies, like canned vegetables, corn, nuts, and seeds.
Fruit can be given to your pig on occasion as a treat, but it should not be a staple of your pig's diet. Stay away from dried fruit, as this is high in calories.

, Pigs need access to fresh drinking water at all times. Whether your keep your pig inside or outside, make sure to keep a bowl of fresh water near your pig. Check the water bowl regularly and replace it as needed. If the water gets dirty, replace it with clean water., Contrary to popular belief, it is not normal or healthy for a pig to be chubby. You should make sure your pig gets exercise. If you aren't able to let the pig roam around outside, make sure it moves around indoors.A good way to encourage movement is hiding food. Scatter pellets around the floor when feeding your pig. Hide treats around the house for your pig to find.
You can easily take your pig for walks on a regular basis as well. You just need a harness and leash, which can be purchased at any pet store.

, A pig should have a litter box in your home. You should use a more shallow box than you would for a cat, so a pig should step in and out. Lay down newspapers for your pig to eliminate on. You can also use wood chips as long as they're not cedar.Most pigs will use the litter box on their own without much effort. If your pig defecates outside the box, place the feces in the litter box so the pig knows where to go.
Praise the pig for using the box. Pigs are highly intelligent and can understand praise. If you say something like, ""Good pig!"" after your pig uses its litter box, it will begin to understand.

, Pigs are social animals. They thrive on play, so make sure you play with your pig regularly. A pig that does not get enough attention will not be happy and may act out.You can use rubber dog toys for your pig. You can toss these toys for your pig and it will chase and catch them.
Pigs also like puzzle toys. Many pet stores sell toys where you place a treat inside a box a pig must then disassemble.
You should also keep a dirt box in your house. Pigs love rooting around in dirt. However, for the sake of your home, keep the dirt box on a tile or laminated floor to make cleaning easier.

, In general, potbelly pigs do not make great pets for small children. Make sure young children understand your pig's boundaries. Encourage them to be gentle with the pig. Never leave a pig unsupervised with young children.Make sure young children wash their hands before petting pigs. If pigs smell food on a child's hand, they may bite.

, You do not want a potbelly pig to breed if you're not equipped to handle piglets. There are also certain health and behavioral problems associated with sexual maturity. Males give off a bad odor and may display inappropriate sexual behavior towards humans. Females will go into heat regularly, and may eliminate outside the litter box and make loud noises.Potbelly pigs reach sexual maturity around 8 weeks of age. Shortly after your pig is 8 weeks old, make an appointment to have it spayed or neutered.

, You want to make sure your pig can navigate your home safely. Pigs can easily get into cabinets and end up ingesting dangerous substances.Put child locks on cabinets within your pig's reach, or secure them closed with rubber bands. Try to keep hazardous materials in higher cabinets.
Clear items from shelves where pigs can reach. A pig could knock an item over and hurt itself.Make sure to keep plants out of your pig's reach. Pigs may dig through house plants.

, You may have to call a few vets before you find one willing to treat pigs. Not every vet has experience with potbelly pigs. If a conventional pet cannot take your pig, see if you can find a qualified livestock peg in your area., Potbelly pigs require basic medical care to thrive. Make regular appointments with your vet to make sure your pig stays up-to-date on basic care.Like all pets, potbelly pigs need regular vaccinations. Make sure to get your pet vaccinated every year.
You will also need regular hoof trimming. You should have a veterinarian do this, if possible.

Remember that pigs can be dangerous.",How to Raise Pigs," Pigs need a dry, secure place to live that will protect them from the weather and provide enough space to move around. Some people claim that a full grown pig only needs about 20 square feet of space. However, for a truly healthy pig, you should allot each pig about 50 square feet of space.When planning your pigpen out, remember that it is best if the pen is twice as long as it is wide.


When making your plans, also keep in mind that pigs tend to relieve themselves near their water supply. Because of this, you should plan to put the water supply on the far end of the pen, away from their food and shelter.
If you have a barn with empty stalls in it, you can consider raising your pigs inside the barn. Just keep in mind that you will have to haul the manure they produce out of the barn.;
, Use a woven fence that is ""hog tight"" with a board on the bottom to discourage digging. The best way to build your fence is to map out the area you will house your pig(s) in and then build a sturdy wooden fence around the area. When your fence is built, attach 4×2 welded wire to the inside of the fence so that if the pigs push on it, it won’t go anywhere.A movable electric fence is a good option for pigs that will be used to pasture other parts of a farm or land, and will be herded in and out of the pen.

, Pigs can sunburn if they do not have protection from the direct sunlight in hot weather. In cold weather, pigs will seek protection from cold and wind. The best setup is a three-sided, roofed structure that can be placed inside the fenced in area. Many pig farmers recommend that you provide your pigs with at least 15 to 20 square feet of shade. The roof doesn’t need to be higher than four feet tall.Remember to leave a partial opening under the eaves of the structure so that heat can escape during the hotter months of the year.
One way to provide shade is to secure shade cloth to the top of the pen to block sun.
In the winter, you should put hay down inside the shelter that your smaller pigs can warm themselves in.

, It's true - pigs love mud. Pigs have a hard time regulating their temperatures, and when faced with a high heat, a mud wallow looks just like a swimming pool to your piggies. To build a mud wallow, section off one part of the pen. You can build a low lying fence or trough to keep the mud in just one section. Till up the earth where your mud bath will be and then add water to the area once or twice a day (perhaps more if you live in a particularly hot climate).Place fresh layer of sand at the bottom of your wallow when you first dig it.
Add fresh dirt when needed.
Note that you have to keep the wallow clean as some pigs will use the wallow as a bathroom.
Do not toss food in the wallow, keep it filled with water and to reduce flies and possibility of illness, do not throw food in it.
Mud also helps reduce the risk of pigs getting lice, allows them to root (dig up the ground; something they really enjoy doing) and keeps their skin in good condition.
Pigs will stress in heat and this can trigger heat related heart attacks. If you do not have room for a wallow, then use large kids' play pools for pigs to lay in.

, A 100 pound pig can produce about 1.6 pounds of manure per day. You can use this manure to fertilize your garden or crops. You could also consider selling the manure to other local farmers or gardeners who may not have a ready supply.

, The one issue that folks have with pigs, farm pigs or pot belly pigs,is the issue of flies. After cleaning up after the pigs, cover the urine spots with a thin layer of garden lime. You can get it in bulk from garden supply stores and use a coffee can to broadcast it over the soiled area. This sweetens the area and kills fly eggs. If you are using manure for your yard, you can treat the manure pile with it as well.

Garden lime is used to mark lines on football fields so its safe for humans and pets. In fact it’s the main ingredient in Sweet PDZ used to freshen horse stalls.
If you can't find lime, you can use gypsum, but it won't smell as fresh.

, Pigs grow in size best during warmer weather (60 to 70°F is ideal). If possible, begin your pig raising project in early spring or in late summer--this way, when the piglets are growing the most, they will do so in the best conditions. Surprising as it may sound, a 50 pound piglet, if given access to constant food and water, will grow the 250 pounds (market weight) in approximately 100 days. Talk about a growth spurt.

, Whether you are raising your pig as a pet or for meat, you will need to select a healthy pig from a good breeder. Unless you have money to spare, you should focus your search to pig farms in your area that have piglets for sale. When looking at piglets, avoid buying any that are scratching or coughing. If you notice that 20% or so of the pigs at the farm you are visiting look sick, you should consider purchasing a pig somewhere else.Keep in mind that if you go to a pig sale where multiple breeders are showing their pigs, the pigs will probably be rather stressed out. They also become more susceptible to sickness.

, Pigs drink a lot of water. On average, they will consume 2 to 4 gallons (7.6 to 15 l) of water per day. Keep a tub rooted to the ground and fill it with clean water throughout the day. If you simply set the tub on the ground, the pig will most likely tip it over and play with it.


Tubs are fine but they need constant refills in summer, same with troughs. There are several inexpensive water troughs for pigs that use hook up to a water source and regulate the water via float system.

, As you might guess, pigs are really good at eating. In general, you should plan to use pre-mixed feeds to ensure that your pigs have a well balanced diet. A 50-pound piglet should be fed a commercial feed that is 16% protein, while a 125 pound pig would do fine with a 14% protein mix--though some farmers prefer to keep their feed at 16%. A pig should gain 1 lb. (0.45 kg) per day.

, Pigs are sometimes referred to as living garbage disposals - which is a pretty accurate sentiment. However, keep the feed as their main course and give them scraps as a side dish. You can feed your pigs fruits, vegetables, meat scraps, garden clippings, and even spoiled eggs. Just make sure you are not feeding your pigs only scraps.Keep in mind that things that are poisonous to humans (like rhubarb leaves or certain berries) are also poisonous to pigs. You should also avoid feeding your pig raw potatoes and raw meat, as both can be poisonous or carry bad bacteria.
Some professional pig farmers think it is best to boil any ‘human’ food that you are planning on giving to your pigs. Doing this will guard your piggies against any bad bacteria that the food might contain., Pigs have a tendency to get internal parasites because they root around in mud and manure all day. Ask a local vet to prescribe your pigs an anthelmintic that will kill any worms they might have. It is recommended that worm your pig every four to six weeks., If you are planning on selling your pigs, you should do so when they have grown to 200 to 250 pounds (90 to 114 kg). When the pigs are ready to be sold at a market, they will be priced based on size and health. Bring the pigs to a livestock auction or to individuals and local stores. Make an appointment with a local slaughterhouse.

, A 100 lb pig can pack a wallop when it hits your legs. Bites aren’t much fun either. Keep “sorting boards” around to move pigs back into their pens, and to grab in case of issues.

These are typically rectangular in shape (30” x 48”) with cutouts across the top and sides. They are inexpensive at feed stores and online.
You can make your own using a piece of wood the size mentioned and attach handles.

Gravitate toward distress calls.,
Opt for an electronic caller.,
Be wary of mouth-blown callers.,
Wait for piglet season.,
Scout from a distance.,
Allow the pigs to reach a standstill.,
Call in short bursts.,
Watch for the results.",How to Call the Hogs," Typically speaking, most wild hogs respond to the sound of distressed swine more than any other call. The sounds of distressed piglets are especially useful, but even the sound of distressed adult hogs might be useful in some instances.


Piglet squeals appeal to the protective instinct of both sows and boars, especially when used during piglet season.
Hog feeding sounds mimic the noises made by hogs while feeding. They're generally the next most effective after distress calls and may capture the curiosity of stationary wild hogs, but these calls won't often encourage distracted hogs to approach.
Grunt calls are fairly common but aren't quite as effective. Even the highest quality grunt calls tend to mimic the sound of warning grunts. Hogs are aggressive by nature, so some may still respond to this noise, but many will opt to avoid the noise and the area it comes from.
Some hunters have success with callers that are programmed with other animal noises. For instance, rabbit squealers and crow noises can appeal to the predatory instinct of many hogs. Coyote growls may scare some hogs off, but territorial hogs or those actively protecting their young may respond to the noise by charging it.;
, Portable electronic callers are more practical and more accurate. They're easier to handle, and wild hogs generally respond to them more consistently than they respond to mouth-blown callers.


Since electronic callers use real sounds recorded from actual hogs, the sounds are more accurate and more likely to work.
Electronic callers are also easier to use since you can start the call recording and set it aside to continue playing. This frees both your hands and attention, making it easier to watch the hogs and handle your firearm.
There are different types of electronic callers, so you'll need to do your research to determine which best fits your needs. Some callers come previously loaded with certain sounds, but many can be loaded separately with sounds from computer sound files, CDs, and DVDs.

, While some hunters can have success calling hogs with a traditional mouth-blown caller, the odds are against the novice hunter who attempts to use one.


Most mouth-blown callers are packaged as hog grunts, but oftentimes, these grunts more closely resemble those of whitetail bucks rather than wild hogs or other swine. As such, the standard mouth-blown caller doesn't often attract the attention of hogs and may even drive the hogs away., If you opted for an electronic caller loaded with the sounds of distressed piglets, the best time to attempt calling and/or hunting wild hogs will be while mother hogs actually have piglets to care for.While the exact timing may vary by region, most hogs have piglets during late winter through the middle of spring. Squealing piglet calls are most effective during this time span.
If you choose another type of hog call (adult distress calls, feeding sounds, grunts, or related animal noises), the season does not make much difference. Each of these calls will have roughly the same rate of success throughout the entire year.

, Keep a distance between yourself and the wild hogs. Try to position yourself downwind of their location.


If you're close enough to see and hear the hogs, you're close enough for the hog call to work. Positioning yourself downwind is still ideal, though, since the sound of the call will carry with the wind instead of being masked by it.

, Wild hogs are more attentive when they've stopped than they are while they're on the move. Wait until the passel of hogs is no longer on the move before attempting to call out to them.


Hogs actively moving about tend to be fixated on accomplishing some task, like finding food, so they will be less curious about random calls.
Hogs that are standing in one place while feeding or sleeping are more vulnerable to calls, though. The territorial nature of the hogs will come out while they remain one one area, so they'll be more likely to react to other hog noises during this time.
Note that hogs at a standstill generally prefer weed patches and other areas of heavy cover, but a good hog call will still be able to reach them and draw them out into the open.

, Play the call for approximately 30 seconds, then stop the recording. After a minute of silence passes, call to the hogs over another 30-second stretch.


The timing of each call doesn't need to be precise, but you shouldn't play the call continuously. Short bursts of noise sound more natural and will evoke less suspicion than constant grunts or squeals.
Some high-quality recorded calls will include natural pauses. These calls can be played without manually stopping them, but you should review the call beforehand to verify whether or not this applies to the one you have at your disposal.

, If the hogs are going to respond to the call at all, they'll usually do so within the first few attempts. Keep an eye on the passel as you play the call to watch for shifts in behavior.


Oftentimes, a call that successfully reaches one hog will reach many hogs, so be prepared for more than one hog to come out into the open.
If your call does not produce results after five or six tries, it might be best to try another option. You could consider a different type of call or a different position. Alternatively, you may also want to try again after the hogs change location or switch activities.

Make eye contact with the piglet and speak in a low calm voice. Piglets can be startled by a high pitched or sing song baby voice.;
, Stick out your arm and hold your hand out with your palm facing up and knuckles facing down. Keep in mind that it might take your piglet a while to feel comfortable, especially if you just got him.Make sure that the piglet has all of his basic needs met before you try to get him to play. Check to see if he has water, a bed, and food to eat.

, The piglet should be looking curiously at your hand, from a distance. You may also consider wiggling a treat or a toy in front of you to get the piglet’s attention.Try offering the piglet a piece of fresh fruit or a tennis ball.

, Use the piglet’s name if it has one and you know it, or just say, ""here piggy-pig"". You can also try snapping your fingers, and/or making kissing noises to get the piglet’s attention.


Keep in mind that many farm pigs are not named because they will eventually be slaughtered. If you are trying to play with a piglet on a farm, try to avoid giving it a name or you may become too attached.

, It might take some time for the piglet to feel comfortable enough to approach you, so try to be patient. If the piglet does not seem interested, leave him be and try again in a few hours.

, He or she will probably try to nibble on your fingers. Be careful because it is possible that the piglet will mistake your fingers for food and bite them. If the piglet starts to nibble a little too hard on your fingers, pull your fingers away.


Keep a first aid kit handy that includes a bottle of betadine and peroxide just in case you get bit. Clean bites with peroxide then betadine (iodine). You should also make sure that you are current on your tetanus shots before playing with a piglet.

, If the piglet gets close to you, then he may want to investigate you further before deciding to trust you. Try to stay still while the piglet circles you. Keep in mind that the piglet may try to nibble on your clothes and shoes, especially if they smell like feed.

, Pat and rub the piglet’s back gently. If the piglet runs away, start again at the beginning and repeat the process until the piglet is comfortable being touched by you.

, Start at the sides of the piglet’s belly and then move in towards the center of his tummy. Rub the piglet vigorously on its stomach and if you're lucky, he or she will tip over in delight.


Remember to watch your fingers. Even if the piglet is comfortable with you, she may still try to nibble on your fingers if they smell like food or if she gets curious.

, Once the piglet is comfortable with you, you can try playing games with her and introduce some toys as well. Piglets love to play lots of the same games that dogs enjoy.

, Pigs love to root around in the mud for roots and other tasty treats. If you have an indoor pig, then you can create a place for your piglet to root in your home by making a rooting box.To make a rooting box, place some fist-sized rocks into a large wide box and then add some treats, such as dry cereal and popcorn for your pig to root around and find. It is important to use only fist-size or larger rocks in a rooting box or your pig may accidentally inhale them.

, Pigs love to roll around in mud. If you keep your pigs outdoors, then you might consider making a small mud pit for your piglets to enjoy. Add some water to a patch of dry dirt to create mud and then lead you piglet over to the mud so she can investigate it.


You might also consider filling a kiddie pool with a bit of water for your piglet to cool off. Make sure that the water is not too deep. Your piglet may not know how to swim yet.

, Pigs enjoy interactive games such as fetch, so try tossing a stick, a tennis ball, or a Frisbee to see if your piglet will retrieve it. It might take him a few tries to get the idea, but once he figures out what you want him to do he should start to bring the item back again and again.


Piglets also enjoy pushing balls around with their noses. Try giving your piglet a big bouncy ball or beach ball to push around her pen or around the house if she is an indoor pig., Pigs also like to shred paper, so your piglet might enjoy having a few sheets of newspaper now and then. Try laying out a few pages and then let the piglet investigate them.You can also try giving your piglet cardboard boxes, magazines, and other types of paper to shred.

, Pigs are intelligent animals, so like dogs, they get bored by playing with the same toys over and over again. Try to swap out your piglet’s toys once every few days to ensure that she will always be entertained."

Alpacas are not inexpensive, but many farms offer in-house financing to help you to afford quality animals. A breeding female can range in price from $5,000 to $40,000 and a breeding male will likely cost between $5,000 and $50,000. Some exceptional males have even been sold for as much as $200,000! Expect to spend a minimum of $10,000 for a healthy male and female alpaca to begin your breeding process.The best way to find alpacas for sale is on the Alpaca Owner’s Association’s registry. You can find alpacas for sale here: http://www.alpacainfo.com/find/alpacas

If you purchase your alpacas from a local farm, you may want to have a veterinarian look the animals over prior to your purchase to ensure they are healthy and able to breed.;
, It’s common for breeders to want to maximize their financial return on a breeding female alpaca, and as a result they begin breeding them at too young an age. Alpacas traditionally reach breeding maturation sometime between twelve and twenty-four months, with some as late as thirty. While some alpacas have successfully conceived as young as five months, this is not safe for the female or the baby.Breeding your female alpacas too young can lead to complications that can endanger the lives of the female and baby alpacas.
Make sure your female alpaca weighs at least eighty-eight pounds before allowing her to breed.

, Male alpacas are usually ready to mate for the first time at between one and three years of age. You can be sure a male alpaca is matured enough to breed when its penis separates from the prepuce. Male alpacas that are not matured enough to breed physically will be unable to mate and will likely demonstrate little interest in attempting to do so.When the male alpaca matures sufficiently to breed, its genitals will detach from the body and hang freely.

, This step is often overlooked because people tend to assume their animals are in good health. Remember that the health of the baby alpaca will be determined in great part by the health of each of its parents, so it’s important to ensure they are both in optimal health. It is especially important that the female alpaca is in good health due to the relative size of their offspring. Baby alpacas are often born weighing around twenty pounds, with a mother that weighs only about one hundred and fifty.Make sure your alpacas are well fed and that their nutritional needs are met.
Ensure you give a breeding female alpaca enough time to fully recover from giving birth before you breed them again. They are often healed after two weeks, but may be stressed by nursing a baby for up to six months.
You may want to have both alpacas looked over by a veterinarian to ensure they are free of parasites and in good health.

, Alpaca breeding behavior can be enhanced by establishing the proper setting. Construct a separate breeding pen and ensure it is positioned in an area that can’t be seen by any other male alpacas you have. Ensure your breeding pen is on flat, even terrain so the male alpaca can maintain its balance while mating.The breeding pen should be fairly small. Make sure it is only two to three times larger in area than the space your male and female alpaca occupy so they can move freely but have to interact.
Minimize distractions by removing everything from the breeding pen except the two alpacas.

, Male alpacas will make it clear that they want to breed by singing or “orgling.” This sound is evidence that the male alpaca is mature and healthy enough to breed and has taken an interest in the female alpaca nearby.An alpaca orgle can be fairly high pitched and is created by the reverberations of the alpaca’s vocal chords.
The orgle sounds almost like a small engine running and is quite distinct from normal alpaca noises.

, Female alpacas are “induced ovulators” which means the act of intercourse or presence of alpaca semen can make them ovulate. Because alpacas do not have an estrous cycle like many other mammals, the female may need to be bred more than once; the first to induce ovulation and the second to impregnate the animal.A single mating is usually sufficient to make ovulation occur, but will likely not impregnate the alpaca.
Female alpacas may be induced to ovulate by being in close proximity to another mating pair of alpacas if you intend to breed multiple alpacas simultaneously.

, Most alpacas will breed with very little human involvement. Because alpacas are induced ovulators, artificial insemination is less successful than it is in other livestock breeds, so natural mating offers the highest chances of successfully breeding your alpacas. Place both of the alpacas in the breeding pen and allow them to interact.If the female is receptive to mating, it will sit in a “cush” position, which looks like laying on its stomach with its legs folded beneath it.
The male will continue to orgle as it woos and ultimately mounts the female.

, Female alpacas may not be ready to copulate when placed in a breeding pen with a male. A female alpaca demonstrates that she is not ready to copulate by “spitting off,” which is the act of actively avoiding the male, keeping its ears down and actually spitting away from or directly at the male alpaca.Spitting off usually occurs when the female alpaca is stressed by its environment or does not feel healthy enough to breed.
Separate the alpacas and attempt to resolve any stressors in the environment. If you do not separate them, the female may injure herself by attempting to get out of the pen.

, Some alpacas may actually become impregnated from the initial copulation, but the often only begin to ovulate as a result. A week after ovulation, place the breeding male and female back in the pen and observe their behavior.If the female enters a cush position and allows itself to be mounted, it is likely ovulating.
If the female “spits off” and avoids the male, it may either not be ovulating, or it may actually be pregnant.
Repeat this process in two more weeks to see if the female is receptive to mating or avoids it.

, The easiest way to determine if an alpaca is pregnant is to continue to place her in the breeding pen with the breeding male every two weeks. If the female did not become pregnant with the last mating, it will enter a cush position and allow itself to be mounted again. A pregnant female, on the other hand, will “spit off” from the male, lower its ears and avoid it.A female will likely allow copulation every two weeks until it has conceived, after which it will not allow the male near enough to mount.

, Once a mated female begins to “spit off” the breeding male, you can use a blood test to determine if the alpaca is pregnant. Blood tests measure the level of progesterone in the female’s body which can be a strong indicator of pregnancy, but can yield false positives. While you may be able to purchase livestock pregnancy tests from retailers, your best option is to have a veterinarian conduct the blood test. If the blood test comes back positive, have the veterinarian conduct an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy.An ultrasound is the most reliable method of determining if an alpaca is pregnant.
Conduct further “spit off” interactions with the breeding male every 8-12 weeks after a confirmed pregnancy to verify the pregnancy is continuing and has not been reabsorbed.

, Alpacas have long gestation periods for the fetus to develop. It usually takes about eleven and a half months for an alpaca to carry to full term and give birth to an offspring. Alpacas usually carry only one baby, or cria, at a time. While twins are possible, they are quite rare.After ten months you will often be able to feel the fetus by palpating the abdominal wall of the female.

, Female alpacas that are going to give birth soon will shift their behavior in the days leading up to it. While these behaviors are not always easy to identify, careful observation may give you an advanced warning that your alpaca will soon enter labor. Look for these signs:The female will separate itself from the herd and avoid interaction with others.
The female’s udders, vulva and anus may all become swollen or puffy.
The cervix plug is ejected from the female. This usually indicates birth will occur that day or the one immediately following it.

, You may want to be present when your alpaca gives birth to help if there are any complications. If things progress normally, it’s best to allow the mother alpaca give birth on its own with limited stressors introduced by your interaction with it. Alpacas almost always give birth in the morning and very rarely go into labor in the afternoon or evening hours.If the cria, or baby alpaca, leaves its mother facing upward, you should contact a vet as their may be a complication with the delivery.
It is normal for the cria to hang from its mother during the birthing process for up to five minutes.
Crias should emerge head and hooves first. If it begins to come out backward, contact a vet immediately.

, After a female gives birth, it may take a few hours to expel the placenta and for the newborn cria to emerge from the fine membrane covering it as it is born. This membrane dissolves, but you may want to allow the mother to lick the membrane off its young to expedite the process. The cria will then begin nursing and the other members of the herd will likely approach the mother and new cria.Alpacas are herd animals, so it’s important that you allow the herd to interact with its new member.
You may want to bring the cria to a vet after 24 hours to make sure it is healthy.

You also have to make sure that there are no plants toxic to the alpacas, such as acorns, buckwheat, and poppies.,
Design a barn for the alpacas to protect them from the elements.,
Enclose the land for the alpacas with a secure fence.,
Find a veterinarian knowledgeable about alpacas near you for emergencies, checkups or routine shots and other tests and treatments you may not be able to take care of doing yourself.,
Set up your farm by stocking up on protective supplies such as steel-toed boots, appropriate clothing, protective gloves, and disinfectants against their possible pathogens.,
Purchase or grow hay for the alpacas so they can graze as well as eat hay.,
Be sure to obtain adequate insurance for your alpaca business, especially mortality coverage for your most valuable breeding animals, and farm insurance for equipment and building coverages.

You are now ready to purchase your alpacas and start your farm!

",How to Run an Alpaca Farm," You also may need an agricultural farming permit if you want to have a large number of alpacas.;
, In the economically challenged environment of 2013, it costs between $100 and $750 each for non-breeder/fiber animals, and $1250 to $15,000 each or so to purchase production alpacas from a breeder. You may choose to apply for a farming loan from a bank. Some alpaca farmers can and will privately finance your purchase of their animals, so do inquire.

, You can manage 7 to 10 alpacas on an acre if you can employ rotational grazing with your acreage, but make sure you leave room for future alpacas from breeding. Alpacas do well on orchard grass or mixed grass fields of flat, rolling or even hilly terrain (they love to play ""King of the Hill"" and if there are outcroppings of rock or rocky ground, their two toes will receive natural nail trimming); alpacas require free choice minerals to make up for nutrients not readily found in the U.S. forage but which are more natural to South America, where they came from; and there also should be available, fresh water for them to drink. Parasites are the number one killer of alpacas in the United States, so it will be important to have fecal testing done periodically and to treat against worms and parasites on an as-needed basis.

, For more poisonous plants, you can go to the first link cited at the bottom of the page under ""Sources and Citations"".

, Their thick coat can protect them in the winter during decent temperatures, but they need shade opportunities in the summer and in extreme heat, and breaks from the wind, snow, ice and extreme cold temperatures in the winter months. Alpacas must also receive full-body shearing once a year after the last frost and before it gets too hot in your area.

, It should be at least four and a half to five feet tall. The fencing woven wire or boards should be no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart so their heads don't get caught in the fence. No-Climb 2""x4"" or sheep and goat 4"" x 4"" woven wire fencing combined with some degree of electric wire on the outside top and bottom of the fencing works best to keep out predators and keep your alpacas safe.

, Most people can, though, learn how to administer most preventative care themselves if instructed by a qualified, experienced mentor, veterinarian or veteran alpaca farmer. Practice helps, too, and provides more bonding with your alpacas and opportunities for you to become familiar with the subtle nuances of each alpaca.

, Further, it's always a good idea to employ a healthy degree of bio-security on any farm with livestock, and an alpaca farm is no exception.

, The hay should not smell musty or moldy and it should not look bleached or be dusty. Hay should look green and healthy.

Make a sound decision about why you are showing your alpaca.,
Know what the alpacas are being judged on.,
Register for the show.,
Obtain suitable clothing.,
Make sure the alpaca is trained properly.,
Bring the right gear and needs with you.,
Bring your alpaca's health papers.,
Be on time.,
Don't talk to the judge.",How to Show an Alpaca," Going to shows is hard work, tiring, but rewarding. You need to reach your own reasons as to why you want to show your alpaca to justify the expense, time, and effort that is required to show an alpaca. Main reasons that people show their alpacas include:


Getting the judge's opinion of your alpaca (if you get as far as the final deciding group)
Meeting up with other alpaca breeders
Promoting your alpaca stock
Winning a ribbon; for pride, or for increasing the value of your stockBenchmarking your breeding decisions against the decisions of others and sharing tips, ideas, and know-how; go on and feel the fleeces of winning alpacas so that you get a tactile impression of what the fleece should feel like; this can help you know what to aim for in your stock!;
, Before you even head off, you should be informed about the show's style, its requirements and what the showing seeks to emphasize. Note that there are variations in what is looked for in alpaca shows depending on where you are in the world and the reason for the occasion. In South America, alpaca showing can be an excuse for a fiesta, with the alpacas being part of the festivities. In the USA, alpaca showing can focus on the abilities of alpacas to navigate an obstacle course to demonstrate the owner's ""handling"" skills, or it can focus on the fleece as a commercially viable outcome of breeding alpacas, as is most common in Australia and New Zealand.Show associations can provide you will all the details you need to know; contact them in advance. A list of relevant show organizations is provided under ""Tips"". Showing an alpaca might include:


Division of alpacas by color
Division of alpacas by sex and age
Judging of fleece according to certain standards
Judging of handling
Possible judging of shorn fleeces if you have these as well.

, Most shows will require advance notice of your intention to bring your alpaca(s) along. Know which class or classes that you want to place your alpaca in and fill out the registration forms and send back in on time. Some shows will not permit late entries or will charge a late entry fee. Be sure to pay any fees required also, or you might find yourself disqualified for non-payment.

, Wear a white or black shirt, white or black pants, and nice shoes. Or wear a white coat as pictured here. Nothing too flashy and nothing that says your farm name or logo. This will ensure a neat and complementary presentation with you alpaca being the star, and you not upstaging it or distracting the judges.

, There is no point showing an alpaca unless you have already trained it to perform the correct show presentation. These are things to train your alpaca in:


Getting used to large groups of people and being viewed by people. This is a case of always handling your alpaca and having people around her.
Halter training your alpaca. She should be comfortable with being lead around from a halter.
Train your alpaca to halt, to walk, and to enter a trailer. It is really important that your alpaca is familiar with the trailer before you go, as this can be a frightening experience and might cause you to stay at home instead of going to the show if your alpaca shies away and refuses to enter it.
Play at judging with you alpaca. Have someone other than you run their hands through your alpaca's fleece, picking at the fleece here and there a few times prior to the show. This is what the judge will do, so best that the alpaca is prepared.

, Be sure to pack the following:


Alpaca's lead and halter - black. This is neat, often regulation and it is easy to find.
Food, e.g., hay, pellets, hay bag
Water and container (buckets)
Floor mats (if wished)
Promotional materials for your farm/stock
Clothes for you
Blanket for alpaca
Any medical requirements
Grooming needs

, You will be required to show these at many shows but it pays to find out what requirements your state, province or national show board has in place so that you bring along the correct documentation. It is recommended that you have your alpaca microchipped.

, If not, you will likely forfeit your chance. There is no re-run. Moreover, not being at the show at least an hour or so ahead means that your alpaca is being taken straight from the trailer onto the showing area without a rest or settling period and this is not good for the alpaca's nerves nor for yours.

, Let the judge perform his or her job unhindered by a running commentary. By all means respond to questions put to you but do not upset the moment by cracking jokes or boasting.

Have someone else soothe the llama and hold the reins.,
Put your hands at the withers (where the neck meets the body).,
Steady your position.",How to Ride a Llama1," You can now get on the llama.


It is important that the llama is calm before you get on the saddle.
If a llama becomes alarmed and fidgets while you are getting on, you can get injured.
Having someone else settle the llama while you are mounting the pack saddle can help.;
, Hoist yourself up onto the animal.


Swing your leg over the top of the llama to settle onto the pack saddle.
If you are too short to get onto the llama, try using a footstool for leverage.
Make sure you are secure in the saddle. If you aren't comfortable, adjust your position.

, Your back should be straight and you should be firmly mounted on the llama.


You want to have a comfortable and steady seat to avoid falling off or injuring yourself during the ride.
Make sure you can comfortably nudge the animal with your heels before you get going.
Make sure you can comfortably reach the reins without straining your arms or back.

"
"
Make sure your llama has a companion.,
Take your llama to the vet.,
Check your llama regularly.,
Score your llama.",How to Care for a Llama1," Llamas are extremely social creatures and need at least one other llama for its mental well-being. Llamas that are not socialized can be either extremely skittish or abnormally violent and aggressive. The ideal herd size for llamas is four to six animals. Once you have more animals than that, they will begin to split and form new herds. Female llamas in particular have a strong need to form a herd.Male llamas can be problematic and disruptive to the herd. If you have a male that is particularly difficult to manage, castration may help calm him down.
If you cannot afford to purchase a herd of llamas at once, consider buying one llama and then obtaining a rescue llama, which will be much cheaper.;
, Once you have purchased your llama, have your veterinarian give it an evaluation. If it has not already received them, your llama will also need its vaccinations.Depending on where you live, you will also likely need to have your llama dewormed at some point. You should also have your veterinarian check the overall health of the animal so that you can better understand what, if any, dietary supplements you need to provide.Generally, llamas are hardy animals that do not need much veterinary care. However, it is important that your local vet know your animal in case it ever needs medical attention.

, You should visit your animal every day to check on its overall health and wellness. Check to see if the animal has any wounds or issues with its fleece. You should also physically check your llama’s body fat every now and then.

, Because its fleece can mask its size, you should score you llama regularly. Simply, feel the thickness of the animal’s back at the base of its neck and give a gentle squeeze. If the back is “U”-shaped, the llama is the correct weight. If it is “V”-shaped, your llama is underweight. If it is flat, your llama is overweight."

Decide what you will be using your alpacas for.,
If you plan on breeding, decide whether you want to breed right away or wait until you are a bit more established and comfortable with alpacas.,
Make sure you have enough fenced-in land for your alpaca.,
Sow the land with hay, grass, etc.,
Figure out how your alpaca is going to get water:


A natural source is ideal, but harder to find.,
Set up some form of shelter for your alpaca.,
Unless you plan on fighting your alpaca every time you need to take it someplace, like the vet, you need to purchase a good halter and know how to properly fit it on your alpaca.,
Get a sturdy feeding trough/container.,
You will need a farm utility vehicle and/or small to mid-sized, reliable farm tractor with a loader.

,
Get a garden tractor and/or brush hog for mowing around the farm but also in your alpacas' grazing fields.

,
You will need a set of ""paca-poop-pick-up"" tools, such as rakes, shovels and scoopers, along with a cart or wheelbarrow or two to haul the muck away to the compost heap with.

,
An alpaca First Aid Kit is a must for routine care but also in case of emergencies.,
Be ready to spend a little money.,
Here are some places that you can look:


Alpaca breeders or farms
Online sites and ads
Newspaper ads
Llama breeders or farms.",How to Buy Alpacas," Some ideas are:


Breeding
Fiber (sales of raw or skirted fleeces)
Therapy
Education (including 4H for kids)
Supplying top quality fertilizer to Greenhouses
The creation and sale of End Use Products (scarves, mittens, blankets, pillows, in-soles, yarns, rugs, weed-block, fiber arts);
,


If you want to get a head start, purchase females that are pregnant.
If you plan on establishing a breeding farm, purchase young females and a herdsire (stud male alpaca), and perhaps a gelding (castrated male) to keep the stud company and later to babysit the weaning cria (alpaca offspring). You could also wait to buy a herd sire until you are ready for breeding.

, You need at least one acre per five to ten alpacas. The fence needs to be strong, at least four and a half to five feet tall, and the openings should be no more than four inches apart, otherwise the alpaca could possibly break the fence, jump over it, get their head stuck or squeeze through to the other side. An even bigger reason to make sure your fences are secure and of proper materials is because the wandering domestic dog is the primary danger to alpacas...dogs and coyotes. Alpacas don't generally want to escape from the security of their herd and farm, while roaming, stray dogs form packs and have been known to get into alpaca yards and attack, even kill entire herds of alpacas not adequately fenced and guarded.

, or buy your hay pre-cut. You will also need to add to your alpaca's diet:


Vitamin supplements
Natural hay. Contrary to popular belief, alpacas do not digest grains properly, leading to ulcers and possibly even death. Feed your alpaca a combination of organic hays and fresh vegetables in moderation. Be sure to avoid feeding fruits or vegetables too high in naturally occurring sugars and starches.

, Opt for streams and small rivers, rather than ponds as the water can get stagnant quickly. Better still, five gallon buckets refreshed with clean water daily is the best way to assure your animals are getting enough of good, clean water and will be a reminder to regularly scrub and clean the buckets. Large tubs are too easy to ignore, leading to algae and slime build up, and a growth of parasites that can make your alpaca sick.

Man-made streams. These cost more, but are worth it in the end.
A ""self-watered"" trough. Though these do not cost as much as a man-made stream, they are still pricey. But they are hooked up to a hose and set on a timer to fill the trough or bowls at specific times of the day, and are convenient.
A regular water trough. This is the cheapest, but you will have to fill it up at least twice a day with a hose or bucket yourself, depending on how many alpacas are drinking out of it.

, It needs to have adequate protection from the wind, sun, snow (mostly hail and sleet) and rain and be capable of keeping your alpaca warm and dry in the winter and cool in the summer. A three-sided shelter facing east or south works well, or a barn where the alpacas have free-choice to go in or stay out in adjoining paddocks.

, If your alpaca is not broken into a halter, you will either have to train it yourself or hire a trainer to do it for you. An alpaca halter should fit snugly, with the nose band high on the bridge near the alpaca's eyes, not low or loose, as is the case with horses or cows in halter.

, Alpacas require about 3' of space of area to eat within in order to keep them from feeling over-crowded and as if their food supply is threatened by the presence of the other alpacas in its group. Further, alpacas are smart, and can tip a regular feeding trough/container over easily. Another idea that works well is the installation of 8' or 10' vinyl gutters affixed to the fences, gates and/or sides of your buildings such that you can grain them with only one layer of grain or pellets, reducing the chance for the animals to gobble up too much food too quickly and choke. Shallow, sturdy rubber feeding bowls work well, too.

,,,, Ask your vet what you should put in this but here are a few ideas:


Large bandages
Splints
Aspirator Bulb
Bottle of Saline Solution
Natural Tears
Tube of Terramycin ointment (for the eyes)
Alcohol for sterilization
First-Aid Gauze and Tape, Pads and Cotton
A chute, tie-down system or other alpaca-specific device designed for restraining your alpaca, if necessary
A thermometer
A stethoscope
Vaseline or other lubricant
Sterile gloves (latex or other synthetic)
Probiotics or all natural, plain yogurt
A llama tape or scale to track the animals' weights and body condition
Novalsan or Betadine
Corid (for treatment of coccidia when it arises)
Ivomec, Ivermectin or other similar worming treatment/medication
Safeguard liquid or paste (or Panacur, some brand of Fenbendazole)
Vitamin B Complex
L.A. 200 broad spectrum antibiotic (found in most farm supply stores)

, A quality alpaca is rarely cheap, but you don't have to buy a million dollar show breeder.

, Often times they will know places where you can get alpacas.
A reputable Alpaca Agent or Broker. There are only a couple of true, full-time professionals specializing in this service in the alpaca industry, and they are real advocates for buyers while providing a valuable service to the seller/owners. The best brokers are experienced alpaca farmers that are also well connected to breeders all over the United States. They can help you find the animals with the genes that will get you closer to your goals a whole lot faster than you might otherwise. Working with one will save you a lot of time and money in the long run because they are usually selling other people's animals and want to see you get what's best for you, not just an alpaca off their farm because it's theirs and they want to sell it and make all the money.

Take the reins from your assistant.,
Use your reins to steer.,
Stop the llama when you are ready to dismount.",How to Ride a Llama2," Hold them firmly. Tap the llama with your heels to get it to start moving.


Gently nudge the llama with your heels to get it to start moving.
Don't kick the llama with your feet. This will hurt them and might cause them to scare.
Always be respectful of the animal. A gentle nudge is all the llama will need to know to move forward.

, You will need to pull them to the left or right to make the animal turn.


Pull on the left rein firmly but gently to go left.
Pull the right rein turn the llama right.
Never pull the reins suddenly or too hard. This can cause the llama some discomfort.

, To stop it, squeeze your thighs against the llama's rib cage.


This squeezing motion signals the llama to stop.
This movement won't hurt the llama if done gently.
Don't squeeze the llama too hard. Remember, you always want to treat the animal you are riding with respect.

"
"
Shear your llama regularly.,
Clip your llama’s nails.,
Trim your llama’s teeth if needed.",How to Care for a Llama2," If you have a wooly llama, you will need to shear it at least once, if not twice, a year. Because they have adapted to the cool and moist highlands of South America, a llama’s dense fleece can get too hot in the summer months. You should shear your llama in spring and be sure to leave at least one inch (2.5 cm) of fiber for protection against the elements.Classic llamas, as opposed to the wooly variety, do not produce as much wool and should rarely be sheared.
If you are new to shearing llamas, you should have an experienced shearer show you how it is done. You may also be able to hire someone to do it for you.
If you shear your llama’s fleece too short, it may get too cold or become sunburned.
Once sheared, you can sell your llama’s fleece.

, Most llamas will never need to have their toes trimmed. However, if your animal comes into contact with a hard surface, they may need a trimming every 2 to 3 months. If your llama does need its nails trimmed, use a pair of large animal nail clippers and make sure that the nails are flush with the bottom of the footpad. , Male llamas develop a set of sharp “fighting” teeth that they use against other males and intruders. You may choose to have your veterinarian remove these teeth to prevent any injury to other animals and yourself. However, if you keep your male away from other males, you may not need to remove the teeth.Be sure to talk with your veterinarian about removing your llama’s teeth.

"
"
Let your llamas forage.,
Feed your llamas grass hay.,
Provide your llamas with mineral supplement.,
Give your llama fresh water.",How to Care for a Llama3," Llamas are natural foragers that will get most of their nutritional needs met in your pasture. Compared to horses and cattle, llamas are exceptionally efficient eaters and can thrive in a number of pasture types. However, because they are such efficient eaters, they have a tendency to get fat when exposed to particularly healthy pasture land. Score your llama regularly to make sure that it is meeting its nutritional needs through foraging.Llamas need a diet that is 10-12 percent protein, so be sure to have your grass and hay tested to make sure you are meeting its needs.
Try to avoid feeding your llama grain. Llamas are susceptible to choking on it and can easily get fat from grain., If you live somewhere that has poor quality pasture land or gets regular snow fall, you will want to feed your llama grass hay. Ideally, you should feed your animal orchard grass. You can also feed them alfalfa, but it should never constitute more than 20 percent of its diet. Too much alfalfa can cause a mineral imbalance.You should avoid feeding your llama straw, clover and timothy.
Although it might be a little more costly in the short-term, good quality hay will keep your animal healthy and prevent expensive trips to the veterinarian.

, If you have poor pasture land or have to feed your llama hay in the winter, you will likely have to provide a mineral supplement. The best way to do this is to fill a feeder half-full of a commercial llama mineral and place it in the pasture. The llamas will eat the minerals if they need them. You can buy these supplements online or through your local farm supply store.Minerals are particularly important for pregnant and lactating female llamas. Without minerals, the females can get sick and possibly die.

, You should provide your llama with a source of fresh drinking water. A stock tank with a freshwater source is ideal. This will need to be high enough to prevent the llamas from getting in the water, but not so high that they cannot drink out of it. If the temperature gets below freezing, you will want to consider purchasing a stock tank heater to prevent ice from forming.Do not let your llamas have access to a stream, pond or other water source that they can get in. Llamas love water and will lounge around in it on warmer days. Unfortunately, this can ruin its fleece and result in fungal and bacterial infections on its skin."
"
Provide enough space.,
Create a shelter.,
Build a fence.",How to Care for a Llama4," Before you purchase your llama, make sure that you have the proper amount of pastureland. The general rule of thumb is to have three to four llamas per acre (1/2 hectare). However, if you only have two animals, it does not mean that they only need a half-acre of pasture. You need to make sure that you have enough land to graze your llamas, while the other half remains fallow.Consider testing the quality of your pasture grasses before placing llamas on the land.
Providing enough space for your llama will help keep them happy and healthy. Overcrowding can cause rampant disease.

, In most climates, a three-sided shelter will sufficiently protect your llama. Your animal needs to be warm and dry in the winter, and cool in the summer. Because they are naturally conditioned for cooler climates, a llama may not need a barn since its fleece will help keep it warm. However, if you already have barn, use it.Your shelter should be at least seven feet (2 m) tall and wide enough to accommodate multiple llamas., You will need to construct a fence around your llama, partially to keep it from wandering off, but mostly to keep predators away. Dogs, coyotes and other large animals may attack your llama and injure or kill it. To keep these unwanted animals away, surround your pasture with “no-climb” fence. This sturdy wire fence will keep other animals out and your animal in.You will want to purchase no-climb fencing that is at least 4 to 5 feet (1-1.5 m) tall.
If you already have a wooden fence, simply wrap the no-climb fence around it. This should keep most dangerous animals out.
You can buy no-climb fence at your local farm supply store.

Take your parrot to a veterinarian.,
Give your parrot antibiotics for the bacterial infection.,
Treat any secondary infections.,
Follow your veterinarian's directions for continued treatment.",How to Treat Parrots for Bacterial Infections1," If you suspect that your bird has a bacterial infection then it should be assessed and treated by a veterinarian. Your vet will likely have a conversation with you about the symptoms you have noticed, assess the bird's physical condition, and then run any necessary tests that will give him or her enough information to give a diagnosis and treatment plan.


It is best to take your bird to a veterinarian that is experienced with treating exotic birds. They will have the knowledge to properly assess, diagnose, and treat your pet.
However, aviary veterinarians, as they are sometimes known, are not always available in every area. This means that you should try to find one before you have an emergency situation and need to find one in a hurry.;
, Most bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. While there are problems with over-prescribing antibiotics for infections, which can lead to antibiotic-resistant strains developing, serious bacterial infections often require treatment with antibiotics in order to be eliminated.


Your vet will determine the type of antibiotic that needs to be used by assessing the type of bacterial infection, the severity of the infection, the location of the infection, and the sensitivity of your bird., Bacterial infections can take hold in your bird because it has another infection that is weakening its immune system. If this is the case, the additional infection needs to be eliminated in order for your bird to fully recover and be healthy.


Keeping infections at bay also requires that you keep your bird's area clean and tidy. Clean your bird's cage regularly and focus on good husbandry, such as avoiding overcrowding, when caring for a sick bird., Treatment length and type will vary depending on the type and severity of infection your parrot has. However, most serious bacterial infections will require continued treatment with an antibiotic after the bird is released from veterinary care.In the case of chlamydiosis, an infection that affects parrots, treatment with antibiotics usually lasts for several weeks.
In the case of mycobacteriosis, which is avian tuberculosis, treatment may be required for six months to a year before the condition is cleared up.

Make sure your parrot has bonded with you.,
Gather all your materials ahead of time.,
Get your bird used to the towel.,
Wrap the bird in the towel.,
Allow your bird to grasp onto your finger.,
Lift each nail with your thumb.,
Identify the quick.,
Trim your bird's nails.,
Give your parrot treats after clipping its nails.,
Have blood stopping powder on hand.,
Stop if your bird becomes extremely distressed.,
Have a veterinarian trim your parrot's nails if you cannot do it.",How to Trim Parrot Claws," You should know your bird's body language before attempting to trim its claws. If your bird does not feel comfortable with you, you should wait until you've bonded with it a bit before trimming its claws. The experience will be more traumatic if your bird doesn't trust you.If your bird sings, talks, or whistles in your presence, this is a sign it is comfortable with you.
If your bird flaps its wings in your presence, this is also a good sign. Your bird is attempting to get your attention and is happy to see you.
Your parrot may also wag its tail, much like a dog, to convey happiness.;
, Your bird may squirm or show signs of distress during the clipping process. Therefore, have your materials ready to go before you begin clipping your bird's nails. You do not want to have to be scrambling for anything while you work.You will need a pair of nail clippers. You can usually use nail clippers made for people as long as the blade is strong enough. If your parrot has particularly tough nails, try toenail clippers.
You will need some kind of blood stopping powder in the event your bird starts bleeding. You can find this at a pet store. Make sure the powder is safe to use on birds.
You will need a towel. Make sure it's a plain color, like white, as birds may be frightened of colorful towels.

, Do not immediately wrap your bird in the towel. This will cause too much anxiety. Instead, allow your bird to get accustomed to the towel on its own.Lay the towel down on your hand. Coax the bird to crawl on the towel. Call it softly and say things like, ""Good bird"" as it approaches the towel.
Let the bird stand on the towel for a few minutes. You want it to be comfortable with the towel before proceeding.

, You need to do this carefully to avoid injuring the bird. You do not want to put pressure on the bird's chest as you wrap it in the towel.Drape the towel over the bird's back. Leave its head uncovered.
Hold the bird at its sides without touching its chest. Wrap the towel around the bird's body.
Hold the bird's head with your other hand. This will prevent it from biting. Place your thumb on one side of the head, and your index finger on the other. Hold the bird firmly enough that it cannot turn its head.
Have a friend help, if necessary. You may not be able to trim your bird's nails on your own. Your friend can wrap the bird in the towel while you trim its nails., Your bird's feet should be exposed at the bottom of the towel. Place your finger near your bird's feet. Allow it to grasp onto your finger on its own. This may take a few minutes, so be patient. If the bird grasps onto your finger on its own, this reduces the stress of the clipping process., You want to clip the nails one by one. Once the bird has grasped onto your finger, use your thumb to lift each individual nail. Hold the nail in place with your thumb as you clip., This is vital to your bird's safety. The quick is the nerve ending in the nail. If you cut into the quick, your bird will bleed. It is possible for a bird to die if it bleeds during the clipping process.If your bird has clear or light colored nails, the quick should be easy to find. The quick is pink, and you should be able to see it in the nails.
With dark colored nails, this can be trickier. Just trim a small amount of the nail at a time. With darker nails, you should only ever trim off the tips of the nails as the risk of accidentally cutting into the quick is higher.

, Simply use the nail trimmer to cut off the tips of the bird's nails. Trim off a small amount of nail at time, keeping a good distance from the quick. You should only trim a small amount of your bird's nails to avoid hitting the quick. Trimming the tips is usually sufficient.You should also give the bird verbal praise for behaving during the clipping process.

, You want your parrot to associate nail trimming with happy, positive things. This will make it more likely to behave next time. When you're done clipping your bird's nails, offer treats as a reward., Rub the bird's nail in the blood stopping powder immediately if bleeding occurs. Then, get your bird to a veterinarian's office. Birds can bleed to death from this kind of injury., Birds can actually have physical reactions to stress. If you notice your bird is struggling to breathe, stop attempting to clip its nails. You will have to try another time.If your bird is panting, or if its eyes are rolling back into its head, stop. Put your bird back in its cage until it calms down. Speak in a soothing tone to encourage your bird to relax.
You should also stop trimming if your bird is squirming too much. If a bird will not keep still, this increases the risk of injury.

, You may not feel comfortable clipping your parrot's nails. If this is the case, take your bird to a vet. It's better to spend the extra money having professional help than risk injuring your bird."

Pay attention to signs of digestive distress.,
Assess your parrot's breathing.,
Look for signs of weight loss and anorexia.,
Be concerned about extreme lethargy and weakness.",How to Treat Parrots for Bacterial Infections2," Bacterial infections can impact your parrot's liver and GI tract. The symptoms of this distress usually include diarrhea that is green or yellow colored and urine that is bright yellow in color.The discoloration of feces and urine caused by a bacterial infection is usually due to excessive bile created by the liver malfunctioning.

, Bacterial infections can also impact your bird's respiratory health. If a bird is having a hard time breathing, it may have an infection in its lungs. Pay attention to coughing, wheezing, and other signs of respiratory distress.Additionally, your bird may have nasal or ocular discharge associated with a bacterial infection in its respiratory system or sinuses. These are visible symptoms that should signal to you that your bird needs to be assessed by a veterinarian.

, Parrots with bacterial infections often do not eat and become emaciated. Problems with digestion can lead to a lack of appetite, which then leads to quick and serious weight loss.If your parrot has not eaten for a day or two, you should get it looked at by a veterinarian to rule out an illness that needs treatment.

, Bacterial infections can impact your parrot's health so much that the bird becomes immobile and non-responsive. It may stop preening itself and abandon all self care. If the condition advances this far your parrot's health is in grave danger and it may pass away if not treated immediately.If your bird is so weak and lethargic that it cannot move then you need to get it to a veterinarian immediately. If your veterinary office is not open at that point, you should take your bird to an emergency pet hospital. At an emergency pet hospital your parrot can get supportive care, at the very least, which will ease any pain or discomfort it is experiencing.

Recognize symptoms.,
Visit your vet.,
Diagnose any secondary infections.,
Administer antibiotics by injection.,
Continue antibiotic treatment at home.,
Maintain good health and hygiene.",How to Treat Psittacosis in African Grey Parrots," There are numerous potential symptoms of Psittacosis in parrots, and the way each bird exhibits the condition will vary. If you notice even one of these symptoms in your bird, it is best to consult your vet. Psittacosis symptoms include:

Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Ruffled feathers
Green or yellow diarrhea
Trouble breathing
Nasal discharge,
Severe weakness
Trembling
Swelling around the eyes.;
, If you have recognized symptoms of Psittacosis in your parrot, bring them to the vet immediately. Your vet will examine your parrot, and run a series of tests to help diagnose the condition. False negative results are possible with these screenings, so it is important to run a combination tests to get an accurate diagnosis. If possible, bring your parrot to an aviary veterinarian, or a vet who specializes in exotic birds.Your vet will likely perform:

An antigen test
An antibody test
PCR-based tests

, It is possible for your bird to become sick with Psittacosis as the result of a weakened immune system. If your vet suspects that may be the case, they may run additional tests. Your parrot may need additional treatment or medication to treat any secondary infections present., The primary treatment for Psittacosis is a regimen of antibiotics. Often your vet will prescribe doxycycline, tetracycline, or a combination of these. Once your parrot has been diagnosed with Psittacosis, your vet will likely inject a strong dose of these medicines., You will likely need to continue giving your parrot antibiotics after they return home. These antibiotics (usually doxycycline, tetracycline, or a mix) will come in liquid form. They can be added to your parrot's water.Follow all dosage instructions from your vet.
Continue to administer antibiotics for as long as your vet has advised. Do not stop early even if your parrot seems better.

, Some birds may exhibit no symptoms of Psittacosis (these are called carriers), but then shed the illness in their feces or nasal discharge when they are otherwise sick, crowded, or stressed. You can reduce the chances of your parrot contracting Psittacosis by keeping their cage clean, avoiding over-crowded, providing a healthy diet, and keeping up with regular veterinary care.Psittacosis can be contracted by humans! It is very important for you to wear gloves and a face mask when you clean your parrots cage.
A clean, well-ventilated cage can reduce the instance of respiratory infections like Psittacosis.

Take note of secondary symptoms.,
Look at the bird's beak.,
Get your bird tested.",How to Treat Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease in Lories and Lorikeets1," Check the feathers on their wings and tail. Watch out for feathers that fall out easily. You might also see bleeding at the molting site. These symptoms are common in birds infected at a young age., Infected birds might fly weakly. Some might lose their ability to fly altogether. This is true whether or not they lose their feathers., Familiarize yourself with your bird's natural coloration, especially where they have yellow feathers. Check the tail feathers and primary feathers for patches of yellow in the wrong places. Older birds might develop irregular patches of yellow in their green body feathers., Pay attention to a drop in vocal activity. Be on the lookout for lethargy, as well. Depression often results from discomfort such as abdominal pain and muscle spasms., PBFD weakens birds' immune systems and leaves them susceptible to bacterial, fungal, and other viral infections. Call your vet if you see symptoms including:

Green or mucous-like diarrhea
Vomiting
Difficulty eating
Weight loss, Beak abnormalities aren't very common in lories and lorikeets, but it never hurts to double check. Familiarize yourself with the normal length of your bird's beak and be on the lookout for any growth. Look for brittleness and fractures. If your bird has advanced PBFD, they might develop a decomposition of the hard palate., If your bird exhibits one or more visible symptoms, take them to the vet as soon as possible. The vet will test their blood, feathers, and feces. They might also perform a biopsy on suspicious feather follicles.If your bird tests negative the first time, take them for retesting in one month. Sometimes PBFD is difficult to detect in its early acute stage.If your bird tests positive the first time, don't panic. It could be a false positive from affected feather dust in the lab. If the second test comes back positive, start taking action for supportive care."

Night Frights.",How to Understand Your Parrot," Just as you brush your teeth after every meal, your bird must clean its beak too. You'll see your parrot wiping its beak on the perch after eating.;
, Before your bird’s bedtime or nap, you may hear strange grinding noises coming from your parrot. This is the sound of a contented bird, and is nothing to be alarmed about.

, Just like us, your bird needs to stretch from time to time.

, It's normal for your parrot to take a few naps during the day.

, Birds are territorial creatures and will defend their environment if they feel threatened. They will scream or make a sound like boiling water. Sometimes a change in your appearance will make the bird think that you are a stranger.

, Birds will preen (groom) themselves on a regular basis.

, Your bird may be excited, nervous, lonely, or happy - check your bird's body language to make sure.

, Some birds are prone to night frights, These “night frights” occur when there is a loud noise in the middle of the night that will end up startling a bird into a thrashing frenzy. If this happens to your bird, leave a dim light on somewhere to give some light the back motion light on outside to give some light in the room.

Isolate birds you suspect to be infected.,
Give your bird nutritional supplements.,
Provide supplemental heat.,
Treat secondary infections.,
Trim your bird's beak, if necessary.",How to Treat Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease in Lories and Lorikeets2," Do this as soon as you detect symptoms of PBFD. Maintain enough distance from healthy birds to prevent the spread of the virus through airborne dander. Keep the birds isolated for two months or as long as it takes to get them tested twice., In some cases, nutritional supplements can suppress the virus and allow your bird to live a long, healthy life. Typical regimens consist of vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. Ask your vet for specific recommendations and dosages.

If your bird appears to make a recovery, don't assume they're cured. They'll always be infected and should be kept away from other birds., Illness and feather loss can lower a bird's body temperature to dangerously low levels. Purchase an infrared light and a thermometer from your local pet store. Place the light one one side of the cage, so your bird can get to close to it and move away as needed. Maintain the temperature at 25–35 °C (77–95 °F) 24 hours a day., Because birds with PBFD have weakened immune symptoms, they can die from secondary infections if they're not treated promptly and aggressively. As soon as you see the telltale symptoms, contact your vet. Only they can make the proper diagnosis and prescribe the right treatments., If your bird's PBFD causes their beak to grow too long, it can affect their ability to eat. Don't try to trim the beak yourself. Take your bird to your vet for a safe and humane procedure."
"
Quarantine new arrivals.,
Disinfect your home with with Virkon-S. No known disinfectant can actually kill PBFD.,
Control dust in your home.,
Vaccinate unexposed birds, if possible.,
Report suspicious deaths in the wild.",How to Treat Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease in Lories and Lorikeets3," If you already have a bird, keep their new housemates quarantined for about two months. During this time, have the new birds tested for PBFD at least twice (once per month). This is because of the possibility of false positives and false negatives.

If you decide to release your bird(s) into the wild, have them tested first. Otherwise, you could start an epidemic that could spread to endangered species., However, Virkon-S can deactivate it. First, clean affected surfaces of all organic matter. Then, apply a 2-percent concentration of the compound to all affected surfaces. Let it stay on the surface for at least 10 minutes to be effective. After the 10 minutes has passed, rinse the surface with water to prevent corrosion.

The 2-percent concentration of Virkon-S is safe for humans and birds. However, if the affected area has poor ventilation, play it safe and move the birds to another room.You can buy Virkon-S at many online retailers. Simply enter “buy Virkon-S” into your favorite search engine.

, PBFD can be transmitted by inhaling infected dust. Install a pleated filter on your furnace and place an electrostatic precipitator on the nearest return air duct. Use room-size air cleaners and vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters. Standard filters won't control dust as effectively., Australian vets have seen promise in an experimental vaccine involving a dead virus. It works best in birds age 14 days and younger. Take your bird(s) to the vet as soon as possible to test for strains of the virus. If they test negative twice, return to the vet in one month for a booster.Have adult birds vaccinated one month before you plan to breed them, as PBFD can be transmitted from mother to offspring., PBFD in wild populations is most common in Australia and New Zealand. If you live in these or other area where exotic birds live in the wild, be alert for deaths of parrots, cockatoos, and budgies in groups of three or more. Report them to your local government provider of environmental protection."

Accept parrot behavior.,
Reward good behavior.,
Clicker train your parrot.,
Avoid punishment with yelling or making loud noises.,
Teach your parrot to speak softly.,
Be consistent.,
Use strobe light training.",How to Train Parrots to Make Less Noise1," Screaming is a natural behavior, and you simply can't completely stop it. Parrots are exceptionally vocal, especially during waking hours and before bed. If you cannot handle a loud pet, consider a different home for your parrot.


Allowing your parrot to scream during the morning and evening may be helpful in training it not to scream throughout the day.Parrots are also curious and bright creatures. Training your parrot will give it mental stimulus and interesting things to learn. The mental task might decrease squawking on its own.;
, Any time your parrot stops screaming when you've left the room, or mimics your soft, muted tones, give your parrot a delicious treat, praise, or click if you are clicker training (keep reading for the last method).Try a variety of treats with your parrot until you learn what it likes. Then use the treats that it responds the best to, but reserve these ""special treats"" for training purposes. Eventually, your parrot will associate that treat with its good behavior.Birds tend to prefer colorful treats with a lot of flavor. Some bird experts recommend treats like Nutri-Berries or yogurt-covered nugget treats designed for parrots, like Kaytee Yogurt Dips.Break treats into small portions. This allows your parrot to eat quickly and remain focused on the training, without getting too distracted by the reward.Reward your bird immediately after it obeys you. It's important for the reward to be seen by your bird as a quick and immediate response. Otherwise, your parrot may not make that association.Give your parrot verbal praise every time you give it a food reward for its good behavior., Parrots are very trainable, respond well to clicker training, and will appreciate the mental stimulus. Mental activity will help decreasing squawking significantly. Clicker training a parrot not to squawk is parallel to clicker training a dog not to bark. Get a clicker and small, ingestible parrot treats.


First associate the clicker and treat with one another. In front of your pet, click the clicker and “immediately” give the treat afterwards. Do this until your parrot starts watching expectantly for a treat after the clicker--this is a sign that they have successfully associated the two together.Use the clicker as you would a treat. The clicker replaces the need of providing a treat, which can be expensive over time, messy, and difficult if your bird is a picky eater.
Mark each correct behavior with a click. If needed, follow up a click with lots of praise and treats to fortify the “clicker and treat” association.

, This is what people naturally use when correcting behavior problems in pets, but it sends the message to your parrot that acting out will be rewarded, and it won't help you train your parrot. If you scream at your parrot, it may become frightened and make more noise, or it might believe that you're joining in, something wild flocks naturally do.Ignore your parrot when it screams. It will take some patience, but ignoring attention-seeking behavior is the best way to train your parrot out of its excessive screaming.
Even a facial expression can give your parrot the reward it was looking for. It's best to leave the room and completely ignore your parrot when it screams for attention.
Be prepared for louder screaming. Just like a toddler throwing a tantrum screams louder when it doesn't receive a reaction, your parrot will scream even louder. But be patient and be consistent, and eventually it will stop.
Return to the room once your parrot has been silent for at least 10 seconds. When you return, give your parrot the attention it is craving. Over time this will cement in its mind that desirable behavior is rewarded and undesirable behavior is ignored.

, You won't be able to make your parrot stop talking altogether, but you may be able to train your bird to whisper or speak softly instead of screaming. Practice, patience, and consistency are key when trying to train your bird to stop screaming.Continue to ignore undesirable behavior.Speak softly to your parrot. Use hushed tones, or ""communicate"" with it through whistles., Consistency is the key to any animal behavioral training. Doing things one way some of the time and another way other times will only confuse your parrot. Praise and reward it every time it behaves well, and ignore it every time it acts out., Note that strobe lights may be very unpleasant for birds. This should be treated as more of a last resort, rather than as a standard training method.


Set up a strobe light near the cage, controlled by a remote control switch.
Any time the bird screams, you can trigger the flashing strobe light without being the room (entering the room would be seen as a positive in the bird's eyes).
Your parrot will find the strobe light unpleasant, and will quickly learn that acting out results in undesirable flashing lights."
"
Turn out the lights.,
Keep the noise down.,
Avoid quick movements.,
Take note of its reactions.",How to Train Parrots to Make Less Noise2," Some birds feel over-stimulated when exposed to too much sunlight. Parrots generally need between 10 and 12 hours of sleep each night. Exposure to more than 12 hours of light each day can lead to elevated hormone levels, aggressive behavior, and increased noise output. Close the curtains in the afternoon to limit sunlight exposure, and put a sheet or cover over your bird's cage when you go to bed.Make sure there's enough air flow coming in under the sheet you use.
Do not use polyester, as this fabric does not breathe well.
For best light blocking, use a black cloth.

, Some parrots respond to environmental sound with their own sound. If you're watching television or listening to music at home, keep it at a relatively low volume. Keeping things quiet at home may produce a calmer, quieter bird.Talk quietly. Birds will often quiet down to hear what you are saying.
Try providing white noise for your parrot, especially if it screams when you're not home. The television is fine (at a low volume), but be wary of leaving nature shows on, as the sound of birds squawking could provoke more noise from your parrot.

, It's possible that you or someone in your household is moving too quickly around your bird, causing it to feel anxious or over-stimulated. Move slowly around your bird, and encourage everyone else in your household to do the same.Always supervise children when they handle or interact with the parrot.
Discourage children from running through or around in the room your parrot is in. This may frighten or excite your bird.

, It's possible that your bird is distressed by the sight of certain physical characteristics. Wearing a hat around your bird may cause it to feel uncertain or anxious about who you are. Likewise with certain types of eyewear, and even certain colors in clothing. If your bird is only making excessive noise on certain occasions, it could be in response to something that's different about you or someone in your home. Try to avoid wearing whatever upsets your bird, or expose it to it slowly and gradually so it becomes used to it."

Check for health issues.,
Ensure that your parrot's needs are being met.,
Change up your bird's toys.,
Give your bird reassurance.",How to Train Parrots to Make Less Noise3," Sometimes screaming can be caused by pain, and it's worth a trip to an experienced avian veterinarian to check that your parrot doesn't have health issues.Blood feathers (aka pin feathers) may be difficult to diagnose at home. A blood feather is a new, growing feather, which will always have a vein and artery that runs the length of the feather. If irritated or broken off, this feather can cause bleeding. It is not usually life-threatening, but can be painful for your bird. Apply pressure to the site of the bleeding. If it continues to bleed, you may need to take your bird to the vet to have that feather removed.Overgrown toe nails can be painful for parrots, making it difficult to perch properly and posing a risk of getting snagged and broken on fabrics around the house., Check that the cage is not too small, that your parrot has plenty of suitable toys to play with, and that it has enough food and water.


Parrots need a diet of around 70% pellets of formulated parrot food, supplemented with plenty of healthy vegetables and the occasional fruit.Parrots require at least an hour of playtime with you. Also expect to provide plenty of interaction throughout the day in addition to at least 1 hour of play. If you're unable to provide this, consider finding another home your parrot.
Parrots need ten to twelve hours of sleep every day or they can bite or scream; you can use a bought cage cover or simply a blanket to cover their cage every night to ensure they receive enough sleep., If your bird is prone to boredom but responds well to toys, it's possible your bird needs new stimuli on a regular basis. Try giving it a new toy every few weeks, and change up what type of toys you give him.Birds like toys with a variety of sizes and stimulating textures that are conducive to chewing or standing on.Toys with sounds can be particularly attractive to parrots.Birds like mirrors. It allows them to look at themselves, and some birds may think they are seeing a different bird.Provide your parrot with interactive toys. Something with a ladder or some type of puzzle component will engage your bird and challenge it intellectually.Make sure the toys you choose are not too big or too small for your bird., Birds in the wild participate in ""flock calls"" as a way of communicating with other birds and ensuring the safety of the flock. If your bird is prone to squawking when you leave the room, it could be its attempt at sending you a flock call. Try squawking back at it from the other room to let it know where you are and reassure it that you're safe.

Check for nasal discharge, plugged nostrils, swollen eyes, discharge from the eyes, bad breath, white patches in the mouth, or a slimy appearance to the mouth. Affected birds might also be depressed and/or lethargic and lose weight suddenly., Look for curvature in your bird's spine or legs. Check for limping or favoring of a wing, which could signal a broken bone. Watch for bending of your bird's beak as they eat. Other symptoms include seizures, tremors, depression, trouble swallowing, weakened vocalizations, lack of balance, and involuntary eye movements., African Greys aren't as prone to obesity as other parrot species, but that doesn't mean they're immune. Look for abnormal body girth and difficulty breathing. Check for evidence of dermatitis on their feet. Be alert to any evidence of joint pain, which could signal arthritis., Fortunately, this condition is rare in parrots, but it never hurts to know what to look for. Check for sudden weight loss, loss of appetite, vomiting, a bloated abdomen, and difficulty breathing. Look for yellow or green crystals in your bird's urine. These symptoms signal problems with the heart, liver, and/or spleen."

Try a thistle feeder.,
Experiment with suet feeders.,
Hang a hummingbird feeder.,
Choose plastic, steel, or glass.,
Look for drainage holes.",How to Use a Backyard Bird Feeder1," The first step to planning your backyard habitat is to discover which wild birds frequent your geographical area. Purchase the appropriate feeder and seed type for the birds you would like to attract.


The National Audubon Society publishes a number of field guides for wild bird enthusiasts.
Visit an online reference like eNature, where you can click your region on a map to learn about the types of birds in your area, Spring migration routes, when they will arrive and how to attract them.;
, Hopper feeders will attract many wild birds, including finches, jays, cardinals, sparrows, and chickadees. House feeders are often easy targets for squirrels, and you will need to keep an eye on the food to make sure it isn't getting wet.

, A window feeder is held to a window by suction-cups, and is usually made of plastic. Window feeders attract finches, sparrows, chickadees, and titmice. Be sure to check that food isn't becoming soiled, because birds will be feeding while standing on piles of seeds inside the feeder., This is a special tube feeder, with very small openings that dispense tiny thistle (or nyjer) seeds. Thistle feeders are attractive to small songbirds, especially redpolls and finches. A variant of this is the thistle sock feeder, which is a fine-mesh bag that birds cling to while extracting the seeds., These are cages made of wire mesh, or bags made of plastic mesh, filled with suet and nailed or tied to a tree trunk or suspended from a branch. Suet feeders attract woodpeckers and nuthatches, chickadees, titmice, and jays. For a simple version of this feeder, you can smear suet directly into the knotholes of trees., These are either bottle-shaped or saucer-shaped, and filled with artificial nectar or sugar solution. They are usually made of plastic or glass and have bright red plastic flowers to attract hummingbirds. Some hummingbird feeders have plastic mesh screens over the feeding holes to keep bees and other insects out of the nectar., These are often much easier to keep clean than old-fashioned wood or clay feeders that have porous surfaces. Plastic, steel, and glass feeders usually last longer than their wooden counterparts, which become weather-worn after a few seasons. If you are looking for an eco-friendly solution, commercial bird feeders are available that are made of recycled plastic., Examine the feeder before buying it, to be sure it has sufficient drainage holes on the bottom. This helps keep the seed dry, so help keep it from becoming moldy. A plastic dome that covers the entire feeder will also help keep rain out."
"
Supplement Vitamin A.,
Treat any secondary infections.,
Feed your bird Vitamin A-rich foods.",How to Treat Nutritional Deficiencies in African Grey Parrots2," Your vet will start the process in the office during at least an overnight stay. Expect to supplement about 100,000 IU/kg per day. However, the exact dosage will depend on how severe your bird's deficiency is., These can be more dangerous than the deficiency that caused them. Tell your vet about your bird's symptoms in detail. Your vet likely start the treatment at the same time as the vitamin supplementation. Follow their instructions if you have to continue the treatment after your bird comes home., Your vet will likely recommend a pelleted diet high in Vitamin A. If they say it's safe, make your bird's diet 65-80 percent formulated foods and 15-30 percent fresh fruits and vegetables. Feed them foods like broccoli flowerettes, carrots, nectarines, parsley, and turnip greens. Serve the food in small enough servings for bird to eat safely."
"
Treat bone fractures.,
Provide high-calcium foods and calcium supplements.,
Supplement Vitamin D3.,
Provide ultraviolet light.,
Cut back on high-fat foods.,
Supplement magnesium, if necessary.,
Expect different age-related results.",How to Treat Nutritional Deficiencies in African Grey Parrots3," MBD can result in weakened or broken bones. Tell your vet if your bird fell off their perch or has been showing evidence of a fracture. After an x-ray confirms a fracture, your vet will give your bird a splint. Follow your vet's instructions about changing the bandages, cleaning the wound (if necessary), and providing pain relief., Your vet will start your bird on a regimen of 100 mg/kg of calcium gluconate. Follow your vet's instructions regarding continued supplementation. When your bird comes home, feed them foods like broccoli, kale, turnip greens, and collard greens., Vitamin D3 helps birds' bodies absorb calcium much better than Vitamin D2. African Greys don't absorb Vitamin D very well from food sources. Therefore, your vet will likely prescribe liquid vitamins like Avitron or powdered supplements like Superpreen, which are easier to absorb. Follow your vet's dosage instructions.Too much Vitamin D3 can cause too much calcium to build up in vital organs like the kidneys. Stick to the dosage your vet prescribes., UV light helps African Greys produce their own Vitamin D. Whenever possible, place your bird's cage in natural sunlight. This can be in an open window or outdoors away from possible predators. When natural sunlight isn't possible, shine an ultraviolet bulb into the cage. You can buy it at your local pet store., Too much fat binds calcium in your bird's digestive tract and prevents it from being absorbed into the body. Cut back on Brazil nuts and sunflower seeds, making them only an occasional treat. Eliminate commercial seed mixtures, which lack essential nutrients., Your vet might prescribe magnesium if your bird is having seizures. Magnesium might also help raise calcium levels in your bird's blood plasma. Follow their instructions in terms of the dosage and how long you'll need to supplement., Adult birds who developed MBD after birth respond to treatment better than juvenile birds who were born with the condition. Don't be disappointed if a bird born with MBD develops stunted legs or wings even with proper nutrition. The key thing is to get your bird diagnosed and begin treatment immediately to prevent further damage from developing."
"
Switch to a mostly pelleted diet.,
Serve up some fruits and veggies.,
Cut back on seeds.,
Encourage movement around the cage.",How to Treat Nutritional Deficiencies in African Grey Parrots4," Pellet foods are formulated to contain most or all of the nutrients your bird needs. They're also low in fat. Follow your vet's instructions in terms of how much and how often to feed your bird. Usually, pelleted food should make up about 85 percent of an obese bird's diet., If it's okay with your vet, make them about 15 percent of your parrot's diet. Aim for calcium-rich dark leafy greens, protein-rich legumes, and Vitamin A-rich carrots and sweet potatoes. Birds also need carbs and fats in their diets, but they should make up a very small part of this 15 percent. Check with your vet for what's right for your parrot., Seeds provide essential fats, but there is such a thing as too much. Talk to your vet about how much your parrot needs. If your bird likes their seeds too much, ask your vet for pointers about reducing seeds without upsetting your feathered friend., Buy a larger cage for your bird. Divide the food into smaller bowls and place them at different ends of the cage. Provide a hanging rope for climbing and a rope perch to improve your bird's balance. Install stairs if your bird's wings are clipped. If your bird's wings aren't clipped, give them a flight cage outside. You can purchase any of these at your local pet store."
"
Cut back on iron-rich foods.,
Eliminate foods high in Vitamin C. Stop feeding your bird citrus fruits.,
Provide necessary medications.",How to Treat Nutritional Deficiencies in African Grey Parrots5," Your bird still needs iron, so don't cut off their iron intake entirely. Reduce the amount of bananas, mangos, papayas, squash, and skinless potatoes you feed them. Substitute these foods with honeydew melons, peaches, plums, and peeled apples., Avoid beetroots, carrots, chili peppers, and spinach. Never give your bird baby food, juices, nectars, or commercial food formulated for humans or other animals. In addition to Vitamin C, they also contain too much iron for avian bodies., Give your bird iron-reducing supplements like tannins and fiber. Feed them whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Work with your vet to work out a schedule for regular blood tests, probably for the rest of your bird's life."

Keep safety in mind.,
Wait until the right age.,
Find a tag.,
Make sure the breakaway buckle works correctly.,
Allow the kitten to familiarize itself with the collar.,
Place the collar around the kitten's neck.,
Test the collar's fit.,
Supervise your kitten at first.,
Understand the benefits outweigh the risks.",How to Put a Collar on a Kitten," As cats, unlike dogs, are able to climb and jump in a variety of places, safety concerns for collars are of particular importance. Make sure you select a collar that will not harm your kitten.


Avoid collars made from elastic or those that contain elastic inserts. As these are stretchable, cats have been known to push their legs through in attempt to get the collar off. This can result in cuts the upper leg and joint injury.Over-the-counter flea collars sometimes contain chemicals harmful to cats. In fact, many flea repellents should not be used by kittens at all. Talk to your veterinarian about flea control rather than buying a collar yourself.For a kitten, who is likely very playful, your safest choice is a breakaway or quick release collar. These collars are secured with a breakaway clasp that will come undone in response to pressure. This prevents your kitten from inadvertently choking if the collar gets snagged on anything.;
, Kittens should not wear collars until they are at least 6 months old. The muscles in their necks have time to build and grow, and most cat collars would not fit a kitten younger than 6 months. Wait until your kitten's reached that age to get him a collar., The main reason cats and kittens need collars is identification purposes. Less than 2% of kittens in animal shelters are returned to their owners, so it's important to have your contact information with your kitten in the event he gets lost.If possible, choose a tag that doesn't hang. Hanging bits, like tags and bells, are a safety concern as these can snag on tree branches and other outdoor hazards. This increases the risk of choking. A breakaway collar minimizes the risk, however. If you have a breakaway collar, a non-hanging tag might not be necessary.Tags are available online or at local pet stores. Non-hanging tags clip flat on a collar. Your tag should include your name, your cat's name, your phone number, and other contact information., If the buckle is defective, this defeats the purpose of a breakaway clasp.


Place your finger under the collar and pull. It should come undone in response to pressure. If it doesn't, have the collar exchanged for one with a working clasp.As you don't want to put the kitten's collar on twice, which can cause undue stress, conduct this test using a stuffed toy.

, Place the collar on the floor and allow your kitten to inspect it as his discretion.


Gently coax your kitten into the room where the collar is. Never rush a cat or kitten, as this can cause stress and elevate the situation's tension.Let your kitten sniff the collar and familiarize himself with it.If possible, rub your kitten's fur on a towel and rub the towel on the collar. That way, the kitten's scent will be on the cloth and the collar will smell familiar. You can also rub the collar on the kitten's bedding or toys., Once the kitten is familiar with the collar, you can safely place it around his neck.


Pet the kitten for a minute to calm him down. You do not want him to start off his relationship with his collar on stressful grounds.
Once he's calmed, gently wrap the collar around his neck. If he starts to resist and pull against the collar stop, let him relax, and try again. You do not want to cause strain to his neck. The collar should not pull against his throat while it's being secured. If he squirms, you may need to enlist the help of another person.
Fasten the breakaway clasp until you hear a soft clicking. Undo the towel restraint and release your kitten.

, A collar should fit snugly without causing strain to your kitten's neck. Make sure the collar fits your kitten properly after putting it on.


Ideally, the cat's collar should be snug enough that you can slide two fingers under the collar. If you can fit more than that, tighten it. If you can fit less, loosen it., Your kitten needs to be supervised when first using the collar. Do not simply let him wander unsupervised until he's accustom to the collar.


Your kitten might try to take the collar off at first. He'll paw at it, rub his neck against surfaces, and attempted to scratch it off with his back legs. Keep on eye on him as long as these behaviors continue.Once your kitten has accepted the collar, you can let him roam unsupervised., Many people are wary of putting collars on cats or kittens due to perceived health risks. However, with proper precaution collars are very safe and beneficial especially if you have an outdoor cat.


In a study conducted through Ohio State University, 538 collared cats were studied for a six month period. At the end of the study, the majority of the cats were still wearing their collars and only a few suffered injuries. None of the injuries were serious or fatal.Collars greatly increase the chance that, if lost, the cat will be returned. While microchipping is also an option, cats are not always checked for a microchip if found and oftentimes cats without collars are assumed to be stray or abandoned.

Sit down.,
Let the kitten smell your hand.,
Pet her chin.,
Scratch her cheeks.,
Rub around her ears.,
Rub the base of her tail.,
Stroke her back.,
Practice being gentle.,
Stop if the cat is distressed.,
Pet her daily.,
Let other people pet her too.,
Get her used to you touching her paws.,
Work your way to touching the ears.,
Brush her weekly.",How to Pet a Kitten," When you are first letting your kitten get used to you, it’s best to get down to her level when you want to interact. Birds of prey are natural enemies of felines, so cats will instinctively fear anything looming over them.When you want to play and pet your cat, sit down on a chair, couch, or on the floor to make yourself seem less menacing. If it’s comfortable, you can even lie down on the ground.
You can use treats or toys to get her attention, but try to let the cat come to you.;
, Especially if you're dealing with a shy, semi-feral, or unsocialized kitten, allow the cat to smell you before touching her. Once she approaches, hold your hand out toward her and let her smell you.As long as the cat is calm and not scared, slowly and gently reach out and pet her.
Start by petting the areas that cats use most often to mark their scents. Many cats enjoy being pet in these areas, which include the base of the chin, ears, and tail, as well as the cheeks., As the kitten becomes accustomed to you and gets used to you petting her, you'll come to learn her favorite spots where she likes to be pet. Many cats, however, liked being rubbed under the chin.


After your kitten approaches and smells your hand, slowly move your hand below her chin and use the back of your hand or your fingertips to rub and scratch under her chin and where the jaw and skull connect.

, After a moment of petting her chin, slowly move your hand slightly up to rub the kitten’s cheeks just behind her whiskers.


If the kitten rotates her head and pushes her face into your hand, this is a sign that she enjoys your petting.

, While some cats don’t like having their ears touched, many do like having their heads scratched at the base of the ears, behind and between the ears, and the area between the ears and eyes.Slowly move your hand from her chin to her cheeks to her ears, petting and gently scratching her face as you move between these areas.

, The haunches, which are the buttocks and thigh area, is a favorite petting spot for many cats. Gently rub around the base of her tail. You'll know she enjoys it if she lowers herself down on her front legs and raises her back end into the air!, Place your hand gently on top of the kitten’s head and gently stroke her back all the way to her tail. Some cats don’t mind being pet in the opposite direction (from the tail toward the head), but some hate this, so start with the head-to-tail direction first.


Once your cat is used to being pet, you can rub her chin, cheeks, and around her ears, and then stroke your hand down her back to her tail, where you can rub her haunches.

, Kittens are delicate creatures and it can be easy to injure them by accident, by being too rough or dropping them.Don’t squeeze the kitten, hold her too tightly, or grab her tail or ears.


When you hold her, place one hand behind her front legs and use the other to support her backside.
Older children must be taught how to handle the kitten gently and how to hold her properly, and they should never be allowed to grab the kitten by her scruff.
Children under five shouldn’t be allowed to handle kittens at all, because they don’t understand the difference between gentle and rough touching., Kittens and cats show distress, fear, and anxiety in many ways, and if your kitten exhibits any of those, you should stop petting her and leave her to calm down. Signs of fear and anger include:


Hissing, growling, and spitting
Ears that are turned back, sideways, or flat against the headAn arched back
Fur standing on end, As long as your kitten is over five days old, she should be gently handled and pet every day to get used to being touched. This will help her bond with you and get her used to the smell of humans.


Socializing kittens and getting them used to being touched is most important during the first seven weeks of their lives (minus the first week or two)., As long as they're people you trust to be kind and gentle, get your kitten used to as many people as possible by letting friends and family pet her too. This socialization will increase the chances that she’ll develop into a loving and friendly adult cat., Many cats don’t like having their paws touched, but working your kitten up to this will help her learn to enjoy being pet, and will make clipping her nails much easier.


Start by gently rubbing your kitten’s chest between her two front legs, and slowly move your hand down one of her legs until you're touching her paw. Go back to her chest and repeat with the other leg. When you’ve done this, reward her with a treat.Gradually increase the amount of time you spend touching her paws until your kitten becomes accustomed to having them touched. Be sure to reward her with treats.

, Start by scratching the back of her head around her ears. Then with one finger, gently stroke one of her ears and go back to scratching her head. Repeat with the other ear and reward her with a treat.Each time you do this, gradually increase the amount of time you spend touching her ear, until it’s no longer an issue. When you're getting her used to this, don’t forget to reward her with treats.

, Use a small brush or one that’s designed for cats. Brush in the direction that her fur grows (brush from head to tail) for a few minutes each week.Not only will this get her used to being touched in different ways, but it will also help to reduce shedding and fur balls.

Try to install your feeders about 10 feet from natural cover like trees or shrubs.,
Arrange your feeders at different heights.,
Place your feeders a safe distance from windows.,
Prepare for colder months.,
Keep nectar and thistle feeders up year-round.,
Check for sharp edges.",How to Use a Backyard Bird Feeder2," Evergreens are ideal, because their thick branches provide year-round cover from predators and protection from winter winds. However, leave a buffering distance of about 10 feet, so predators can't jump onto the feeder from branches or roofs. Also try to space your feeders apart to prevent overcrowding., Just as different varieties of birds are attracted to different kinds of feeders, they also have their own preferences as to the height of the feeder. If you have multiple feeders, try to arrange them at different levels throughout your yard.Ground level feeders attract juncos, mourning doves, towhees, and sparrows.
Table level feeders attract cardinals, finches, and jays.
Higher-level, hanging feeders attract titmice, goldfinches, and chickadees. Hang these feeders about 5 – 8 feet above the ground.
Tree trunk feeders and knothole feeders attract wrens, nuthatches, and woodpeckers.

, You can help prevent collisions by placing feeders more than 30 feet away from your windows. You can also place them very close to the window – within 3 feet – so if they are attracted to the window's reflection, they won't have built up enough momentum to seriously injure themselves.Window strikes kill millions of birds each year, when birds see the reflection of trees, sky, or clouds and don't realize the glass is there.
Some birds will also attack windows during the spring mating season, when a male bird sees its reflection and thinks it is another male competing for females.You can try to make a window less transparent by keeping certain lights on or off inside the house, or drawing the shade.
You can also place stickers or netting over the window, so birds will realize the glass is there.

, Most wild birds only need your help during periods of the year when they require more energy, during migration times and cold spells. Plan to put feeders up for late winter and early spring, when birds have difficulty finding food in the wild. In the summer, seeds are more plentiful and young birds need to learn how to find food on their own., Hummingbirds have very high metabolisms, and will benefit from having access to nectar throughout the year. Goldfinches nest later in the year than other birds, so you can leave nyjer feeders up from winter through early fall, when thistles go to seed., If a bird is scratched by a sharp edge, the open wound is susceptible to disease. You may also be injured when you are refilling or cleaning the feeder. If you find any sharp edges, file them down with a metal nail file or sandpaper."
"
Try sunflower seeds.This seed attracts the greatest variety of birds in most North American regions.,
Feed a variety of foods for different birds.,
Mix your own bird food.,
Find a good place to store your bird food.",How to Use a Backyard Bird Feeder3," Black-oil sunflower seeds are best, as they have a high meat-to-shell ratio and fat content and are thin-shelled enough for small birds to crack open. Striped sunflower seeds are larger and have thicker seed coats and proportionately less meat per seed.

, Add other seeds to your feeders, according to the types of birds in your area. Most tree-dwelling birds are attracted to sunflower seeds, but certain varieties prefer other types of food.Jays like sunflower seeds, suet, corn, millet, and milo.
Woodpeckers like sunflower seeds and suet.
Doves and other ground-feeding birds are attracted to white millet or red milo.

, Commercial mixes are often a blend of sunflower seeds and cheaper, “filler” seeds like oats, wheat, flax, or buckwheat seeds. Birds will pick out the sunflower seeds, and leave the rest to spoil. It is usually cheaper and more effective to mix your own feed, because there is less waste. Less waste seed also makes your feeders easier to clean.


For a simple home-made bird feed, purchase 25 pounds of black-oil sunflower seed, 10 pounds of cracked corn, and 10-pounds of white proso millet.
Pour the seed into a clean metal trash can, and blend the mixture with a broom or rake handle., Keep seed in a cool, dry place, in clean metal trash can and secure the lid to keep rodents out. Check your seed for mold on a regular basis, and dispose of any contaminated food. Try not to buy too much seed at one time, to avoid expensive waste."
"
Change your nectar.,
Clean your feeders regularly.,
Plan for winter vacations.,
Watch for dazed birds around windows.",How to Use a Backyard Bird Feeder4," Hummingbird nectar should be changed every three to five days to prevent potentially fatal fermentation and mold. Clean the feeder with hot water and a bottle brush, then dry it thoroughly before refilling it.Never feed hummingbirds honey, which ferments easily and readily grows mold that can kill hummingbirds.

, Try to clean your feeders at least once a week during busy feeding periods, to keep them free of contaminants that can harm birds and spread disease. During slow times of the year, cleaning them once every two to three weeks should be enough. Dispose of any uneaten seed, then scrub the feeder with hot water and a bottle brush. Dry your feeders thoroughly before refilling them.If you need to clean your feeders more thoroughly, rinse clean surfaces with a dilute bleach solution of one part bleach to nine parts water.
Avoid using soap or detergent, which can be toxic to birds.

, If you live in an urban or suburban area, your local birds should be okay while you are on vacation – they can easily find food in a neighboring feeder if yours run out of seed. However, if you live in a very rural or isolated location, try to arrange for a friend or neighbor to refill your feeders while you are out of town during winter months., If you see a bird collide with a window, carefully place it in a shoebox or similar dark container with a lid. Leave the box in a warm, quiet location where pets and other predators can't reach it. Check the box frequently, and release the bird once it appears awake and alert.


Do not try to give it food and water, and resist handling it as much as possible.
If you find an injured bird, you can take it to a vet or wildlife agency – but bear in mind that it's illegal in many areas to handle a migratory bird without a permit."

Select a time to put the collar on.,
Let your cat investigate the collar.,
Put the collar on your cat.,
Check the fit of the collar.,
Check your cat's collar on a regular basis.,
Choose a safe collar.,
Examine the collar.,
Avoid elastic collars.",How to Put a Collar on a Cat," The collar will be a new experience and sensation for your cat, so it will be important to choose a time of day when she will be a little less resistant to having the collar put on. You could try putting it on during her meal time or play time, when she will be distracted with another activity.You could also choose a time when she is calm, such as when you are spending quiet time with her., Place the collar on the ground near your cat so that she can get used to it before you put it around her neck. To help her get more comfortable with the collar, you can put her own scent on it. To do this, you can rub the collar on your cat’s bedding.You can also rub a soft cloth around your cat’s mouth (if she will let you) and then rub this cloth on the collar.The collar may not seem so foreign and strange to her if she recognizes her own scent on it.


You could also purchase a synthetic pheromone spray at your local pet store and spray this on your cat’s collar.Do not rush your cat’s investigation of the collar.

, When your cat is calm and content, slowly and gently place the collar around her neck. Talk to her in a soothing and reassuring voice while you are putting the collar on to make the experience as comfortable as possible for her. Give her a treat when you have the collar on so that she can begin to make a positive association with wearing it.Your cat will probably fidget with, or scratch at, the collar and try to get it off the first time that you put it on.The first time that you put the collar on, leave it on for a few minutes then take it off.Put the collar on your cat each day, leaving it on for longer and longer each time.Your cat may need some time before she’s more comfortable with wearing the collar all day.
Consider giving her a treat each time that she has the collar on and doesn’t try to get it off. Eventually, she will get used to the collar being on without needing a reward.
If she manages to get the collar off on her own, put it back on but do not give her a treat—she may think that she is being rewarded for getting the collar off.

, It is very important to make sure that your cat’s collar does not fit too tightly or loosely around her neck. You will know that the collar fits correctly if you can snugly yet comfortably slide two to three fingers between the collar and your cat’s neck.Your cat may tense her neck when she has the collar on for the first time, so you may need to wait a few minutes until she relaxes her neck muscles before testing the fit.Do not put pull or tug on the collar when you are sliding fingers under it.
If the collar does not fit correctly the first time, remove it from your cat and adjust it accordingly.

, Your cat may lose or gain weight as she gets older.If significant enough, her weight changes could cause her collar to become too loose or too tight. If you notice that her collar is hanging loosely around her neck or seems to be squeezing her neck, take it off and make the necessary readjustment.

, When you walk into your local pet store, you will notice that there are many types of cat collars from which you can choose. Despite the many choices, keep in mind that safety is the most important feature of any cat collar.Breakaway collars are considered to be the safest type of collar for cats, since they will automatically open up if your cat accidentally gets her collar stuck on something (e.g., window blinds, furniture).Breakaway collars will typically have a fastener that will automatically unclasp with enough pressure.
Some collars come with attachments, such as bells. Although these attachments can be useful for an outdoor cat (e.g., alerting potential prey to the cat’s presence), they can also get caught or stuck on things, which could be dangerous for your cat., Before you purchase the collar, run your fingers along the entirety of the collar. It should not have any rough or sharp edges that could irritate your cat’s skin. You should also check to see if the stitching has started to unravel. If the collar has a fastener, make sure that the fastener does not have any sharp edges when fastened.Consider testing the strength of the fastener before leaving the store. Pull on the collar with varying amounts of pressure. The fastener should release with a moderate amount of pressure. If it releases with barely any pressure at all, then your cat could slip out of the collar too easily.The amount of pressure needed to release the fastener will depend on your cat’s weight and size.For example, a heavy cat would probably need a fastener that releases with more pressure than would be necessary for a light cat.

, Some cat collars will have a section of elastic fabric woven into them, which would stretch to the point where your cat could get out of the collar if it gets stuck on something.However, elastic collars can serious injury to your cat if she happens to get her leg stuck through it.Elastic collars also have the potential to get stuck over your cat’s jaw, which can cause serious injury.


If you choose an elastic collar and it gets stuck on your cat in a way that causes injury, take your cat to your veterinarian immediately for treatment."

One error many novice or uninformed bird owners make is to feed their bird an all-seed diet.,
Supplement the diet with fresh veggies and fruits, as well as foods such as cooked brown rice or hard boiled eggs.,
Limit dairy products, as birds are sensitive to Lactose.

,
Make sure your birds' water is clean and fresh and change it at least twice a day, or as needed to keep it clean.

",How to Manage Your Pet Bird's Diet," Seeds do not provide adequate nutrition for your pet bird. It is horrifying to meet a bird owner who is making the mistake of feeding their bird solely millet sprays-an excellent treat but NOT an appropriate diet. Imagine a human living on potato chips-it may keep them alive but their quality and length of life will suffer.Make sure your bird has a good staple formulated diet, such as pellets. Some seed diets say they are balanced, and some are certainly more balanced then others-some even have pellets included. While excellent in theory, the danger is that the bird, much like a toddler presented with a bowl of healthy cereal with marshmallows-will eat the less healthy parts and ignore the good stuff. This is one reason why sunflower seeds, found in many bird foods, should be kept to a minimum as they are very fatty, taste good, and are very tempting to your birds. If you feed your bird a seed/pellet mix, make sure they are eating all of it.;
, Do not, however leave these fresh foods for more than an hour in the cage, as bacteria can build up.

Keep the door to the bathroom closed.,
Place the toilet paper out of the cat's reach.,
Make the roll unable to spin.,
Put the toilet paper in an enclosed container.",How to Prevent Your Cat from Unrolling Toilet Paper1," The simplest option for keeping your cat from unrolling your toilet paper is to close the door to the bathroom. Unless your cat knows how to open doors, this will stop any mischief surrounding the toilet paper.

If your cat's litter box is in the bathroom, then this is not an option for you. You will need to find another way to keep your cat from unrolling the toilet paper.;
, If you have a small kitten or a cat that doesn't climb, you may be able to stop them from unrolling your toilet paper by placing the toilet paper on a high shelf or isolated shelf. This will keep the cat away from the toilet paper. However, you need to be sure that you can reach it while you are sitting on the toilet.

Some cats will see a new, high shelf as a challenge and an exciting new thing to explore. If your cat is like this, then this solution won't work. You need to think about your cat's personality and behavior when finding a way to keep it from unrolling your toilet paper., When a cat is scratching at a toilet paper roll it becomes a fun game because the roll spins and spins. If you can limit the rolls spinning, it may make the game less fun for your cat. A simple way to do this is to squish the cardboard inside the roll of toilet paper so that it does not roll off the holder so easily.If you have an upright toilet paper holder, you can put a stick or other item in the cardboard hole so that the roll is pinned against the holder and won't spin. Simply remove the pin when you want it to spin it again for toilet paper removal.

, There are a variety of child-proof toilet paper holders that are available and will work well for keeping your cat at bay. Look in the child safety section of your local big box store or search online for the right product.Some child-proof toilet paper holders limit the amount of paper that can come off the roll at one time. Other holders simply cover the paper when not in use.

Avoid nuisance birds.,
Eliminate hawks.,
Keep squirrels out of your feeders.,
Eliminate pesky insects.,
Get rid of rats or mice.,
Don't feed the bears.,
Keep your cats inside.",How to Use a Backyard Bird Feeder5," Starlings and crows, in particular, have a tendency to take over bird feeding areas. You can adjust your feeders if they are plagued by aggressive, dominant birds that are frightening other birds away.Use suet feeders that are only open on the bottom, forcing birds to feed while hanging upside-down – woodpeckers, nuthatches, and chickadees feed this naturally, but starlings are usually unable to.
To protect small birds, hang tube feeders with short perches and no catch basins, so large birds have nowhere to perch.
If an aggressive hummingbird is keeping the others from eating, hang several feeders in different parts of your yard, so it can only see one or two at a time.
Avoid spreading food on the ground, or using open-air platform feeders, as this attracts larger, aggressive breeds of bird.

, If your wild birds are being plagued by hawks while they try to feed, try taking the feeders down for a few days. Your birds will feed elsewhere, and the hawks will move on to another area with more prey. Then put your feeders back in place, and the small birds should return., Squirrels may be cute to watch, but they eat all your feed and scare the birds away. Squirrels are notoriously clever animals, so you may need to experiment a little to find a good solution.A squirrel baffle is an inverted plastic bowl that hangs above the feeder – when a squirrel lands on the baffle, it will slide off onto the ground. Some bird watchers use old vinyl records, 2-liter soda bottles, or plastic salad bowls as baffles.
Feeders that hang from a horizontal pipe or wire can be protected with plastic tubing. Thread the horizontal supporting line through sections of plastic tubing – when a squirrel tries to climb across the wire, the tubing will spin and dump the squirrel off.
Avoid coating poles with oil or grease to protect your feeders from squirrels. Animals can freeze to death when their fur or feathers lose their insulating properties because they are matted in oils or grease.

, If ants, wasps, or bees take over one of your feeders, you will probably need to move the feeder to another part of your yard. Avoid using toxic chemicals to kill insects in your yard, because most insects are an integral part of the food chain. Harsh chemicals may also injure or kill the very birds you are trying to help., Rodents love bird food, and can quickly become a problem if you aren't careful. If one of your feeders becomes infested with mice or rats, take down your feeders for a couple of weeks to encourage the rodents to look elsewhere for food. Then clean your feeders thoroughly before returning them to your yard.


Try protecting your feeder with a large tray placed underneath it, to keep rodents from getting to the seed.
Clean the catch-tray regularly, because bird droppings from the feeder may contain salmonella, which will then spread among your birds., Bears hibernate during the winter, and then emerge in late March. If bears are a problem in your area, you'll need to take precautions to avoid drawing them into your yard. In this situation, it's best not to feed birds at night from late March through November.Take your feeders down and bring them inside at night.
Always hang feeders 10 feet above the ground and 6 feet away from tree trunks.
Never feed birds by spreading seed on the ground, or leave seed on the ground after cleaning your feeders.
Store your bird seed indoors, or in a securely locked shed or garage with a sturdy door.
Avoid hanging bird feeders on your front porch, or near your doors.
If you do see a bear, remain indoors and call animal control. Never approach a wild bear.

, Domesticated cats are one of the main causes of death among wild birds in populated areas. Try to keep your cat indoors if possible, to keep it away from your birds – an indoor life is safer for your cat, as well. To avoid trouble from neighborhood cats, be sure there aren't any branches or fences near your feeders that could provide a cat easy access to your birds."

Consider whether you want to clip your budgie’s wings.,
Keep your budgie comfortable.,
Don’t try to tame your bird right away.,
Start by opening the cage door.,
Train your budgie to hop onto a stick.,
Train your budgie to hop onto your finger.,
Move your budgie while it is perched on your finger.,
Let your budgie spend time outside of its cage.,
Let your budgie sit on your shoulder.,
Keep your budgie healthy and happy with toys.,
Continue to talk to your bird.",How to Gain Your Parakeet's Trust," This can be a difficult decision to make once you get your bird. If you have questions about clipping the bird’s wings, talk to your veterinarian.Trimming your bird’s wings does not cause it any pain, when done properly by a professional. With its wings trimmed, your budgie will not be able to fly for a few months, until its feathers grow back. That way, you can leave its cage door open, and the budgie can explore more with less chance of it escaping. This can make it easier to train.
On the other hand, not everyone likes the idea of altering a bird. There are also concerns that the inability to fly can be distressing to a bird.;
, Make sure that your budgie has an appropriate cage and easy access to food and water. All the necessary supplies can be found at pet supply stores. Keep the cage in a room that is moderate in temperature. If the temperature feels good to you, then your bird should be comfortable as well., When you first get a budgie, give it a few weeks to get used to its surroundings. Then you can start to tame and train it.


If possible, keep your budgie’s cage in a room where you spend a lot of time. This will help it get used to the sight of you.Play music around your bird. This will get your budgie used to the volume level of your home, and it may enjoy hearing the music.
Talk softly to your budgie when you give it water and food, so that it will create positive associations with you. You can also make a point to leave treats on or just inside its cage., Open the door of your budgie’s cage and carefully insert your hand. Talk softly to the budgie. Try to coax it into eating a treat, like a sunflower seed or millet, from the palm of your hand. This may take several tries, so be patient.


Do not try to grab your budgie at this early stage. Let it come to your hand instead. If your budgie moves around in the cage when you insert your hand, leave it there until the bird calms down.Each training session should last about 10 minutes., After your budgie trusts you enough to eat treats from your hand, you can try getting it to hop onto a perch or stick. Open its cage door and carefully insert the perch. Very gently press the perch against your bird. With some time, it will learn to move onto the perch.


For now, just let your budgie stay on the perch in its cage. Don’t try to move it out of the cage yet. Your budgie needs more time to develop trust in you.

, Once your budgie is used to hopping onto a perch or stick, you can place your finger next to the bird to see if it will hop onto it. When your budgie is on the perch or stick, you can also try placing your finger next to the perch to if the bird will hop onto it.


If your budgie is not startled by the presence of your hand, you can try rubbing your finger on its belly while saying “up.” When you set it back on its perch or the cage, say “down.”, If your budgie has gotten used to hopping on your finger, and can perch on it securely, then you can try to move it on your finger out of its cage.


Move your budgie very slowly and carefully as you are taking it out of its cage, especially for the first time. You do not want to startle the bird.Do not try to move your budgie around very much when you are trying to get it used to coming out of the cage. Keep the training sessions short., Once tamed and trained, your budgie will need at least an hour per day outside of its cage for exercise and play. Make sure all windows and doors are closed for safety. It is also a good idea to cover windows and mirrors so your budgie does not accidentally fly into them.

, Once your budgie is comfortable being moved around outside of your cage, you can try to set it gently on your shoulder. Many budgies can be trained to perch there.

, Budgies will enjoy having a number of toys to choose from. You can use these toys as an opportunity to bond with your budgie. Try rotating toys regularly (at least every month) to keep it happy.Good budgie-appropriate toys should be available at pet supply stores and include:


Ladders
Swings
Mirrors
Bells
Wooden chew toys (these are good for keeping your budgie’s beak trimmed)
Non-poisonous house plants. Your budgie can fly from its cage to the plant and back., You want your budgie to be used to the sound of your voice, so continue to talk to it as it bonds with you.


Many budgies can be taught to mimic words and noises.

Keep a proper temperature.,
Be conscientious.",How to Take Care of a Parakeet," Look into Alexandrine Parakeets, Indian Ringneck Parakeets, Black-tailed Parakeet or anything else available where you live. Budgerigars, or Budgies, originate from Australia so they are likely to be a cost effective choice for Australian's wanting to have a pet parakeet. Other parakeet species come from South America, Africa and parts of Asia but can be successfully kept as pets with the correct environment and equipment. (like toys);
, Just as with getting other types of pets, you want to make sure you’re purchasing from a reputable breeder. Check for online reviews to get extra feedback. Ask to view the breeder's other birds and check they are kept in clean airy conditions, have plenty of space, and seem calm and well cared for.


Make sure the birds aren't overcrowded on the perches, and check to see that they are being fed clean, quality food, including fresh fruits and veggies. Also make sure that there is a cuttle bone or mineral block in the cage. These are vital to a birds diet.

, Check that there is no crusting around the cere (the spectacles above the beak) and that the vent is clean. The vent refers to the spot from where the bird defecates, and a dirty vent is a sign of digestive problems.Avoid birds that seem lethargic and don’t move from the bottom of the cage.


Make sure the birds look content, vigorous, and in optimal health. You may need to visit at different times during the day, as parakeets take naps and look drowsy at times during normal waking hours.

, Parakeets are sociable birds and enjoy being kept in pairs or groups. If you purchase a single bird, you need to be able to spend time with the bird every day to satisfy her need for company.If you do decide to get multiple birds, make sure only to cage parakeets together and not with other types of birds.

, Even if your parakeet looks healthy, they often don’t show symptoms until they are very ill, so you should have your new parakeet looked at by a vet very shortly after getting it. The vet will likely test for psittacosis, which is a dangerous bacteria that can be passed to you and your family. The vet will should also test for internal and external parasites, yeast, Macrorhabdus fungus, and certain other kinds of bacteria.

, The size of the cage should measure at least 18 x 24 x 24 inches, but purchase the largest cage you can. Prioritize the horizontal measurements because parakeets fly horizontally rather than upward., The cage should be made from stainless steel. Unfortunately, many other metals such as zinc, brass, or lead can be toxic to parakeets, and you should never use a rusted cage or one with chipping paint. Never buy a circular cage, because they do not provide enough flight space, and a parakeets' little feet could easily be injured by the tapering bars near the top of the cage. , Parakeets love to climb, so you should select a cage with horizontal bars, allowing him to grip on and shimmy upwards. The bars should be less than half an inch apart. Otherwise, there is a risk the bird will get his head stuck between them., Line the floor of the cage with paper towels or copy paper, both of which are better choices than newspaper. When this is soiled with droppings, throw it away and reline the cage with clean paper., You will need a food bowl and a water drinker. You can mount each to the bars of the cage away from the bottom, which keeps them from getting knocked over or from having the bird contaminate them with waste.If you cage multiple parakeets together, provide a separate food bowl for each, so the dominant bird cannot fight the others away from the food., The ideal choice for perches is branches of natural orchard wood. Ideally, choose a branch diameter large enough that the bird’s toes do not curl around and overlap each other. This will likely be around 3/8” in diameter. Orchard wood such as apple, plum, pear, or cherry is safe for the parakeet to peck at it, and it has a naturally abrasive action which helps keeps his nails trim.The wooden doweling perches provided with most cages are poorly designed for birds. The diameter of the doweling is too narrow for a bird to grip comfortably, and they do not wear the claws down., Parakeets have lively, inquiring minds and need plenty of mental stimulation. Put a selection of toys in the cage, so he has something to play with. Toys that parakeets particularly enjoy have mirrors, bells, or ladders to climb up and down.Toys are needed to keep the bird healthy and entertained. Boredom can lead to screaming.

, This ensures that the bird has proper company. Parakeets feel safe with they have an area to retreat to, so putting the cage against a wall is a good idea (rather than the bird feelings exposed on all sides). Avoid putting the cage beside a window or door, where it might be in danger of direct sunlight or drafts because they are very sensitive to temperature.Bird cages should never be allowed in the kitchen.The fumes from some cooking oils—and even from the finish on some frying pans—are toxic to parakeets and can make the bird very ill., Changing out the paper at the bottom of the cage isn’t enough on its own. Clean the cage bars with soap and water regularly, particularly after you've clipped food to the bars. 

, Though seeds are a very common diet for parakeets in the wild, they are also a source of bacterial infection and can easily lower the health and lifespan of your bird. Bacteria can build up and overwhelm your bird over time. Consider converting your parakeet’s diet to roughly 60-70% pellets. Birds adapt to pellets at various rates, and initially may reject them, perhaps vigorously. However, about 90% of parakeets will convert within two weeks using the following plan:


Give birds seed for only one hour in the morning and one hour at night.
The rest of the time they have to snack on pellets.
Generally, the 10% of parakeets that don't switch in two weeks will switch after a short period of reverting to a seed diet.

, As well as the seeds, feed a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables such as kale, beets, peas, carrots, parsley, cooked yams, sliced apple, mandarin oranges, citrus, and the like. If you vary what you offer the bird—never give the same fresh food two days in a row—this avoids any dietary overloads that might be associated by feeding an excessive amount of one food.Try clipping pieces of apple or carrot to the bars at which your bird can peck. For larger fruits and veggies, you can also chop them up in a food processor to food in your bird’s food bowl.
Most fresh foods are safe for parakeets EXCEPT for avocados, eggplants, apple pips, rhubarb, tomato plant leaves, and potato plant leaves. You should also never give your parakeet caffeine, chocolate, or alcohol., Let the bird get used to you and the surroundings, doing nothing but maintaining his food/water and cage, before trying to train the bird to perch on your finger.

, Millet sprigs or ""sprays"" are a favorite treat, but don't feed too much of it (about 1/2"" per day), as it is fattening like junk food. Avoid sweets or excess oats, both of which are fattening.


Millet sprays are also one of the best ways to train the parakeet to perch on your finger.

, Parakeets need company so be prepared to spend at least ninety minutes a day—though not necessarily all at once—chatting to your bird or interacting. Parakeets can be clicker trained as well, which is a fun way of stimulating the bird mentally and encouraging her to bond with you.


Without regular and sufficient attention, parakeets will lose interest in human interaction. A pair will tend to bond with one another (regardless of sex) and ignore humans, but through interaction, you can be considered part of the flock.
A way to interact with your bird is to sing together, give it baths and if it seems to be rapidly dropping a mobile toy, pick it up. There is a chance it is trying to play a game with you.
Sometimes parakeets get lonely. A good way to get them happy again is to talk to them.
To get them to climb up on your finger, push a little bit on their stomach, and say, ""Step up."" By continuously saying that, they will start to say it by themselves, and will ""step up"" whenever they say it,which will usually be when they come to a stair/ledge.

, Although the bird can fly in the cage, it is a good idea to let the bird out once a day for free flight. Obviously, be alert for hazards and close windows and doors, extinguish candles, and that sort of thing. Again, clicker training can come in handy to test your bird a command when it’s time to return to the cage.


Many things you might not immediately consider can be dangerous to parakeets. Before allowing your bird out of the cage, remember not just to close windows, but also: put away potentially dangerous shiny objects such as knives in the kitchen, turn off all fans, keep them off the floor around children and other pets, etc. The safer you can make the environment, the better.

, Parakeets will sleep approximately ten hours a day, mostly at night, but they can nap during the day as well. When your parakeet is asleep, try not to make too much noise, though music or the television at low volumes is still okay.


At night, parakeets like the security of being covered, so drape a towel or pillowcase over the cage.

, Parakeets are sensitive to large swings in temperature. They do well with average household temperatures, but always make sure their cage has a shady spot where they can retreat and try not to let indoor temperatures exceed 80°F (27°C). Do not place the cage in direct sunlight.

, Parakeets are a lot of work, but you will find them an affectionate and funny companion. Most will talk and how much they learn is really up to you. Be prepared to do some daily care and maintenance, as well as giving them attention and playtime, or consider getting another hobby.

Provide your parakeet with an ample-sized cage.,
Place your parakeet in a room with light.,

Move your finger closer to the end of the dowel.,
Take the parakeet out of the cage while it’s perched on your finger.,
Have friends and family hand train your parakeet in the same way.,
Allow the bird to sit on other parts of your body.",How to Hand Train a Parakeet," When you first bring your parakeet home from the pet store, you’ll probably be given a carrier box. This box will do for the trip home, but should most certainly not be used as a permanent housing space. Your parakeet needs enough room to live and avoid boredom. This means it’ll need several places to perch so it can watch you during your daily routine.


When transferring your parakeet to its new cage, be sure to open the cage door and put the box up to the tip of the cage door. Don't put your hand in there and try to force the bird out. You want to let the bird come out on its own.
Patience is the key to getting your bird in the cage. If you shake the box and tilt it, you're just startling the bird more. This will cause the bird to want to move back further into the box.;
, A good environment is vital to a healthy life for your parakeet. Do not put parakeets in a dark room that is quiet. If your room is bright and you are interacting with the parakeet, it will feel comfortable. Make sure the cage is level and in an area with adequate, but not too much foot traffic., Before you even begin to hand train it, you’ll want your parakeet to be used to your voice. Keep your voice at moderate levels with a normal speaking tone. Talk to your bird about anything you want to, just be sure to talk to it. It will hear your voice and want to inspect the source of the sound. Only after it isn’t startled by your voice and your physical presence outside its cage should you begin training.


This is also the first step to train your parakeet to talk. Choose language you want your parakeet to repeat., You should change your parakeet’s food and water every day. Birds can be very particular about their food and water, just like people. They might perceive something as tainted and refuse to touch it.


Food: Make sure that you place at least a tablespoon of seed in a parakeet’s food bowl every day. Your parakeet will eat the seeds, but leave shells and discarded parts of the seed in its bowl or near it while eating. Many new parakeet owners confuse this refuse with new seed and don’t feed their parakeets as regularly. Change its food every day to avoid this problem.Water: Fill its water dish every day. Tap water works well. Don’t add vitamins or medicines if you can help it. Some parakeets will refuse to drink this water if it tastes additives., The water should be no more than one to two inches deep. Your bird will bathe itself. It doesn’t need to be bathed by you. Every couple of days replace the bird bath water. If your bird gets comfortable outside its cage, you can purchase mountable bird baths that attach to the outside of the cage., There are numerous different products out there designed to line a parakeet's cage, yet most are actually dangerous for parakeets. Cedar shavings contain toxins that can affect your bird’s digestive tract. Pine shavings can be ingested by your parakeet and cause digestive problems too. Cat litter absorbs moisture and if ingested can cause serious issues. Stick to paper products. You can purchase paper designed for parakeet cages or you can just use unscented paper towels or unprinted newspaper.Inspect your parakeet’s cage daily for excess fecal matter. You should change its lining every couple of days.

, Parakeet toys come in all shapes, sizes, colors, textures, and smells. Many even make sounds. The more variety you give your parakeet the happier it’ll be. Your parakeet needs stimulation to be happy just like. Don’t let your parakeet get bored.In the long run, the happier your parakeet is, the easier it will be to hand train it.

, Do this repeatedly. Make sure that you are inserting your hand slowly and in a non-threatening way. Don’t shake your hand around needlessly. Don’t shake the cage or hit your bird. Your goal is to teach your bird to trust that your hand won’t hurt it.Lots of parakeets may fly around or squawk at you. However, remain still so it can determine that nothing will happen at this point., After your bird gets used to your hand being in its space, a treat will tell your bird to value your hand. Your hand should signify a safe and even beneficial addition to its space. The ideal treats will be made of grain or seed. They should be big enough for your bird to recognize, but small enough for your bird to pick up off of your hand., Perches come in many sizes. Most look like wooden dowels. Some are made out of metal. They all range in size. You should choose a perch that extends from your hand comfortable around 4 to 5 inches. Your goal with this step is to get your bird used to perching near your hand. The dowel will eventually be replaced by your fingers., This will be the physical cue that tells your parakeet to step onto the perch. Make sure that you don’t jab your parakeet too hard. If you do, your parakeet will associate the perch and your hand (or presence) negatively., Let’s say your parakeet’s name is Petee. You’d say “up, up, up Petee” while nudging its chest. This will add an auditory cue for your bird to learn. Eventually, you may be able to have your parakeet hop onto your finger with one or the other signal., This includes gentle pets on the back of its head or additional treats. In this respect, parakeets are like dogs and cats. They need some positive reward in order to learn the trick. Some parakeets don't like to be petted. If your parakeet is one of these, stick to treats. Make sure that you choose treats that are made from natural seeds, vegetables, and grains. Every parakeet is different and will prefer different treats. Experiment and figure out what your parakeet likes the most. , Place the dowel and your finger near its feet. When your parakeet begins to step onto your finger instead of the perch, you can get rid of the perch entirely.Make sure you keep your finger straight, as if the perch is still in place underneath your finger. Your parakeet needs to feel safe and stable at all times or else it will avoid your finger out of caution or fear. 

, Remember that it has spent a long time inside the cage and will be understandably scared. This may take a few days.Keep the doors and windows closed so your bird doesn't escape.

, This is the only way that your parakeet will feel comfortable with its human flock.

, Only after it feels comfortable on your finger should you give it the opportunity to explore other parts of your body. This includes the head, knee, shoulder, and arm. You can train him to sit anywhere as long as you take things very, very slow so your bird feels safe."

Distract the cat from the toilet paper.,
Give the cat other things to do.,
Provide other things to scratch.",How to Prevent Your Cat from Unrolling Toilet Paper2," When you find your cat unrolling your toilet paper, you should try to lure it away from that bad behavior. Bring a toy into the bathroom and try to engage the cat in play. Move the toy out of the bathroom as you play with the cat.This may be a temporary solution but it could be helpful in stopping this behavior before it becomes a regular habit, especially for kittens.

, Sometimes a cat shreds toilet paper because it is bored. Give your cat a variety of toys, puzzles, and areas to climb that are nowhere near the bathroom. Keeping it busy during the day when you are gone will go a long way towards stopping its bad behavior.Most cats need some stimulation during the day to keep their minds and bodies active. Providing toys and entertainment for the cat is an important part of caring for its well-being.

, In many cases, cats use the toilet paper roll as a scratching post, and as they scratch the whole thing unrolls. In order to avoid this, try giving your cat more places to scratch in your home. This could mean a scratching post or a scratching pad in most rooms of the house, including the bathroom.

If there is not enough room in your bathroom to provide a scratching post or pad, try putting one right outside the door. This may stop the cat from even going into the bathroom in search of something satisfying to scratch on.

Make the texture unappealing.,
Apply a bad smell.,
Create sounds that are unpleasant.,
Apply something bad tasting to the roll.",How to Prevent Your Cat from Unrolling Toilet Paper3," In order to train the cat to stay away from your toilet paper, you should try using remote correction, which makes the experience unpleasant for the cat. With remote correction, you make the cat associate something unpleasant with the behavior you want to eliminate. For example, you can place an unappealing texture on the surface of the toilet paper or on the floor beneath the toilet paper area. A surface that your cat doesn't want to touch or walk on may deter it from messing with your toilet paper.You can apply aluminum foil, sticky paper, or a knobby plastic mat under the toilet paper roll and see if it dissuades your cat from entering the area.

, Cats are very sensitive to certain smells, so you can use this to your advantage when trying to keep your cat away from your toilet paper. Apply a smell that your cat doesn't like around the toilet paper roll to keep it away.Some smells that generally keep cats away include citronella, citrus, aloe, eucalyptus oil and oil of wintergreen.

, If you see your cat going towards the toilet paper roll, you should make unpleasant noises that startle it and cause it to leave the area. Scaring the cat repeatedly near the toilet paper roll will make it associate that fear with the area and will likely cause it to avoid that area in the future.Use a whistle, a can with pennies in it, or some other noise making item to scare the cat away from bad behavior.
Don't use your words or yell at the cat, however, as this can make the cat fearful of you in the future.

, This will make the cat think that this will always happen when playing with toilet paper. Some products you can apply to the surface of your toilet paper include bitter apple, citrus products, hot sauces, cayenne pepper or aloe gel. Be sure to remove the bad tasting layer before using the toilet paper yourself.
Even if your cat is not chewing on the toilet paper, unrolling it with its paws will get the bad tasting substance on its paws. When the cat goes to clean the substance off with its tongue, it will experience the bad taste.

Observe your budgie’s activity level.,
Clean your budgie’s cage to eliminate red mites.,
Scrub the cage with F10 vet grade cleaner or white vinegar and boiling water.,
Use a disinfectant.,
Clean your budgie’s cage frequently.,
Dust your bird to eliminate red mites.",How to Get Rid of Mites on Budgies1," Red mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) are active at night. This may cause your budgie to seem restless or uncomfortable at night, and to sleep during the day to make up for the disruption., Some mites will not constantly stay on your bird. Red mites are active at night and will hide in crevices in your bird’s cage during the day. The treatment to rid your budgie of these pests is to thoroughly clean and disinfect its cage., Take your budgie’s cage apart. Use a brush to thoroughly scrub the cage. Be especially careful to clean all the nooks and crannies of the cage. Rinse all of the residue off with plain water once you are done and sun dry., Spraying your budgie’s cage with a pet-safe disinfectant after cleaning will help ensure that all mites are eliminated. Products that are approved as safe for this purpose (such as PetFocus or F10) will not harm your pet if you follow all directions provided with the disinfectant., Even after your budgie’s mites are eliminated, you should thoroughly clean its cage once a week. This provides your bird with a healthy place to live, and helps prevent further infestations., While cleaning your budgie’s cage is usually effective at combating red mites, a vet may recommend that you also dust the bird with an insecticide powder. If so, be sure to follow all instructions provided with the insecticide, in order to protect yourself and your bird.Mite and louse powders are available from many pet supply stores.
Avimec and Scatt also work extremely well for red mites on the bird.

Adopt a parakeet from the youngest age possible.,

Look for reasons why the bird is biting.,
Move very slowly.,
Stay calm if the bird bites you.,
Talk softly to your bird.,
Train the parakeet to perch on your finger.,
Put your finger on the parakeet's chest and push lightly.,
Finger-train your parakeet out-of-the-cage.",How to Stop a Parakeet from Biting," Parakeets are very sociable,and if you become part of their flock, you will have a more loving friend. To do this, simply spend lots of time with your bird from a young age, and he or she will become accustomed to your hands. This will help prevent your parakeet from biting you in the first place.;
, If a parakeet associates your hand with something positive—like food—it will be less scared and therefore less likely to bite you. Not only can this help keep the bird from biting you, it will help them become friendlier in general.


If the parakeet feels threatened by your hand, you may have trouble feeding it from your hand. In this case, try using a spoon at first and gradually choking up on the handle, then placing the spoon head in your fingers, then palm, etc. until you can discontinue using the spoon and encourage the bird to eat from your hand.

, Feeding your parakeet from your hand is one way to develop a bond, but you can also use food and treats to reward the bird for good behavior. For example, if you successfully got the parakeet onto your hand or even out of the cage for the first time (see parts below) you can use treats or food to reward the bird for that behavior. When the bird understands the reward system, it will learn to do what you want it to do in exchange for the food or treat.

, Parakeets may bite out of fear or jealousy, because they are tired, due to unintended reinforcement of biting behavior, in anticipation of being placed back in the cage when they do not want to be, or to protect their territory.You will be more successful at bonding with your parakeet and reducing biting behavior if you know why your bird bites. Armed with this information, you may tailor your approach to helping put a stop to biting more specifically.

, If you move too fast you'll scare the bird. In general, you must move slowly around the bird if you want them to become tame enough to stop biting behavior. Do not place the cage in a high-traffic of your home, as too much commotion may be disturbing.

, If you quickly remove your hand from the cage when your bird bites, he or she may be getting just the reaction they are hoping for and continue the behavior. The bird may also be entertained by your reaction and continue the behavior for this reason. Be sure to remain calm if the bird bites—its bites are unlikely to break the skin, and they will probably not hurt that much. In response to biting behavior, simply say no firmly and cover the cage. The isolation this produces is not something the bird likes, so you will be discouraging biting behavior. It also calms the bird., The goal of proper interaction with your parakeet is essentially taming the bird. Talking softly around the bird helps it to feel calm around you, which can help with taming. Talking too loudly or shouting near the bird (not even necessarily to the bird) can scare it., Getting your parakeet to perch on your finger is part of hand-training. Finger-perching may take a while to achieve, but the patience should pay off in the end by developing a strong bond between you and your bird and minimizing biting behavior. Follow subsequent steps in this section to achieve finger-perching.Be mindful of the bird's mood—he or she may not be interested in trying finger-perching just because you want him or her to. Keep this in mind as you begin to train the bird, and try to be aware of the bird's mood so you don't irritate or frustrate it.

, This does not hurt your bird, but it will make it lose its balance and coax it into putting its foot on your finger. It may not happen the first time, so if the bird flies away, try again the next day.Practice these steps each day to get the bird comfortable perching on your hand. Doing so will help put an end to biting behavior.

, Once your bird is comfortable perching on your finger, begin trying to bring it outside the cage on your finger. Use a vocal cue such as saying ""up"" in an enthusiastic voice. The bird may not want to venture too far outside the cage, but keep trying and you should be able to get him or her to go farther and farther each time. If they fly away, they will eventually go back to their cage, as that's where they feel safe.Once your bird is finger trained out-of-the-cage, he or she will trust you a lot more, so biting should cease.

Keep a diary of when your budgie bites.,
Use negative reinforcement when biting occurs.,
Keep a regular sleeping and feeding schedule.,
Handle your budgie with care.,
Provide enough toys.,
Ease your budgie into transitions.",How to Stop a Budgie from Biting1," The first step to addressing biting is to keep track of when biting occurs. Budgies may bite for a variety of reasons. How to address the behavior depends on its root cause.


Write down each time your budgie bites you. Jot down the circumstances surrounding the bite. Was the budgie being handled at the time? Was in or out of his cage? Was the bite in response to being fed or given a treat? The more details you record regarding the incident the better.Look for common themes and patterns regarding when your budgie bites. If he tends to bite when he hears loud noises outside or when handled by unfamiliar people, he may be biting out of anxiety. If your budgie tends to bite around nighttime when he's been out of his cage for extended period, he may be biting because he's tired and wants to go back in his cage.;
, Oftentimes, people unintentionally reinforce biting. Any attention, even in the form of scolding, can seem like a positive to a budgie who's seeking relief from boredom or frustration. When a budgie bites, instead of scolding your budgie simply ignore the behavior. Try not to react when a budgie bites. He will realize he's not getting the reaction he craves and cease the behavior., As budgies may bite due to dissatisfaction with their diet and sleep cycle, maintaining a schedule can help. Make sure your budgie gets variety in his diet and is fed regularly. Allow him to sleep at roughly the same times each day.


Seed and pellets, the kind that you buy at pet stores, should be the staple of a budgie's diet. However, budgies will get bored eating the same meal day after day. Add variety to your budgie's diet by adding sprouts, veggies, and grains to his regular bird food.Keep track of what times your budgie seems to rest. Make a conscious effort to give him space during these times. A budgie might become frustrated and bite if he's being handled when he's tired. Respect the fact budgie's need lots of rest to feel healthy and happy., Anxiety is a major cause of biting in budgies. Oftentimes, anxiety is caused accidentally by owners improperly handling their budgies. Be careful when handling your budgie as not to cause him stress.


Allow a budgie to come to you. Do not grab a budgie but give him the option of perching on your hand or finger.Do not follow your budgie from room to room. This can come off as chasing. In the wild, predators chase budgies in this manner. You do not want your budgie to mistake you as a threat, so allow him to fly from room to room on his own.Talk to your budgie softly and offer him treats and toys. This will keep him calm and relaxed and allow him to establish a bond with you. If you have just purchased a budgie, give him space for a few weeks before attempting contact., In the wild, budgies are constantly occupied with some task or another. Mental stimulation through appropriate toys is vital to a budgie's well being. If a budgie gets bored, he may resort to biting to get attention and stimulation.


Shreddable toys, like old toilet paper rolls and scrap paper, are fun for budgies. As they forage in the wild to build nests, they'll enjoy tearing through paper in captivity.Stop by a local pet store and look at what's available in terms of bird toys. Many budgies enjoy puzzle toys, which are contraptions where you can hide a treat. The budgie will have fun trying to dismantle the puzzle in order to get a reward. These are great if you're away from home for long periods during the day.Play with your budgie. Budgies need one-on-one attention. Set aside time every day to spend with your budgie, especially if you only have one. Considering getting another budgie if your schedule does not allow you to spend time with your budgie each day., Have there been any changes to your household? Have you recently moved to a new home? Did a new person or pet recently move in? Is there construction going on outside causing excessive noise? Any changes to routine can cause anxiety for a budgie, leading to biting. If there are any major changes, give your budgie some space while he's getting used to the transition. Do not handle him too much and make sure he always has adequate food and water. If loud noises from outside seem to be bothering your budgie, consider a noise machine."

Look at size.,
Pay attention to coloring.,
Examine the tail.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Cockatiel and a Cockatoo1," First, consider the size of the birds. Cockatiels are generally much smaller than cockatoos. Cockatoos do range in size, as they come in a variety of types, but can grow up to 26 inches tall. Cocktails, conversely, are usually only 13 to 14 inches tall. If you're dealing with a smaller bird, it's probably a cockatiel.However, a young cockatoo may be smaller if he is not yet full grown. Therefore, do not rely on size alone. Pay attention to other aspects of the bird's appearance to determine if he's a cockatoo or a cockatiel.;
, Cockatiels and cockatoos also differ in terms of color. Examine the bird's color patterns to help you tell if you're dealing with a cockatoo or a cockatiel.


Cockatoo's colors do vary somewhat by species. However, nearly all cockatoos are mostly solid in color with a few small patches of different colors here and there. Most commonly, a cockatoo's base color will be black or white. A few breeds of cockatoo may have pink or gray as their base color. If you're dealing with a larger mostly even-colored bird, you're likely dealing with a cockatoo.Cockatiels are far more colorful in appearance. In the wild, cockatiels are gray with white patches on their wings and green and yellow patches on their tails. Cockatiels bred in captivity come in a wide variety of colors that do not occur in nature, having patches of reds, browns, and yellows throughout their bodies. A smaller, more colorful bird is likely a cockatiel., Cockatiels also have a specific type of tail. If you're still unsure if a bird is a cockatiel or cockatoo, this may help you clarify. A cockatiel's tail is very long, making up about half of the bird's length. When a cockatiel flies, its tail will spread out like a fan."

Look for scaliness or crustiness on the budgie’s toes.,
Treat your bird to eliminate scaly mites.,
Listen to your budgie’s breathing.,
Give your budgie medications to combat air sac mites.",How to Get Rid of Mites on Budgies2," Like many birds, the toes of budgies are covered in scaly skin. If you notice changes in your bird’s toe scales, however (abnormal color, size, shape, texture, etc.), this could indicate that your pet has scaly mites., Avimec/Scatt one drop on the skin on the back of the neck once a week for 2-3 weeks will kill the mites and eggs., A bird that is infected with a particular pest called air sac mites (Sternostoma tracheacolum) may have trouble breathing. You might hear a clicking or wheezing sound when your budgie breathes if it has this problem.You may also notice your budgie’s tail flitting up and down, or that your bird breathes with its mouth open. These are also signs that the bird is having trouble breathing.

, Both ivermectin (Avimec/Scatt) and levamisole are effective against a variety of parasites, and are often prescribed to treat budgies infested with air sac mites. Unfortunately, the mortality rate for budgies afflicted with air sac mites is high, even with the availability of these medications."

Xeno (an insecticide). It is applied to your budgie’s feathers in drops or by using a pipette. Several doses at two week intervals should eliminate your bird’s mites.
Insecticide dusting treatments.
Thoroughly cleaning your bird’s cage.

Do not yell at a budgie.,
Avoid punishment.,
Do not use distractions like treats or toys.",How to Stop a Budgie from Biting2," Yelling at a budgie can backfire in one of two ways. Yelling can excite a bird, causing him to repeat the behavior to elicit the reaction again. Yelling can also cause a budgie stress, which can lead to biting out of fear and anxiety. Do not yell at a budgie in response to biting., Punishment will only increase a budgie's sense of anxiety. It can also cause undo stress and diminish the bond you have with a budgie. Avoid punishing budgies if you want to eliminate biting.


Never squirt a budgie with a spray bottle to address biting. This will cause the bird to perceive you as a threat.Do not place a budgie in his cage as punishment. Budgies see their cages as safe, happy spaces. If your response to biting is to put the budgie in his cage, he will think his behavior is being rewarded., Many people address biting by distracting a budgie with a treat or a toy. However, much like putting a budgie in a cage, your budgie will see this as a reward for his behavior. This will encourage biting in the future."

Beware of toxic fruits and vegetables.,
Remember that, if it isn’t good for you, it probably isn’t good for your cockatiel.",How to Feed Cockatiels," Any fresh food given to your cockatiel should be cut into small, pieces, no larger than half an inch. They should also be washed well. Pesticides on fruits and vegetables can be toxic to your pet., Seeds, pellets, and treats are all susceptible to being infested by fungus that could be deadly to your cockatiel. To be sure that this does not happen, store food in tightly closed containers and in a location that is cool and dry., You should feed in cockatiel in a clean bowl. Wash the bowl daily with hot soapy water. Consider having two sets of bowls that you can switch out when the other is being cleaned.Cockatiels are naturally foragers, who enjoy the opportunity to search the ground for food. Consider occasionally scattering food across the floor of the cage so that they can forage. In providing cockatiels with this opportunity, however, you should be cautious about food hygiene.Placing food directly on the floor of the cage is more appropriate for foods like pellets and commercial treats, which will not rot. Be sure that fresh foods are easy to find and extract from the cage so that no rotting food is left in the cage.

, Fresh foods left in the cage for more than an hour will begin to rot and could pose a health threat to your cockatiel. Feed your bird fresh food in a bowl and remove the bowl by the end of the day. Search the area for any remaining scraps on the bottom of the cage. Remove these as well., As with the food bowl, the water bowl should be washed daily in hot soapy water. If you notice food particles, feces, or any other solid particles in the water, you should take it out and clean it immediately.If you do not trust the local water enough to drink it yourself, you shouldn’t give it to your cockatiel either. Provide your cockatiel with bottled water, if necessary., Cockatiels are social animals that, in the wild, eat with their flock. Try to feed your cockatiel around your own meal times to build a closer social bond.To encourage bonding, you can also try to hand feed it. Place a few seeds in your hand and hold them out for your cockatiel to eat., Cockatiels need to consumer a variety of nutrients and vitamins. The best way to accomplish this is to mix up your cockatiel’s diet. Be attentive to what your cockatiel eats and does not eat and follow its lead when designing your cocktail’s diet plan.In addition to the base diet of pellets or seed, you should aim to feed your cockatiel some sort of fresh green daily. A couple of times a week supplement this with a second course of protein or carbohydrate. When serving either, limit the portion to a couple of very small, finely chopped pieces.
In addition to your bird’s staples, which should be either seeds or pellets, you should serve a couple small pieces of a varied fresh food twice a day., There is a lot of controversy over whether seeds or commercially produced pellets are the best source of nutrients for cockatiels. Either way, you should make sure that you pick a mix that is specifically designed for cockatiels, because they have specific nutritional needs that differ from some other species of bird.Cockatiel's are not inclined to overeat, so provide your pet birds with as many seeds or pellets as they are willing to eat. When you provide fresh food, which you should do once or twice daily, they will cut down on the amount of pellets or seeds that they eat.
In general, cockatiels will eat approximately 15 grams of food per day.To add some variety, consider providing pellets occasionally if your bird is on a seed diet, or seeds if it is on a pellet diet.

, Your bird will need calcium to maintain its bone structure. To do this, provide it with dark, green vegetables like kale, cilantro, beet greens, turnip greens, bok choy, endive, chard, collard greens, and mustard greens.


Alternatively you can also provide your bird with a mineral block to snack on.
Cockatiels cannot process lactose. However, they can consume lactose free dairy products, like yogurt and cottage cheese., For protein you can feed your cockatiel meat or eggs. Chicken, turkey, beef, fish, and hard boiled eggs are ideal. Serve them freshly cooked. Do not give your bird reheated meats or eggs.Keep portions small, only a couple of tiny pieces per serving., For carbohydrates, feed your winged companion cooked rice, cooked beans, baked sweet potatoes, oatmeal, or fresh corn. These are less essential to your birds diet and should be served in moderation, only a couple of times per week., Fruits and vegetables should be served to your cockatiel so that your bird has sufficient vitamins in its diet. Some fruits and vegetables, however, can be problematic in excess. Try not to serve the same variety more than twice per week. Do not serve fresh food that is discolored or bruised. Wash fresh food well and chop into small pieces to prevent choking.


Good vegetables to feed your bird include cooked sweat potatoes, sprouts, cooked beets, broccoli, carrots, carrot tops, corn, chard, endive, fresh sprouts, wax beans, parsley, pumpkin, red or green sweet peppers, watercress, yellow squash, zucchini, and dark green lettuce.Iceberg lettuce, cucumbers, and celery are not a good source of vitamins.
Good fruits for your cockatiel include apples, apricots, bananas, berries, cantaloupe, cherries, honeydew, pears, pineapple, mangoes, nectarines, plums, and watermelon.Cockatiels are allergic to the pits found in many varieties of fruit. If you are feeding your bird a pitted fruit, cut it up carefully and be certain to remove all pits.
Although you should refrain from giving your cockatiel the same type of fruit or vegetable more than twice per week, you should provide some amount of fresh produce daily. Two or three pieces of finely chopped greenery should suffice., You should consider getting vitamin supplements for your cockatiel, particularly if you are afraid that you aren’t giving it a sufficiently varied diet. The best vitamin supplements are served as powders or hard treats. Vitamin supplements that dissolve into water are less effective., There are a variety of commercially available treats for cockatiels, which, while not essential to their diet, make for a fun distraction. Talk to the people at your local pet store about which treats they sell would be appropriate for a cockatiel., Shelled nuts often contain a fungus that can be toxic to your cockatiel. You should also avoid nuts in their processed form, including peanut butter., Shellfish contain bacteria that our bodies can tolerate but that birds have trouble processing. As a result, you should never feed your bird shrimp, crab, or lobster., Canned food is heated in a way that causes it to lose much of its nutrients. It also has unhealthy levels of sodium. Stick to fresh fruits and vegetables., Cockatiels are allergic to several varieties of fruits and vegetables. Refrain from feeding them avocadoes, mushrooms, rhubarb, tomato, and eggplant. They are also allergic to the pits of apples, apricots, organs, cherries, peaches, pears, and plums., Refrain from indulging your bird in your own vices. Do not expose it to alcohol, tobacco, sugar, chocolate, honey, salt, or greasy foods."

Listen to the sounds the bird makes.,
Consider social needs.,
See if the bird imitates household sounds.,
Give the bird puzzle toys.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Cockatiel and a Cockatoo2," In terms of behavior, the noises a bird makes can help you identify a cockatiel versus a cockatoo. Pay attention to how your bird expresses itself vocally.


Cockatoos are generally louder. They talk more and may imitate words you say frequently.Cockatiels have softer, squeakier voices. They tend to make bird-like sounds more often than they talk. When they do speak, their voices are often harder to understand than a cockatoo., In terms of social needs, cockatiels and cockatoos are very different. Between the two birds, cockatoos are far more social. They require a lot of time out of the cage with their owners and may become stressed if left alone too long. A cockatoo will be openly affectionate of his owner, wanting to be physically close a lot. Cockatiels, while friendly with people, are less socially needy. They're content to be alone for longer periods., Both cockatoos and cockatiels can imitate household sounds, like the noise of a car outside or the sound of a phone ringing. However, cockatiels may be slightly more likely to do so.However, as both birds do imitate noises, consider other factors first when trying to differentiate between a cockatoo and cockatiel.

, Cockatoos are known to enjoy puzzle toys. These are toys in which a bird has to dismantle some kind of contraption in order to get a toy or a treat. A cockatoo may be more interested in a puzzle toy than a cockatiel.However, like imitating household sounds, this is not the best means of identification. Consider a bird's appearance, voice, and social needs first.

Buy a large cage.,
Invest in a sturdy cage.,
Get a variety of perches.,
Purchase food and water dishes.,
Buy toys and enrichment items.,
Place the cage in the right spot.,
Put paper at the bottom of the cage.,
Place toys and enrichment items throughout the cage.,
Fill and place food and water dishes.,
Make adjustments to the layout of the cage.",How to Set Up a Cockatiel Habitat," It is important to get a cage that has plenty of room for your bird. A cockatiel will need more space than a smaller bird, like a parakeet. An individual cockatiel should have a cage that is at least 24 inches wide, 24 inches tall, and 24 inches deep.The space between the cage bars shouldn't be more than 5/8 inch, so that your bird cannot get their head stuck between them.;
, Your bird's cage should also be very sturdy. A cockatiel's beak is very strong, so having a cage that has thick bars and is made of stainless steel or powder-coated steel is important.If you put your cockatiel in cage that is flimsy or made of sub-par materials, you run the risk of your cockatiel escaping from it or scratching itself against the areas it has chewed on.

, You should get at least three or four perches for your bird to sit on. These can include traditional wooden perches that typically come with bird cages but there are also other types of perches that can serve some additional needs your bird may have.For example, there are grooming perches, also called cement perches or pedicure perches, which are said to keep a cockatiel's nails rounded. These reduce the frequency with which you will need to trim your bird's nails.
There are also natural wood perches available at most pet stores. These can be very enjoyable for a cockatiel to stand and chew on.

, Buying sturdy food and water dishes is important when setting up your bird's habitat. Food dishes should have a good place for your bird to perch while eating and they should be made of a material that is easy to clean, such as plastic or stainless steel. Additionally, look for dishes that have a wide opening, so that your bird will be able to see where its food is easily.Consider getting food and water dishes that are covered. Then, if the bird is on top of one of its dishes and it goes to the bathroom, the food or water won't be contaminated.
The number of food dishes you will need depends on how many different things you plan on feeding your cockatiel. In many cases, you will need to have three food dishes and one water dish.

, Your cockatiel will need a variety of enrichment items to stimulate its brain and to keep it healthy and happy. These can vary, but usually include some combination of:Cuttle bones or mineral bones
Shredding toys
Wooden toys
Swings
Mirrors

, Cockatiels like to be a part of the family but they don't want to be in a hectic and busy spot. Try putting your bird's cage in a corner of your living room or another room your family spends a lot of time in, so that the bird can see you all but is not right in the center of everything going on.

Try putting the cockatiel's cage in a place where it can see out a window. The window will allow it to get some sunlight and to see some activity outside. However, make sure that the bird always has an area of the cage that is not in the sun, so that it does not get overheated., In order to more easily clean your bird's cage, you should cover the bottom with something that can be removed and thrown away. Most people use newspaper, because it is cheap, not toxic to your bird, and keeps most of the mess off the actual bottom piece of the cage. Simply take a few layers of newspaper and shape it to fit the bottom of your bird's cage.

Many cages have a pan that can be removed from the bottom of your bird's cage. If you wrap the newspaper all the way over the edges of this pan, you can then easily remove the soiled paper and give the pan a quick rinse with soap and water when it's time for cleaning, which should happen weekly., Toys and enrichment items, such as cuttle bones or sticks to chew on, should be placed around the cage. Basically, your bird should be able to find something fun to do in each area of its cage and it should be encouraged to move all around its cage so that it gets physical activity.Consider putting a toy that your bird loves in a place that is hard to get to, such as a corner that doesn't have a perch. This will force your bird to use its brain and body to figure out how to get to it.

, Make sure that food and water dishes are in your bird's cage at all times. Water dishes should be placed away from food dishes, ideally on the opposite end of the cage, so that the food does not get flicked into the water dish and the bird gets physical activity when going between the two.Make sure that food and water dishes are placed securely on the cage walls. Your bird will not only perch on them, but will likely chew and push on the dishes while it is having a meal.

, Once you have your bird in its habitat, you may discover that some items don't work where you originally placed them. Don't be afraid to reorganize the cage to better suit your bird's needs. Your bird will adjust to any changes you make, especially if they benefit the bird in the long run.

For example, you may need to move the cockatiel's food dishes so that your bird has easy access to them or so that they don't knock them over when playing with a favorite toy.

Place the bird in a safe area where they cannot get out of the house or be bothered by other pets.You may choose to place the bird in a travel cage, a second cage, or on a free standing perch if it is trained.;
, Whether you use newspaper or cage liners, you should change them daily. The bird’s feces and excess food will drop into the liner. You shouldn’t leave your cockatiel in their droppings for multiple days, so remove the tray and quickly remove the liners every day.Change the liners even if they look clean. Feces can be buried in the liner, and bacteria or mold can start growing in the environment. The ammonia from standing urine can bother a bird’s respiratory system.

, Between major cleanings, you should wipe off the grate at the bottom of the cage. The bars on the bottom of the cage separate the bird and any droppings or discarded food. You should take a hot rag and wipe down any buildup on the bars.You can also use a mixture of 50% water and 50% white vinegar to clean the bars.You can wipe off the bars when you change the drop tray liners if you see a need.

, You should remove and wash all food containers, including bowls, water bottles, and trays, each day. Clean out any leftover food or debris. Wash the dishes in hot, soapy water. Make sure to rinse thoroughly to remove all suds and dry the dishes before replacing in the cage."

For example, hard toys that you can drop in water should be cleaned.If there are toys that cannot be cleaned that way, try using a rag soaked in hot water to clean off the surface of the toy.

, Remove all perches and clean them. Stone perches should be soaked in hot water or cleaned with a vinegar solution. After you soak them for a little while, you can take a cleaning brush and scrub away any feces., After soaking in hot water, you can use a brush to try to remove any feces on the rope perch. Let the rope dry completely before placing it back in the cage. Rope perches need more time to dry, so leave them lying out until they are completely dry., Unlike stone and rope perches, wood perches can’t be soaked in water because of the material. Instead, you can use a rag soaked in hot water to clean the surface of the wood perch.Wood perches need a longer time to dry. Don’t place the perch back inside the cage until it is completely dry.

Place your bird in a cage in a different room so they are not affected by any fumes from cleaning supplies., If your cockatiel habitat has shields that extend beyond the edge of the cage, the shields will catch feces and food debris. Every couple of days, you should take a hot rag to wipe down the mess on the shields.You may need to wipe them down more often if your cockatiel creates a lot of mess on the shields.

, After removing and cleaning all the accessories, you should start cleaning the cage. Remove the drop tray. Throw away any product used in the bedding tray for droppings. Then, wash the drop tray with hot water or a vinegar solution., Before you can disinfect the cage, you need remove any food, droppings, and seeds from the bars. Disinfectants won’t work if there is organic material on the bars. Use a commercial bird-safe cleanser or a vinegar solution.If the build up is caked on and hard to remove, let it soak in hot water for awhile before cleaning it.

, Scrub the bars using a brush and hot water or vinegar solution. Remove all food, seeds, and feces that are stuck on the bars of the cage. Rinse off any cleanser before returning your bird to their cage., Some cockatiel enclosures are difficult to clean because they are deep and contain hard to reach places. To clean those edges, use a high-powered hose, like a pressure washer or steam washer.You can also try a garden hose.

, Wash the seed skirt or cage apron with hot soapy water. You should also clean the area of floor beneath the cage.

Generally, this gesture means the bird is happy., If you're nearby and he comes to you, that's a sign he's happy you're there. However, he's only happy if his head is up as he walks to you, rather than pointing face-down., While generally not a gesture, cockatiels like to talk when they are happy. They will sing to themselves or whistle. They'll also make little chirping noises., If your cockatiel's eyes suddenly dilate, that could be a sign he's getting mad. Stop what you're doing if you see this warning sign., When he's really angry, he may put his head down. He may also ruffle up his feathers, and fan his tail feathers.If he starts walking toward you in this position, he really wants you out of the way., This stance, paired with spread wings, is usually a sign he's trying to defend his territory. It's probably time to back away if he's making this stance while you're near the cage., Cockatiels will lunge at you if they are about to bite. They may also snap in your direction with their beak. You should leave him alone for a bit if he's trying to snap at you., While hissing is not a gesture, it does go hand-in-hand with other aggressive behavior, such as lunging. If you hear your cockatiel hiss, he may be about to bite., Wing flapping, when the bird makes an expansive gesture with his wings and moves them up and down, is usually a sign he's mad or annoyed. Try to leave him alone for a bit, if you've been bothering him., Some cockatiels, usually males, will bang their beaks against things, such as counter tops and cages.

Act quickly.,
Wrap the cockatiel in a towel.,
Talk to your bird as you help it.,
Have another person hold the bird.,
Remove the feather carefully with a pair of pliers.,
Staunch the bleeding with cornstarch.",How to Treat Injured Cockatiels1," Anytime a bird has a broken feather, it can be life threatening. The bird can bleed out very quickly, so it is important to act fast in order to help it survive., To help restrain and calm the bird, you should wrap them in a towel. Cover the entire bird in the towel, except the part you are working on. Make sure the towel isn’t too tight around the bird, and keep a loose grip on it. Toweling the bird helps them safe and secure.Make sure you gently fold the wing you’re not working on against their body.
If you don’t have a towel of the right size, you can use a sock or t-shirt.

, Stay calm and talk to your bird in a calm, even voice as you help it. Birds can pick up on your stress, so it will not help the situation if you from become upset. Even though they can’t understand you, tell them calmly what you’re going to do to help them., Once your bird is toweled, get someone else to hold the bird for you. Having another person hold the bird allows you to be able to concentrate on removing the delicate blood feather and gives you the use of both of your hands., Removing feathers is very delicate work. You can accidentally break the bird’s bones or cause them more harm. Have someone hold your bird while you use a pair of pliers or hemostats to grip the feather. Get as close to the skin as possible and grab the feather shaft above the break. Secure the wing against the surface of your work area, and pull with a quick, firm yank.The end of the feather should have a rounded bulbous end if you removed the entire feather shaft.
Coating the feathers with water before you remove it can help you move the feathers and find the broken one. Use a cotton swab to coat the feathers in water.
If you don’t think you can remove the feather from the follicle, stop the bleeding until you get your bird to the vet.

, If the follicle starts bleeding after you remove the feather shaft, apply pressure on it. Then, place cornstarch on the area and apply pressure again. Applying cornstarch and pressure should help stop the bleeding.You can also use styptic powder or a styptic stick to stop any bleeding.

Stay calm.,
Search for the source of the bleeding.,
Wash the wound.,
Apply pressure to wounds.,
Use cornstarch to staunch the bleeding.,
See the vet.",How to Treat Injured Cockatiels2," No matter what the injury is, you want to get the cockatiel to the vet as soon as possible. However, you need to stabilize the bird first to make sure it doesn’t go into shock or bleed out. While you treat your bird, stay calm. Your bird can sense if you are panicking or upset, which can add more stress to them.Don’t allow other family members or pets around the bird. Keeping others away helps keep the bird calm.

, If your bird has gotten injured or you spotted blood, examine the bird’s entire body. Be careful as you look for the wound or the source of the bleeding., For wounds on the skin, use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution or a solution made of Betadine and sterile water. Gently wipe around the bleeding wound using a cotton ball, gauze, or cotton swab covered with the solution.If it is a surface scratch that isn’t bleeding, just put some antibiotic ointment on it and let it heal.

, If your bird is bleeding, press gauze or a paper towel against the wound. The pressure should help stop the bleeding. You apply pressure for skin, nail, or beak bleeding., If pressure doesn’t stop the bleeding, you can use a substance to help stop it. Try cornstarch or flour on a moist cotton swab to help stop the bleeding.You can also use styptic powder or a styptic stick.
If you use any of these substances to stop bleeding on the bird’s face, make sure you don’t get it in their eyes, nose, or mouth.

, If the bleeding does not stop, then you must take your bird to the vet. Once you've put the powder on, check to make sure the bleeding stopped and put the bird's cage in a quiet, calm spot so that it can relax and heal. Again, speak to it calmly and quietly with affection and care.

Take your bird to the vet as soon as possible.,
Wrap broken wings loosely to prevent movement.,
Take the bird to the vet immediately if the leg or skull is broken.,
Monitor for signs of illness.",How to Treat Injured Cockatiels3," If your bird gets injured, even if it is a minor injury, you should take them to the vet. Taking them to the vet is important so that you can have the vet check over your bird, make sure there are no other wounds, and administer any additional needed care.Most towns have vets that can see and treat birds.

, If you’re taking your bird to the vet for a broken wing bone, you need to secure the wings. The bird may try to flap the wings or fly, which could cause further damage. Wrap gauze loosely around the bird to secure the wings. Tape the gauze so it doesn’t come loose.Don’t wrap the gauze too tightly around the bird. Wrapping them too tightly will restrict the bird’s breathing.

, Leg or skull breaks should not be treated at home. Don’t try to wrap or treat them. Take the bird to the vet immediately if they experience this kind of break., Most birds hide their weaknesses and won’t let you know they are sick. Keep a close eye on your bird to make sure it's okay and doing well. You know your bird, so if something is off, take them to the vet. Taking them to the vet is especially important if your bird has suffered a recent injury.You can weigh the bird monthly to make sure they are not losing weight. Weight loss without being on a diet is one of the first signs of problems.

Monitor for symptoms of chlamydiosis.,
Get a lab test.,
Isolate your bird.,
Get a doxycycline prescription.,
Provide supportive care.,
Remove mineral blocks.,
Keep the bird quarantined.,
Clean the cage.,
Quarantine new birds.,
Clean bird environments regularly and thoroughly.,
Keep your bird calm.",How to Treat Chlamydiosis in Cockatiels," Before you can treat chlamydiosis in cockatiels, you need to make sure that you are treating the right thing. Watch the bird for symptoms of the disease, and if you notice any, schedule a vet visit to get a laboratory diagnosis. Symptoms may include:Lethargy or depression
Fluffed feathers
Loss of appetite and weight loss
Green droppings or diarrhea
Difficulty breathing
Discharge from the eye or around the face
Seizures
Chewing their feathers or bodies
Unusual head positions;
, Symptoms can help give you an idea of what’s wrong, but most symptoms for chlamydiosis aren’t exclusive to the disease. If you think your bird may be suffering from chlamydiosis, take them to a vet that specializes in birds or small animals. The vet can request an antigen or antibody test to get an official diagnosis for your cockatiel.Test results may take up to two weeks depending upon your vet and your bird’s condition.

, If you suspect chlamydiosis, isolate your bird from other birds immediately. Cockatiels are particularly susceptible to infection, so it is important to move your bird into a cage separate from any other birds you may have.The cage should be comfortable and supplied with the same items as the bird’s home cage or perch, but kept separate from any other birds. Clean the cage regularly to help minimize the risk of spreading the infection, but keep your contact with the infected bird to a minimum.If diagnosis comes back positive, your bird may need to remain in isolation during treatment.

, The most effective form of treatment against chlamydiosis in cockatiels is a course of antibiotics called doxycycline that is provided over the course of up to 45 days. Your vet will prescribe either oral medication or a once-weekly shot, depending upon what works for you and what is best for your bird’s condition.Either your vet or the prescription packaging will tell you how much medication you need to give your cockatiel and when. Follow these instructions as precisely as possible to help ensure the medication is most effective.
If you opt for injectable treatments, which can be beneficial for birds showing severe symptoms, make sure you or someone you trust is available to take the bird to the vet every five to seven days.

, Antibiotics can be harsh on your bird’s system, so it’s important to make sure their environment is comfortable and that they are eating while they undergo treatment. This may involve feeding and providing fluids using a feeding syringe every six or so hours.If your bird is not eating or drinking on its own, talk to your vet. They will be able to provide you with a feeding schedule and recommendations for the proper food based on your bird’s condition.
You may want to provide a heat lamp to make sure they get a consistent temperature and that you don’t shock their system with temperature fluctuations, as well., Remove all mineral blocks and stop providing any other mineral supplements while your bird receives treatment. Calcium, in particular, can interfere with antibiotic course. If your bird is on a supplement for a medical reason such as deficiency, consult your vet to figure out what action you should take., If your cockatiel is receiving treatment for chlamydiosis, it is important to keep the bird isolated for the full course of the treatment. It is also important that you avoid interacting with the bird unless completely necessary, such as when you’re giving it food or medication.Chlamydiosis is transmittable to humans, and birds don’t develop immunity after being exposed, so it’s important to do all you can to keep yourself from becoming a carrier for the disease. That way, your bird won’t become sick again after treatment.

, Clean and disinfect your bird’s cage regularly during treatment. This will help prevent the bird from being re-exposed to the disease, and keep it from passing onto you or other birds. You can buy bird-safe disinfectant from most pet stores. Be sure to use a bird-safe brand.Be sure to wet any cage paper with disinfectant before removing it from the cage. After removing the paper, spritz the whole cage down with a bird-safe disinfectant and then rinse with a wet paper towel. Allow the cage to dry completely before returning the bird.Do not disinfect dishes with water and food still in them. Remove the excess food or water, and wash them with disinfectant, followed by hot water and soap. Allow them to fully dry before returning them to the cage.

, The best way to prevent chlamydiosis in your cockatiel is to prevent any exposure. Avoid buying underweight or sickly birds, and quarantine all new birds that you bring into your home until you are able to get them tested for the disease.Not all birds will show symptoms of chlamydiosis. Some are simply carriers. That is why it’s important to get all birds tested, even those not showing symptoms.

, Since chlamydiosis is spread through droppings and feather dust, it’s important to make sure that you thoroughly clean your bird’s cage or other living space regularly. This means cleaning items like dishes and toys daily, and sanitized every one to two weeks., Stress weakens your bird’s natural immunity, making it more difficult for them to fight off infection.Work to keep your cockatiel calm by providing it with proper stimulation, company, food, and a routine that it can rely on.Keep your bird away from windows and loud noises, and make sure it's cage is fully stocked. Try to avoid stressful situations such as moving the bird's environment more than necessary. Avoid handling the bird if it does not like to be touched."

Heat the fat.,
Strain the liquid.Run the liquefied fat through a cheesecloth.,
Choose a dry mix.,
Choose a sweetener.,
Combine the dry mix with liquefied fat.The dry ingredients and the fat should be combined approximately in a two to one ratio.,
Try a special recipe.,
Wait for the suet mix to cool.After mixing the dry ingredients into the liquefied fat, wait about twenty minutes.,
Shape the suet into balls with your hands.Place disposable gloves on your hands and pick up a handful of the suet mix.,
Pour the suet in a grapevine ball.If you don’t want to simply roll the suet into a ball with your hand, you could put it in a grapevine ball.,
Make a half-ball.Cut an orange or grapefruit in half.",How to Make Bird Suet Balls," Store it in the freezer in a sealable container. Alternately, buy animal fat from your local butcher or grocery store.


If you don’t want to render suet, you can buy ready-made suet from many pet stores. However, birds tend to prefer homemade suet.Do not use pan drippings or fat from cooking. This fat has been contaminated by the meat it cooked with, and tends to smear on the birds’ feathers.Do not substitute vegetable oil, polyunsaturated margarine, or vegetable shortening for animal fat.These have a low energy content relative to animal fat.
Do not use turkey fat. Birds dislike it, and it might coat their feathers, negatively affecting their flight capabilities.Be careful with beef fat. It turns rancid quickly in temperatures above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius).;
, If you do not have a meat grinder, chop the fat into tiny pieces. Try to chop it into cubes of about a quarter centimeter on all sides.

, Place the fat in a large skillet or pan on low heat.Your goal is to liquefy the fat. It will take several hours to liquefy.After about three hours, begin checking the fat every thirty minutes for signs it is done. When you stop seeing bubbles coming up from the fat, you’ll know it is ready.


Even though the fat is white, the liquid should be a yellowish color. If the color is darker, you might have burned it.
Put a thermometer in the fat. Don’t let the temperature rise beyond 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius).

, Have a friend hold the cheesecloth over another pan, then pour the pan with the liquefied fat slowly into the cheesecloth. This will filter out any fatty chunks that may not have broken up properly. Discard these fatty chunks and allow the liquid fat to cool.


At this point, some people let the fat cool and harden, then heat it to a liquid again, and run it through the cheesecloth one more time. This is not necessary, but it might improve the quality of the suet if it is heated again.

, You could choose seeds, nuts, wheat flour, rolled oats, corn meal, or cracked corn.Alternately, you could simply use bird seed. Your dry mix doesn’t need to be composed of just a single ingredient. Mixing bird seed and chopped nuts, for instance, results in a yummy treat for birds of all sorts.

, Birds will enjoy suet with a sweet taste, and the sugar gives them needed energy. You could add a teaspoon or two of sugar or honey directly. Include fruit for a more natural sweetener. Dried, frozen, or freshly chopped fruit -- especially apples and berries -- are all acceptable in suet.A handful of raisins, likewise, adds some sweetness and fiber to the suet ball.You could also add a small amount of crushed, sweet breakfast cereals., For instance, you could combine two cups of dry mix with one cup of fat. Carefully place the appropriate amount of the dry ingredients into the pan with the liquid fat. Use a stiff wooden spoon to mix the ingredients until they are thoroughly incorporated.


You could add a spoonful of extra add-ins like peanut butter at this stage, too.
There’s no real wrong way to make suet. As long as the fat and dry ingredients stay combined, birds will be happy to eat your tasty suet balls.If you’re having trouble getting the dry and wet ingredients to stick together into a solid mass, add a few more spoonfuls of dry ingredients.
If your suet mix is too dry and crumbly, add a bit more liquefied fat or water and mix again.
If you don’t want to use your mixture right away, you could place it in the fridge.It should stay good for several weeks.

, Bird lovers have developed some tried-and-true suet combinations. If you’re interested in developing a great suet mix, check for recipes and inspiration online. Try a variety of recipes and see what your birds like best.


Create a tropical suet.This recipe uses peanut butter to partially replace the fat. Add one cup of fat, one cup of peanut butter, 2-1/3 cups of oats, 2-1/3 cups of cornmeal, 1/3 cup of coconut, then one cup of raisins or birdseed.
Make a fruity suet.Mix 1.5 cups of fat with 3/4 cup of safflower (or other) seeds, 3/4 cup of dried raisins or cranberries, 3/4 cup millet, and 1/2 cup of cracked corn. Add a tablespoon of honey if you wish.

, If you feel heat radiating from the suet when you place your hand above it, it needs more time to cool.


When you’re ready to make suet balls, put a disposable glove on and pick up a small bit of the mix. If it’s too stiff, or if you’re working with refrigerated suet, place the amount you want to work with in a bowl and microwave it for ten seconds.

, Cup the mix in both your hands, rolling it gently with your palms. Work it between your palms to shape it into a sphere. Place your suet ball in a suet cage (available online or at your local gardening store) and hang the cage at an elevation of about seven or eight feet off the ground.

, A grapevine ball is a rustic decorative element popular on Christmas trees and in countrified homes. You can obtain grapevine balls from most craft stores.


Cut a small hole in the ball about one to two centimeters in diameter.
Push a bent wire (a bent and broken wire coat hanger is a good choice) into the hole and through the bottom of the grapevine ball. Curve the top end (the end coming out the hole) into a semicircle. Bend the other end of the wire (the part sticking out the bottom of the grapevine ball) up and around the arm of the semicircle.
Wrap plastic wrap around the entire ball, except for the hole. Use a rubber band to keep it in place, if necessary.
Scoop or pour your suet mixture into the hole. Fill the grapevine ball, with the wrap still surrounding it, and place it in the freezer once it is full.
After an hour or so, remove the ball, attach a string to the top of the metal wire sticking out the top of the ball, and hang it from a tree branch so that it hangs about seven or eight feet off the ground.

, Remove the fruit. Fill the hollowed-out peel with suet mixture and let it cool in the freezer for about an hour.


Cut two lengths of twine, each a foot long. With the empty fruit peel in front of you and its round side facing down, use a sharp pencil to poke four small holes into the peel. Each hole should be about one centimeter from the top edge, and each should be equidistant from the others. In other words, the four holes should located along a horizontal plane at 90 degree angles from each other.
Work the twine into one hole and tie a knot at one end. Pull the string so that the knot is snug against the peel.
Loop the other end of the twine into the hole directly across from its corresponding knot (180 degrees around the other side of the peel). Pull a few inches of twine through the hole on this side and knot it.
Take your second piece of twine and affix each end to one of the other two holes you poked along the horizontal plane of the peel.
Hang the suet half-ball from a tree branch where it will be readily accessible by birds.

The condition can be caused by a lot of different things, such as bacteria, fungi, nematodes, protozoa, and injury. The vet needs to test your bird to find out the cause so they can receive the proper treatment.There are a few other conditions that are similar to conjunctivitis, which is another reason why it’s so important to get your bird tested before treatment.;
, Your vet may prescribe topical medication to give to your cockatiel. The vet may also prescribe oral medications, antibiotic ointments, or sprays for the bird. For fungal infections, the vet will prescribe topical antifungals.You can get these medications from the vet or at any bird supply store.

Look at your bird’s eye and see if there is any debris inside. If there is, use a warm damp cloth to gently remove it.Common debris that can get in a bird’s eye include dust or cracker crumbs.

, You can help your cockatiel’s irritated eye by dropping sterile eye drops into the eye. This helps keep the eye lubricated and reduces discomfort.You can use this if the conjunctivitis is caused by debris, or if you have to wait to take the bird to the vet.

When they have conjunctivitis, this membrane gets inflamed. Look for red or irritated areas around the bird’s eyes., Birds that have conjunctivitis may also produce a clear or cloudy discharge from their eye. This causes a crusty, thick build up around the area. It may crush along the swollen membrane, or get inside the bird’s eyes., Another symptom that may occur with conjunctivitis is problems with the eyelid. The lower eyelid may droop or hang down slightly. The bird may also have a prolapsed third eyelid, where you can see the reddish membrane., Birds with conjunctivitis may start to preen more than they used to. You may notice that the feathers around the eyes are wet, or that the feathers on the wing or leg are wet and matted due to increased rubbing., Some birds may rub the eye repeatedly against their cage or try to scratch the eye with their foot or wing.

Do not assume you need to feed the baby bird.",How to Make Emergency Baby Bird Food," Because of the sheer number of bird species, it can be difficult for the average person to know the species-specific dietary needs for baby birds.Fortunately, some foods are generally acceptable to be used as emergency baby bird food. For example, moistened dry cat or dog food can be fed to baby birds.Puppy chow is especially high in protein—an essential nutrient for baby birds. If you do not have dry cat or dog food, wet cat or dog food is also acceptable.Insects and mealworms are also acceptable as emergency baby bird food. They are both excellent sources of protein.Pre-made emergency baby bird food is also available at your local pet store. It is relatively low-volume and high in calories. It can be added to dry dog or cat food as a supplement.Seed formula is appropriate emergency baby bird food, but only for doves, pigeons, and parrots—these types of birds do not eat insects.;
, Milk should not be a part of the emergency baby bird food that you prepare.Birds do not nurse, so milk is not a part of their natural diet.Bread is another food to avoid giving to a baby bird, since it provides no nutritional value and could cause internal blockage.Pet bird food is also not recommended.Pet bird food may not meet the nutritional requirements of a wild bird.
Baby birds obtain water from their food,so it is not necessary to give them water separately.

, You can find mealworms at your local pet store or bait store.Crush the mealworms’ heads before feeding them to the baby bird.Visit your local pet store to purchase live crickets.Before feeding them to the baby bird, you should seal them in a bag and freeze them for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the crickets will be dead, but will still look and feel like the real thing and will not be too frozen.Crickets are a good source of water for baby birds., Baby birds must be fed very small amounts of food to prevent choking. Dog or cat kibble is much too large to be fed whole to a baby bird, so you must do some extra preparation. One option is to grind the kibble in a blender or food processor to break it into very small bits.You should then moisten it with warm water until it is the consistency of yogurt or feels spongy.Another option is to moisten the kibble first, then break each kibble piece in half by hand.This method could get tedious, so you may prefer to grind up the dry kibble.
To achieve the right moistened consistency, use one part food to two parts water. It could take up to an hour before the kibble is at the right consistency.Dry food that is too moist can drown or choke a baby bird, so it is very important to properly moisten the food., A baby bird must be warm before it eats.To warm the baby bird, fill up a jar with warm water and place a nest of tissues against the jar.Place the baby bird in the nest and allow him to warm up.


Given the baby bird’s small size, a few minutes may be all that’s needed before the bird is warmed up and ready to eat.
If the baby bird has few feathers, or no feathers at all, use a small plastic container (e.g., empty margarine tub) as a nest. Fill the container with paper towels or toilet paper.You could also place this against the jar of warm water to help the baby bird warm up.

, The baby bird may gape (open its beak) on his own once he is feeling warm. If not, he may need some encouragement from you. Softly whistling or gently nudging on his chest are good ways to stimulate him to gape.You may need to gently pry the baby bird’s beak open with your thumb.Keep in mind that you may injure the baby bird when handling him,so you should be very careful if you nudge his chest or pry his beak open.

, Use something very small to feed the baby bird—tweezers, cocktail sticks, plastic coffee stirrers, and baby medicine syringes are all suitable feeding utensils.After putting a small amount of food on the feeding utensil, aim the utensil towards the right side (your left) of his throat.The left side of the baby bird’s throat contains the trachea.Just like with people, food should not go down the trachea.
Hold the utensil at a height where the baby bird will easily be able to take the food from the utensil.
Make sure the food is at room temperature.You may need to cut the crickets or mealworms into smaller pieces before feeding them to the baby bird.
Feed the baby bird until his crop is full., This is probably the most challenging aspect of feeding a baby bird. In the wild, a baby bird gets fed every 10 to 20 minutes during daylight for 12 to 14 hours a day.Maintaining this feeding schedule is not very practical for the average person.


Contact your wildlife rehabilitation center to transfer the baby bird over to the center’s care as soon as possible.
The emergency baby bird food should be fed only as long as it will take for you to coordinate the transfer of care.
Discard any remaining soaked food after 12 hours. After this time point, the food will start to spoil., A fledgling is a partially or fully-feathered baby bird. A fledgling has likely outgrown his nest and is walking around on the ground or low branches before he can fly. He still needs to be fed by his parents, but is not completely helpless.You should leave a fledgling where he is so that his parents can find him and feed him. You should only move him if he is injured and needs to be taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center.A nestling has either no feathers or the beginnings of feathers. If you see a nestling out of his nest, put him back in his nest. If the nest has fallen out of tree, put the nest back in the tree, then put the nestling in it.If you cannot find the nestling's nest, make one by placing shredded paper towels in the bottom of a margarine tub. With a nail or wire, fasten the tub to a tree near where you found the bird, then put him in it., If the baby bird's parents have not come back in one to two hours, or if you know that the mother is dead, the baby bird will need to be transported to a wildlife rehabilitation center. He will also need expert care he is injured or appears sick.Do not delay in calling a wildlife rehabilitation center. The sooner you can transport the baby bird, the better his chances for recovery.If someone from the wildlife center will be coming to pick the baby bird, keep him warm in the meantime by placing him in a nest of tissue against a jar of warm water.

, Although you mean well, you may be doing more harm than good by feeding a wild baby bird. In fact, many wildlife centers recommend that you not try to feed a wild baby bird.It is best to either leave him alone or transport him as soon as possible to a wildlife rehabilitation center.


It is likely the baby bird's parents are nearby and will return to him within a few hours to feed him.If you mistakenly take the baby bird out of the wild to feed him, you may deprive him of the care that he needs from his parents."

Some birds, however, are more prone to obesity than others, and understanding your breed's distinct needs will help you provide the proper amount and variety of nutrition.


African gray parrots typically thrive on a diet of 70 percent pellets or other basic nutrition and 30 percent other foods (seed mix, fruits, nuts, vegetables).
Amazon parrots have varying needs depending upon their size and activity level. Experts recommend using a gram scale to carefully weigh and adjust both birds and their food. Typical Amazon diets are 30 percent pellets or other basic nutrition, 20 percent whole-dried foods (seeds, nuts, fruit, vegetables), and 40 percent fresh vegetables and fruits. Cockatiels are more prone to obesity than many breeds, so keep a careful eye upon your bird and watch for signs of excess weight.
Canaries typically need a breed-specific seed mix, pelleted mix, and song mix, with vegetables provided about twice a week.
Cockatiels thrive upon 60 percent pellets or other basic nutrition and 40 percent breed-specific seed mix, plus vegetables for added nutrition. Like Amazons, cockatiels are more prone to obesity than many breeds, so keep a careful eye upon your bird and watch for signs of excess weight.
Conures are such active birds that they rarely experience weight problems. Conures thrive on a base diet of pellets with rotating additions of vegetables, soaked seeds, dried fruit, and enrichment treats.
Eclectus parrots' diets should be weighted heavily toward fresh foods. One expert recommends 25 percent pellet and seed mix and 75 percent fresh foods, including grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables.
Macaw diets should be composed of approximately 70 percent pellets or other basic nutrition, 20 percent vegetables, and 10 percent nuts, seeds, and treats. Macaws are also prone to obesity.
Quaker parakeets benefit from roughly equal parts pellets, vegetables, and whole-grain mush or other grain based-treats.;
, Birds benefit from nutritional variety just as humans do, and preparing fresh foods is an easy way to make a homemade contribution to your bird's diet. Consider the following breed favorites:


African grey parrots need more calcium than many pet birds, so calcium-rich foods such as kale, mustard greens, broccoli, carrots, dandelion greens, apricots, endive, figs and okra are especially important. Also consider baked eggshells, walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds.Amazon parrots benefit from vitamin A-rich foods such as carrots, pumpkin, squash, sweet potatoes, papaya, bell peppers, cantaloupe and mango. The calcium present in peas, broccoli, almonds and Brazil nuts is also important.Canaries tend to enjoy greens, broccoli, shredded carrot or peas. Cockatiels benefit most from dark green or orange vegetables. They aren't as enthusiastic about fruit as many birds. Conures tend to enjoy a wide variety of vegetables and fruits, with apples often a notable favorite (be sure to remove all seeds). These birds also enjoy cooked brown rice, pasta, and boiled, shredded potatoes or yams.
Eclectus enjoy cooked legumes, whole-grains, cucumber, papaya and watermelon with seeds, various in-season berries, broccoli, endive, celery and more greens.Macaws eat a high volume of leafy vegetables and fruits in the wild, so reproducing these habits for your pet is a good idea. Macaws also tend to like oranges, apples, melon, broccoli, spinach, kale, carrots, and celery. Quaker parakeets enjoy bananas, grapes, apples, oranges, pears and strawberries. These birds can also benefit from occasional consumption of dairy products such as low-fat yogurt or cheese., Just as humans need a wide variety of nutrients, your bird needs the benefit of variety in its diet. Avoid the pitfall of the tried and true; rather, learn how to prepare different foods for your pet. A varied diet also provides the mental stimulation these intelligent pets need to stay healthy.

, Avocado pits contain a substance toxic to birds, while onions and garlic can cause a form of anemia. The acid in tomatoes can give pet birds ulcers, and fungi such as mushrooms have been known to cause digestive problems or even liver failure. The nutritional content of celery isn't a problem, but the strings it contains can cause crop impaction. Remove the stringy parts if you would like to feed your bird celery.Coffee and chocolate are both toxic to birds., As noted above, pellets compose a significant, if varying, percentage of each pet bird breed's diet. Part of the reason for pellets' popularity is that they provide better nutrition and involve less waste than seed-based diets. Birds are savvy creatures; they will pick and choose their favorites from among a collection of mixed seeds. This practice often results in nutritional deficiencies.A similar principle applies when considering the rest of your bird's diet. Mash mixture is a homemade supplement to store-bought pellets and is especially popular with parrots. Biologically, birds are best adapted to raw foods. Mash allows you to provide the complex carbohydrates, fats, and protein your bird needs in raw form.Because it is mixed, your bird will be ""forced"" to consume a full range of nutrients.

, Take note of the provided ratios to ensure the balanced nutrition of your mash.


25 percent cooked mixed beans such as mung, adzuki, or garbanzo beans
25 percent cooked grains including quinoa and amaranth
25 percent high-calcium greens such as kale, chard, mustard greens, collard greens, or dandelion greens
15 percent high-vitamin A fruits and vegetables such as cooked sweet potatoes or squash, carrots, papaya, and mangoes
10 percent miscellaneous additions -- any bird-safe vegetable or fruit that catches your eye at the store , You'll want the mash to retain a chunky texture.

, Medium-sized parrots will typically consume about 1/4 cup of the mash mixture per day; adjust the quantity for smaller or larger birds., Making mash isn't a speedy process given the variety of foods involved, but preparing and freezing large quantities will help you maximize your time and effort.


Determine how much mash your bird will eat each day and then freeze in serving-size quantities for easy defrosting.
Make defrosting a regular part of your daily routine so you don't find yourself facing a hungry bird and a frozen block of mash.

, Try one of the following recipes to provide food enrichment that will provide mental stimulation -- and fun! -- for your bird.


Punch a hole through a rice cake and hang from a string. Parrot breeds especially enjoy pecking and foraging their way through this treat.Fill a paper lunch sack with nuts, pellets, dried pasta, and/or dried fruit. Tie the sack with a piece of ribbon or string and hang in your bird's cage. Especially eager foragers might enjoy the challenge of a double-bagged sack.Combine chopped walnuts, sunflower seeds, diced pears and apples, and granola and add enough honey and peanut butter to create a sticky mixture. Slather a clean pine cone with the mixture, then roll in millet seeds. Hang in your bird's cage. This enrichment treat is especially popular with parakeets., Just as humans have preferences, your bird will gravitate toward particular flavors and textures. While the list of treat recipes is almost endless, considering categories is helpful. Use your observations to craft homemade bird treats that will delight your pet.

, If your bird refuses to eat raw vegetables, try feeding it cooked versions. Offer nutritious foods in different shapes. Many birds enjoy peeling their own fruits and vegetables, so offer peas in the pod, oranges with rind, or apples with skin., Quinoa-based treats provide a wonderful source of avian nutrition.Many pet lovers have developed recipes for ""birdie bread""; a quick Web search will reveal a wide variety of options.

, Blend fruit mixtures with ice or fruit juice. Human baby food is also a handy ingredient.

, Try mixing 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, 1 cup mixed walnuts and peanuts, 1/2 dried fruit, and 1 T. dry, hard corn kernels. Store in a tightly sealed container in a cool, dry place.

Note changes in character.,
Observe their activity levels to determine if they have lethargy.,
Listen to their chirping for any changes.,
Observe how they sleep.,
Pay attention to how much they are eating.,
Track how much they are drinking to see if they are dehydrated.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in a Cockatiel1," Cockatiels are typically very active birds. They are known to be social and curious. Since birds tend not to show signs of illness until they are very sick, it is important to know your cockatiel’s normal habits and behaviors. If anything changes, be on alert.For example, if your cockatiel is no longer coming up to you when you approach the cage, they may not be feeling well.;
, A sudden drop in activity may mean that the bird is not doing well. Watch how active or energetic your bird is. Some signs of lethargy include:Sitting or lying on the bottom of the cage.
Inability to fly or exercise.
Sleeping for long periods of time.
Ignoring you if they are normally social.
Ignoring sounds or movement around them.

, Any changes in the sound or tone of their voice might indicate a problem if joined by other symptoms. This could include loss of voice, crying frequently, inability to sing, or a weak quality of voice., In most cases, cockatiels sleep with one foot raised into their feathers. If your cockatiel is suddenly sleeping with both feet gripping the perch, consult a vet., Changes in appetite are one of the key symptoms of sickness in cockatiels. If the bird is either eating more or less than usual, take them to a vet.Changes in food or stress can also cause eating problems. If the cockatiel is sick, the loss of appetite will be accompanied by other symptoms.

, Cockatiels drink about a teaspoon of water a day. A sick cockatiel may drink more than this if they have diarrhea or vomiting. There are other things, however, that can also cause this. Rule out these other causes first:The room may be too warm.
They may be feeding their young.
Their food may be too salty.
They are very active.

Inspect their feathers for any signs of distress.,
Look into their eyes for swelling or discharge.,
Check their droppings to see if they have digestive problems.,
Glance around their beak.,
Listen to their breathing for signs of respiratory problems.,
Check the vent for signs of diarrhea.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in a Cockatiel2," Ruffled or puffed up feathers are one of the most frequent signs of illness in cockatiels. Loss of feathers, particularly around the feet or eyes, can also signal a problem.Sometimes birds will pluck their feathers. This might be due to sickness, stress, or anxiety. Treat these issues early to prevent lasting problems.
While cockatiels may fluff up their feathers while sleeping, their feathers should not be puffed up all day long. If they are doing this for long periods, take them to a vet.

, Healthy eyes are clear and free from discharge or swelling. If you notice any redness, pus, discharge, or swelling around the eyes, take the bird to a vet. Other signs include frequent blinking, squinting, or closing one eye.Conjunctivitis (also known as pink eye) is a common disease in cockatiels.Loss of feathers around their eyes can be a sign that they have mites.

, Healthy bird droppings consist of coiled brown feces, chalky white urates, and clear, liquid urine. Change in color, consistency, or frequency of droppings may mean that the cockatiel is not feeling well. Look for:A lack of urine
Watery feces or urates
Diarrhea
Yellow, green, red, or black coloration
Undigested food in their droppings

, Their beak should be straight, smooth, and symmetrical. Any crookedness or flaking of the beak may indicate problems. You should also check for any discharge or crusting around the beak or nostrils.Try giving the cockatiel a seed to see how well they can eat it. If they struggle to eat it, they need to see a vet.

, If the cockatiel is struggling to breathe, they may have a respiratory issue. Listen carefully for any wheezing, gasping, clicking, or heavy breathing. They should not breathe with their mouth open., The vent of the cockatiel is where they expel their waste. It is on their bottom side just below the tail. A healthy vent is clean and dry. If the feathers are ruffled, pasted, or wet, the cockatiel may have diarrhea."

Visit an avian veterinarian.,
Report any symptoms.,
Allow the vet to perform tests.,
Quarantine the bird until they get better.,
Return for an annual exam.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in a Cockatiel3," Illnesses can progress very quickly in birds. Take your bird to a vet as soon as possible if you are concerned about their health. It is best to take your cockatiel to an avian veterinarian, which is a vet that specializes in birds.The Association of Avian Veterinarians has a database where you can look up local avian vets.

, In addition to the behavioral and physical changes that you have noticed, tell your vet of any other symptoms of sickness. These include:Weight loss
Vomiting
Seizures
Sneezing
Any signs of blood

, If the vet suspects that the cockatiel is ill, they may do a number of different tests. They may need to keep your bird at their office while they do these tests. Some common tests include:Bloodwork
Fecal tests
Viral screening
X-rays
Psittacosis Testing
Fungal testing

, If you have other birds, you should make sure that they do not have contact with the sick cockatiel until the cockatiel has completely improved. Your vet may advised that you quarantine the sick cockatiel for up to 60 days after treatment.It is best to keep the cockatiel in a separate room while quarantining. Always feed and clean the quarantined cockatiel last after the other birds.

, To catch diseases before they become serious, you should take your cockatiel back to the vet once a year. This will prevent serious problems from developing in the future."

Learn more about attracting hummingbirds to your yard.",How to Make Hummingbird Nectar," Here's a simple chart to make the math easier:


1 cup sugar to 4 cups water
3/4 cup sugar to 3 cups water
1/2 cup sugar to 2 cups water;
, Bring the mixture to a boil and then turn the heat off, stirring all the while. The sugar should dissolve entirely into clear sugar water. And don't keep it boiling – that changes the water to sugar ratio through evaporation.


Don't use a sugar substitute – your hummingbirds do not need to go on a diet. They burn so much energy every day fluttering their wings at breakneck speeds that sugar is necessary. So only use plain, white sugar – not brown, not a sugar substitute, and definitely not gelatin.

, Cover the pan and allow the solution to reach room temperature. If you put it into your feeder warm or hot, the sugar may crystallize.

, Most experts suggest only filling it about halfway full – sure, it means more work on your part, but then it's less likely the nectar will get a chance to mold.However, if you have so many hummingbirds you can barely keep up, go ahead and fill it up all the way.


Take a clean, empty 2-liter bottle to hold the rest of the nectar and keep it in the refrigerator. It will keep for around a week as long as it keeps in a cold, dry location.

, Do this more often if you notice mold growth or fermentation. Generally speaking, nectar deterioration will be controlled by the outside temperature. Here's a brief rundown of how it works:Temperature: 71-75°F (23-25°C); change every 6 days
Temperature: 76-80°F (25-27°C); change every 5 days
Temperature: 81-84°F (27-29°C); change every 4 days
Temperature: 85-88°F (29-31°C); change every 3 days
Temperature: 89-92°F (31-33°C); change every 2 days
Temperature: 93°F+ (33°C+); change daily

, Do this every time before you add new hummingbird nectar to the feeder. Old nectar will mold, resulting in white strings and sometimes even black, moldy spots, so be sure to get rid of it.


Sometimes you can get away with only washing it with hot water, if you take it apart and are diligent. However, only do this if no mold whatsoever is present. Most feeders come apart easily just for this reason.
If you do use vinegar, make sure the vinegar odor is gone before you replace the nectar. Finish with a hot water rinse.

, You don't want your nectar to start getting milky and develop black spots in the blink of an eye, so keep it in the shade. It's heat and sunlight that make it go bad. Make sure it's out of the way of cats, too.


Near your window is probably best for you and your view. Don't worry about the hummingbirds being shy. They may start out unsure of your feeder (just the way we're unsure of any new food), but soon enough they'll come to trust your homemade treat. And you being in the window isn't a threat – they could out-fly you any day of the week and they know it.

, Ants love sugar water and hummingbirds do not love ants. They will not drink from a feeder contaminated with ants on it or dead ants floating in the nectar. You can keep them away with an ant guard (some feeders come with them already installed).


Some people put vaseline around the ridges of the feeder or use Tanglefoot. The latter could potentially contaminate the nectar and Tanglefoot not only kills ants, but can be dangerous for hummers, too. If you go either of these routes, be very, very careful.

, Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red – likely because its their favorite color or is a vibrant color. If hummingbirds can't seem to find your feeder, put a splash of red on it. It'll attract their eye, piquing their curiosity.


It doesn't have to be a ribbon – red tape, paint, or even red nail polish will work. Just make sure it doesn't contaminate the nectar and can handle external weather conditions, whatever changes you make.

, Though hummingbirds are quite territorial, they put on such a show they're often worth it. People have been trying to attract hummers to their yards for centuries and it's just about down to an art. Here's a few other things you can do to up your hummingbird quotient:


Place a mister in your garden as well. Hummingbirds love to take a quick ""shower"" after eating.
Place several feeders all over your yard. Sometimes alpha hummingbirds will scare smaller birds away.
Place your feeder next to vibrantly colored flowers. It'll then be hard for the hummers to miss your delectable sugar water.

Compare the body plumage.,
Take the cockatiel to a veterinarian.",How to Tell if a Cockatiel Is Male or Female1," Male and female cockatiels look identical when young. After approximately six to nine months, the bird will molt for the first time and grow a new coat of plumage, typically more colorful and with more variation between the sexes.


A dull coat or faded colors can be a sign of poor nutrition, although sometimes it just takes a couple molts for the full, bright adult plumage to develop.
Do not provide a nest-box for juvenile birds, as this can stimulate over-early egg-laying or breeding, which harms the female.;
, Normal grey cockatiels without mutations have grey bodies with a yellow head and orange cheek circles. These can be identified using the steps below. If your cockatiel doesn't match these descriptions, its ancestors have been bred for unusual plumage, and you have a bigger challenge ahead of you. A few identifying characteristics for these breeds are mentioned below, but you will often have to rely on behavioral cues.

, In normal grey cockatiel breeds, adult females (and all juveniles) have markings on the underside of the tail feathers. These are often horizontal stripes alternating grey/dark grey or white/grey or yellow/grey, but some females have dots or irregular patterning on a grey background. If you don't see any, hold the cockatiel up so its tail is in front of a bright light and examine closely. If you still don't see any markings, the cockatiel is probably a male.


Lutino breeds, or pale yellow and pale white birds that still have cheek circles, can be identified by the female's yellow spots under the wings and yellow marks under the tail. You may need to use a bright light in order to see these., In normal grey cockatiel breeds, the male typically has more striking facial feathers, with vivid orange spots standing out from a bright yellow face. The female face has lighter orange spots, generally on a more muted yellow or grey backdrop.In some breeds, only the males develop a yellow face after molting, while the female keeps her juvenile grey or brownish face.Cockatiels with the white face mutation but non-white bodies sometimes have males with no cheek spots at all, and females with faint cheek spots that match the body plumage., Cockatiel breeds with grey body plumage tend to include darker grey plumage on males, and lighter grey on females. This is one of the less reliable methods, but it may help confirm suspicions raised by earlier tests. Breeds with non-grey body plumage are rarely identifiable this way.


In some breeds, the female also has faint yellow spots on the underside of the wings.In pearled cockatiels, which have white dots on a non-white body, the male loses these ""pearls"" after the first molt, while the female keeps them., The last test that relies on physical anatomy should only be done by a veterinarian. Inexperienced people could seriously hurt the cockatiel during the attempt, and are unlikely to be able to tell the difference anyway. Ask the veterinarian to sex your cockatiel, and he will probably examine the shape of the pelvic bones, which tend to be wider in the female. Even this is not a completely reliable method, as there is a great deal of variation between individuals.


The older a cockatiel is, the more likely this method is to work, especially if the bird belonged to a breeder as an adult and may have laid an egg in the past.If you want to be completely certain, ask for a DNA test.

, Male cockatiels are more likely to spend a lot of time in front of the mirror, strutting, calling, or investigating it. If your bird loses interest quickly, it's more likely the bird is a female.

, Male cockatiels are generally the ones actively trying to woo a partner, but they will sometimes exhibit these behaviors even without another bird around:Tapping his beak loudly against objects to get a female's attention.
Strutting around while whistling or beak tapping, involving hopping motions and/or quick head dips.
Wing tips lifted away from body, forming a heart shape when viewed from behind

, Females are generally less active leading up to bonding or mating, and typically do not display these behaviors unless a male is present:Sitting on a low perch, peeping quietly, with her tail up in the air.
Attempting to feed the male cockatiel she has bonded with or is trying to bond with.

, Most experienced bird owners have noticed a bird rubbing its vent (bottom) on perches, objects, or even its owner's hand. Some birds will do so daily or even more frequently. This type of habitual masturbation is most commonly seen in males, but there are exceptions.


Male masturbation generally involves humping the object or standing over it and rubbing its vent on it.
Female masturbation can be similar, but could also involve backing up against an object with the tail up and body bent forward.

, It's no surprise that only females lay eggs, but this won't help you if you discover an egg in a cage with multiple birds. If you want to be certain of the sex identification, provide each bird with a separate cage and nesting box, or point a video camera on the nesting box to record future behavior.


Females under 18 months should not be given a nesting box, as egg-laying often causes serious health problems in young birds.
Removing the egg will stimulate additional egg-laying.
Keep in mind that the egg may be fertilized, although in that case pair-bonded activity between two birds should be obvious.

Plant flowers that hummingbirds like.",How to Make Hummingbird Food," The sugary sweet mixture will encourage visiting hummingbirds to stay in the area. High-energy food is also important for hummingbirds in the spring because it helps to replenish the energy reserves that hummingbirds use up during migration.Avoid buying nutrient-enhanced hummingbird nectar. It will cost you money that you don’t need to spend, and the hummingbirds won’t really benefit either. Hummingbirds get all of the nutrients they need from natural flower nectar and the insects that they eat--the sugar mixture you are providing is a quick pick-me-up for them (similar to a cup of coffee for us) when they are flying around and feeling tired.;
, Stir the mixture until the sugar is completely dissolved. Cane sugar is a sucrose that falls into the carbohydrate family. Carbs are easily digested and give the hummingbirds the immediate energy they need to keep those little wings flapping.

, Boiling the mixture will slow down any bacterial growth that may occur. Boiling the water will also get rid of any extra chlorine that might be in your tap water (which in turn could harm the little hummers.)It is not necessary to boil the solution if you are only making a small amount of food for immediate use.


If you do not boil the mixture, you will need to change the food every 1 to 2 days or else bacteria may grow in the mixture that could harm the hummingbirds.

, Though hummingbirds are attracted to the color red, red dyes have been known to harm hummingbirds. Natural hummingbird food (nectar) is odorless and clear--there is no need to add dye to your homemade hummer food., Keep the food in the refrigerator. If you make a large batch of the food, you can keep the extra amount in the fridge until your feeder is empty. This will save you time when refilling your feeder.

, Red feeders are the best because the color red attracts hummingbirds. You should hang your feeder in a shady spot if possible because the nectar will stay fresh longer when it is in the shade. Hang your feeder in your garden if you have one. Hang your feeder near a window (but far out of the reach of cats) to be able to enjoy these beautiful little birds.Some hummingbird enthusiasts say that you should only hang a feeder near a window if you have cut-outs of birds on the glass so as to keep the hummingbirds from flying into the glass and potentially injuring themselves., When your sugar mixture turns cloudy, it needs to be replaced. Yeasts eat sugar, causing fermentation that could potentially harm a hummingbird. A warm, sugary mixture is also a great place for mold and bacteria to grow.

, If possible, check your feeder every other day. Keeping an eye on your feeder will keep any harm from coming to the hummingbirds. If you find mold, mix ¼ cup of bleach in a gallon of water. Soak the feeder for an hour in this bleach mixture. Scrub any mold off and then rinse the feeder thoroughly before refilling it., Flush the feeder with hot tap water. Do not use soap--hummingbirds do not like the taste that soap leaves behind and will avoid your feeder if it has soap residue.

, Be aware that the amount of time you can leave hummingbird food outside depends on the temperature in which the feeder is hung in.If temperatures are 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26 C), change the food every 5 to 6 days.
When temperatures are 81 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (27 to 30 C), change the food every 2 to 4 days.
If the thermometer tops 91 degrees Fahrenheit (32 C), change the food daily.

, Decrease the amount of sugar concentration in the food after a couple of weeks. Doing this will increase the activity at your feeder. One part sugar to five parts water or one part sugar to four parts water will dilute the mixture. When the mixture is more diluted, the hummingbirds have to come back more often. Do not make the mixture any weaker than 1 part sugar to 5 parts water. If the food has less sugar than this, the hummingbirds will expend more energy flying to and from the feeder than they will be able to replenish by eating the food.
You want to make the food strong enough that you do not constantly have to fill the feeders, but not so strong that the birds visit infrequently and you don't get to see them. Making food that is incredibly high in sugar will give the hummingbirds a high amount of energy, allowing them to go longer before eating again (so they won’t be visiting your feeder as much.)

, If you have tried different mixtures but there are still no hummingbirds using your feeder, plant flowers that will attract hummingbirds.


Here are plants that hummingbirds like: Bee Balm, Phlox, Lupine, Hollyhock, Red-Hot Poker, Columbine, Coral Bells, Foxglove, Cardinal Flower, Lantana, Salvia, Butterfly Bush, Rose of Sharon, Trumpet Vine, Trumpet Honeysuckle, Crossvine, Carolina Jessamine, Indian Pink (Spigelia).

How much time can I spend with my Cockatiel? Unless someone is at home most of the day, a single Cockatiel is likely to be lonely. Paired Cockatiels will need less attention, but you'll still have to give them daily attention and care.

Am I sensitive to noise and mess? Though Cockatiels are not extremely noisy, they will be vocal in the morning and evening, and can create big messes. If you're a neat freak or hate being woken up early in the morning, a Cockatiel might not be right for you.

How long am I prepared to care for a pet? Because Cockatiels can live for upwards of twenty years, consider your dedication carefully before purchasing. If you are underage, consider who will care for your Cockatiel if you cannot keep it while at college.;
, The cage should be at least at least 2 feet (0.6 m) tall with a 20-inch width and 18-inch depth, but a larger cage is recommended. The cage should have bars no more than 3/4 of an inch apart. Stainless steel cages are recommended. Because zinc and lead are poisonous to birds, the cage should also be guaranteed to not contain these materials. Additionally, because Cockatiels love to climb around their cage, the cage should have at least a few horizontal bars., Cockatiels, like any pet bird, require things to keep them entertained in their cages. You will need to purchase:


Two food bowls and a water bowl. You will need need separate bowls for the dry and wet bird food (wet food will be items like fruit, cooked beans, etc.)
A skirt for the cage to catch thrown seed.
Lots of perches for the cage. Cockatiels like to climb and play so lots of perches will make your cockatiel very happy. You will notice that your cockatiel will choose one perch as his home base (the perch where he will sleep.)
A bunch of toys for your Cockatiel to play with. Buy several toys and rotate them every week so that your bird isn't bored. Cockatiels love to chew, so toys like twig balls, or rafia and palm strips are best.

, Though not necessary, purchasing cleaning supplies, such as poop remover and a handheld vacuum, is a good idea. You will also need to purchase a cuttlebone for calcium; this is particularly important for female Cockatiels, who can get egg binding problems (females will lay eggs without a male; they'll just be unfertilized).

, Before purchasing a Cockatiel, thorough research of Cockatiels and how to care for them is necessary. While this article covers basic care, more in-depth research is recommended. Good resources include the Internet, your local library, and pet stores, which will usually carry books and other resources about the care of Cockatiels. In addition, interacting with Cockatiels is recommended, as well as speaking with an owner of Cockatiels about their experience caring for their birds.

, While you might be tempted to purchase the cheapest Cockatiel you can find, purchasing a bird from a pet store is not recommended. This is because pet store birds can be unhealthy, and are often not socialized (which makes taming them harder). You can purchase a hand-fed baby from a specialty bird store or bird breeder. Purchase a Cockatiel that is about three months old or slightly older. A beginner should never hand-feed a baby Cockatiel.


Purchase a cockatiel from a rescue center. Before trying to buy a pet bird it is generally better to try to adopt a bird. While many Cockatiels from rescue groups make good pets, adopting from a shelter is not recommended for beginners, as these Cockatiels can be unhealthy or have behavior problems.
Purchase a cockatiel from a previous owner. Sometimes, things come up and people have to give away their pets. As long as you're sure the owner isn't rehoming the bird because of behavior problems, and you are given the bird's health history, this can be a great way to purchase a Cockatiel, particularly for beginners.

, If your cockatiel is already tame, you can skip to the next step. One of the major parts of taming a cockatiel is getting the bird used to your presence. When you first bring your bird home, place the cage in an area of your house where there is a lot of human activity. Sit down next to your bird’s cage everyday and talk or whistle to it quietly for 10 minutes. This will get your bird used to your voice and presence.When the bird comes over to the side of the cage where you are sitting and seems fine with you being there, start to offer him small treats (see step one of the next section for what those treats should be.) After about a week of doing this, open the cage door and hold out a treat, thus prompting your bird to come sit on the cage door. The next step is to place food in your hand and have the bird eat out of your palm.

, The way you do this depends on if you have a bird that bites a lot, or a friendlier bird. Do not try to grab a Cockatiel or force it to step up, as this will most likely result in you getting bit.If you have a bird that bites: Move your finger quickly and fluidly towards the top of his legs, as if you were running your finger through a candle flame. Your bird will automatically step up. Give him a treat and praise immediately after he does this. If your bird starts to bite aggressively, stop the training session and try again later.
If you have a bird that rarely bites: Place your finger against your bird’s abdomen above his legs. Apply a slight pressure and he will most likely step up immediately. When he does this, give him a treat and praise him. Next time you do it, say “step up” as you apply the pressure. Eventually he will associate those words with the action of ‘stepping up.’

, If your Cockatiel is a hand-fed baby, this can be as short as a few hours. Unsocialized babies, however, will usually need two or three days to get used to their new surroundings. During the adjustment period, do not handle the bird, but do cleaning and feeding routines and talk softly with the bird.

, Bird pellets should make up about 70% of your Cockatiel's diet. Seed can make a good treat, but don't feed it in excess as it's too fatty. You should also feed your Cockatiel healthy vegetables and sometimes fruit; well-cooked beans, and spaghetti are examples of tasty treats you can give your Cockatiel. When you choose fruits and vegetables to feed, organic ones are recommended. You should also thoroughly rinse off uncooked fruit and vegetables before feeding.



Do not feed your Cockatiel avocados, chocolate, alcohol, onions, mushrooms, tomato leaves, caffeine, or uncooked beans, as these are toxic. Very sugary or fatty foods such as candy bars are also not healthy for Cockatiels.
Remove any uneaten fresh food from the cage within four hours or else it could attract harmful bacteria (and will just make a mess.)

, You should change your bird’s water daily. You should also change it when you notice that food or droppings have gotten into it. You should give your bird water that you yourself would drink.When washing the water bowl, make sure to use hot water with a bit of soap and rinse thoroughly to remove all traces of soap. Doing this will ensure that harmful algae or fungus doesn’t begin to grow.

, If your Cockatiel is already tame (or you have already tamed and trained it--see Part Two,) you will need to spend at least an hour a day with it to keep it tame and friendly. Unless you purchase a bird ""diaper,"" you may want to interact with the bird on a chair covered with a towel, or in a room with an easy-to-clean floor.

, You might feel hurt or upset when your Cockatiel bites, but it's important to realize that birds bite because they are reacting to a stressful situation, not because they are trying to be mean. A bird will bite to express that it is scared or upset, and you shouldn't take bites personally. Think back to what you were doing when your Cockatiel bit you, and try to see things from it's point of view. For example, a Cockatiel might bite if you were trying to grab it, or if you were too careless or rough while handling it. Additionally, many Cockatiels are territorial and may be protective of their cage, and may act aggressively if you try to put your hand in the cage.


If your Cockatiel bites you outside of the cage, put it back into the cage and wait for it to calm down before taking it out of the cage again.
If your Cockatiel is cage aggressive, instead of putting your hand into the cage train it to step up onto a stick or perch. That way, you can have it step up onto the perch when you want to remove it from its cage.

, While males are best at speaking and whistling, females can learn how to whistle and will occasionally learn a few words. It's recommended that you begin teaching your Cockatiel how to speak before teaching it how to whistle, as it can be harder the other way around. To teach your Cockatiel to speak, talk frequently with it, and say words you want your Cockatiel to learn frequently - for example, say ""Mommy!"" every time you approach your Cockatiel. If you hear the beginnings of a word or phrase, immediately reward your Cockatiel with a treat and lots of attention.


Teaching your Cockatiel how to whistle is much the same - frequently whistle in front of your Cockatiel, and reward it if it begins whistling.

, Because Cockatiels will often hide their illness until it is very bad, you should keep a sharp eye out for signs of sickness. Very sick Cockatiels will sit with fluffed up feathers at the bottom of the cage. A Cockatiel that is bleeding is also obviously injured. Signs of a sick bird include:


Crankiness or biting; napping more often than usual; a decrease in your bird’s weight or the amount of food he eats; refusal to eat or drink water; coughing, sneezing, or irregular breathing; lameness; lumps or swelling; inflamed or crusty eyes and nostrils; cloudy eyes; a soiled vent; or a drooping head, wings, or tail.

, You should take your Cockatiel to an avian veterinarian for an annual ""well-bird"" exam. Additionally, you should immediately contact your vet if your Cockatiel exhibits any of the signs listed above. Remember that while it may be expensive to go to the vet, birds will often become very sick in a short period of time, and it isn't a good idea to ""wait and see"" with Cockatiels as they are rather delicate creatures.

, Some cockatiels are afraid of the dark and have ""night frights"" where they essentially freak out in their cages. To prevent this, put a nightlight in the room your Cockatiel sleeps in, and don't completely cover the cage at night.


Once you know which perch your cockatiel prefers to sleep on, you should make sure that there are no toys hanging around that perch. If your bird was to have a night fright and get tangled up in a toy, he could be badly injured.

The cage should be large enough so that your cockatiel can spread its wings, even with any other birds or items that may be in the cage. Remember that the smaller the cage, the more time your cockatiel will need to spend outside of it to get the necessary exercise and mental stimulation.Look for a cage you clean easily. Remember, birds will void every ten to fifteen minutes.
Check to see if your hand can fit in the cage without problem.
Your cockatiel will need enough room to spread its wings.;
, Make sure you put enough perches in the cage so that your cockatiel is free to walk and jump around the cage. If positioned correctly, a cockatiel should be able to fly between perches too. Natural wood and rope perches are ideal.


Don't place perches directly over one another as cockatiels cannot fly at steep vertical angles.
Try making steps or platforms using your perches to handle vertical positioning.
Avoid concrete perches, as they are hard on the bird's feet.
Check that the wood is safe for the bird, such as eucalyptus.
Dowel perches or plastic perches can cause foot problems due to the lack of foot exercises.
Avoid perches and toys made out of Prunus or Oak trees as these may be harmful to to your cockatiel., Variety is important. Cockatiels, like most parrots, love to destroy things. Natural foliage and shredding toys are vital to ensure that your bird can direct its chewing in the right way.Variety is important. Your cockatiel will be happiest if it has many toys to play with.
Ask a veterinarian before adding natural foliage as not all trees and shrubs are safe for cockatiels.
Cockatiels will grow tired of their toys. Rotate and clean toys every other week.

, All birds will need to have some kind of bathing option available. Beyond providing a way for your bird to stay clean, it also provides mental and physical stimulation. Most pet shops will have a sturdy plastic cockatiel bathtub for the cage.Some birds may prefer misting from a spray bottle or even showering with their owner.
You can gently mist your bird with tempered water. Aim above the bird, don’t spray it directly.
Cockatiels are desert birds. It doesn't need to bathe more than once a week.
Change the water every day to avoid bacterial infections.

, There are number of different pellet formulations, designed by veterinarians, which are intended to provide a nutrient rich and balanced diet. Beyond the store bought pellet formulas, your cockatiel can enjoy many fruits and vegetables as well. shop.Try offering corn, grapes, millet, or sunflower seeds as a treat.
Try to use pellets and vegetables to keep your birds seed intake to a minimum (33% or less, preferably).
An all-seed or mostly-seed diet is extremely high in fat, and will shorten a cockatiel's lifespan.
Never feed your cockatiel chocolate, caffeine, or alcohol. These are toxic to the bird., It can often be very hard to tell if your bird is unwell. If you see anything that is out of character for your bird, contact a veterinarian. Look for the following symptoms:Sudden weight loss
Abnormal breathing
Discharge from the beak
Mucus on any feathers
Abnormal behavior
Go for a check-up with the veterinarian twice a year.
If you have more than one cockatiel, isolate the sick one immediately.

, Cockatiels need ten to twelve hours of sleep per night. They should have a quiet and relatively dark place to get their necessary sleep each night.The ten to twelve hours of sleep is in addition to any naps it may take during the day.
You might need a separate sleeping cage if the environment around their daytime cage cannot be quiet for at least 10-12 hours a night.
Cover three sides of the cage with a blanket to stop the light and the sound.
Don’t forget to let one side uncovered for oxygen circulation.
Cockatiels are often prone to ""night frights"". Place a small light near your birds cage to reduce its stress.

, If your birds beak or nails grow too long, they can pose health issues. In the wild, your bird will keep his nails and beak at a proper length.


Long nails may become tangled or caught in toys or on the cage, causing injury.
Perching problems can result from long nails, which in turn may cause foot injury.
Nails that are long are also sharp. If your bird perches on your hand, it may be uncomfortable or hurt you.
Use a grooming perch to allow your bird to trim its own nails as it moves about the cage. Try placing it next to the birds food and water to ensure usage. Grooming perches can be found at most pet stores.
To help maintain proper beak length, make sure your bird has plenty of toys to play with. Play, using the beak, will help wear it down and keep it at a healthy length. Lava rocks and cuttle-bones are great things to offer your bird to help with beak maintenance.

, Cockatiels need exercise regularly. Even if it has clipped wings, presuming your bird is healthy, it should be capable of some flight. A walk or a flight in a room will keep your bird happy and stimulated.Make sure the bird is safe. Close windows and doors, turn off fans, put cats or other pets away.
Try to challenge it when outside the cage by putting down treats in different areas and allowing the cockatiel to walk or fly to them.
Think about hygiene. Your bird will likely void whenever it wants, so keep it away from kitchen counters or furniture.

, Petting your bird is a great way to provide interaction and bond with your bird. While your bird is out of its cage, try to gently pet the cockatiel by lightly scratching its head and neck.


Some cockatiels will be more accepting of your petting than others.
Birds will invite you to scratch their head by tipping their head down.
Don’t forget to wash your hands before and after touching your bird.
Don’t insist if your bird doesn’t want to be touched.
Be gentle. Birds can easily be injured.

, Cockatiels are intelligent creatures and need mental stimulation. Providing this stimulation and interaction is a great way to keep your bird happy and to form a deeper bond with it.You can also train it to do tricks:


Talk to your bird often, even reading it stories.
Start using instructions like ""Up!"" and ""Down!"" to coincide with its hopping on and off your finger.
Repetition is the key to getting him to perform an action according to your words.
If you aren't available to interact with your bird, leave music or a radio on. Your bird may even imitate the song or any talking it hears.
Position the bird on a tennis ball and help practice balance. The bird will eventually go on the ball on its own.
Never yell at or hit your cockatiel.
When training a bird, focus on positive reinforcement at all times.

, Playing games can be a great way to help your cockatiel keep stimulated and learning new things. It may also help to your bird to bond with you. Try some of the following games out with your cockatiel:


Try dancing with your cockatiel. Move your head up and down, or side to side, to the beat of a song. Cockatiel's have a sense of rhythm and will often move their head with you and the music.
Play music for your cockatiel. Playing an instrument, whistling, or singing can be entertaining for you bird. With enough exposure to certain songs, it may even learn to sing them back to you.
Play hide and seek with your bird. Take your bird into a room and gently set it down. Go around the corner to a new room and call out to your bird. Peak your head around the corner so you bird can see you and say “come find me!” before ducking back around the corner. When it find you, give your bird a head scratch and let it know how well it did.

, Cockatiels are social birds and love to have company. If you are often away from your cockatiel, you may want to introduce another bird as a companion.Get a second cage for your new cockatiel.
Place the cages apart for ninety days, checking the new bird for any signs of illness. You don't want both of your birds to get sick.
If after ninety days the new cockatiel is in good health, you can move their cages near one another.
At first, schedule separate times for each bird for when they are allowed out of their cage.
Eventually allow both out at the same time. Keep a careful eye on both birds as they may act aggressively towards one another. Any hissing, screaming, biting, or attacking should result in them going back in the cages.
Eventually they may bond, even visiting each other in their respective cage.
Never fore interaction and never force your birds to share a cage.

Select a quality commercial birdseed.,
Feed your birds soft food.,
Give your cockatiel fresh produce.,
Add dietary supplements.,
Avoid sunflower seeds and spinach.",How to Keep Cockatiels Healthy While Breeding1," If you want to get your cockatiels healthy for breeding, a good diet is vital. Most cockatiels thrive on a healthy commercial birdseed.


You should go for bird seeds over pellets, as seeds tend to be more nutritious. Choose a brand with a good reputation and one that minimizes use of additives, pesticides, and preservatives.Watch fat content. Cockatiels are prone to fatty liver disease, so look for brands of birdseed with a fairly low concentration of fat. If you're planning on breeding, it's not a bad idea to talk over feeding options with your vet. He or she may be able to recommend the best birdseed to get your birds healthy enough to breed.In general, birdseed made from sprouted seeds tend to be healthier, especially for breeding pairs. Sprouted seeds tend to have a lower concentration of fat.Cockatiels need 1.5 to 2 tablespoons of birdseed each day.;
, Seeds should only be about 10% of a cockatiel's diet.In addition to birdseed, soft foods are great for cockatiels you intend to breed. Moist whole wheat bread, hardboiled eggs mashed with their shells, high protein baby food and cereal, cooked rice, cooked beans, peas, and oatmeal can all be great additions for breeding cockatiels' diets. Female cockatiels especially need extra calcium when breeding. Eggshells are an excellent source of calcium.Different types of table foods should comprise about 20 to 30% of your cockatiel's diet, so keep portions small. Portions of fruit and veggies will make up the rest of your bird's diet., Supplement your bird's diet with a variety of fresh produce. Birds tend to enjoy apples, oranges, and bananas. Green veggies, like dandelion leaves and celery, are particularly healthy for cockatiels., Most cockatiels, whether breeding or not, need a healthy dietary supplement in addition to regular seed and foods. Spirulina, Bene-Bac, Echinacea and Prozyme should be sprinkled over a bird's fresh food. Talk to your vet before adding supplements, however. You want to make sure you're getting a quality brand and using the appropriate doses.


Cuttle bones and mineral blocks are chews designed for cockatiels that you can purchase at a pet store. These provide additional calcium to your cockatiels. When breeding, calcium is vital to female cockatiels as it's used in egg production., As calcium is so important, do not feed your bird any foods that could adversely affect the body's ability to absorb calcium. Sunflower seeds and spinach can both potentially affect calcium absorption. While not every bird will be affected in the same way, it might be better to err on the side of caution and go with other options for seeds and greens."

Provide a small dish for the bird to clean itself.,
Bathe the bird under running water.,
Mist the bird with a squirt bottle.A third option for cleaning your cockatiel is to obtain a squirt bottle of average proportions.,
Do not use soap when washing your bird.,
Let your cockatiel dry.",How to Groom a Cockatiel1," Birds often enjoy bathing themselves and keeping clean. Offer your bird a small dish or bowl filled halfway with lukewarm, chlorine-free, filtered water.Use a ceramic bowl; the heavier weight will prevent the bird from spilling it or knocking it about. Remove and clean the dish when the cockatiel has completed its grooming routine.;
, Instead of providing a small dish for your cockatiel to clean itself, you can place your bird in the sink of your kitchen, or place it beneath the bathroom shower. Attach a shower perch to the side of the shower or sink and sit your bird on it. If you place the cockatiel in the sink, it helps if the sink head has a multi-stream spray option which mimics the expulsion of water from a showerhead. If it does not, simply turn the faucet on so that a steady stream of lukewarm water comes out. In either case, bathe the cockatiel well by moving the faucet over and around the it on all sides.


If you opt to wash the cockatiel in the shower, remove the shower head. If your shower head is not removable, move the shower perch into and through the water. The cockatiel should be wet all over.
Do not open the faucet so far that the force of the water is excessive or the bird will be unable to clean itself.
After the bath, replace your bird in its cage and allow it to preen itself.
After the cockatiel has completed its grooming routine, replace it in its cage and disinfect the sink. Use a solution of one part bleach to ten parts water. Alternately, you could poor boiling water over the surface of the sink.Be sure to remove sink mats, dish drainers and other objects which may have been contaminated by your bird’s cleaning in the sink.

, Fill it with filtered, chlorine-free, lukewarm water. Adjust the nozzle such that when the handle is depressed, it emits not a single long squirt, but a fine mist. From a distance of nine to twelve inches, aim the nozzle in the bird’s direction and depress the handle two or three times. The bird will then be able to groom itself.


Cockatiels enjoy being sprayed with the misting bottle. It allows grease and oils to run off their feathers.

, Human shampoo and soap can take away your bird's powder down, and result in unhealthy plumage. Antibacterial soaps, furthermore, are toxic to birds. Never use antibacterial soaps on or around birds, including when washing their cages or toys. Unless your cockatiel gets oil or other toxins on it, do not use soap when washing.


If your bird does require soap, use a mild glycerin soap and rinse it thoroughly. Wash the bird’s body only, not its face. Set your bird in a deep dish or tub filled with soapy water up to its chest and scrub gently., Your cockatiel should be allowed to dry in the air naturally.Unless the weather is very warm, keep the windows closed to ensure your cockatiel doesn’t catch a chill. For the same reason, you should always bathe your cockatiel in the morning, not at night. You might want to move its cage close to a sun-lit window or provide a bird lamp for your cockatiel to accelerate the drying process.


Do not use a blow-dryer on your cockatiel, as many blow-dryers contain nonstick coating on their heating coils, which can be toxic to birds."

Burp your bird.",How to Massage a Cockatiel," If your bird is flapping around, squawking, or restless, give it a chance to relax before you try to pet it. Touching your bird while it is excited can cause it to feel threatened., Cockatiels are easily frightened, especially by loud noises. When you want to approach your bird to pet it, talk to it in a soft and soothing voice. In addition, make sure any sources of noise (televisions, stereos, etc.) are turned down or off., Your bird will probably love to be petted under its beak, on its head, at the nape of its neck, over its ears, and under the nares (nostrils). All of these areas are places that the bird cannot preen on its own. Your bird will really enjoy it if you take your finger and rub one of these areas., Unlike other pets, like cats and dogs, most birds like to be petted the “wrong” way. Take your finger, and rub its feathers against the direction that they grow in., If your bird takes well to petting, you can also try using your fingers to gently scratch its head. This can become an addictive massage technique!, Take your fingers and gently rub your bird’s feet. Some cockatiels will love a foot massage right away, while others might be startled at first. Many birds seem to love this kind of massage, so give it a try and see what yours thinks.You can also provide your cockatiel with a variety of perches with different textures. When your bird stands on them, they can provide a kind of massage for its feet.You can even try gently scratching the bird’s feet with a stick.

, Your bird may fluff up the feathers on its head if it is enjoying being petted. It may also stand on one foot, sing, or even “talk” to you!, Every cockatiel has its own personality. Many will like to be petted, though yours may not. Some cockatiels may like to be petted, but not all the time. If your bird doesn’t seem to want to be petted, don’t push it., If you have started to pet your cockatiel (or are trying to), and it does not want to be touched, it may behave somewhat aggressively. Hissing, tail fanning, swaying from side to side, backing into a corner, puffing up, and lunging with its beak open can all indicate that your cockatiel does not want to be petted., Certain kinds of petting can cause your bird to become hormonal. For most birds, this means petting them in places other than their heads. In particular, you should avoid stroking the wings or base of the tail, even if your bird seems to enjoy being petted in other areas., If your bird has become hormonal, it may regurgitate food, begin panting, or act especially protective of you. It may even attack other people that come near you. If you see any of this behavior, you should stop petting your cockatiel., Cockatiels are prone to have night frights. This means that yours may become scared by something in the dark, and begin to thrash around violently in its cage. This can be startling, but try to speak softly to your bird to soothe it. Then, try petting its head to calm it down.Leaving a night light on in the room you keep your bird in may help prevent night frights.

, If you are hand-feeding baby cockatiels, you can make their mouths open. Simply massage one on the side of its head (by its ears), using a circular motion. This will stimulate it to yawn, making it easier to feed the bird., Hand-fed baby cockatiels are prone to aerophagia, or gulping air. This can cause them to become bloated and need to be burped. Simply massage its crop (the pouch near the base of its throat) by rubbing it lightly with a finger to help release the air."

Feed treats to your cockatiel.",How to Have Fun With Your New Cockatiel1," When you first bring your new cockatiel home, he may need anywhere from a few days to two weeks to get comfortable in his new environment.Limit your interactions with him during this time.Having a comfortable cage will help your cockatiel adjust to your home. Make sure the cage is large enough for him to spread his wings without touching the sides of the cage. Also, a square or rectangular cage is preferable, since a round cages tend to make birds feel nervous.Put his cage in a busy part of your home. Since cockatiels thrive on interaction, getting him used to human activity will help him acclimate to your home.Place wood perches of variable diameters in his cage to give his feet good exercise.His food and water dishes should go at the height of the perches to prevent them from getting contaminated by his droppings.When you first bring him home, consider sitting with him for about 20 minutes in the room where you have placed his cage— without putting him in his cage. By doing this, he will learn that the space outside of his cage is safe, making it easier for you to take him out of his cage later on.;
, Your new cockatiel will need daily interaction with you. Plan to spend one hour per day interacting with him.This interaction can involve different types of activities, such as talking to him, petting him, or teaching him new tricks (e.g., ‘step up’).Pay attention to what your cockatiel likes to do. This can give you ideas on how to interact with him. For example, if he likes to toss a toy with his beak, roll a toy towards him and let him toss it back to you.Interacting with him in a way that he enjoys will deepen your bond with him and let you have even more fun with him.

, Talking to your new cockatiel is a great way to interact with him. You can even teach him how to talk! When you talk to him, associate your words with something very specific. For example, say the name of a particular food (e.g., ‘apple’) as you are feeding it to him.You can also say ‘good morning’ when you get greet him in the morning and say ‘bye bye’ as you walk out the door.Your cockatiel is more likely to learn words or phrases that are spoken enthusiastically. Whichever words or phrases you want your cockatiel to learn, say with them energy and enthusiasm.With repetition, your cockatiel will start saying the words back to you, even if it sounds more like a whistle initially.
Keep in mind that male cockatiels are more likely to talk than female cockatiels., Interestingly, cockatiels have rhythm.When you have him perched on your finger, turn on some music and gently move your hand up and down to the beat of the song.Watch with amusement as your cockatiel starts to bob his head to the beat., Your new cockatiel will enjoy being able to interact with you when he is outside of his cage. If you have not had his wings clipped, he will enjoy having the space to fly around the room and your home.If his wings are clipped, he may be perfectly content to sit on a perch.Portable perches are available at your local pet store.Wood play pens are also available that you could set up outside of your cockatiel’s cage.If you have a skittish or nervous cockatiel, he may prefer to stay inside his cage. Do not force him to come out of his cage for the sake of interacting with you.

, In the wild, cockatiels will eat together. To foster this same type of social interaction, consider feeding your cockatiel when you are eating. This will make him feel like he is eating with you, even if he is not eating off your plate.Make sure to wash your hands after feeding him and before eating your own meal., Another way to have fun with your cockatiel is to feed him treats. There is a variety of treats that you can feed him, such as packaged seed treats and spray millet.Some healthy treats include strawberries, mangoes, and yellow peppers.Keep in mind that treats should be only a small part of your cockatiel’s diet. Feeding him too many treats could lead to health problems such as obesity.
Make you hold the treat by its sides to prevent your bird from biting your fingers."

Prepare the right cage.,
Provide a nest box.,
Add perches.,
Watch the heat.",How to Keep Cockatiels Healthy While Breeding2," When breeding, try to provide your cockatiels with as much space as possible. At minimum, choose a cage that is 30 inches (76.2 cm) long, 18 inches wide, and 36 inches (91.4 cm) high. However, if at all possible go for something bigger.An aviary is actually ideal for breeding pairs but not a possibility for most people. This is a large room specifically designed for your birds to live in. If you have the ability to use an aviary, do so.If you decide on a cage, go for a welded wire cage. You'll need to add a nest box at some point and it's easier to do so when working with a cage of this kind.If you decide to build your own cage, do not use chicken wire with 1 by 1 inch openings. These are not safe for cockatiels as they can fit their heads through and get stuck., If you're breeding your birds, they'll need a nest box. This is a small box big enough to contain the 4 to 5 chicks cockatiels typically have when breeding.


Next boxes should be at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) high and 12 inches deep. They should have a 3 inch (7.6 cm) wide hole in the front so breeding pairs can access chicks. You can purchase a nest box at a pet store or build your own. However, it might be better to go the pet store route. You want to make sure the box is safe for your cockatiels and will promote the health and safety of their chicks.Some people use cardboard boxes in place of nest boxes. If your birds breed unexpectedly, this may work as a temporary solution. However, commercial nest boxes are relatively inexpensive and tend to hold up well., For their health, cockatiels needs stimulation in their cages. Also, mating usually occurs on perches. Therefore, have at least 2 perches in your cockatiels' cages if you expect them to breed.


Make sure perches are secure. If you don't feel comfortable installing them yourself, hire someone to do so. If a perch falls while a bird is standing on it, accidents could occur.Keep perches low enough that males can easily stand on them. If a male cannot properly mount a female, breeding will not occur., The heat of your cage should be monitored during the breeding process. It plays an essential role in the healthy development of your chicks.


Heat allows an embryo to develop. Therefore, make sure the cage is not too cold or drafty.
You should also strive to keep the heat stable. Sharp variations between hot and cold temperatures can confuse your cockatiels. If the weather suddenly becomes warm, for example, your cockatiel may leave her eggs. If it becomes cold again quickly, she may not realize she needs to return to the eggs and keep them warm. This could result in the embryo dying. Keep the cage at a stable room temperature."
"
Determine age.,
Have your cockatiels professionally evaluated.,
Get a DNA test if you don't know your birds' genders.,
Make sure your birds are not related.",How to Keep Cockatiels Healthy While Breeding3," If you don't know your both your cockatiels' ages, you need to figure this information out before breeding. A vet can help determine the rough age of your cockatiel. If possible, ask for your birds' birth dates from the breeder or pet store where you purchased them. If your cockatiels are not at least 15 to 24 months old, breeding is risky. Younger birds encounter more problems when breeding and fertilization is generally less successful., You should never simply breed two cockatiels without veterinary approval. You should have your birds thoroughly examined by a vet before beginning the breeding process. You want to make sure they're physically capable of breeding successfully.


Make an appointment with an avian vet. Explain to him or her you're thinking of breeding your cockatiels and you want to make sure this is safe.Your vet may want to do some blood tests in addition to a physical exam. Females with low blood calcium levels should not breed until levels can be raised., It can be difficult to determine a cockatiels gender through a physical examination. There are some behavioral and physical characteristics that may offer hints. Males are louder, for example, and females have more markings under their wings. However, the only way to tell for sure is a DNA test. If you don't know the gender of your cockatiels, have your vet conduct a DNA test to determine this. DNA can be gathered from blood or feathers., As the chance of genetic disorders increases with inbreeding, you should not breed your cockatiels if they are related. Return to the breeder or pet store where you purchased your cockatiels. Ask for a pedigree to make sure the birds do not share common ancestors. If you cannot obtain a pedigree, you may want to err on the side of caution and avoid breeding.

"
"
Create a safe and comfortable environment.,
Remove other pets from the area.,
Clean your hands.",How to Handle a Cockatiel1," In order for your cockatiel to be comfortable with being held, it will need to be in a calm and quiet environment. For example, this means that you should not have loud music on, have unexpected loud noises occur, or use abrupt movement when picking up your bird.You should also use a calm voice when addressing the cockatiel while picking it up. Loud noises coming from you can scare the bird.;
, When preparing to hold your pet bird, you should remove all other animals from the area that could be a risk to it. In most cases, this means keeping dogs and cats out of the room while you hold your cockatiel. This will help to assure that the bird does not get scared while you are holding it and that it does not get attacked while it is outside of its cage.

If your bird is used to your other pets, and they show no interest in your cockatiel, then you may be able to keep them in the same room while handling your cockatiel. However, it is probably better to avoid the risk of conflict and injury to the bird by keeping them separated when the cockatiel is out of its cage.
If you have multiple birds that live in different cages, they can typically be out of their cages at the same time. Just make sure that none of them are aggressive and that they all get along well., It is very important to clean your hands before and after picking your bird up. You can transfer diseases onto your cockatiel if you don't clean your hands with soap and water or with hand sanitizer before handling them. Also, it is important to wash your hands after holding them, so that you do not transfer any diseases they might have.Cleaning your hands before holding your bird, in combination with keeping its cage clean, is important to the overall good hygiene of the bird.

Check the length of the cockatiel’s nails.,
Have the nails trimmed by a vet or trained professional.,
Get a friend to hold the bird steady for you.,
Look for the quick.,
Clip carefully.",How to Groom a Cockatiel2," Generally, the nails are too long if the toe is unable to make full contact with the ground when the cockatiel is placed on a flat surface.Another way to evaluate whether the nails are too long is to pay attention to the feeling of the bird’s nails when they perch on your hand or arm. If the nails are so sharp that they cut, scratch, or cause pain in your arm, it’s time to get them trimmed., Before doing it yourself, it will help to see a pet shop employee or veterinarian trim your cockatiel’s nails. This way, you’ll know how to properly trim them when you try it yourself.Even if you can’t be present to see hem actually do it, it will help to observe the length of the nails before and after being trimmed. You can use these measurements to get an idea of how long the nails should be in the future.


A list of cockatiel breeders is available at https://www.beautyofbirds.com/cockatielbreeders.html. Some cockatiel breeders offer grooming services.
A list of avian vets is available through the Association of Avian Veterinarians at http://aav.site-ym.com/search/custom.asp?id=1803.
Another list of avian vets is available through the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners animal specialist database at http://www.abvp.com/diplomate.

, The trimming is much easier when you have a partner. Your partner should wrap the bird in a small towel to prevent it from flapping and moving too much when it’s having its nails trimmed., The quick is a fine blood vessel that runs through the center of the nail. While it’s easy to spot in lutinos and light-colored cockatiels, it can be harder to see in gray-footed cockatiels, or those with dark toenails. Cutting the quick will result in a dangerous, bloody mess on your cockatiel’s foot. If you cannot see the quick, consider having a specialist cut the bird’s nails, or err on the side of caution when cutting the cockatiel’s nails.If you accidentally cut the quick, check the severity. Sometimes a small cut will stop quickly after a few drops of blood are spilt.
Have some styptic sticks on hand as part of your cockatiel first-aid kit. Styptic sticks are agents which promote hemostasis (the process by which bleeding stops) and are available at pet stores. If you do not have any styptic sticks and the bleeding is profuse, dip the bleeding foot in cornstarch or flour to staunch the flow.

, Cockatiel nails can be clipped with a regular nail clipper, but these might be too large and make the task more difficult than it need be. Instead, try a baby nail clipper or a specially-designed nail clipper for birds and cats.These are available at pet stores or online.


Do not cut the quick when clipping.

"
Decide if it is necessary to clip the cockatiel’s wings.,
Have your vet or a trained professional clip your bird’s wings.,
Do not cut a blood feather.,
Administer a light but even clipping to your cockatiel.,
Avoid doing a one-wing clip.",How to Groom a Cockatiel3," There are several reasons why you might clip your cockatiel’s wings.Maybe you think it a matter of course to clip your pet cockatiel’s wings. You might want to prevent the bird from escaping or limit its ability to fly about the house. However, you can use caution to keep your bird inside by, for instance, investing in a spacious cage and closing the door when you let your cockatiel explore the room or house it lives in.


You can also engage in training to ensure the bird flies in only certain areas or certain ways.
While clipping the wings is not hard, it can limit a bird’s ability to stay healthy and fit. Feathers which have been clipped might not re-grow properly and the bird could develop behavioral problems. Furthermore, it may leave them in danger if they are ever in a situation where escape is necessary, such as an encounter with another pet. Therefore, carefully consider if clipping the wings is a good choice for your bird.

, The best option when getting your cockatiel’s wings clipped is to have someone do it who know what they’re doing. It is a delicate procedure and can end badly if the wings are clipped too close, or the wrong feather is cut.


If you do not feel like dropping the money on it, at least watch your vet or a trained professional clip your bird’s wings before attempting to do so yourself. Carefully observe their behavior and make a video recording of the clipping for later reference., Blood feathers, also called pin feathers, are feathers just starting to grow. They carry a large blood supply since they are still growing. If cut, they will bleed profusely. To avoid cutting a blood feather, check the shaft. The shaft of a blood feather will be dark due to the blood within; the shaft of a mature feather will be white.


Identify the shaft of each feather you intend to cut. If you have trouble identifying the shaft, soak the wings in a mix of water and alcohol.Move other feathers out of the way while examining a particular feather.

, Use cat claw clipper, dog nail clippers, and bird claw clipper to clip your cockatiel’s feathers. Clipping six to eight primary feathers from each of your cockatiel’s wings is usually sufficient.The primary feathers are those closest to the wing tips, and can be distinguished from secondary feathers by observing a fully outstretched wing. Look closely at the wing and you’ll notice a slight inward dip in the bottom of the feather line. This line serves as the natural dividing point between primary and secondary feathers.


Have a friend hold the cockatiel. It helps to wrap it gently in a towel. Slowly extend the wing whose feathers you want to cut.
Begin cutting at the tip of the wing. Cut all the feathers which you want trimmed on one wing before moving to the next. Cut the same feathers in equal amounts on each wing.
Do not clip more than ten primary feather’s from a cockatiel’s wings.Do not clip your bird’s wings with scissors.
Do not clip any secondary feathers.Your clipping should allow the bird to fly down from a perch or cage but should be unable to fly up. If your bird can do neither -- or both -- successfully, you may need to revise your clipping technique with the help of a qualified professional.

, The one-wing clip is, as its name suggests, a clip performed on only one wing, with the aim of unbalancing the bird’s path of flight.It has been described as crude and cruel, and is not advised since it can threaten the safety and life of the cockatiel. When birds realize that their plumage is unbalanced, it might inspire them to start plucking their own feathers, a behavior which can be difficult to correct.To execute a one-wing clip, simply follow the same directions as you would would to clip both your bird’s wings, but apply the clipping pattern to only one wing.

Change your cockatiel’s diet.,
Remove potential nesting sites.,
Decrease your cockatiel’s exposure to direct sunlight.,
Prevent inappropriate pair bonding.,
Induce molting.,
Separate your cockatiel from the other bird.,
Place “mock” eggs in her nesting site.",How to Get Your Cockatiel to Stop Laying Eggs1," In the wild, cockatiels will be ready to mate when they have access to sources of fat and protein in their environment. If your cockatiel’s diet is rich in fat and protein, her body will essentially be in a constant state of being ready to mate and lay eggs.You should not go as far as removing all of the fat and protein out of her diet, but you can start giving her more low-fat foods, such as fruits and vegetables.Decrease her intake of birdseed, since this is typically high in fat.
Consult with your avian veterinarian for guidance on making her diet more healthy without cutting out any important nutrients.;
, The more places that your cockatiel can find to nest, the more likely she will lay eggs. Potential nesting sites include just about any areas that are dark and quiet on the inside where she can hide, such as empty cardboard boxes, small bird tents, and old clothes. If you occasionally let your cockatiel out of her cage, she may also try to seek out other locations for nesting, such as closets and empty cabinets.Keeping her in her cage more often will reduce the chances of her finding places in your house to nest., For wild and captive cockatiels, the urge to mate will begin when there is more than 12 hours of daylight (spring and summertime). Your cockatiel may be laying eggs because her cage is receiving 12 or more hours of direct sunlight. Try moving her cage to an area of your house where it will not be in the direct path of sunlight for more than half of the day.Another option is to partially cover her cage with a towel or piece of bed linen during the day to keep out the direct sunlight., If you spend a lot of time bonding with your cockatiel, you may not realize that she might see you as a mate. Doing things such as petting her head or scratching under her wings mimics what cockatiels do in the wild with their mate, as either a mating ritual or regular preening.Although you want to have a good relationship with your cockatiel, you certainly do not want her to mistake you as an object of her affection!


Talking to your cockatiel and having her in the room with you are ways in which you can bond without her seeing you as her mate.Cockatiels are very vocal and enjoy talking, so she may even start talking back to you.Your cockatiel may also see an inanimate object, such as a stuffed animal or mirror, as a potential mate.Remove these items from her cage.

, Molting occurs when a bird sheds her old feathers and grows new ones. A female bird will typically molt after she has finished laying her eggs and weaned her babies. For your cockatiel, inducing her to molt after she has laid her eggs will send a signal to her body that she should not try to lay any more eggs. You can induce molting by making changes to her environment, such as moving her cage to a different location or rearranging some of the items in her cage., This will be important if you have more than one cockatiel. If you have two females and one is a chronic egg layer, she may stimulate your other female to lay eggs as well.If you have a male and a female cockatiel, the male may want to mate with your female cockatiel. If either situation applies to you, it will be good to separate your cockatiels to reduce the likelihood of excessive egg laying.If you have a male and female cockatiel, trying to breed them to stop her from laying eggs is not recommended for several reasons. First, they simply might not be a good match for each other. Also, there is a risk of disease transmission if you do not know their disease statuses. In addition, your relationship with your female cockatiel may suffer, especially if you try to mate her and something goes wrong., On average, a female cockatiel will lay about five to eight eggs at a time. She will be able to feel her eggs beneath her when she is laying on them, and will know when she has laid all of her eggs.To stimulate the feeling that she has finished laying all of her eggs, you can place marbles or scotch mints in her nesting site.Place the mock eggs in the nesting site when your cockatiel happens to stand up and move away from the nesting site.
Mock eggs are also available at your local pet store.

Leave the television or radio on.,
Provide your cockatiel with a variety of toys.,
Move your cockatiel’s cage to a different location.,
Provide your cockatiel with a cage mate.",How to Have Fun With Your New Cockatiel2," Environmental enrichment is very important to your cockatiel’s health and well-being. The happier he feels in his environment, the more fun you will have with him. For the times when you are away from home, leaving the television or radio on for him will keep him mentally and visually stimulated until you get home.Channels that your bird might enjoy are the Travel Channel and Discovery Channel.Animal Planet is another good channel for your bird to watch.
Other than the television or radio, you could also play a CD with bird or nature sounds., As with other pets, cockatiels can become bored when playing with the same toys. Giving your cockatiel a variety of toys (e.g., wooden toys, puzzler toys) will provide him with good physical and mental exercise. You do not have to spend a fortune on toys, though—rotating out the toys every few days will give him what seems like an endless array of toys from which to choose.Cockatiels especially like toys they can shred and destroy. A balled-up piece of newspaper or notebook paper is perfect for your cockatiel and will save you money.Cockatiels have a natural instinct to chew.Select chew toys made of either wood or leather.Chew toys have the added benefit of keeping your cockatiel’s beak trimmed down.Foraging toys encourage your cockatiel to exhibit his natural foraging behavior. By requiring him to put in extra effort to get his food, foraging toys also provide good mental stimulation and physical exercise.Rope preening toys are also available that will satisfy your cockatiel’s natural urge to preen and prevent him from feather picking and self-mutilation.Comfort toys (e.g., snuggle perches) are toys that your cockatiel could snuggle up against, especially if he does not have a cage mate.Exercise toys, such as swings and bungees, will provide your cockatiel with plenty of physical exercise., This will give your cockatiel a change of scenery, which would keep him visually stimulated. Select a new location that is on the periphery of activity, rather than in the center of it. This would give your bird a chance to observe the different activity, but also have some peace and quiet.Determine if your bird will be able to tolerate a change of scenery. If your bird is older or timid, a change in location could cause him to start feather picking., Since cockatiels are such social animals, your cockatiel may be happier if he has a cage mate with whom he can interact.If you spend a lot of time away from home, providing your cockatiel with a cage mate will keep him entertained and busy while you are not home.


Make sure that the new bird is well socialized and friendly.Be mindful that you will need to have frequent interaction with both birds.Having two birds in the same cage could have its downsides. For example, the birds could start to exhibit aggressive behavior. Also, when the birds reach reproductive maturity, they may begin to start feather picking because of hormonal stress.If your bird is older and has become accustomed to the solitary life, giving him a cage mate may not be ideal.Consult with your avian veterinarian if you are considering getting a cage mate for your cockatiel.

Lure the cockatiel towards your hand.,
Remove the cockatiel from its cage carefully.,
Be gentle.,
Make the experience pleasant for your bird.",How to Handle a Cockatiel2," When attempting to hold a cockatiel, it is best to have them climb onto your hand willingly rather than grabbing them. This is typically accomplished by training the bird to step to your finger or onto a stick you hold out like a perch.

Having a cockatiel that will step onto your finger or a stick requires that it is tame. This means that it has been socialized, typically from an early age, to interact with humans and to complete commands that they give.

, When removing a cockatiel from its cage, be sure that the bird fits through the door without any problem. You do not want to knock the cockatiel against the sides of the door or against items in its cage. If the bird is injured while being removed, it could make the bird fearful of being held in the future., When holding your cockatiel you want to use a gentle touch. Birds are delicate animals that should not be squeezed and tussled if at all possible. Allow your cockatiel to perch on you, instead of you keeping a hold on it. Using this type of gentle touch will be safe for the bird and can help to build up a relationship of trust with the bird.

If your cockatiel is trained well, it will not fly away and be uncontrollable when out of its cage. Making sure to train it well will allow you to be more gentle with it in the long run., While you are holding your cockatiel, feed it treats, pet is softly, talk to it, and play games with it. Making the experience as pleasant as possible will increase the likelihood that your bird wants to be held again.

While your bird may like to sit on your shoulder and come along while you complete your daily chores, this does not provide the bird with much interaction. Instead, use out of the cage time to train and interact with the bird."
"
Clip your bird's wings.,
Handle your bird regularly.,
Train your bird.",How to Handle a Cockatiel3," Some bird owners choose to clip their bird's wings so that their birds cannot fly effectively. This procedure, which is most reliably done by a veterinarian, will prevent the bird from flying into walls or windows and injuring itself.Remember, however, that a bird with clipped wings cannot escape danger easily. This means that you need to be vigilant with keeping it away from possible predators, such as the family dog or a young child that doesn't know it needs to be gentle with the bird., The more often you handle your cockatiel, the more it will be comfortable with being handled by you. You should start handling it from a young age, if possible, and use it as a way to build a relationship up with your bird. A young bird will adjust to handling more easily than an adult bird that has not been handled before.

A bird that is not handled regularly can become nervous and defensive over time. If your cockatiel is not handled on a regular basis it may begin to bite and be aggressive., Taking the time to train your bird will make handling easier in the long run. If your bird knows how to follow commands, and that it will get a treat or a fun time if it does, then it is more likely to be well behaved while being handled. Overall, training is both how you get a bird to come willingly onto you and it is the way that you keep it from flying around while being handled.

Handling is typically one of the first types of training that you do with a cockatiel but it can also then be the foundation for other types of training. Training your cockatiel to do tricks or talk can be done while holding the bird. This builds up the relationship and trust you have with the bird.

Improve her diet.,
Do not remove the eggs right away.,
Examine the eggs.,
Monitor your cockatiel for illness.",How to Get Your Cockatiel to Stop Laying Eggs2," Even though you want to stop your cockatiel’s egg laying, you will need to know what do if and when she starts laying eggs. Egg laying can be very taxing on your cockatiel’s body, so it will be important for her to be in the best nutritional state possible. One nutrient that she will need plenty of is calcium. Cuttlebone is an excellent source of calcium and can be found at your local pet store.She may also need a multivitamin to add more vitamins and minerals to her diet, especially if she primarily eats birdseed.If your cockatiel is on a pelleted diet, she may not need additional calcium supplementation.Over-supplementation is not good for your cockatiel. Consult with your avian veterinarian to determine what supplements your cockatiel may need to keep her healthy for laying eggs.Make sure that she also has access to plenty of fresh water., Because your cockatiel will be able to sense when she has finished laying her clutch of eggs, removing the eggs from the nesting site too soon will essentially take that sense away from her. She will continue to lay eggs until she feels like she has laid enough, which could lead to a serious calcium deficiency and other medical problems.It is recommended to wait for anywhere from eleven days to three weeks after she has finished laying her eggs to remove them from the nesting site.A female cockatiel, whether wild or captive, will typically abandon her eggs three weeks after she has finished laying them.Remove the eggs gradually–one at a time and every other day–until you have removed all of them. Removing them slowly will help her understand that the eggs are not fertile.Consult with your avian veterinarian on what to do with the eggs that you have removed.

, The look and feel of the eggs can serve as an indication of your cockatiel’s overall health. For example, if the shell looks misshapen or feels soft and thin, your cockatiel may be suffering from a nutritional deficiency. Abnormal-looking shells could also indicate an infection in your cockatiel’s reproductive tract. Because nutritional deficiencies and infections are serious medical conditions that require immediate treatment, take your cockatiel to your avian veterinarian if your bird’s eggs are in bad shape.Eggs that are broken or cracked should be removed immediately, since they are more susceptible to bacterial growth.Replace these eggs with mock eggs so that your cockatiel does not sense that she has not laid enough eggs.

, There are a number of medical conditions that can result from excessive egg laying, all of which require veterinary treatment. One condition is egg binding, in which the egg becomes stuck in your cockatiel’s reproductive tract and cannot be expelled from her body. If your cockatiel is showing signs of distress or struggle with laying her eggs, take her to your avian veterinarian for immediate treatment.Other signs of egg binding are difficulty breathing and blood coming from your cockatiel’s vent (where the egg passes through).Excessive egg laying can also lead to your cockatiel’s reproductive tract being pushed through her vent.This would also require immediate veterinary treatment.
Your cockatiel could also develop hyperlipidemia, which means that too much fat is in her blood. This is caused by extra fat and protein being in her blood during egg development. Her blood could thicken if there is too much circulating fat, which could lead to a stroke.Your cockatiel may also have broken bones as a result of excessive egg laying, due to the loss of calcium."
"
Make sure your cockatiel has clear eyes, good plumage, energy, the ability to fly around and grooming.,
Have a somewhat large cage.,
Be sure the food is healthy.,
Keep all food and water dishes clean.,
Clean out their cage.,
Allow the bird to exercise.,
Give the cockatiel lots of love and attention.,
Safeguard your house to keep the cockatiel from getting hurt.",How to Keep a Cockatiel Healthy,";
, Be sure that the cage is enough so, at the very least, the cockatiel will be able to flap it's wings around quickly without hitting any of the bars. This is very important, because if it does not fly, it will do this for exercise. It is even better if you have a cage or aviary that the bird can fly about in.

, Food should be healthy (a variety of seeds, millet, sunflower, oats, etc.) The more healthy foods you feed, the better. One or two different fruit or veggies a day is a good source of vitamins. It does not have to be too much. Just keep it consistent. #*Having cuttlebone is good as well. Cuttlebone or edible chalk gives the bird minerals, which are essential for good bones, and are related to a good plumage.


Provide the bird with fresh, clean water. It is a VERY good choice.

, There should be no cracks, as bacteria can accumulate. Never, ever, give your birds table scraps.

, Cleaning the cage is a must. Once a week is good enough, if you have a large cage. If you have a somewhat smaller cage, you can clean it more often, so the birds droppings do not accumulate there. Keep it consistent. You should clean the food and water cages every day, when you change the food and water once a week. A quick rinse with hot water is good.

, Exercise is important, or else the bird will become obese. If the cage is large enough, it will exercise itself. If the cage is smaller, take the bird out and let it fly or walk around the house. Make sure there are no possible hazards. Toys of different sorts (such as bells) are great. However, rubber toys should be avoided, as they can harm the bird if it eats them.

, Tame birds should have about an hour of interaction a day (it does not have to be direct.) For instance, if you have to write a paper or something like that, set the bird down on a perch on the table, and you can write while talking to the bird. If you must be away for extended periods of time, you should buy your bird a pal (such as a Budgie, which is also known as a Parakeet). If your bird is not tame, you should try your hardest to tame it. If this is a burden, remember that a tame bird is very friendly, and does all sorts of tricks.

, This is essential if you let it wander around the house (which you should do).


Keep the bird out of the kitchen and bathroom, as this is where most accidents happen. #*Beware of open aquariums and vases.
Birds can mistake the water as firm, then land and drown.
Pointy things, such as knives, pens or even pencils should be put away while your bird is out. Before you sit, check the chair so you don't accidentally sit on your pet. with while you are walking around a cluttered place where your bird is. Make a habit out of checking

Find a partner to help you.,
Towel your bird.,
Extend your bird's wings.,
Locate the flight feathers (or primary flights).,
Plan which feathers to trim.,
Let baby birds learn to fly before clipping.",How to Clip a Cockatiel's Flier Feathers1," One person should hold your cockatiel firmly and put his middle and index fingers on the sides of the bird's neck to keep her from biting., If you are having trouble controlling your bird, try covering your bird with a soft, clean towel. This may calm the bird and make him easier to handle.It is a good idea to “towel train” your bird in advance, so he will be easier to deal with when you need to restrain him. Use the same towel every time, and give your bird treats on the towel. Allow him to walk underneath the towel on his own until he gets used to the towel.
Do not constrict a bird's chest when restraining him with a towel. Birds need to be able to completely expand their chest in order to breathe properly.

, Have the person who is holding your cockatiel open one of her wings. Be gentle but firm with the wings, as the bones are very fragile., Your cockatiel's flight feathers are the long feathers at the outer edge of his wings. Do not clip any feathers that grow on the inner portion of the wing – always stop at or before the bend in the wing (the middle joint.), Using pet nail trimmers or scissors with blunt ends, clip three or four of the primary flight feathers from each wing, beginning with the longest one and working your way in toward the bird's body. The primary flight feathers are the longest feathers at the tips of your bird's wings., Allow baby birds several weeks to learn how to fly before you attempt to trim their flight feathers. If you clip them too soon, the birds will not develop the muscles needed to fly as adults.”Flight” means a bird can lift herself from the ground or another surface, and can move herself through the air of her own volition.
”Gliding” means a bird can control her wings well enough to drift safely to the floor when released; however, she will not be able to lift herself off the ground or maintain flight once she is in the air.

"
"
Clip each flight feather individually.,
Clip using the traditional method.,
Do a test flight.",How to Clip a Cockatiel's Flier Feathers2," A more modern technique is to clip each individual flight feather on the shaft right at the point where there are no longer any barbules. (The feathery protrusions growing from the quill, or shaft, are called barbs or barbules.)


Select the flight feather you wish to trim, and clip it carefully on the quill, below the barbules (the wide, soft part of the feather).
Cut the quill just below the barbules — if you clip too close to the bird, you may hurt him.
Never cut the shaft if it is dark in color — this is the blood supply that indicates it is a growing feather (or blood feather.)
Clip only a few feathers at first, and don't clip more than you absolutely have to. Birds are very proud about their feathers, and over-clipping your bird may upset him.

, The old-fashioned way to clip a cockatiel's feathers is to cut all the flight feathers at once, so that the ends of the feathers create a straight line; however, this can leave sharp edges that can injure your bird.


Clip the group of feathers you intend to trim all at once, about halfway up the wide part of the feather – as if you were giving the bird a hair cut.
Trim the feathers at an angle, to match the length of the covert feathers (the shorter, softer feathers on top.)

, After clipping four of your cockatiel's primary flights, let her loose for a “test flight.” If she can still attain lift, clip one more flight feather from each wing. Your bird should be able to control drift when released, so she can glide to the floor safely. She should not be able to lift off, however, or remain airborne."
"
Avoid cutting blood feathers.,
Treat a clipped blood feather.,
See a vet if the bleeding persists.",How to Clip a Cockatiel's Flier Feathers3," These are new feathers that are growing in to replace lost feathers. A blood feather contains a vein and an artery, providing blood flow the feather needs to develop. In a cockatiel, blood feathers have a dark purple/blue quill (the tube-shaped portion of the feather).
A cockatiel's mature feathers have a pale, opaque, slender quill that does not contain blood.
Blood feathers are often sore and tender to the touch, and handling them at all will hurt your bird.
Clipping a blood feather can cause serious (potentially fatal) bleeding that may require a veterinarian's attention.

, Restrain your bird, and apply pressure to the broken quill shaft with a cotton ball to stop the worst of the bleeding. Apply cornstarch or flour, using a cotton ball or Q-Tip, to the surface of the quill. Do not pack these substances into the feather's shaft. Continue to press firmly until the bleeding stops.You can also use a coagulant like Kwik Stop, available online or at your local pet store. Kwik Stop may sting your bird a little, but it is said to be very effective. It contains a topical anesthetic to treat the pain.
When a blood clot forms, be very careful not to disturb it, or the feather will start bleeding again.
Return your bird to his cage and watch him closely for at least an hour. If he seems weak or listless, or if the bleeding starts up again, see a vet right away.
Even if you successfully stop the bleeding, you may want to take your bird to an avian vet to have the damaged feather completely removed.

, If you are unable to stop the bleeding with pressure and cornstarch, take your bird to the vet right away. If your pet has a medical condition (such as liver disease) that prevents proper blood clotting, a clipped blood feather should be treated as a life-threatening emergency."

Bond with the bird first.,
Make sure your cockatiel is healthy.,
Make sure your cockatiel is happy.",How to Train a Cockatiel to Talk1," Human interaction is key to teaching a cockatiel to talk. While some people believe you can teach a bird to talk and tame it at the same time, this is a false belief. Instead, you need to bond with the bird and get it used to its home before talking training.


If you need some help taming a bird, your local veterinarian or pet store owner can help you, or an experienced friend can too.;
, Make sure your bird has enough food and water, as well as enough space in its cage. Also make sure that your bird is in good physical health by taking it for veterinary checkups on a regular basis. If your cockatiel is feeling under the weather, it is less likely to want to chat with you.

, Give it lots of attention and mental stimulation. Teaching the cockatiel to talk is part of that attention, but you also want to give it toys to play with and praise and affection whether it is talking or not.A cockatiel's brain needs to be stimulated in order for it to be happy.


Also make sure that the bird is in an environment that it likes. That way the bird will feel more comfortable when learning words.

Do your research.,
Prepare for the cost of owning a cockatiel.,
Purchase a cage and equipment for your cockatiel.,
Look into adopting a bird from a shelter or rescue organization.,
Find a trustworthy pet store or bird breeder.,
Think about what you want from your cockatiel before you shop.,
Look for signs that the cockatiel is healthy.,
Ask about the age of the bird.,
Allow your cockatiel to get used to its new environment.,
Begin to train your cockatiel.,
Get your cockatiel used to being bathed.",How to Buy a Pet Cockatiel," Buying a cockatiel is a major commitment, and it's important to know what you are getting into. All birds need to have their food and water refreshed daily and their cages cleaned frequently. But cockatiels are especially social animals that require daily exercise and attention from their owners to keep them happy and healthy. Be sure you have enough time to invest in your pet cockatiel, and that your family is on board with the decision.If a cockatiel sounds like too much work, consider a lower-maintenance option like a canary, or a pair of finches. These birds also make beautiful pets, but require far less attention.;
, The average cost of a cockatiel is only $80-100, but the start-up costs for its cage, food and equipment can easily reach $300.Also remember that the cockatiel will need food and toys, and at least one veterinary exam per year. You can expect ongoing costs for your cockatiel to be at least $100 per year., Cockatiels need a lot of room to exercise, so you want the biggest cage you can accommodate. The minimum recommended cage size for a single cockatiel is 24"" x 24"" x 24"". Be sure that the bars are spaced no more than 5/8"" apart. The cage should have at least 3 perches for the cockatiel to choose from.The bird will also need the following:


Food and water dishes
Cockatiel food
A night light near the cage; some cockatiels experience ""night frights""
A bird bath
Toys

, Friendly, lovable cockatiels are often given up to rescue organizations because their first owners bought them on a whim without realizing how much work a cockatiel is. The joy of taking care of a cockatiel will be magnified if you know that you did the bird a favor by saving her life.


Rescue organizations for cockatiels and other birds can be found worldwide!, Ask other cockatiel owners or your local avian veterinarian for tips on reputable sellers. Your local bird club is another good resource. Make sure the seller offers a health guarantee for any pets they sell, and remember that birds that are hand-raised will generally be more friendly and sociable than aviary cockatiels that are bred and raised for display.Ask the seller lots of questions about the birds and how they were raised. If the seller can't readily answer these questions, you should consider another shop.

, If you want a beautiful display bird and are less interested in companionship, choose your bird based primarily on appearance. If you are looking for a friendly companion bird, however, you will want to choose a bird based on its temperament and sociability more than how it looks.When choosing a display bird, choose a healthy bird with plumage that you find attractive.
When choosing a companion bird, look for a bird that seems curious and playful, makes noises, and is eager to be handled.
Some shy cockatiels can eventually be made more tame, but some never get used to people. Don’t count on being able to completely tame a skittish bird.

, Healthy birds have bright, clear eyes. They should have no discharge from their beaks, and no sneezing. Make sure the bird has a smooth beak that closes evenly, and no missing feathers or toes. Do not choose a bird with damaged, dirty or puffed up feathers. These are all signs of illness., It is ideal to choose a young bird that is fully weaned, and has been hand fed and hand raised. When considering an adult bird, note that the darker the bird's beak, the older it probably is.


Determining the sex of a cockatiel can be a tricky business, and in some cases requires DNA analysis to know for sure. Fortunately, both male and female cockatiels make wonderful pets. , The transition to a new home is stressful for a cockatiel, and your bird will need time to rest and get acclimated. Try to let the bird rest for 2-3 days before handling it. Try to keep children and other household pets away from the bird, but do talk to it frequently in a low, calming voice to help it get used to you.Remember that cockatiels are very social animals. You might leave music or the television on when you leave the house during the day so the cockatiel has something to listen to.

, You should spend some time researching the best ways to train a cockatiel, but a great place to start is teaching the bird to be near you outside of the cage. Gently remove the bird from the cage and take it to a small room with a door, like a bathroom or large closet. Close the door so the bird does not escape, and let the bird go. Then sit near the bird and talk to it every once in a while as it adjusts to your presence. Eventually, you can work on training the bird to climb onto your finger.Training a cockatiel can take time, but your patience will pay be rewarded with a well-socialized, friendly companion.

, Cockatiels can be very dusty birds and need to be bathed every few days. Fill a plant mister bottle with clean, slightly warm water, and acquaint your cockatiel with the routine by giving it just a spray or two in the beginning. It won't be long before the sight of the spray bottle will bring the cockatiel to a close perch. They love the spray and will open their wings and turn their bodies until they are soaking wet, and then shake off the excess water. Remember not to do bathe your cockatiel when it's too cold, or at night.
Cockatiels also enjoy bathing in pans of water, and even playing in a regular bathtub filled with 1/2"" of warm water."

Try not to react when bitten.,
Don't try to punish the cockatiel.,
Only pet the cockatiel if it remains calm.",How to Tame a Cockatiel," Do not attempt begin taming until it has spent a few weeks getting accustomed to its new environment. Keep the cockatiel in a quiet, calm area.;
, You may say anything you like, as long as your voice stays calm, without sudden changes in volume. Also try to speak softly, not loudly. Lower yourself to just above the cockatiel's eye level if you are taller than its cage, putting yourself in a less threatening position without appearing submissive. Keep this up for a few days before you make any attempt to train the bird.

, At some point, now that your bird is used to the sound of your voice, he or she will begin to move toward you when you sit down to talk to your cockatiel. At this point, you can begin to train your bird, but only very slowly., A spray of millet is commonly used to train cockatiels, since the birds are typically enthusiastic about the food, but you may use any cockatiel-appropriate food in small amounts. Hold it through the bars of the cage, but not directly at its face. This encourages the bird to make its way toward you voluntarily. Keep it steady as the bird pecks once or twice, or let it peck for up to five seconds when it demonstrates unusually good behavior.Only use the spray of millet, or whichever treat you chose, as a treat. The cockatiel may be less motivated for training if it can eat the same food without working for it.

, Each day, set aside some time to talk to the cockatiel, keep your hand steady near the bird, then give it a treat if it calms down. Spend no more than 10 or 15 minutes per session, one or two times a day, to avoid making cockatiel anxious. At the end of each session, make the cockatiel move closer to your hand before it can get the treat.


Even if a young bird is willing to play with you and appears happy, keep these sessions to no more than 15 minutes, as a young bird needs to return to its cage to eat and rest frequently.

, Once the bird is comfortable around you, it will stay calm as you approach it, and may even eat the treat directly from your hand. This may take weeks or months for an adult bird that is not used to close human interaction. Once you've reached this stage, you may convince the cockatiel to leave its cage, although some older birds that did not grow up socialized may not voluntarily do this.


Make sure all windows and doors in the room are closed, and no other pets are present, before you open the cage.

, Once the bird will approach you and eat from your hand, start approaching it in a similar way with an empty hand, extending two fingers horizontally. Hold the hand in position until the bird calms down, rewarding a bird with a treat if the cockatiel remains calm. Again, keep these sessions to 10 or 15 minutes, once or twice each day.

, Eventually, move your hand directly to the bird's perch, or touch its feet. Once you can keep your hand there without agitating the bird, gently push the bird's lower chest with your fingers. A light nudge should be enough to slightly knock the cockatiel off balance, and cause it to step on your finger with one foot.

, Each time the bird starts to step up, say a short command such as ""step up"" or ""up."" Praise the bird and give it a small treat when it does this. Praise again when bird steps with both feet. Keep training sessions to a few minutes at a time, making sure to always end on a positive note.


The cockatiel may use its beak to test the stability of your finger. Try not to jerk your hand away when the beak touches your finger.

, Once the bird will step onto your finger on command, teach it to ""step down"" onto another perch using the same method.Reinforce these behaviors by teaching it to ""ladder,"" or repeat the ""step up"" command from your left hand to your right and back again.Train the bird to perform these movements daily, until it will do so on command without a treat.


You do not need a special command for laddering. Repeat the ""step up"" command instead.

, As the training gets more complicated, your bird may have trouble figuring out why you are giving it a treat. Try using a ""clicker,"" or make a distinct, short sound by tapping a pen, each time the bird displays good behavior. This gets the bird's attention while you fetch a treat. Once the bird is well trained, you can use just the sound of the clicker or pen as a reward, but until then the treat is still a vital part of the training.


A clicker or other distinct sound is recommended over a verbal command, because it sounds the same each time and is unlikely to be encountered outside of training.

, Clicker training remains an excellent tool for training pets. Whenever you start teaching the cockatiel a new command, use a clicker or make a distinctive noise by tapping a pen at the moment it shows good behavior. Fetch a treat immediately afterward, and continue daily training until the cockatiel will respond to the command with just the clicker as a reward.

, If the cockatiel is comfortable outside its cage, put it on a white or beige towel on floor each day during its training session. Gradually bring up the corners of the towel, but stop if the bird struggles. Repeat the process each day, rewarding the bird when it stays calm, until you can fully enclose the cockatiel in the towel.This training will make it much easier to bring your cockatiel to the vet, or remove it from a dangerous situation.

, Repeat a phrase a few times, with an animated facial expression and tone, at a time when the cockatiel is relaxed and happy. If the cockatiel looks at you and demonstrates a reaction, such as cocking its head or dilating its pupils, it may be interested in that word. Repeat that word frequently, but stop if the cockatiel gets bored. When it attempts to mimic you, reward it with a treat.Male cockatiels can make more sounds than females, since they use more complex calls to attract mates. Female cockatiels can still talk, but the voice may not be as clear.
Most cockatiels can talk around eight months of age, although you can attempt to teach them as young as four months if the bird appears interested.It can be harder to train an adult bird not used to speaking.

, While watching the cockatiel, bob your head or rock your finger back and forth to music with a steady beat. When it starts to rock back and forth, reward it with a clicker and a treat. As you continue this training, and find music that gets the cockatiel's attention, it may sway more energetically and raise its wings while doing so.Similarly, whistling during these dance sessions may encourage the cockatiel to make sounds of its own.

, If the cockatiel bites you, try to keep your reaction to a minimum. Jerking away violently, responding loudly, or ending the taming session can encourage the bird to bite again. This can be difficult to avoid due to the painful bite, so try to avoid serious bites in the first place by leaving the cockatiel alone when it is hissing, when it has fully extended its head crest, or when its crest is flattened against its head.Wear thick gardening gloves if biting is a recurring problem.

, Cockatiels do not typically understand what you are doing when you attempt to punish them. They may enjoy it when you shout at them, return them to their cage, or otherwise react to bad behavior. Focus on praising the cockatiel during good behavior instead, or use mild forms of punishment such as ignoring the bird, or gently withdrawing the jewelry it is nibbling., Many cockatiels will only let you pet their crest or beak, and some dislike any form of petting. Pet slowly, and withdraw slowly if the bird hisses, nips at you, or flattens its crest.

Make sure your cockatiels are old enough.,
Ensure that the pair is not related.,
Inspect your birds for signs of good health.,
Keep in mind that not all cockatiels make good parents.You may have to hand raise the babies if the parents are negligent or treat the babies poorly.,
Provide 10-12 hours of natural or bright artificial light per day.,
Feed your birds well.,
Put your breeding pair into a large cage together.,
Create a nest box.,
Watch the male cockatiel prepare the nest.,
Observe the signs of mating.,
Allow the parents to brood their eggs.,
Leave the nest alone.,
Reduce breeding activity.",How to Breed Cockatiels," For breeding purposes, your male and female cockatiel should be at least 18 months old. Younger females may experience problems like egg binding and younger birds also may not take good care of their babies.Egg binding is a condition where the eggs become stuck in the cloaca. This may lead to an infection and even death.;
, Related birds have a higher chance of having weak or deformed babies. If you are not sure if your birds are related, then contact the person who bred your cockatiels to find out if they are related. Do not breed them if they are related.

, Before you decide to breed to cockatiels, it is a good idea to bring your birds to an avian veterinarian to get a clean bill of health before breeding.This is will help to protect against any diseases or defects your birds may have. Weight is also a good indication of health in cockatiels.



Overweight. Being overweight increases the chances of infertility in both sexes and egg binding in the female. If you are not sure if a cockatiel is overweight, try to feel your bird’s keel or breastbone. If you cannot feel the breastbone, then it is overweight.

Underweight. Being underweight may indicate that your bird has a disease or that one bird is guarding the food dish and preventing the other from eating. Find out what is causing your bird to be underweight before you start breeding your cockatiels.

, Make sure that you have the time and energy to devote to hand raising baby cockatiels before you decide to breed them.

, Cockatiels will breed any time of year, but they need a decent amount of light in order to breed. Make sure that your cockatiels have a source of natural or bright artificial light for 10-12 hours per day., Before breeding, it is important to ensure that your birds are eating well. Feed them a balanced diet of food that is meant for cockatiels. Check on your birds often to make sure that both cockatiels have equal access to food and water dishes. If one bird is guarding the food and water, then you can add extra dishes of food and water. Good foods to give your cockatiels include:cockatiel seed mix
soft foods such as greens, pasta, cooked rice, cooked beans, moist wheat bread
sprouted seeds
cuttlebone or mineral blocks for calcium
supplements (to sprinkle over other foods) such as spirulina, Echinacea, and Prozyme
fresh, clean water (change it a couple of times per day)

, Your cockatiels will need plenty of room for breeding and even more space after their young have hatched. Make sure that the cage that you put your cockatiel pair into is 6 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet.You can place the pair into their enclosure a few weeks before you provide a nest box so they can get to know each other and to get into sync for breeding.Place the cage in a quiet part of your home to give the couple the privacy and quiet they will need to breed, brood, hatch and raise their young.

, After the pair has been together for at least two weeks and they are getting along well, then you will then need to provide them with a nest box. As you choose a nest box, some things to consider include:



Material. There are many types of nest boxes available including metal, plastic and wooden ones. Wood is a good choice because cockatiels will chew on the entrance to customize it to their specifications.Size. A one foot by one foot box is sufficient for breeding cockatiels.

Rear access door. Some nesting boxes come with a rear access door so that you can check on the chicks without disturbing the hen.

Bedding. Cockatiel parents will use bedding to make a cozy and safe nest for the chicks. The best materials for nesting are low dust pine shavings or uncolored paper materials like newspaper or plain white paper towels.Do not use cedar shavings because the oils in this material can kill or injure the chicks.

, You will know that your cockatiels are preparing to mate when the male starts preparing the nest. The male will gnaw on the nest box opening to enlarge it to the size that he prefers. He will also arrange the bedding material in a way that he likes. When he has made the box the way that he wants it to be, then he will allow the female to enter., When it’s time to mate the male cockatiel will do a mating dance. During this dance, he will bob his head, hop around, and sing.You will also notice the birds grooming each other often. When the female is ready to mate she will crouch down. This position makes it possible for the male to mate with her.


Mating may take up to a minute and then the male will fly away.
The female cockatiel should lay her eggs about two weeks after mating.

, Each of the parents will take turns brooding the eggs, but the female will sit on them most of the time. You may notice that both parents pluck out some of their own feathers to expose a bit of bare skin. This is called a “brood patch” and the parents do this so that their bare skin can make contact with the eggs.


Hatching takes about three weeks, but she will lay eggs for about a week before she is ready to incubate them.She will lay an egg about once every 48 hours until she has laid a clutch of about two to eight eggs.The male cockatiel will provide food for the female cockatiel while she broods the eggs., After the 21 day incubation period, the eggs will hatch. You can take a quick peek at the nest box to make sure there are no dead or distressed chicks but otherwise try not to disturb the new family. Let the parents and babies have some time and privacy to bond.


Cockatiels will not begin the weaning process (eating without the help of a parent) until they are about eight to 10 weeks old.At this point, you may want to separate male and female chicks from each other to prevent breeding. Brothers and sisters may pair up and mate if the conditions are right, so it is best to separate male chicks from female chicks to prevent unwanted babies.

, After your cockatiels have mated and produced chicks, you may want to take steps to prevent them from mating again. There are a few different things that you can do to prevent mating.



Decrease light. Providing a little less light per day will discourage breeding. For example, you can reduce the amount of light that your cockatiels receive from 10-12 hours to about eight hours per day. This will simulate winter conditions and make it less likely that your cockatiels will mate.

Remove the nest box. Once you cockatiels have finished using the nest box to brood and raise their chicks, you can remove the nest box from the cage.Eliminate soft foods. Do not feed your birds any soft foods, such as pasta, beans, and moist bread. However, make sure that you are still giving your birds plenty of nutritious food."
"
Train the bird in a quiet place.,
Introduce the bird to one phrase at a time.,
Focus on words that your bird ""likes."",
Strengthen the behavior with positive reinforcement.,
Repeat the phrase often and be patient.,
Complicate and increase the phrases you teach the cockatiel.",How to Train a Cockatiel to Talk2," This will allow your bird to focus on you and your words. If your bird is easily distracted you can even try talking to it while its cage is covered. This will eliminate visual distractions as well., Keep it easy and short and use one that you say frequently, for instance the bird's name.If you want to teach it something other than its name, remember that the phrase should be simple, containing one or two words that are relatively high pitched.


Since cockatiels have high pitches voices, you may not be able to teach it words that you say in a low tone.
Use the words at the right time, such as don't teach it ""Good morning"" in the night when you are about to sleep, and vice versa.

, Look at the cockatiel's eyes. Are its pupils getting larger when you say a certain word? Does the bird's crest go up to indicate excitement or interest? If you see neither, you may not be teaching the bird a word it likes saying.


The cockatiel may not be repeating your phrase for other reasons too. For instance, it may be that the bird is not physically able to say it.

, Give the bird lots of treats and attention whenever the bird says a word correctly. Depending on your birds preferences, there isn't really a ""right"" thing to do. Some birds may like human food better, but some may like special bird treats. What ever you do, make it positive., No matter how smart your birdie is, it will not be Einstein. You must be patient, otherwise your bird will become frightened of you and you will have lost all the progress you have achieved. One single hand movement can do this, so be careful

, Once your bird has one phrase down, give it more to learn. After all, you don't want to hear just one phrase from your bird all day.


Try narrating things you do for your cockatiel. When you feed it an apple, say ""want a treat?"" If you do this enough, and your bird likes talking, it may start saying the phrase when it sees the treat coming.Try whistling at your cockatiel. If you give it a simple series of notes repeatedly, it just might repeat it back to you. Be warned, however, that once a cockatiel learns how to whistle, it may choose whistling over talking. This is because whistling is easier for the bird."
"
Choose your bird carefully.,
Set up an environment for your bird.,
Set up a comfortable cage, for times when you're not around, or at night.,
Provide a variety of healthy food for your bird.,
Introduce toys, so that your bird can entertain him or her self.,
Interact with your bird whenever possible.,
Develop a routine whenever possible.,
Bathe your bird weekly or bi-weekly with a spray bottle.",How to Take Care of Cockatoos," Look for one which is healthy, alert, and does not display signs of fearing strange humans.


Clear eyes and smooth, clean feathers are a sign of good health. Also check the feet (they should be scaly but dry and smooth), and the vent (should be free of fecal material).
A bird should hold its crest in a relaxed position, about halfway raised. A flattened crest indicates fear or hostility. A fully upright crest indicates surprise or defensiveness.
Purrs, low-pitched squawks, and clicks usually indicate curiosity or friendly intent. Hisses and high-pitched screams indicate aggression or fear.
The bird should show interest in normal activities, such as playing with toys, eating, and interacting with other birds or people.;
, While a cockatoo can spend time riding around on shoulders or sitting on a perch outside its cage, you need to ""bird proof"" any room where the bird will be loose.


Hazards which should be removed or hidden include: wiring (birds will chew on power cords), bare bulbs, flames, toxic plants, small hard objects (easily swallowed), standing water (deeper than 4cm), hot plates.
Make sure to cover holes, such as those behind appliances. Cockatoos love to explore what they perceive as ""tree cavities"".
Unless you are positive a room is 100% bird-proof, and is closed to prevent escape, don't allow your bird to be loose unsupervised.

, The cage should include perches, a toy or two, fresh water, and a removable tray for droppings. You'll also want a cloth to cover the cage at night.

, Besides bird food pellets, offer fresh fruits and vegetables.


Carrots, apples, celery, spinach, and pear are good choices.

, Cockatoos are highly intelligent, and easily bored.


Present toys one or two at a time, and replace the toy with a novel one when the bird tires of it. Keep old toys around to cycle back in.
Good toys include teething rings/teething toys, large bells, rope dog toys, balls (too large to swallow), and rattles.
Introduce entertainment. Besides playtime with humans, many birds enjoy listening to music or watching movies over your shoulder.

, Cockatoos are very social, and love companionship.


Talk to your bird as much as you can.
""Socially groom"" your bird by gently scratching the back of its head.
Play with your bird by allowing it to climb on you, stroking it, and offering toys from your hand.
Offer food treats, such as small pieces of fruit, directly from your hand.
Introduce your bird to new people.
Allow your bird to accompany you around the house. A trained cockatoo can ride on your head or shoulder while you do chores, talk on the phone, or watch TV.
Teach your bird tricks. Cockatoos enjoy the mental stimulation of learning new tasks, especially when they get a tasty fruit morsel as a reward! As well as being good talkers, they are agile and can be taught to do some amusing gymnastics.

, Birds have an acute sense of time and enjoy predictable interactions. For example, you can start a ritual of playing with the bird every day at a certain time, or of an activity you do together.

,


Some birds prefer to bathe themselves in a shallow dish (less than 5cm of water).
Mix 7 parts water to 1 part Listerine in your spray bottle if your bird's feathers need extra attention.

Give your cockatiel toys to shred and chew on.,
Put a swing in your bird's cage.,
Rotate your cockatiel's toys.,
Give the cockatiel somewhere to bathe.,
Provide a mirror for your bird.,
Consider getting another cockatiel.",How to Entertain a Cockatiel1," Cockatiels love to shred and chew on a variety of items. It stimulates their brains and keeps their beaks healthy. Providing them with a bunch of different things to chew on is important, as they can get bored with just one chewing or shredding toy. Things that cockatiels typically like to chew on include:Commercial shredding toys
Untreated wood, such as apple, ash, almond, apricot, peach, maple, or elm
Paper
Thin cardboard, such as paper towel rolls
Feather toys
Rope toys;
, Cockatiels tend to like sitting on swings once in awhile. Most swings made for birds are round hoops that allow the bird to sit upright inside of them. They move similarly to branches in the wild, so this may be why cockatiels like to sit on them.Pick a swing for your bird's cage that is covered in something that is easy for them to perch on, such as a swing that is wrapped in natural cotton rope.

, A cockatiel will get bored with toys that are always the same and always in the same spot. Switch out toys that the bird seems disinterested in and move toys it loves into different areas of its cage. Giving the bird some variety will help to assure that it continues to be entertained by its toys.When you rotate out old toys, put new toys in, and move the bird's existing toys around in its cage, take that opportunity to thoroughly clean any toys that are going in its cage. Having clean toys will help to assure that your bird remains healthy.

, Some cockatiels like to take a bath in a shallow dish of lukewarm water. This is typically placed at the bottom of the bird's cage and only left in place for a few hours. Providing your bird with the water and dish once a week or so will allow it to have some focused time cleaning and preening itself.Not all cockatiels enjoy this activity. Some just want to be sprayed by you with a light mist of warm water from a spray bottle. Spraying them will still give them much needed moisture and cleaning time.

, Some cockatiels can be entertained by looking at themselves in a mirror. Putting a small mirror in their cage can provide hours of entertainment. Your bird may look in the mirror and think that there is another bird there for it to interact with or even a potential mate.Since cockatiels are flock animals, they will likely be interested in interacting with the bird they see reflected in the mirror.

, A really good way to keep your cockatiel entertained is to get another one for it to interact with. The birds will be able to talk to each other and generally keep each other company.

You can keep both birds in separate cages that are placed next to each other. This will eliminate the chance of overcrowding or fighting.

Be sure your home and family is willing to accept the responsibilities and needs of the Cockatoo.,
Buy a very large cage and try to get one with a play gym on the top.,
Plan on buying lots of toys or making them.,
Pay attention to the birds.,
Good training early on in a bird's life will ensure continued acceptable behavior later on when the hormones kick in.,
If you go out, leave a radio or the TV on so they have something to listen to and watch.,
While some learn to talk well, they generally are the clowns and love entertaining you by dancing, flapping and swinging with loud abandon.,
If you plan on taking your bird outside, buy a harness or travel cage.",How to Live With a Moluccan Cockatoo," If you wish to cut down on the dust, make sure you have an excellent air cleaner in the same room and plan on a small shop vac for daily cleanups of debris thrown from the cage. Note it says "" cut down "". Cockatoos produce large amounts of dust and your home will get coated with it. Running the vacuum and / or dusting daily is pretty common with the Cockatoo species. They produce that much dust. Allergies or asthma ? Consider a different species.;
, Place the cage against a wall (unless you have a chewer) and never in front of a window where the bird cannot find some privacy and seclusion. Keep the cage where the bird can see family members interacting and feel like they are part of the action but in an area away from the kitchen and fumes.

, Cockatoos love to destroy things, chew up old socks, and their bright minds need to be stimulated all the time. Rotate the toys every week to keep their interest.

, These are not birds that can be left 8 hours a day with no human interaction. They become neurotic and can resort to self-mutilation to try to comfort themselves.

, Make sure you allow them time to amuse themselves and not indulge their constant need for attention. These birds aren't called 'Velcro' birds for nothing!

, Tell them you are coming back and will see them in a little bit. They understand a lot and have the intelligence of a 2 year-old human.

, Their vocal range is wide and can be heard halfway down the block, so have understanding neighbors that have been allowed to get to know the bird when you take it outside. If you live in an apartment, do not even consider a Moluccan. With a yell capable of reaching 130db, your neighbors will ensure you don't stay long.

, Wing clipping is not enough.

Don't rush into cockatoo ownership.,

Buy a suitable cage for your Moluccan or Umbrella Cockatoo.,
Give your Cockatoo a healthy diet.,
Allow your Cockatoo out of his cage every day.,
Ensure regular vet care.,

Have fun with your Cockatoo!",How to Care for a Moluccan or Umbrella Cockatoo," Unfortunately, cockatoos have gained a reputation as ""cuddly."" Though cockatoos are very loving parrots, before buying one it's important to ask yourself the following questions, and only purchase a Moluccan or Umbrella Cockatoo if all your answers are in the affirmative:


Do I have the money for cages, toys, vet care, food, and anything else my 'too might need?
Do I have the space for a cage roughly 3 x 3 x 3 (91cm x 91cm x 91cm)?
Do I have the time for a parrot that needs at least an hour of play time a day?
Do I have the patience for a parrot that will scream extremely loudly and bite?
Do I have the commitment for a parrot that will, in all probability, outlive me? (Moluccan Cockatoos, for example, can live to 65 plus years.);
, You have several options for obtaining a cockatoo. You can:


Buy a baby cockatoo from a pet store. This is extremely risky, as generally you don't know who the parents are, where he was bred, or his health history. However, certain parrot-specific stores are reliable enough to be bought from. Look at parrot websites online for people's comments on forums, etc., for advice as to where they purchased their cockatoo from. If you are in a region where cockatoos are found naturally, require written proof that the parrots were not wild-caught, as catching parrots from the wild is a cruel practice which can physically and emotionally damage a parrot.
Buy a young bird from an established private breeder. A private breeder knows the parents and will have raised, or help raise the baby. The breeder can also let you know how siblings have turned out, and you can make plans accordingly. You can make any arrangements with the breeder ahead of time, such as preferring the chick be parent raised, hand-raised, or co-parented with both humans and parrot parents.
Buy an adult from an individual. As long as the adult is being re-homed because of a situation unrelated to the Cockatoo himself (allergies, divorce, etc), this is a fine way to get a 'Too. However, require that you meet the parrot beforehand to check her behavior, and contact the vet for her health history.
Adopt an adult from a rescue center. This is a good way to go, as rescue centers will usually be able to tell you the parrot's behavior and health. However, avoid rescue centers that seem to be individual-run, or which don't give their parrots vet care, as the health of the cockatoo may have been compromised. Ask the local animal welfare organization or shelter for their advice.

, The cage should be rectangular and roughly three feet by three feet by three feet (91cm by 91cm by 91cm), with plenty of space for your cockatoo to climb and flap his wings, and a bar spacing no more than half an inch (1.27cm). Because zinc and lead are poisonous to parrots, request a written certificate that the cage does not contain these elements. Ideally the cage will be stainless steel with a strong lock, as Umbrellas and Moluccans have a penchant for escaping, and harming less powerful cages. You should include plenty of toys (but not so much as to restrict your 'Too's movement); a seed guard for keeping thrown food inside; three stainless steel bowls for pellets, vegetables and fruit, and water; and safe wooden and/or rope perches.

, Seeds are, contrary to popular belief, not a suitable diet for parrots. Around 60 percent of your Cockatoo's diet should comprise of formulated, non-dyed pellets such as the brand Roudybush. Vegetables are another necessary part of your 'Too's diet; some of the best vegetables include kale, broccoli, dandelion greens, carrots, cooked sweet potato, and squash. Fruits are healthy and tasty, but should only be fed in moderation due to their high water content; good choices include orange fruits such as papaya, mango, oranges, and cantaloupe.Healthy table foods (well-cooked meat, brown rice, tofu, cheese, non-fat yogurt, cooked egg, cooked beans, carrots, etc) are also acceptable in small amounts. Seeds are a good treat; grit, cuttlebone, and vitamin supplements are unnecessary. Food should act as mental stimulation as well as nutrition, so introduce new foods as a means of chewing, play, and curiosity fulfillment.Toxic foods include:


Chocolate
Avocado
Green parts of tomatoes
The seeds/pits of fruits from the rose family, including pears, peaches, apricots, and cherries
Caffeine and alcohol
Dried beans
Very salty foods like pretzels; and
Many other foods; always check that a food is safe for your parrot before feeding it to him!

, He should be out for at least an hour a day, though longer is always better. Try to fit him into your life - let him out to watch TV with you, or let him sit on your chair when you're on the computer. However, if you bought a baby, you'll need to train him to step up. You can do this by following these simple steps:


Place your arm next to his chest, and in a gentle but firm voice tell him ""Step up!"".
Hopefully, he'll step onto your arm, or place one foot on your arm. Don't worry if he does nothing!
When he steps up, praise him! You can also offer him a treat; however, don't do it every time or he'll come to expect it.
Eventually stepping up will become a learned behavior.

, This is nothing but mandatory. Find a vet who specializes in avian care; it's also good to have an emergency vet available in case your parrot gets in trouble after your regular vet closes. You'll need to take your Cockatoo to the vet every year for blood work to check for any diseases; and if you notice that he has runny droppings, seems tired and dejected, has changed his eating or drinking habits, or is suddenly biting or plucking when he didn't before, take him to the vet immediately.

, If you allow him to fly, he could severely injure or kill himself through flying into fans, pots of boiling water, closed windows, or other household dangers. In addition, lost parrots are often euthanized in shelters or never found or returned to their owner. And even if you clip your 'Too's wings, he might be able to fly away if you bring him outside. Never take your Cockatoo outside without a harness or carrier!

, While he is a baby, enforce rules such as no biting, inside voices, or any other rules you have by ignoring bad behavior and praising good behavior. This will help you during the teenager stage, at which point your parrot will seek a parrot to mate with (which might be you, as parrots have a loose sense of species), explore and defy boundaries, and behave in general like a human teenager. Adopted adults have something somewhat similar: When you first adopt your 'Too, you'll experience the ""honeymoon"" stage, at which point he will behave perfectly. Once this stage is over, however, you will experience typical Moluccan or Umbrella behavior.

, Common ones include:



Teflon and many other non-stick products, which can be found in ovens, irons, heaters, and many other household items. If heated, they can produce poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene (PTFE) fumes, which is fatal to parrots and other birds.
Fans - this only applies for non-clipped 'Toos.
Open toilet bowls, which your Cockatoo can drown in.
Dogs and cats: Even their saliva can be fatal for parrots, and no matter how well they seem to get along, your cockatoo should be kept separate from any other pets.
Lead and zinc, which can be found in some cages, and many household items (Lead: picture frames, paint, jewelry, etc. Zinc: white rust, padlocks, galvanized dishes, certain paints, duct tape, etc).
Some household plants, including the common Christmas plant, poinsettia.

, Moluccan and Umbrella Cockatoos are powerful enough that they can cause severe damage to a child, with the addition of any emotional trauma an attack may cause. Even the friendliest 'Too can attack if provoked.

, Common problems cockatoos have include plucking, screaming, and biting. Plucking is a neurotic behavior in which the parrot will pull feathers out, causing a great deal of pain. If it progresses far enough, plucking can go as far as self-mutilation; if this happens, your Cockatoo needs to be re-homed or taken to a sanctuary. Screaming is a natural behavior, and happens most often during the morning and evening, but if it starts to become a habit, seek the help of a professional. Biting is again natural, but if it becomes an issue, again find a professional.

, Umbrellas and Moluccans are difficult to care for, but if they're given the correct care, your 'Too can be your ""cuddly"" (if screaming) best friend!

Talk to your cockatiel.,
Take your cockatiel out of its cage regularly.,
Train your cockatiel.,
Allow your cockatiel to use its wings.",How to Entertain a Cockatiel2," A cockatiel can be entertained quite a bit by having a conversation with you. Talk to it daily in a sweet and calm voice. They can also be good mimics and often like to respond to a person who whistles or sings to them.

If your cockatiel begins talking, whistling, or singing, you should respond. It is likely trying to lure you into interacting with it.

, It is important to physically interact with your cockatiel on a regular basis. This will begin by taking it out of its cage. Many birds will willingly come out of their cage if you stick your finger into the cage and allow them to perch on it. Other birds, however, will need to be tamed and trained to do this.

To judge whether your cockatiel wants to come out of its cage, you should try to read its gestures. Sometimes your bird will be interested in interacting with you and other times it will want to be left alone.

, You can really stimulate your bird's brain and give it lots of entertainment by training it to respond to your commands. This could simply be training it to leave its cage on command, which is usually done with a step up method that trains the bird to step onto your hand. It could also be training to search out treats around a room when you have the bird out of its cage.If your bird has a hard time stepping directly onto your hand, you can train it to step onto a stick instead.

, Even if your bird's wings are clipped, it should still be able to complete short flights if it is healthy. When you have it out of its cage, let it fly around the room a little bit. This will give it some much needed exercise and will allow it to keep its wing strength up.Before you let your cockatiel fly, make sure all doors and windows are closed. Also make sure that there are no other pets in the room that could harm it, such as a cat or dog.

, Not to poop in the house and not to be aggressive towards other family members. In other words, not to be a one person bird.

, Lesser sulfur crested cockatoos need plenty of room to play, climb, and explore. So, you need to provide a cage at least 36"" long, 24""wide, by 48"" tall. It is a good idea to have multiple or extremely secure locks since these avian Einsteins will devise clever ways to escape. Space between the bars shall never exceed 3/4.

, Make sure they are made of wood to keep their beaks filed down.

Let the budgie fly in a room.,

Teach your budgie to fly to you.,
Train your budgie to balance on a tennis ball.,

Teach your budgie its name.,
Expend its vocabulary.,
Teach your budgie a song.",How to Train Your Budgie," If your budgie is new, it will need time to get used to its cage. You should let it adjust for at least a few days and make sure that the bird is in a quiet environment before attempting to train it.By this time, the budgie should start to relax and feel comfortable.


Make sure to read the Wikihow tutorial on how to take care of a budgie

Stay close to the cage. Talk to it quietly as you wait for it to adjust but do not try to handle it. It will get used to you in the course of a few days or weeks.
Avoid loud noises and screams. Your budgie is likely to be stressed by this new environment.
Name your budgie. Say it often, especially when you feed it, so that it gets used to its new name.
Read your bird a story. This might sound strange but budgies like to hear their owner's voice. Reading them a book will sooth them and make your voice familiar.;
, The budgie will slowly recognize you as the one providing food. The bird will trust you faster and will be excited when seeing you.


Water and food should be changed daily, even if the budgie hasn't touched it. A new budgie will often refuse to eat for up to a week, as it gets used to its new life.
Introduce your budgie to treats before training starts. Give it a piece of fruit or a few seeds. Your bird will love it and will be more willing to learn if it has an incentive. Don't exaggerate with treats as you want to keep your bird healthy.

, Once the bird is at ease with you, you can let it fly in a room with all of the windows and doors closed. This extra space will make your budgie happy and will keep it fit for the forthcoming training.To call it back, switch off all the lights and leave the curtain of one window open, but remember to close the window. The budgie will be attracted towards the light. Hold it gently and put it back inside the cage.
Make sure that there is no cat or predator in the room.
If you have a child, don’t let him/her frighten the bird. Budgies are easily traumatized.

, Once your budgie is settled, place your hand in the cage and keep it immobile. Repeat this for days to let your bird get used to your physical presence in the cage.When the budgie seems okay with your hand, place your finger inside the cage. Then push it slightly against your budgie’s chest. This will encourage it to climb on your finger. Be patient as the bird might be reluctant at first.
If the bird is intimidated, just stroke its breast with the back of your finger. Show love and care.
Alternatively, you can put a few seeds on your finger. Your budgie will probably climb on your hand to eat them. Doing this for a few days will teach your pet to trust you.

, When talking to your budgie, start using instructions like ""Up!"" and ""Down!"" to coincide with its hopping on and off your finger. Repetition is the key to getting him to perform an action according to your words (which are just sounds to him).


Offer a treat when your budgie does something following your instruction. This will reinforce the desired behavior.
Be persistent and consistent. You will need to focus on one instruction at a time, and for quite a while until your budgie repeats on cue. Persevere and don't vary the routine; this increases the chances that your budgie will learn faster.

, Have your finger super-close, but not too close that your bird can just step up. It needs to hop. Bring your finger half an inch further and reward your budgie with a millet each time your budgie flies to you. Practice this and bring your finger further and further each day.

You can also teach your budgie to fly to its perch. Point to the perch and say ""go back to your perch"". Reward the budgie when they go to the perch. If your bird seems clueless, set it down there and say ""perch"" and reward, but you must start when you're half an inch away.

, Once your bird knows basic directions, it’s time to make things more difficult. Introduce a tennis ball in its cage and let the bird play for a few days. Follow the following steps:


Try to put the budgie on top of the tennis ball and hold its body while the feet look for balance. Every time the budgie tries to balance itself with its feet, offer a treat.
Don’t force your bird to learn a trick for too long. 10-15 minutes per day is enough. Remember that your bird should have fun!
Leave the ball in the cage. Your budgie will eventually understand the purpose of the exercise and balance on its own on the ball.
Be gentle when you hold the budgie on the tennis ball. Remember that they are fragile birds.

, You can find plastic bird ladders in most pet shops. Fix it to the side of the cage. Your budgie will be naturally intrigued by the ladder and will want to climb it.


Every time the bird tries to climb the ladder, say the same word, like 'climb', to let your bird make the association between its action and your order.
The trick is to make your budgie climb when you order it. Be patient and gentle. Place your bird on the lowest end of the ladder and hold it. Say the word associated with climbing and release your budgie.
Once your bird understand what is expected, don’t place it on the lowest end of the ladder but a few centimeters from it. Increase the distance every day until your budgie obeys without physical contact.

, It is easier to start with the animal’s name as it hears it all the time. Repeat your budgie’s name every time you see it and when you bring food. Try to speak in a high-pitched voice and say the name slowly and clearly.Wait until the budgie is old enough. The bird should be at least three months old before it can speak.
If you have more than one budgie, stick to the teaching of one name. You don’t want to make it too hard at first.
Don’t forget to reward your budgie. If it doesn’t learn quickly, don’t punish it. It doesn’t understand right or wrong and will just mistrust you.

, Talented budgies can learn over a thousand words over their lifetime. Once your bird knows its name, target the words you want to teach. Your budgie will eventually make the connection between the words and the objects or actions.


When you enter the room, systematically say ‘hi coco ’. When you feed it, point at the seeds and say ‘food’.
Look at their corporal language and take advantage. When the bird is in a threatening posture (biting or pecking), say ‘Angry’. When the budgie is resting on one leg and looking happy, say ‘happy’.
Your budgie can also say simple sentences. When your bird eats, say ‘coco eats’. When it drinks, say ‘coco drinks’.
Don't teach your bird insults. The budgie will remember it for a long time and might embarrass you in front of your guests.

, There is nothing funnier than having your bird singing a song. Your budgie can remember simple tunes and will happily delight the whole family. The easiest way to teach a song is to sing it over and over to your bird. Don’t try to teach the whole song but just a few seconds. Pick a song you like. Remember that your budgie might sing it for a long time.
Record yourself singing a song and play it to your bird when you’re away. This is an extremely efficient way to teach a song without having to sing it a thousand times. You can do the same to teach words.
The actual recording of a song might not be the best way to teach the bird. The instruments will probably disturb it.

Notice whether your bird cuddles with you.,
Look at your bird's wings.,
Notice your bird's tail.,
Observe your bird's body posture.",How to Tell if Your Pet Budgie Likes You1," Cuddling is a clear indicator that your parakeet likes you and wants to bond with you. If your bird gently nuzzles against your hand, climbs around on your body, grooms you, and rubs against your neck, you will know that your parakeet likes you and feels safe around you., We typically think of a bird's wings as being an instrument of flight, but many birds, including parakeets, use their wings as a sort of body language. If your parakeet is flapping his wings, which may give the appearance of trying to fly in place, it is a good sign of your relationship with your bird. Wing flapping is one way parakeets display happiness around humans., Just as your parakeet's wings can be an indication of happiness, so too can his tail feathers. When a bird wags its tail (similar to a dog's tail), it usually means that your bird is happy to see you - though it can also indicate that your bird is about to relieve himself. Similarly, flipping the tail up and down is generally considered an indication of happiness, and can be taken as a sign that your bird likes you., The way your parakeet carries himself around you can tell you a lot about how he feels in your presence. Taking his body posture, along with individual pieces of body language like wing and tail fluctuations, can help you get a better picture of your bird's level of comfort around you.A bird in a relaxed, non-rigid posture is typically happy and comfortable around his human.A bird that ""bows"" his head - crouching down with his head ""pointed"" toward his human - is comfortable around that person and may be requesting a head scratching or petting.Any kind of rigid body posture, usually accompanied by ruffled feathers and a restless, side-to-side movement, typically indicates discomfort, displeasure, or a lack of trust around a human. If your bird behaves in this manner, it's best to give him space. He either has not yet gotten comfortable around you or does not like something that you are doing. Find out what you are doing wrong and avoid that trigger. "

Separate your budgies.,
Learn how to talk to your budgie.,
Say individual words to your budgie.,
Say short phrases to your budgie.,
Respond to your budgie when he tries to talk.",How to Teach Your Budgie to Talk," Budgies learn to talk by mimicking the intonations of the words they hear.Choose an area of your home, such as your living room or family room, where your budgie would be able to hear human voices.


Your kitchen is likely another hub of human conversation, but the fumes from nonstick appliances are extremely toxic to birds. Do not place your budgie’s cage in the kitchen.
Similar to wild budgies learning the language of their flock, your budgie will want to learn the language of his human flock.Exposing him to human voices will help him learn human language.;
, Developing a bond with your budgie is essential to teaching him how to talk. The more bonded your budgie is to you, the more effort he will put into learning how to talk and communicate with you.Spending quiet time in the same room (e.g., reading, watching television) as your budgie is a good way to start the bonding process. This will help him feel more comfortable around you, if he is not comfortable already.Hand taming your budgie and teaching him to step up are other good ways to bond with your budgie. In addition, a tamed budgie is more likely than an untamed budgie to learn how to talk.Spend time bonding with your budgie every day., If you have multiple budgies in a cage, they will likely prefer to interact with each other, rather than with you.If you want to teach any or all of them talk, you will need to work with them individually, away from their cage mates.


Keep in mind, though, that the more they interact with each other and make budgie sounds, the harder it will be for you to teach them to talk.
It is ideal to have only one budgie in the house if you want to teach a budgie to talk.

, When teaching your budgie to talk, it is not just about what you say, but how you say it.Importantly, you should speak to your budgie enthusiastically—the more excited you are when you speak to him, the more excited and motivated he will be to talk back to you.If possible, hold your face close to your budgie when you talk to him. Your budgie will likely stare intently at your mouth when you speak. He may even put his face up to your mouth.You will know he is in ‘learning mode’ when his pupils dilate as he focuses on your mouth. , Call out the name of different items in your home (e.g., chair, table, couch) when you talk to your budgie.You can also name other people in your home, as well as other pets.Greet your budgie with ‘hi,’ and say ‘goodbye’ to him when you leave the room.Repeating these words each time you greet or leave him will help him learn these words and with what they are associated.

, In addition to singular words, you can also teach your budgie to talk by repeating short phrases and sentences to him. For example, you can say ‘good bird’ when he steps up onto your finger.You can also ask him a question like ‘Is that fun?’ or ‘Are you having fun?’ when he is playing with his toys.Talking to him when you change out his food and water is also helpful. You could try saying ‘Here is your food’ or ‘Would you like some food?’ when you are feeding him.
The better your budgie can associate certain words (or sets of words) with specific actions, the better he will learn how to talk., When your budgie tries to say words at first, you may not be able to understand him—his may mumble his words.Regardless of whether his words are intelligible, give him verbal praise and try to repeat back whatever he ‘says’ to you.You should also respond to him if he uses his behavior to ask for something. For example, if he is making motions as if he has to go to the bathroom, say something like ‘You need to go to the bathroom,’ and then take him to his bathroom spot.Responding to him with words and actions that correspond to his body language will also help him learn to talk.

If your parakeet's cage isn't already there, move it to a busy place of the house so that it will get used to your household.,
Spend a little time each day next to your budgie's cage, letting it get used to you being near it.,
Soon your parakeet will get used to this.,
Start putting your hand in the cage and offering it millet spray.,
When your parakeet doesn't fly away from your hand as much, then take a perch from the cage.,
Start finger training if your bird is ready to.,
Leave the perch where it's at.,
Once you have successfully trained your parakeet to step up, take it out of the cage for the first time(if you haven't already).",How to Train a Parakeet to Step Up," A good place to put it is your room. Don't put it in a hallway, because it will soon get lonely. It's okay to place the cage near the kitchen, but use common sense! Don't place it next to the stove or oven. Also, make sure you can comfortably sit next to the cage.;
, Sit near the cage. The first time you try this, it may stand still and stare at you. Then, after a while, it will go back to doing what it did before. Get a book to read so you're not watching it all the time. Continue this for a few days.

, Then you can start sitting in front of the cage. Do this until your bird is used to that, too, which shouldn't take long.

, Be patient, because when you approach it with the millet, it may lean away in terror. Hold the millet there, in front of it, until it decides to eat. If not, slowly take your hand out of the cage, saying,""That's okay. Good bird."" It's okay for the bird to fly around the cage when it sees your hand. This will fade over a small period of time,about a day or 2.

, Slowly bring the perch towards it. Press it on the bird's stomach and say clearly, ""Step up,"" or ""Up,"" if you prefer. You can't change ""Step up"" to ""Up"" once your bird has learned the command. It will just get confused. When the bird steps onto the perch, praise it and feed it millet. Do this until your bird is used to the concept.Do this until your parakeet is used to this.

, If your bird is okay with stepping up, put your finger on top of the perch, covering part of it. Keep practicing ""step up"", but with the added finger. The parakeet may not step onto the finger, but onto the perch. That's okay.

, Put your finger on it like usual, but don't take the perch along when you and tell it to step up. See if the bird will step onto your finger. If not, keep trying until your budgie will.You may take your bird out slowly once your bird is used to this if you wish.

, Make sure to close all windows and doors in the room. At this stage, you can now stop pushing your budgie's legs to have it step up. Give her/him a choice. When saying ""Step up,"" let the bird decide when to step up. This makes the bird realize it has a say, and will love you more.

Practice this until they can step up onto your other index finger without you having to push on their chest.",How to Tame Your Budgies," Budgies can be nervous and skittish animals.Taming them will not be effective if they are nervous in their surroundings.


If you just purchased your budgie, give them about 2 weeks to become settled in to their new environment. One of the things that they will do during this time is locate his food and water dishes in their cage.Place the budgie in a busy room during their adjustment period, if possible. Although this may seem counter productive, having them in a busy room will actually let them get accustomed to seeing people as companions rather than threats.However, be aware that budgies have sensitive hearing, so be careful that the room is not a stressful place. Although there is plenty to see, be careful it's not a noisy room with the stereo on high, or a room where there are drafts because of people coming and going. It needs to be a pleasant environment, so as not to overwhelm the bird.;
, In order for your budgie to trust you, he will need to become comfortable being close to you. Allow about a week for him to get comfortable with this. Have the cage next to you when you are doing relaxing activities such as watching TV and reading.You do not have to directly interact with your budgie when you have his cage close to you. It’s more important for the budgie to be comfortable in your presence.

, Once the budgie is comfortable being around you, you can start working on interacting with them more often. You will still need to be very patient with them so that you don’t increase their anxiety.


Be mindful not to make eye contact with your budgie. Budgie’s eyes are located on the sides of their heads, which is common in prey animals. Because human’s eyes are positioned on the front of the head, looking directly at a budgie signals to him that you are a predator−you definitely don’t want him to see you this way!, In this way, they will be able to see your hand as non-threatening; your soothing voice will help to reduce their anxiety. Give the budgie about a week to become comfortable with your hand being outside of the cage., Open the cage door slowly when you do this so that you do not startle your budgie. Do not try to touch them or anything else in the cage. The goal is to have the budgie get comfortable with your hand being in his physical space. It may take about a week for him to become comfortable with this.You can place a towel over your hand if you are afraid that your budgie may bite you., Slowly move your hand closer to your budgie and see if they will walk to you to grab the treat. Don’t be surprised or discouraged if the budgie gets scared, freezes, or flies to another part of the cage.Practice doing this over at least 3-5 sessions. Move your hand closer to your budgie during each session. Eventually, they will become more comfortable with walking over to you and taking the treat from your hand.Having a treat in your hand each time that you reach into the cage to change your budgie’s food and water will encourage them to get more comfortable with your hand.This step may take anywhere from several days to several weeks., Use the same slow and steady movements and soothing voice that you used when building his trust. Even though your budgie should be much more comfortable with you and your hand at this point, you will need to be consistently non-threatening to them to make progress in taming them.


Slowly stick out your index finger so that it will act as a perch for your budgie to step on.Drape a towel over your hand if you think that your budgie will bite you. , Make sure that you do this slowly. Your budgie may react in the same way as when you moved your hand closer to give him a treat. If this happens, wait for the budgie to calm down, then try again.


If your budgie seems too flustered and nervous, you may want to wait until later in the day or just try again on another day., Once the budgie is comfortable with having your index finger close to him, slowly place your index finger on his chest just above his feet and gently push up.Make sure to use light pressure when you place your finger on their chest.


If you are too forceful when you place your index finger on your budgie’s chest, they may get nervous and fly away from you.
Your budgie may not understand this movement at first and may fly away. Just be patient with him and try again until he understands what you want them to do.Gently saying ‘step up’ as a verbal cue as you push on your budgie's chest may help them understand that they should step up onto your finger.If your budgie is hesitant, you can use some millet to entice them to step onto your finger., When your budgie steps onto your finger, keep your hand as still as possible.Even though budgies are used to perches, it may take some time for your budgie to get comfortable with using your hand as a perch.


Reward him with a treat as positive reinforcement for using your finger as a perch.
Practice having your budgie use your finger as a perch several times a day, rewarding them each time.

, Now that your budgie is comfortable stepping onto your hand, it is now time to practice taking them out of their cage. Use slow movements and a soothing voice to coax them out of their cage.Your budgie may be very reluctant to leave their cage, because that is their comfort zone. You can try enticing them out with treats, but do not rush them.Creating a clear exit path out of their cage (no toys, food and water trays) will help you easily back your hand out of the cage more easily.It is okay if your budgie flies away, or flies right back into their cage, when you get him out of the cage.
If your budgie flies away, do not run and chase them. Chasing your budgie will feel like a predator/prey situation to them.Wait for them to sit down somewhere and then calmly walk over to them. Reach out your finger to get it to step up onto your finger.
If your budgie flies back into their cage, let them relax for a while and then try again.
Taking your budgie out of their cage and keeping them on your finger will probably take at least 1 week of daily practice, but it may take longer. Be patient and move at the pace of their comfort with being outside of their cage.

, Once your budgie is comfortable being perched on your finger outside of their cage, take them to rooms that are unfamiliar to them. The bathroom is a common room that budgie owners will take their bird to.Whichever room you take your budgie to, it would be helpful to cover the mirrors and the windows, since they may serve as distractions. Also, make sure that the room is clean and free of dangers, such as fans or other pets.Your budgie may fly off your finger because it’s a new environment. Once again, do not chase them if they do this.
Offering your budgie a treat in the different room may help them be more comfortable in this new room.Aim to take your budgie to a different room for 15-20 minutes at a time, a few times a day., This part of the taming process involves both of your hands, so it will be easier to remove your budgie from their cage. You can choose a neutral room that he has become used to, such as the bathroom, or they can stay in the same room as their cage.

, Teaching your budgie to step up will be easier to do when you are sitting down. Sit down slowly and gently so as not to startle your budgie or cause them to fly off your finger., Use gentle pressure against their chest just as you did when you initially taught your budgie how to step onto your index finger. Push up against their chest as you say ‘step up.’Your budgie may not be familiar with this verbal cue, so it may take a few tries before they understand that they should step up onto your other index finger.
Give him a small treat each time he steps up.

, As with the other aspects of the taming process, you should practice this several times a day in short sessions (10-15 minutes). Stepping up usually comes naturally to budgies, so it probably won’t take very long for them to learn how to do this on your index fingers."

Make your budgie comfortable.,
Get closer to your budgie.,
Start putting your hand on or near the cage near the bird gently.,
Approach the budgie from inside the cage.,
Get the bird to perch on your finger.,
Bring the budgie out of the cage.,
Talk to your parakeet a lot.,
Try petting your parakeet.,
Remember to always handle your parakeet carefully.,
Feed your budgie a variety of foods, like fruits and vegetables, seeds, and pellets.A full bird is a happy bird, particularly when it isn't bored of the food you give it.,
Give your parakeet plenty of toys.,
Keep the cage clean.",How to Teach Your Parakeet to Love You," The cage is a safe space for your parakeet, but you want him or her to be in the presence of your family enough to be used to seeing and hearing people. Be sure, however, that this is a place where the bird can get rest when wanted—budgies need 10-12 hours of sleep per night.Cover the cage when your budgie sleeps—this blocks her vision and keeps drafts at bay—and be sure no loud noises will startle her where she is sleeping;
, Once the bird seems comfortable in her cage where you have put it—and especially where she will be in the presence of people on a regular basis—start getting closer to the cage each day. Move slowly when you come near the cage so as not to frighten the bird.Talk softly to the bird when you are near the cage. Avoid sudden movements.
Spend plenty of time near the cage—the more the better. She will know that you know she's there. You are essentially the bird's flock, with which he or she would spend all their time in the wild, so the more time you spend with your budgie, the better.

, If it moves away, don't move your hand; instead, keep it there and talk to the bird or read a book or something.The point is to get the bird used to your hands and your presence. Just don't scare the bird.

, Once the bird doesn't move away from your hand, it is time to do the same on the inside of the cage. Reach inside the cage and rest your hand there for a while.It is especially effective if you do this while holding a treat, such as millet. Holding a treat helps to gain the bird's trust.


Slowly, over time, move your hand closer and closer to the bird. Chances are, if you are holding a treat, the bird will begin to eat from your hand.
If you coax the bird to a place in the cage where he cannot reach the treat in your hand while on a perch or the side of the cage, he will likely be convinced to jump onto your hand to get the treat.

, After a while of feeding the bird on/from your hand, try to get the bird to perch on your finger without food by slowly approaching it with your finger and nudging it against their belly near the feet.


The parakeet may jump off your finger quickly, but keep trying—just don't overwhelm the bird. Give him or her some time between attempts and continue to move slowly. Be patient, and your bird should start getting on your finger voluntarily over time., The next phase of hand training is getting the bird to come outside the cage while perched on your hand. Because the parakeet feels safe inside the cage, he or she may jump off your hand near the exit. Keep trying, though, just like when you tried to get him or her to eat from your hand or perch on your finger. Eventually the budgie will trust you enough to come outside the cage with you.

, Every time you pass by your parakeet, stop a minute and talk to it. If you repeat the same phrases or noises (such as whistles) when you do talk to your bird, he or she may even start saying them him or herself. Parakeets can talk just like other pet birds.Talking to the bird also gets him to trust you more—which can translate to a loving budgie., Parakeets may occasionally groom one another, and, as you are part of their flock, your budgie may like it if you gently rub or stroke his or her feathers in different places.Try scratching his or her head very gently, stroking his or her back, or rubbing his or her belly.

, Budgies are small and very delicate.Take it easy when handling the bird and you will have an even more trusting pet, which can translate to a loving relationship with the bird.


Never hit or do anything rough with your bird.
Never kiss your budgie on the beak or anywhere else, because human saliva, even in small concentrations, is toxic for a budgie.

, Give your budgie seeds, pellets, fruits, and vegetables.Start out with natural pellets that contain no colorings or added sugar.
Feed seeds separately—not mixed with pellets.There are some foods to avoid, including avocados, eggplant, mushrooms, onions, and more., Parakeets will play a lot, so toys will keep them very happy, making them more loving pets. Give them shiny toys, swings, rings, bells, etc., Budgies appreciate a clean home just like people. The difference is that budgies live in close proximity to their droppings. Keeping their cage clean minimizes exposure and helps keeps your bird nice and healthy.Get the proper perches for parakeets. Perches with varying diameter like natural tree branch perches help your budgie get exercise that is in addition to you bring him or her out of the cage."
"
Watch your bird's eyes.,
Observe whether your bird hangs upside down.,
Notice your bird's beak and head movements.",How to Tell if Your Pet Budgie Likes You2," While human pupils dilate and constrict in response to light or darkness, a parakeet's pupils can change in size as a physical reaction to the bird's mood and environment. Flashing (the widening of the pupils) and pinning (the narrowing of the pupils) are controlled by the bird, and typically indicate excitement or pleasure, though these behaviors can also be an indication of fear or anxiety.If your parakeet's eyes flash and pin when he sees you, it is most likely an indication that he likes you and values your company., Hanging upside down is a common practice for birds. It is typically done when birds are happy and feel safe, as the position tends to leave the bird vulnerable. If your bird hangs upside down in your presence, it may be a sign that he likes you and trusts you., Parakeets use their beaks for a variety of purposes, from physical tasks to conveying messages. If your bird is performing any of the following activities, it is typically a sign of happiness and comfort around you.


Grinding the beak, left to right in the same way that people grind their teeth, is a sign of happiness in parakeets.Mouthing with the beak, without actually biting, is one way parakeets play with one another. If your bird is gently mouthing you with his beak, without actually trying to bite you, it is probably a sign of affection.Regurgitating in front of or ""at"" a person is a sign of tremendous affection.This is particularly true if your parakeet displays signs of eye pinning and head bobbing immediately before regurgitating."
"
Notice any talking, singing, or whistling.,
Listen for beak chattering or purring.,
Pay attention to tongue-clicking.",How to Tell if Your Pet Budgie Likes You3," These three vocalizations are a common sign that your parakeet is content and happy in your home. If your bird is very vocal, particularly when you walk into the room, it is a good sign that your bird likes you., Beak chattering and purring are not always loud; some birds make these sounds softly and silently. No matter how your bird chatters and purrs, it is typically a sign that he is content and wants to interact or play with you., One way parakeets express that they would like to be picked up or petted is by clicking the tongue against the beak. If your parakeet clicks his tongue around you, it is usually a sign that he likes you and wants you to interact with him more."
"
Make sure your bird's physical needs are met.,
Make him feel safe.,
Give your parakeet toys.,
Encourage your parakeet to trust you.",How to Tell if Your Pet Budgie Likes You4," Forgetting to feed or give water to your bird is very dangerous to the bird's health, and could over time reduce your bird's overall happiness and trust in you. Always be sure that your bird has enough clean drinking water, and be sure to feed him an appropriate diet.Make sure your bird has access to seeds, grains, beans, vegetables, nutritious pellets, and occasional fruit.Do NOT give your bird chocolate, avocado, salty foods, garlic, onion or any human snack foods., Your bird views his cage as a home within your home. Making your bird's cage as comfortable as possible will help him feel safer in your home, and may help him feel more caring toward you.Be sure your bird's cage is big enough. It should also be kept away from direct sunlight, out of reach from any other pets you may have, and away from loud or frightening sources of noise, such as televisions and radios., Parakeets love to play, and providing your bird with fun, challenging toys will make him happy and content.


Be sure your parakeet has toys that allow him to climb, as well as toys that are colorful and make noise.Give your parakeet a swing inside his cage, and make sure he has plenty of perch space inside the cage.Get your parakeet toys that are safe to chew on. Look for toys with wooden components, or solid, sturdy beads that can be bitten and chewed., You can do this by showing your bird that you are safe and friendly. Speak to your bird often, and use soothing, calm tones. You should also allow your bird to eat and play outside his cage, and encourage him to interact with you. Over time, your bird will feel safe and comfortable around you, and he will come to show you affection."
"
Disguise treats.,
Fetch the ball.,
Play catch.,
Play peek-a-boo.,
Practice flying.",How to Play With Your Parakeet1," Because parakeets are foragers and enjoy taking things apart with their beaks, your parakeet will appreciate taking things apart and finding a treat. An easy game to play with your parakeet is to wrap up a treat in paper and allow your bird to pull it apart. You can fold the paper or simply ball it up, either way your bird will enjoy finding the treat in the middle.Paper foraging games are particularly useful for training a young bird to play. Once your bird is older you may want to consider soft-wood foraging toys.;
, Find something that is small enough to fit in your parakeet’s claw and hand it to them. If it throws the object on the ground, pick it up and hand it to the bird again. Although you might find this a little repetitive, your bird is having a good time and is being better socialized.If your bird is not interested in playing fetch, do not worry. Try again another time or play a different game.
In order to encourage the bird to continue playing the game, give it a treat and an encouraging remark like “Good job!” every time that it throws the object.

, Take your parakeet out of its cage and set it on the ground. Then, roll a small ball towards it. Your parakeet may follow the ball and attempt to grab it with its beak. However, the bird will not return the ball to you, so you may have to go retrieve it from them.Use a whiffle ball or something with notches big enough for your bird to grab with its beak.
In order to encourage the bird to continue playing the game, give it a treat and a supportive remark like “Good job!” every time that it gets the ball.

, Place your parrot on your bed or floor and cover your head with a sheet or towel. Peek your head out of the sheet and call your bird’s name. Then cover it and say your bird’s name again. Your parakeet will begin following the sound of your voice and be excited every time you reappear.If your bird is comfortable with this, you can also put your bird under the sheet and play peek-a-boo that way. Just be careful not to let your parakeet stay under the sheets for too long and make sure they have enough air.

, Perch your bird on your finger and gently hold both of its feet. Carefully lift it above your head. As you raise it, the bird will begin flapping its wings. Let it flap its wings for a few moments and then bring it back down. Repeat this process as long as you want or until the bird gets tired of it.Before you play this game, make sure that any ceiling fans are off and that the space above you is open.
Parakeets and other members of the parrot family naturally flap their wings when perched to exercise their wings. This game mimics this natural exercise. If your bird’s wings are clipped and there is enough room, you might consider letting go of its feet so that it can float to the ground. If you let go of the bird, make sure any windows or doors are closed.

Talk and play to the budgie often.,
Let the budgie fly in a room.",How to Take Care of a Budgie," Birds need to have some space to play and stretch their wings. If you care about their well-being, try to find a model which lets the light go through. The cage should be at least 50 centimeter (19.7 in) D x 60 centimeter (23.6 in) H x 80 centimeter (31.5 in) W.


Try to buy a cage that is wider than it is tall and with a square top. Budgies fly horizontally, not vertically like quails. Fancy-topped cages are simply a waste of space and money.
Do not buy a circular cage, as a budgie cannot stretch its wings and fly properly in one. The bird will also feel insecure and scared, as it has no corners to hide in.
Your budgie must be able to spread its wings and fly. Do not crowd the cage with toys, perches or other budgies.
Test a few cages and look for one that you can clean easily. Can your hand enter the cage easily? Can you use a brush inside it? Remember that budgies defecate every ten to fifteen minutes!
You should buy a bigger cage if you decide to have one or more budgies.;
, Budgies might defecate a lot but they also like to stay clean. They even like to go under water for fun. Look at your favourite pet shop for a stable mini-bathtub made out of plastic that you can hook to the cage. It must be accessible for the budgie and easy to refill from the outside.


Don’t fill the bath too much. You don’t want the budgie to spill water on the bottom of the cage every time he goes in its bathtub.
The bathtub must be roughly the size of the bird so he can immerse himself in the water.
A bathtub is great for your pet budgie and they are sure to love it but make sure it doesn't take up a lot of room in the cage. Budgies will clean themselves if you spray some water onto them; it's not a must for them to have a bird bath.

, Natural perches are great, especially compared to dowel or plastic perches. They also look far better. Make sure that the perch is stable to avoid any injury.There is a great variety of toys. Look out for ladders, bells, balls, etc. They will keep your budgie stimulated.
Check that the wood is safe for the bird, such as eucalyptus. Dowel perches or plastic perches can cause foot problems due to the lack of foot exercises.
Avoid perches and toys made out of Prunus trees as they might contain cyanogenic glycosides. Also avoid oak because the wood contains tannins. There are no confirmed bird deaths, but it’s always better to be on the safe side.Try to avoid concrete perches, as they are hard on the bird's feet, but if you must use them, position them at the lowest point possible.
Don't give the budgie too much toys or perches. Two or three different toys are perfect for one budgie, but you don't want to fill the cage up with unwanted toys so that the bird feels crowded. Budgies should always have toys in their cage for 'mental stimulation', no toys can cause boredom which leads to feather plucking.

, Try to put the bird in a warm room where there is no temperature fluctuation. A light room will keep your bird stimulated and happy, and a room close to family activities will prevent your bird from becoming lonely, and will get an untamed bird used to humans.


Avoid placing the cage in front of a sunny window or next to an open door. Cold drafts and over-exposure to the sun can kill your bird.

, Good budgie food mostly consists of seeds and fresh fruits and vegetables. You can purchase budgie feed from your pet store or grocery store, this will make up most of your birds diet but you can also supplement it with other types of food like coriander leaves, greens etc., Try to introduce pellets in the diet as well as a seed-only diet can lead to obesity.


Never feed your budgie avocado, chocolate, onion, garlic, caffeine, alcohol or human junk foods. These are toxic to the bird.Make sure the budgie has enough water to drink in its dispenser. The bird will know how much to drink. Change the water daily to prevent bacterial build-up.
Add a cuttlebone. This is a good source of natural calcium for budgies. Mineral blocks can also be bought too. Some people may use liquid vitamin and mineral supplements, but those will be consumed through the fresh fruits and vegetables.

, This will keep the budgie safe from disease germs. Clean only with mild dish soap and water and avoid using any cleaning products unless you are one hundred percent sure that they are safe for birds.


Try misting your bird with a fine spray from a misting bottle to keep the bird cool.

, When it's time to sleep, simply throw a light towel or blanket over the cage. Make sure there is sufficient air ventilation - you don't want to suffocate your new bird! Make sure that the bird cannot get its nails caught in the fabric.


This is also helpful when it’s noisy. The blanket will muffle most sounds, and will also keep cold drafts out.
If your budgie is frightened by the dark, add a little night-light. Don’t let your bird panic. It might fly around the cage and injure itself., Take the budgie to the veterinary surgeon at least once a year for a check-up. If your bird acts weirdly or if you spot anything unusual, go to the veterinary surgeon as quickly as you can. Look out for abnormal breathing, discharge from the eyes or the beak, mucus on the feather, abnormal behavior and a loss of weight. If any of these symptoms occurs, call the veterinary surgeon immediately.

, Give it some time to get used to its new surroundings - about three or four days at least. Never rush your budgie. It will adapt on its own.


Stay close to the cage. Talk to it sweetly and quietly as you wait for it to adjust but do not try to handle it. It will get used to you in the course of a few days or weeks.
Keep the bird in quarantine for four weeks if you have other budgies. Once you are sure that the bird is free from disease, bring the cages closer without mixing the birds. Your new budgie will slowly familiarise with these new friends.
Avoid loud noises and screams. Your budgie is likely to be stressed by this new environment.
Name your budgie. Say it often, especially when you feed it, so that it get used to its new name.

, Your budgie might be overwhelmed if there are too many people around. Bring your family members once at a time and make them repeat its name. Let your household feed the bird to gain its trust.


Be careful if you have another pet, especially a cat or dog. Cats and dogs are natural predators and they are likely to find your budgie suitable for their next meal. Keep the cat or/and dog in another room at all times to avoid any unnecessary stress. Dogs are also likely to get excited, and may accidentally or purposefully hurt your bird. Their bark can also frighten the budgie.
Check that your children treat the bird with respect. Little children can get overexcited when they have a new pet. Always make sure to be in the room when they look at the bird. Don’t let them hit the cage or try to grab the budgie., Put your hand in the cage after a few days. Just place it there and don’t move it for some time. Repeat this for some days, to allow your budgie to get used to you.


When the budgie seems okay with your hand, place your finger inside the cage. Then push it slightly against your budgie’s chest. This will encourage it to climb on your finger. Do this for some days.
Feed your budgie from your finger. Dip your finger in water and put some millet grains on it. The water will make the millet grains to stick on your finger. Place your finger near the budgie’s mouth and it will eat them if it's grown used to you.
After doing this a few times, hold the budgie gently in your hand. Do this briefly at first, then extend the time.

, Eventually as it becomes used to its new environment, start interacting with it more and more and eventually it will know you are a friend and not a predator.


If you rush things, the budgie may start being a little anxious and afraid. This will cause it to fail to bond with you.

, Remember that the bird is fragile given the strength of a human hand and therefore requires that you handle it with care.


Always remember to teach people new to birds how to handle and properly play with this delicate little creature.
Never kiss your budgie, human saliva is toxic to budgies and they might carry easily transmittable diseases.

, Adding a mirror in the cage of your budgie can keep the bird entertained for hours. They love to look and talk at their reflection but be aware that there are debates about potential psychological damages.


Instead of a mirror, consider a second bird. Budgies love company and will probably welcome a new friend.
A mirror will most certainly with male, often also with female budgies lead to crop infections as parakeets regurgitate to feed their mates. A mirror (the feeding bird itself) will not provide the needed feedback that has to come from a real mate.
If you decide to install a mirror, make sure that it’s fixed to the cage and doesn’t present a risk to your bird.

, Your bird will love the interaction and the games and is likely to become very chatty. Move your finger in front of it–– if it is shaking its head in the same direction, it means that it loves to play and is very active.

, Once the bird is at ease with you and its environment, you can let it fly in a room with all of the windows and doors closed. To call it back, switch off all the lights and the curtain of one window open, but remember the window must be closed. The budgie will be attracted towards the light. Hold it gently and put it back inside the cage.


Make sure that the bird is safe. Put the cat or dog away and look out for potential escape routes.
Think about your own hygiene. Your budgie is likely to defecate on the floor. Don’t let it fly in a carpeted room. If there is feces on a solid surface, you can wet a paper towel and wipe it away.

Get your parakeet to go up a ladder.,
Have your bird go down a slide.,
Teach it to go through a hoop.,
Hold short training sessions.,
Give them cues.,
Reward your bird.,
Speak in a positive tone.",How to Play With Your Parakeet2," A simple trick that you can train your parakeet to perform is climbing a ladder. Because they are natural climbers, your parakeet will instinctively want to climb a ladder. However, you can train it to associate this activity with a verbal cue and a treat so that the bird will climb on command. Place the bird at the end of a ladder, say the cue, and reward it with a treat when it does what you command.Examples of a verbal cue might be “up the ladder” or “climb the ladder.”
You can buy a ladder for your parakeet at most pet stores.

, Place a slide at the other end of your parakeet’s ladder. Initially, give it praise and a treat once it reaches the top of the ladder and touches the slide. Then, place a treat at the bottom of the slide. Eventually, your bird will slide down and get the snack.It is easier if you break tricks down and teach them in steps. Train your bird how to climb the ladder before instructing it on how to go down a slide.
You may have to make your own slide out of PVC pipe since commercially available parakeet slides are hard to come by.

, Create a small hoop for your parakeet out of cardboard or other light material. Lead your parakeet through the hoop with a treat and assign a cue every time it goes through. Eventually, you may want to insert increasingly longer pieces of tubing for the hoop.A paper towel or toilet paper tube should be about the right size for a parakeet.

, When you begin teaching your parakeet tricks, you will want to limit the length of you training sessions. Pushing your bird too hard will cause it to lose interest and may make it ill. Stop training your bird if it looks tired or loses interest.The time spent training your bird could last anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour.
Try having training sessions a couple of times a day.

, Parakeets are particularly adept at responding to verbal cues from humans, but they can also recognize physical gestures. When training your parakeet, pick a cue and stick with it. Consistency and repetition are essential. Once the bird has associated the cue with the activity, they will respond on command.A physical cue can be a snap of the fingers of a wave of the hand.
A verbal cue can be a short phrase like “up the ladder” or “down the slide.” It can also as simple as a word like “up” or “down.”

, Whenever your bird does what you want it to do, give it a treat. This positive reinforcement will ensure that it associates your cue, and the action is has performed, with the treat it receives at the end. You can also reward the bird at the end of a session with a treat in its bowl that it does not regularly eat.Consider a hulled sunflower seed or a piece of millet spray as a quick treat.

, Parakeets are perceptive birds and will respond to your attitude. If you stay positive and enthusiastic, the bird will focus and stay on task. If you become frustrated and agitated, the bird will likely be distracted and lose interest in the training. To avoid this, stay positive and make the activities fun.Maintaining a positive tone is essential to keeping training fun and light.

Place a mirror in their cage.",How to Play With Your Parakeet3," Before you buy your parakeet toys, test out the ways in which it likes to play. Make paper foraging toys or weave pieces of paper through its cage. Give it small objects from around the house like bottle caps or little balls and see how it reacts to them. This will help you determine what kinds of toys to invest in.You may also find that your bird enjoys the simple toys just as much as ones you bought at a pet store.
Make sure that you give your bird safe things to play with. Avoid anything treated with harsh chemicals or solvents.

, Make sure that the toys you are giving your bird are appropriate for their size. Parakeets can get stuck and die in toys intended for larger birds. You should also avoid any toys with sharp edges that could poke your bird or lose strings that could strangle them.If you are in doubt about the safety of a toy, talk to a clerk at your pet store or email the toy retailer.

, Because parakeets can see the full spectrum of colors, they are particularly attracted to colorful objects. When considering toys, you should buy things that have vibrant coloring. Bright primary colors, like yellow, red, and blue, are great choices. Although you can give your bird toys that are drably colored, they may not play with them as much.Be sure to choose toys that are colored with non-toxic materials., Parakeets are social birds by nature and make a lot of noises. Because of this, they also enjoy toys that make a lot of sound. Toys with bells attached to them are particularly popular with parakeets. You can also hang a few small bells in your birds cage.Avoid buying the Christmas style “jingle bell” with openings. Your parakeet may get stuck in the holes. Instead, buy an open-bottomed bell., Parakeets are particularly fond of toys that mimic foraging activities. Because parakeets have smaller beaks, you will want to invest in foraging toys that are made of soft-woods or cardboard. Wooden toys are a particularly good choice because they are also safe for your bird to chew on.Avoid plastic toys if you can. These can contain harmful toxins.

, If you own a single parakeet, you might want to consider installing a mirror in its cage. Parakeets are social and like having other birds like them around. If you install a mirror, your bird will chirp at and interact with the mirror as if it is another parakeet.You may have to clean the mirror occasionally.

If you have two, you need at least a 28-inch-by-24-inch-by-36-inch cage.Overcrowding can lead to certain diseases spreading more quickly, such as clostridial diseases., Choose a room that has some airflow. If the room is too stuffy, it can also increase the chances of spreading certain bacterial diseases, such as clostridial diseases., Some infections can be vaccinated against. The polyomavirus, for instance, can be vaccinated against in two shots. For adult birds, it needs to be two to four weeks apart the first time and should be renewed yearly.Note that vaccinations for birds are not always routine, and your veterinarian may not have it readily available. Discuss the need for vaccinations with your veterinarian before your appointment so they can obtain any vaccines they think your bird needs.


Talk to your vet about what other vaccines your parakeet will need.

, You need to visit the vet when you first get a new bird, but it's also important to provide yearly checkups for your parakeet. Checkups help to make sure your parakeet hasn't developed a new condition., At the bottom of the cage, create a lining of newspaper. The newspaper catches the bird's droppings and helps soak up any water or spills., To prevent the growth of bacteria, remove the newspaper every day. Discard the old newspaper in the trash. Make sure the cage does not have any feces in the bottom. Add a new liner of newspaper in its place.Make sure to wear disposable gloves when cleaning out the cage, and don't touch areas in your kitchen. Birds can pass on bacteria to humans., Water bowls and other open water dishes encourage contamination more easily than a water bottle. Food can drop in, growing bacteria. Feces can also fall in, leading to the same problem. A water bottle discourages this type of contamination.Contaminated water can lead to bacterial infections in your parakeet.

, It's important to provide fresh food and water every day. Doing so prevents bacteria from growing in the water or food. It's also important to make sure you wash out the dishes, also to prevent the growth of bacteria.When washing out the food dish and water bottle, don't do it in the kitchen sink. You can contaminate other areas when disinfecting these items. It's best to clean them out outside,but you can also use the bathtub.

, You need to disinfect the cage regularly, about once a week. You can use diluted bleach to disinfect the cage, as well as cleaners made specifically for the purpose. You'll will need to move your bird somewhere else while you are disinfecting the cage. Move the cage outside, placing something underneath it when it's clean so you don't recontaminate it. Cleaning the cage helps prevent the buildup of bacteria, which can lead to infections.Wearing disposable gloves, clean the whole cage, including the perches. Start by using dish soap (have a bottle just for cleaning out the cage), and water to wash out the cage. Next, spray it down with disinfectant. Rinse it really well to get rid of any residue. Use paper towels to dry it off.It's always important to wash your hands thoroughly after messing with your bird's cage, even when you're wearing gloves.

, When you get a new parakeet, isolate it from your other birds for a period of time. Isolating the bird keeps it from introducing diseases to your other birds.Keep a new bird in a separate cage and separate room for about four weeks, watching to see if any diseases develop. Ideally, the bird would be kept at another location or in a room that has a separate ventilation, as diseases can be spread through the air conditioner, as well.The best way to tell if a bird has a disease is to visit a vet within a week of getting the bird. The vet can screen for certain diseases and give you an idea of what treatment the bird will need if it does have a disease or tell you if you need to return it to where your bought it. She can also give you an idea of how long you will need to continue the quarantine., When you have a new bird, make sure to clean its cage last, so that you don't spread its germs to your other birds. Clean out the cage daily, of course, but also make sure to disinfect the whole cage more often when you have new birds., Feed the new bird last, so you don't bring its germs over to your other birds. In addition, make sure you don't switch out the new bird's dishes with the other birds' dishes.Always wash your hands or change gloves between cages.

, If your bird escapes, you of course want to try to find it. If you do find it, you will need to follow the same quarantine procedures for the returned bird, as it could have picked up a disease while outside., If parakeets come into contact with wild animals or insects, the parakeet can contract an infection. One way to prevent this problem is to keep your parakeet inside. Also, don't allow strays in your house that could pass on diseases.In addition, take measures to keep any insects away from the cage if possible. If you have an infestation in the house, consider calling an exterminator to help deal with the problem.
Mosquitoes are one carrier for diseases. Try to make sure you don't have any standing water outside your home, as that can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes., Other pets can also pass on diseases to your pets. Reptiles, in particular, can be carriers of Salmonella. Don't keep parakeets near reptiles. In addition, if you let your parakeet out, close off the room where you keep the reptiles, so the parakeets can't land on their cages."

Decorate the bottom of the box.",How to Make a Nesting Box for Parakeets," The nest has to be made of wood. Parakeets like to chew and they will shred up a cardboard box quickly. Go to the hardware store and pick up some wood paneling to build your cage.Panels of plywood board will work best.
You'll want wood that is at least 1.5 to 2 cm (.6 to .8 inches) thick, though it can be thicker as well.
You'll need to cut the wood into 4 panels of 12"" x 14"" (30.5cm x 35.5cm), and 2 panels of 14"" x 14"" (35.5cm x 35.5cm). In total, that's about 90 square feet, so make sure you get at least that much wood to ensure you have enough.;
, You'll need a few tools to make the box, so pick them up at the hardware store if you don't already own them.A circular saw. If you don't get the wood pre-cut into the proper size at the hardware store, you'll have to cut it yourself. The best way to get a straight, clean cut is with a circular saw.
A rotary cutting tool. This works much like a power saw, but has a long and slender blade used to cut holes. You'll need this to cut a round entrance for the nest.
A power drill. You'll have to drill a few holes to assemble the box, so a power drill is the best option here.
A hammer. You'll have to nail the box together, so a hammer is a necessity. Remember nails as well.
A ruler or tape measure. You'll need this to properly measure the wood you're cutting.

, You should never operate power tools without proper protection. To ensure your safety, there is some safety equipment you should get before starting the project.


Eye protection. Goggles or safety glasses are a necessity when using a power saw or drill. Debris can fly into your eyes and cause pain and damage.
Ear protection. Power tools are loud, and prolonged exposure to the sound can damage your hearing. Ear plugs or specialized earmuffs will prevent any hearing problems.
Gloves. When handling wood, you could cut yourself or get a splinter. Prevent any avoidable injuries by wearing a thick pair of work gloves.
A dust mask. Sawdust will fly around when you're sawing and drilling, which could get into your lungs and cause irritation. Wear a dust mask to protect your lungs.

, You can either get the wood pre-cut at the hardware store, or you could cut it yourself. If you cut it yourself, you'll need 4 panels measuring 14"" x 12"" (35.5cm x 30.5cm) for the sides of the nest. Then you'll need 2 panels measuring 14"" x 14"" (35.5cm x 35.5cm) for the top and bottom.Be sure to measure carefully before cutting. Use a carpentry pencil to mark the wood to keep your cuts accurate and straight. If you mess up, you might have to make another trip to the hardware store for more wood, which will cost more time and money.

, This will serve as the entrance for the box. Using the rotary tool, cut a circle that is 3 inches in circumference in any one of the side panels. Locate it close to the floor of the cage so the bird can walk right in.Remember, the formula for circumference is pi (3.14) x the circle's diameter. So to get a circumference of 3, you'll need a diameter of .95 inches -- round up to 1 inch.

, It will be much more convenient if you make a box with a removable top. That way you'll be able to clean it easily. To do that, hold off putting the top on the box for now.First nail all of the side pieces together. Place one nail in the bottom corner and one in the top corner of each side.
Then nail the bottom on by putting a nail in each of the 4 corners.
Be sure to keep the nails straight as you hammer them in, or they'll go off center and pierce the inside of the box. If this happens, pry the nail out and try again.

, Give your parakeet a perch so it can land and step inside the box. Cut a piece of wood a few inches square and use wood glue to secure it just under the hole you cut., A simple way to make the top of the box removable is by using wire to secure it down. You'll just have to drill a few holes.


First drill two holes on both the left and right sides of the box. Then drill corresponding holes in the top portion.
Place the top on the box and run wire through to the holes.
Tie the wire to secure it to the box. Now, you can simply untie the wire and take the top of the box off when you want to.

, Birds often place natural materials in their nests for comfort and security. You can imitate this by placing feathers, straw, or wood shavings in the box."

Let him out to for a flying session at the same time every day.",How to Play With Your Budgie," Budgies are very active birds and they enjoy having lots of toys to play with. However, be careful not to crowd your budgie’s cage with toys so he has lots of room to move around and hang out, as budgies consider their cage their home.Look for toys that are made of materials that your budgie can chew, like rope, and all natural materials. Chewing helps your budgie keep his beak nicely trimmed and strong and it also provides stimulation for him when he is hanging out in his cage. Birdie bagels are great as they can be slipped onto your budgie’s perch or hung up for chewing. You can also use lightweight toys or a small, squishy ball. Toys made of natural materials like wood, paper and plant materials are also good for your budgie, as they will mimic the types of things he might play with in the wild.;
, Your budgie is prone to climbing and hanging off of objects. He will also likely enjoy ringing bells, scratching his head against objects, and chewing objects. Head to your local pet store and look for climbing stands and a play gym made for budgies. Look for a colorful gym made of wood with dowels, and ensure there are no toxic materials in the gym. There are also hanging jungle gyms that have two to three levels of perches, ropes, and swings.There are also safe climbing nets made for budgies that you can install underneath the play gym. Your budgie may also enjoy climbing up, down, and through the net as another kind of toy.

, Most budgies enjoy swinging and hanging out on a play swing. You can find play swings for budgies at your local pet store or make your own swing with two dowels and a piece of rope. Install the play swing in your budgie’s cage so he can move around safely on the swing unsupervised.Some swings have bells, which are a real treat for budgies as they love to ring bells. There are also swings made of rubber like material, which are soft on your budgie’s feet and fun to bite and chew on.

, If you are going to let your budgie fly around the room or play on a swing or gym outside of his cage, you should always prepare the room first. You should also never let your budgie out of his cage unsupervised, as he can get injured or end up chewing on something that might make him ill or harm him. Before you let your budgie out of his cage:Cover all the windows and mirrors in the room with sheets or towels. This will prevent your budgie from flying into them.
Close all the doors and windows in the room. Let everyone in the home know the budgie is being let out of his cage and they should not open any doors or windows.
Remove any other animals, such as dogs and cats, from the room.
Move any poisonous plants into another room.
Switch off all ceiling fans and regular fans to prevent your budgie from getting injured. Ensure there are no hot surfaces, such as on a heater or a stove.
Remove or cover any containers with water or liquid, such as fish bowls or aquariums.
Unplug electrical cords and hide them so your budgie cannot chew on them.

, Playing with your budgie is a great way to bond with him and train him to respond to your direction. Maintain a consistent routine of play sessions, lasting no more than 15 minutes, several times a day. This will keep your budgie entertained and active, without tiring him out with long play sessions too often throughout the day., During your play sessions, it’s important that you vary the toys you use. Try to change up your budgie’s toys every two weeks, using toys with different functions, colors, and textures. Rather than splurge on new toys every two weeks, you can change the location of the toys in his cage.If possible, you should try to move his cage to different areas of your home so he is exposed to different noises and activity around him. This will keep him interested in his surroundings and prevent him from getting bored.

, Budgies love interactive games, and you should try to be as involved as possible with your budgie’s play time. One simple way to do this is to play a game with a small mirror. You can play this game in your budgie’s cage or outside of your budgie’s cage.Hold the mirror a few inches in front of your budgie. He will then likely run towards his reflection.
When he moves closer to the mirror, move it in a different direction so your budgie chases it.
Do this several times, letting your budgie chase the mirror each time.
Reward him at the end of the game with a small treat.

, Play this game in an unfamiliar area of your home or an unfamiliar room, like a basement or a bedroom.Place your bird on the floor at one end of the room and then step back. Tell your budgie, “Find me!” Move several more yards away from your budgie and peek around corners or behind furniture so your bird can see you. Hide a far enough distance away so your bird will have to do a fair amount of walking to find you.
If your budgie does not seem to be able to find you, call out his name to give him a clue. If your budgie is very bonded to you, he will seek you out to avoid being left alone in an unfamiliar place. When your budgie finds you, tell him “Good job!” and give him a treat.

, You will need to play this game with two people on carpeted stairs. One person should stand at the top of the stairs with the budgie and the other person should stand at the bottom of the stairs. The person at the top of the stairs should place the budgie on the top stair and encourage the bird to move downward. The person at the bottom of the stairs should call the budgie’s name and say, “Climb down!”Your budgie should start to climb down the stairs, flapping his wings as he hops down. Once he reaches the bottom, tell your budgie “Good job!” and give him a treat.

, This is a more advanced game that you can play with your budgie if you are going for a very active play session.


Use a small, soft ball or a lightweight toy and throw it at your budgie as you say “Catch it!” Your bird may then pick up the object with his beak. Reward this action with “Good bird!” and a treat.
You can then try to teach your bird to bring the object back to you once he catches it. Command him to “come” when he has the object in his mouth and motion towards you. Once he comes back to you, reward him with a “Good job!” and give him a treat.

, You can interact and play with your budgie during his daily flying session. Let him play on his play gym or his play swing. Use a toy to play fetch or to get him to interact with you. Make the flying sessions the same time every day so your budgie gets into a routine. Over time, he should fly back into his cage at the end of the session on his own."

Search for parakeet pellets at your local pet store.,
Provide clean water and remove old food daily.,
Provide playtime for your parakeet.,
Spray your bird.,
Give your parakeet toys.,
Institute a bedtime routine.,
Say goodnight to your parakeet to help it feel relaxed.

,
Turn off the light, say goodnight again, and slowly walk out of the room.",How to Own a Parakeet," Birds enjoy many fruits and vegetables. Try to introduce a variety of suitable food as early on as possible.


Pellets should be offered at all times, with bird seed only making up 1/6th or less of the diet. You should provide fresh veggies everyday for variety. Without veggies, your parakeet will not be as healthy and will likely become bored of eating the same thing. You should try to feed them produce like kale, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, strawberries, carrots, and apples. Plain, cooked eggs are healthy and enjoyed by many parakeets. You may have to wait awhile for your bird to begin eating veggies, but be patient!
Remember to never feed your parakeet avocados or chocolate! Also, most fruit seeds are poisonous to budgies, so throw away the area of the fruit that touches the seed and the seed itself. Research what foods your budgie can or cannot have.;
, You should have two bowls in the cage: one for food and one for water. Fill the water bowl with fresh water every day. Change the food out every other day.

, You should spend quality one-on-one time with your bird for at least an hour each day (not all at one time). The rest of the time your parakeet can watch you do chores from your shoulder or sit on top it's cage while you are nearby. To get your parakeet out of his/her cage reach into the cage and put your finger right in front of your bird's abdomen, pushing your finger closer to the chest and lifting up. Soon your bird should be on your finger, then move your finger out of the cage and let your parakeet fly around.

, Birds need to be either sprayed by a water bottle or allowed to play in a shower or sink to have healthy feathers. Note that some birds don't like being sprayed. Your bird may also decide to take a bath in its water bowl. This is fine, just make sure that it's water stays clean. Regardless of what method your bird likes, most all find pleasure in bathing.

, Toys should be offered at all times. Parakeets love mirrors, but they're not always a good idea. Sometimes parakeets get too attached to the 'other' parakeet in the mirror. Parakeets usually like bells (no jingle bells, they can get their claws stuck) or other noisy toys. Toys made of ripped up paper strips tied together are good too. Of course, you can always go to the store and buy parakeet toys. To keep your bird from getting bored of their toys, you should rotate them.

, Cover the cage with a thin blanket or towel.

,, Try not to make any noise -- it may disturb your bird! Also, keep in mind that your bird may not want to stay up as late as you. It's a good rule of thumb to only allow an hour past what time the bird's outside go to bed.

Offer your index finger and say ""step up."",
Lure your bird with treats as needed.,
Teach your bird the ""step down"" command.,
Train your bird to ""ladder"" between fingers.,
Use proven training techniques.",How to Perch Train Your Parakeet," If your bird has never used a dowel before, you may need to introduce your bird to the dowel before it will climb on. The dowel will become an important training tool, so make sure your bird gets comfortable with being on and around dowels as soon as possible.Most parakeets need a dowel between 0.5 to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.5 centimeters) in diameter. Your parakeet should be able to wrap about 2/3 of its toes around each perch without overlapping.Hold the dowel gently up to the parakeet's belly. Keep a steady hand so the dowel doesn't wobble.You should aim to place it just above the bird's legs.
If you're just starting out your training, it will be easiest to keep your bird in its cage while you practice sitting on a perch. Once your parakeet progresses you'll be able to move training to outside the cage.;
, ""Step up"" will be an important command in every stage of perch training. It's important that your parakeet gets used to this command early on in the training process.Say the command every time you practice perch training with your parakeet. Remember that consistency is key in any type of training.

, Depending on your bird's temperament, you may need to lure it with treats onto the desired perch. Make sure you praise your parakeet and reward it with treats every time the bird obeys your command.Hold the treats just out of reach to lure your parakeet up onto the dowel/perch.
Millet makes a good treat for parakeet training.Whatever treat you use for training, make sure it's reserved just for training. You want the treat to be something special that the bird will only get when it cooperates during your sessions., Once your parakeet is comfortable climbing onto a perch inside its cage, you can advance to training outside the cage. Remember though that you should never attempt to train a bird outdoors. Training outside the cage simply means training in a safe room inside your home.Make sure the room you choose does not have any open windows or doors. The curtains should be closed over any windows and the room should be free of pets.
Follow the same training steps you used to perch train inside the bird's cage. You may need to use more treats to lure your bird if the room has other distractions.

, Before you attempt to teach your parakeet how to perch on your finger, it's important that the bird understands the ""step up"" command. If your bird is not yet comfortable stepping onto a dowel, it may not be comfortable stepping onto your hand., Before you can get your bird to perch on your finger, you'll want to have it step up onto the dowel. This reinforces to the bird that you're continuing your training, and your bird will realize that more treats can be had if it cooperates.Hold the dowel in front of your parakeet and give the ""step up"" command as you did during regular perch training.

, Once your parakeet is on the dowel, you'll want to offer your finger to the bird. Be patient, as your bird may be anxious or uncertain about what you want it to do.Extend your index finger in front of where your bird is perched on the dowel. Say ""step up"" while offering your finger.
Inch your finger closer to your bird's feet every time you practice finger perching.
Keep your hand steady. Your bird will be reluctant to climb onto a hand that's unstable or wobbly., Treats will help motivate your bird during any type of training, and finger perching is no exception. Continue to offer your parakeet millet or any other special treat that you've had success with during training.Remember that your bird may be scared of perching on your finger if dowel training is still relatively new to it.
Be patient and try speaking in a soft, calming voice while you practice training your bird to help put it at ease.

, A good companion to the ""step up"" command is its counterpart, the ""step down"" command. Step down is useful when you want to move the object your parakeet is perched on, which can be particularly important if it is perched on your finger.While the bird is perched on your finger or a dowel, offer the object you want it to move to.
Hold the object just above and in front of whatever your bird is perched on.
Give the command, ""step down."" You're still trying to get the bird to climb upwards, but the command ""step down"" communicates to the bird that you want it to get off of you or the dowel.
Use treats to lure your bird onto the replacement object until it gets comfortable following your command without a reward.

, Laddering is essentially a repeated ""step up"" command that urges your bird to switch from one hand to the other in succession. You'll need to practice this command on a daily basis, at least until your bird gets comfortable with the repeated action.While your bird is perched on one finger, hold the index finger of your other hand up in front and slightly higher than where your bird is perched.
Give the ""step up"" command to get your bird up onto the other finger.
Once the bird is on your other finger, repeat the process to get your bird to climb back onto the finger it was initially perched on from your other hand.
Try to get your bird to move from one hand to the other as comfortably (and later as rapidly) as possible.

, As you begin to advance your parakeet's training, it's important to use training techniques that have been proven effective by trainers. While some birds are easier to train than others, you should be able to make progress with any parakeet if you stick to a schedule and ensure your bird is comfortable and happy.Stick to short sessions. Aim for 10-minute sessions held two or three times each day to ensure your bird remains focused and attentive.
Try to stick to a regular schedule with your training sessions. Aim to train your bird at the same time every day.
Leave props and perches in or near your bird's cage for a few days before training begins. That way it will be used to these objects and may even have an interest in using them independently.

Help your bird back into the cage.",How to Keep a Parakeet Safe Out of Its Cage," Moving is stressful for parakeets, so avoid taking the bird out of their cage as much as possible in the first week or so that you bring it home. Taking it out too soon could cause them to get nervous and fly into things that could hurt them., You may ultimately opt to keep your parakeet fully flighted, but before your bird is hand-trained, it can be helpful to keep their wings clipped. This will keep them from flying away and hurting themselves while you teach them good out-of-cage behavior.Ask your seller if your parakeet’s flight feathers have already been clipped. If not, visit an avian vet. Even if you want to learn to clip the feathers at home, a vet should show you how it's done and walk you through the process the first time.

, Hand training starts with you gently introducing your hand into the cage. When your parakeet is used to your hand, you can gently nudge them from their perch onto your finger. With practice and praise, you will eventually be able to train your parakeet to come to your finger using hand signals and vocal commands.It helps to keep treats nearby when you are hand training so that your parakeet learns to associate you with a positive experience.
Hand training takes time, especially when you introduce verbal cues such as “up” and “return.” Be patient with your parakeet.

, Before you let your parakeet out to play, go through the house and make sure you have closed all windows, doors, and any other access points through which your bird could escape. Even birds with clipped wings can glide long enough to get away, so make sure all openings that lead outside are closed off before letting them out.Do not rely on window or door screens to contain your bird. These are often easily torn and could injure your pet. Fully close all doors and windows.
You may want to cover mirrors and windows, as well, as parakeets can mistakenly fly into them. Close curtains or blinds and use a sheet to cover mirrors.

, Take a look around the area where you plan on letting your parakeet fly. Turn off any fans, lights that you know can run hot, appliances such as stove tops, ovens, and laundry machines, or anything else that could hurt your bird while it flies or once it lands.Open pots on hot stoves, open food, and open flames are all dangerous to your parakeet. Secure these before you let your bird out.

, Even well-meaning playful attention from your dog or cat could cause accidental injury for your parakeet, so it is important to secure any other pets you have before letting your parakeet out. You may decide to crate larger pets, or limit their access to your parakeet by keeping the bird play space in room with a closed door.Make sure small pets such as fish and hamsters are also secure from your parakeet, as a curious bird could hurt itself by trying to make friends with other small pets.

, Look over the area before letting your parakeet out to make sure there are no materials such as electrical cords or toxic plants that could harm your parakeet if they were to chew on them. Move plants to another area, and either unplug and remove cords, or else permanently cover them with a hard case.Common household plants that are toxic to parakeets include certain ferns, jasmine, many types of lilies, many types of grasses, oak, poinsettia, poppies, tulips, honeysuckle, cacti, clovers, and rhododendron., Play stations with different sized perches, toys, slides, swings, and ladders are readily available from most pet stores, and help keep your bird active in a safe, area where you can watch them. Set up a play station in an area where your bird will not get droppings in their food or water, and where they have space to fly around to all the different parts and toys.Depending upon the size and shape of your cage, you may be able to set up the play area on top so that bird droppings can safely fall down to the paper liner below.
Remember to provide food and water for your bird while it is out of the cage, as well.

, Your parakeet should be let out for fly time for at least an hour or so every day. They will need your full attention during that time. Schedule time every day for you to watch your parakeet while it plays. Avoid distractions like cooking, household chores, or staying on your computer or phone.Many owners find it helpful to avoid cleaning the cage during fly time. While it is a time saver to do them both at once, cage cleaning often involves going in and out of different areas and requires attention you may want to give your bird.

, Some parakeets will return to their cage between flights, but others may need your help finding their way back. If possible, get your parakeet to your finger and help them find their cage. If your parakeet refuses to return, move slow and dim the lights. Parakeets don’t like flying in dim lighting, so you can gently catch them and help them return.Do not chase after or aggressively catch your parakeet. This could spook them or cause them injury. Your best option is to try to get them on your finger, or to rest enough that you can gently grab them with two hands.
Do not dim the lights so low that you cannot see your parakeet. Making the room too dark too quickly could cause the bird to run into walls or obstructions, which may cause them to hurt themselves.

Find the budgie's cere.,
Identify a male budgie.,
Identify a female budgie.,
Consider the age of your budgie.,
Understand the challenges of using color to identify the sex.",How to Identify Your Budgie's Sex1," The cere is a fleshy covering which is located directly above its beak.The budgie's nostrils are found on the cere (they look like two in-depth holes) making the cere easy to find. While most budgie's beaks are a yellowish color, the cere is a certain color depending on the bird's sex.;
, Most male budgies in the breeding mood have a bright or royal blue cere. Sometimes, the vibrant color can appear purple-blue.This color will lighten when the budgie is not in the breeding mood.If you've identified your budgie as male and notice his cere turn brown, he may have a medical condition., A female adult budgie's cere is usually a white or pale blue. As she becomes more fertile and ready to produce eggs, the cere will become a darker tan or brownish in color.If the budgie is fertile and ready to breed, you may also notice the cere thicken and become crusty.The cere build up can be about a centimeter thick., If your budgie is less than 4 months old, it will have immature colors respective to their sex.Before this time, the colored area that shows sex will be pink or purple on a male and white or pale blue on a female. If your budgie hasn't had its first molt, has dark button eyes, and has bars coming from its head to cere, then it's less than four months old.If your budgie is immature or less than 4 months old, the cere on males will slowly turn deep blue and females will keep white or pale blue before showing tan., In addition to changes in color based on breeding mood, a budgie's cere may change for a number of other reasons. Female budgies may have hormonal imbalances that display a light blue cere for a long time or their environment may not be suitable for breeding. Some budgies have genetic mutations that show color differently in males. Recessive pieds and INO (albino, lutino and yellow face albino) variety males will have a pink cere as well as a few other mutations. For example, male albino budgies will have a pink cere color.

Gather your hair from the hairbrush.,
Grab one pipe cleaner.

,
Use the end of the pipe cleaner to make a hole through the bottom of the hair clump.

,
After sliding the pipe cleaner through the hole fold, leave about 1 inch (2.5cm) poking through one side.,
Done.",How to Make Fun and Safe Parakeet Toys1," It is recommended that you take a thick layer.;
,,, Fold up that side and wrap it around the bottom and over itself again.  

, You now have a preening toy for your parakeet that you can hang from the top of its cage.

"
"
Listen to your budgie.,
Watch your budgie's behavior.,
Ask someone knowledgeable.",How to Identify Your Budgie's Sex2," Males are known for being much noisier than female budgies. They will chirp or sing and the songs can be quite long. While female budgies make sounds too, they usually sound angry and less musical. However females can be just as cheerful just as males may be grouchy. Males are also quick learners when it comes to speaking though a female can learn to talk as well.

, Male budgies frequently bob their heads up and down or tap their beaks against their cage. They'll appear playful and outgoing. Female budgies may seem more aggressive if they're in the mood to breed, subdued, or if they're fertile.You may notice a male budgie tap against a female and regurgitate food to her. Don't worry. This is normal bonding behavior and will occur between same sex pairs, too.

, When you buy your budgie from the breeder or dealer, ask the budgie's sex, though be aware not all breeders are informed, especially if colony breeding. You can also purchase inexpensive DNA kits that also reveal the budgie's sex.


Don't forget that you can ask your veterinarian to determine the sex of the budgie. This will be easier if the vet is familiar with treating birds.

After the one extra ball is on, do not knot it again.,
Cut way an excess length of the pipe cleaner.

,
Poke some spray millet through some of the holes in some of the balls.",How to Make Fun and Safe Parakeet Toys2," (Look in Tips below for more info on this.) You'll also need two to three long pipe cleaners, spray millet, and a small bell.

,,,, Repeat steps 3-4 until you have run out of room to put on another ball.

, However, slide the other pipe cleaner through before you tighten the knot, then knot it just one more time, to keep both pipe cleaners firmly in place together.

,, Instead, grab the small bell. Attach the small bell to the string of balls. Knot it on, tying until you are absolutely certain that the bell won't come off.

,, This is for your budgie to eat.

Make another big knot right after the seventh popsicle stick.

,
Go up the string/braided string 1 1/2 inches (3cm), then tie another large knot.

,
Grab two pipe cleaners and twist them together.,
With the pipe cleaners, tie the length to the cage so that your parakeet can use it.,
Finished.

",How to Make Fun and Safe Parakeet Toys3,",, Make the knot big enough that the beads can't slide off.

, This is fun for the bird to chew on and play with.

, Make the hole large enough for the strings to pull through, yet make it a snug fit.

,,,,,, Twist the pipe cleaners around the big knot and keep twisting until you are satisfied it will hold it together. Alternatively, while you were tying the big knot, you could have inserted these at that time.

, Shape the popsicle ""branches"" so they form a spiraling ""ladder"".

Remove the nest box.,
Name your baby birds.",How to Breed Budgies," Breeding budgies takes time and isn’t easy. You need to cash out on supplies and feed, check on the budgies often, clean the cage daily and set aside extra time for caring for the chicks.;
, The room should be quiet, protected from predators including pets, have no disturbances and the only person entering the room should be you.

, Choose one that is approximately two feet wide. The cage should be wider than it is tall (budgies fly horizontally), square-topped and have at least three doors: one for the food dish, one for the water dish and one for you to easily access the cage. You might need to cut a small hole in the cage for the nest box (see below for a nest box).


Add bedding to the box. Suitable bedding include safe wood shavings or plain rolled oats.

, You’ll not only need to prepare items for the mating budgies but also for the budgies chicks as well. You'll likely need:


A couple of perches. Make sure the perch is a natural wood and isn’t dangerous to your budgies.
A few toys for the male budgie. Make sure you don’t have so many toys so that the cage is cramped and do not put the toys too close that can cause the male to get hurt. It’s also recommended that you do not put any rope toys in the cage as the budgies and fledgling chicks might get tangled up in them.
A feeder.
Water dishes including an extra one for when the baby budgies fledge.
Budgie seed.
Budgie pellets.
A cuttle bone for extra calcium.
Liquid calcium or crushed oyster shell (two of these calcium sources at least).
A mineral block.
Extra food for when the baby budgies fledge.
Baby budgie food
A small syringe
A spare cage for when the chicks grow up.

, If your budgie pair have a big hatch you may encounter some problems with the youngest chicks getting cared for properly. This is why you have to prepare a safe and warm home for an abandoned or neglected chick. However, it’s a bit rare to get more than one neglected chick during one hatch.

, Good dimensions are: (9"" (H) X 6"" to 8"" (W) X 6"" to 7""(D) with an entry hole of 2 inches (5.1 cm) diameter).


Make sure that it has a little dish in it so the eggs don't roll and get rolled out of the nest and away from the heat of the mother bird. This is important so the eggs don't get cold. A concave also helps prevent splayed legs.

, If you like, make your own nest box from coconut husks. A coconut husk makes an ideal choice as it is not only snug but also offers something to bite on should the budgie get such a notion.


Locate three coconut husks. They need to be roughly the same size.
Drill some holes in one of the husks. Make a hole in the top part of the husk, a hole on one side and another hole on the other edge.
Repeat for the other two husks.
Draw the husks together using bird-safe wire or string. Thread through the drilled holes.
Make a hanger hole at the front of the husk. Or, make it wherever it seems appropriate.
Hang the husk in the breeding cage.
Add nesting materials to nest box (E.G. pine shavings).

, The pair must be older than 12 months but the hen younger than 3 years and the male younger than 5 years old. They should be healthy and have no deformities or illnesses such as splayed legs, french moult or similar.


You could also buy a budgie pair that is from the same cage/aviary so that they know each other already. If you don’t buy a budgie pair from the same cage you will have to spend time trying to get them both used to each other and it will also take them quite some time trying to bond. Be aware they may be related and it is never a good idea to breed related birds.
You can purchase healthy budgies from a local pet shop or from another reliable breeder. A good budgie pair should be alert, awake and making lots of noise whilst a bad budgie pair would be sleepy, huddled up and its eyes would be cloudy.
When ever you aquire a new bird remember to quarantine it in a seperate room, in a seperate cage for a minimum of 6 weeks. This is very important in ensuring the bird is not sick and doesn't spread anything to your other birds if it is. Birds in quarantine should not be bred.

, If you are going to start breeding budgies you will want to breed from a healthy budgie pair that is being cared for properly. This way you will most likely have a successful hatch of baby budgies.


Everything should be clean including the cage, bedding, feeders and water containers. Depending on the amount of budgies there is in one cage, it should also be spacious and not cramped.
The feeders should be filled with feed and the budgies should be fed a balanced diet consisting of seeds, fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, etc. The water containers should also be filled with fresh, clean water.

, Budgies won’t breed until they have adjusted to the new surroundings and they also need time to bond. You will have to wait for at least four weeks for them to consider mating.

, Keep all details, including a phone number, close at hand. You never know when something will go wrong, so when it does, call.


It’s also good to get your budgies checked out by an avian vet to make sure they are not sick and are suitable to breed.

, A good diet consists of fruits, veggies, seeds, grains, etc. You can also purchase a budgie seed mix and pellets that you can feed to your budgie along with the safe fruits and veggies.


Be aware that budgies eat a lot more when the chicks hatch so you should give them some extra food when the chicks do come about.

, The water container (and feeder) should be next to the perch and it should also be cleaned at least once a week.

, Rinse the cage and feeders out, dispose of all bedding and get rid of the feed/water and supply fresh feed/water. Bedding should only be changed once all the eggs have hatched. While the chicks are small it will only need changing every few days, when they are older or it is a large clutch the bedding will need to be changed daily. Avoid using cleaning products that aren’t safe for your budgies.

, Do not disturb the budgies. They will do their ""thing"" in their own time, but disturbing them and constantly hovering over them is not going to help. You may not catch them mating, but if you do, let them be. If you don’t the female/hen will tell the male to get off and the mating will stop. The female budgie will soon lay about 4-6 eggs.

, Candling the eggs means that you will know which eggs are fertile and which eggs are not. You can find candling steps online. Be very gentle and avoid touching the eggs, if you are going to touch the eggs at least wash your hands first to prevent passing on bacteria to the egg. Candling every few days during incubation can also help to determine if any of the embryos die. Any Dead In Shell (DIS) eggs need to be discarded to prevent spreading bacteria to the healthy eggs.


Be aware that this step is optional; it's recommended that you do your research first before deciding.

, The chicks will begin to hatch around day 16-21 so it is very important that you check the nest box daily. Try to do this when the mother bird is out eating or you can teach her to leave by tapping on the box before opening it.


Gently check the chicks over for injury (scratches, bruises or missing down feathers), seeds/air bubbles in the crop (the sack at the base of the chick's neck).
Check that the crop is full (bulging).
Make sure no food is stuck inside the top of the upper mandible (top of the beak). If there is food, gently pick it away with the end of a matchstick or the quill-end of a feather. If the food is not removed it will retard beak growth.
Clean off any poop and/or food from around the toes, beak, eyes, and other body parts with a soft, damp, and warm cloth.
Remove/dispose of any dead chicks or eggs in the nesting box.

,, If you see any problems with the chicks and the mother (E.G the mother isn’t feeding one chick) then consider hand-raising a chick or two.

, Chicks also mean poop, so the nest box must be cleaned out regularly. When the hen is out eating, remove the chicks to a small container lined with soft paper towels. Scrape out the soiled bedding and scrape away wet poops from the bottom of the nest box, then replace the nesting materials with fresh stuff. Gently replace chicks back. Make sure to be as quick as possible. (This should not be done until all fertile eggs have hatched)

, Simply put it in the box. The mother bird will nibble at it and immediately regurgitate this for her chicks. The babies may also take a bite or two, mimicking their mother. This helps with weaning later on as chicks recognise the seed as being food straight away. At 3 weeks old the mother may also stop feeding the chicks and the father will take over. This is completely normal however you will need to watch the mother and possibly seperate her as she may harm the chicks if she attempts to mate and nest while they are still in the box.

, When the chicks finally fledge at the age of 28-35 days old, put a dish of seed at the bottom of their cage. Though the father bird feeds them entirely at this stage, you want to encourage them to start eating solid food as soon as possible. It’s also a great idea to provide a bowl of chopped fresh fruits and veggies – fledglings love to explore and try new things!


You should also provide a bowl full of fresh, clean water at the bottom of the cage for the chicks. Make sure the bowl is shallow and that the chicks can access it easily. If it is too big you can add some marbles to stop the chicks from drowning.

,

Make sure that baby birds don't stay in there all day, Maybe take it out for a few hours a day so the baby birds can explore the cage and remember to eat and drink.

, Since you want chicks to stay with the male bird as long as possible it is best to seperate the mother.

, You can let the hen go on for a second round but often it causes a lot of stress on the breeding pair. When the last chick fledges, remove the nest box immediately and seal the hole where the nest box was. Perhaps separate the mother bird from the father bird and the chicks, as she may be a bit mean to her babies.


Back to back clutches can be OK if the pair are in great health and have not already had more that one previous clutch immediately prior to laying again. It is best to give your pair a 6 months break before allowing them to breed again.

, Males will have a pink or purple cere (nose) and females will have white or pale blue. Guess what, you made a budgie happy family!

Start a ""Parakeet Town"".,
Start a ""Parakeet Town Water park"".,
Change up their food.,
Give your bird a bath!,
Start a conversation with your bird.",How to Have Fun With Your Small Bird," This is lots of fun, and you can make it using things commonly found in a typical house. Start off by gathering up things like cardboard, index cards, wood, paper towels, string, building blocks, store-bought play-gyms, glue, and tape. Next, out of these items, start building your ""Parakeet Town"". Be creative! You can build anything fun that you think your birds will like, but here are a few building ideas to help get you started:


tunnels
homemade play gyms (make sure they're sturdy!)
chew toys
a play ring (made out of a circle of index cards taped or glued together)Be sure to fill it with homemade or store-bought toys!
a diner or a snack bar (cardboard works well for the ceilings, walls, and floor, and the bottom halves of paper cups make good food dishes)
a pool (bowl filled halfway with water)
a zip line (made out of string and a bird swing tied from one side of a room to another, on a slight angle)WATCH YOUR BIRDS CAREFULLY AT ALL TIMES! Always have another person at the end of the zip line to catch them, or tie a knot at least a foot from the back wall to stop the swing. *WARNING* If the swing is going too fast, it might stop suddenly at the end and scare your birds, possibly causing them to fly off. It is best to have another person at the end to help stop them. Most importantly, only do this if your bird is very well trained!
a castle (made out of blocks) Make sure the blocks are sturdy- you don't want a loose block falling on your birds!;
, First of all, your bird's wings must be clipped before taking them outside. See the Wikihow article, ""How to Take Your Pet Birds Outside"" to learn more about how to clip wings safely. Make sure you only do this activity on a very hot day (over 80 degrees) or your birds will get cold, which could be fatal. Basically, it is the same thing as ""Parakeet Town"" only outdoors and with more water. Start by setting up any bird toys or play-gyms that you have that can't be damaged by water (they WILL get wet!)on a table outside. A picnic table works well! Plastic toys and play-gyms work best. Next, take a hose or buckets of water and get everything completely wet. Put bowls and plates of water all over the table. If your play-gyms have a closed bottom, you can fill them up with water, too. If your birds like being misted, you can also use a spray bottle or the 'mist' setting on your hose (if you have one!)to cool them down every once in a while. Do not get your birds too wet, and give them time in direct sunlight to warm up about every 15-20 minutes, or they could get sick.

, Can you imagine eating the same old bird seed all day every day? Not only would you get sick of it, but it's unhealthy too! Try experimenting with different bird-safe foods (no sugar or salt) and find out what your birds like! You can look up fun food recipes that are safe for birds to eat online, or invent some yourself! If your birds don't eat what you make for them at first, try sprinkling their old bird seed on top of it to make them feel more comfortable with it. You can also buy pre-made microwavable bird food in stores.

,


All you need is a bird and a sink! If your bird has never taken a bath before, keep it short- and don't force the bird into the water. Make sure you dry your bird as much as possible with a towel. When he's as dry as you can get him, put him in a room without any drafts (no open windows or doors)for a while. You can also buy a special lamp from some pet stores especially for keeping your bird warm after a bath.

, If your bird is talk-active bird (e.g. a budgie) why not start an interesting conversation? Although your bird won't actually respond you can teach the bird a few words."
"
Fill a shallow bowl with lukewarm water.,
Put a towel under the cage.,
Place the bowl in the bottom of the cage.,
Let the budgie play.,
Let your bird dry off.,
Clean out the bath.",How to Give Your Budgie a Bath1," Water should only be an inch or two deep. It shouldn't be too cold, as budgies are susceptible to cold.


You can also find baths that attach to the side of your bird's cage.
If you find your bird doesn't like the bowl of water, you can also try wet grass or greens at the bottom of a (clean) cage. Your bird will enjoy rolling in them as a way of bathing.You don't need to use soap.;
, If you're worried about water splashing out, set a towel under the cage. It will help catch the splashing.

, Set the bath in the bottom of the cage where your budgie can jump in. Make sure it's on a level surface.


If you prefer, you can also fill up your sink with a small amount of water. Take the budgie in there, and close the door so she can't fly away. However, make sure your sink is clean first.

, Budgies will splash and flutter in the water. The splashing is the budgie giving themself a bath. Most budgies enjoy the process immensely.If you're budgie doesn't jump in immediately, give her a chance to get used to it. If he or she still doesn't hop in, you may want to move on to the next method., Your bird will shake herself to get the water off. However, make sure that the area they are drying off in isn't breezy or cool. You might want to cover his or her cage with a towel to help., After you bath your bird, take the bowl or bath out of the cage. Make sure to wash it out thoroughly and wash your hands when you're done.

Pick a pellet food.,
Supplement with fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Add seeds, nuts, and grains.,
Place food dishes in the conure’s cage.,
Provide fresh drinking water.,
Dispose of old food and clean the food containers.,
Avoid certain toxic foods.,
Refrain from feeding fatty and sugary human foods.,
Consult your veterinarian.",How to Feed a Conure," This should be the main staple of your conure’s diet – accounting for approximately 60-70% of its food intake. This food will create the base of a nutritious diet for your conure.Be sure to purchase a pellet food that is labelled “organic” or “all natural” so that you can avoid exposing your conure to any harmful additives.
You should be able to find a high-quality bird pellet food at any pet store in your area.
Consider purchasing a pellet food that contains a variety of colors to keep your bird interested.;
, Adding fruits and vegetables to your conure’s diet is a great way to enrich the bird’s nutrient intake and provide a bit of variety. This group should account for approximately 20% of your bird’s diet. Be sure to cut the produce into small, easily edible bites before putting it into your bird’s food dish.Some good examples of produce your conure will like include mangoes, kiwis, apples, blueberries, spinach, pumpkins, and zucchinis.
Make sure to wash the fruits and vegetables thoroughly before feeding them to your conure. This will protect your bird from ingesting harmful pesticides.
You may also want to consider purchasing organic fruits and vegetables.

, These food groups are a great way to add a bit of variety and extra nutrition to your conure’s diet, though they should be given sparingly and constitute the smallest category of your bird’s diet. You can incorporate seed mixes with the pellet food that you feed the bird most of the time, but nuts and grains should be provided in small amounts.You can give your bird healthy, non-sugary grains like barley, cooked brown rice, or crackers.
Consider adding low-salt, unshelled nuts. Peanut shells can be toxic to conures.

, Give you conure two feeding dishes – one for the pellet/seed foods and one for the supplementary foods like fruits, vegetables, and nuts. This will make it easier for you to clean the containers and replace the fresher foods more frequently.Make sure the food dishes are attached to the side of the bird cage so that the conure cannot knock over its food on accident.
Typically, you should give your conure three tablespoons of pellet food each day, supplemented with a smaller portion of fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, and nuts. Follow your vet’s feeding instructions.

, You should include one dedicated drinking dish inside your conure’s cage. Check it every day to make sure that the dish is full of water and not contaminated with some other element – like old food or excrement.Consider keeping the water dish away from the food dishes so that the bird doesn’t accidentally drop some of the food into the water while it is eating.

, Check the bird’s cage every day to see if there is any leftover food that needs to be disposed of. The pellets and seeds can remain in the cage for several days, but any fresh fruits or vegetables will need to be monitored for spoilage. Remove the food dishes once per week and clean them thoroughly to get rid of any food remnants that might rot.Make sure you check your bird’s food dishes every day to prevent exposure to rotten foods.

, There are some food items that are toxic to conures. Some of these items include peanut shells, avocados, onions, chocolate, and cocoa. Do not give these items to your conure under any circumstances.You should also avoid feeding your conure anything containing caffeine or alcohol, as these can be highly toxic to birds.

, While some human foods are perfectly acceptable to feed your conure, others can be quite unhealthy for your bird. This is especially true for foods that are high in sugar, fat, and salt content. Conures cannot break down these elements very easily, so they are difficult to digest.Avoid feeding your conure sugary cereals or grains, processed foods of any kind, or food items containing meat.

, If you are unsure about what to feed your conure, make an appointment with your veterinarian so that they can answer any questions you might have. This is the safest option for your bird.You should also be able to ask questions of knowledgeable pet store employees or avian specialists.

Get a marker.,
Make sure your parakeet accepts food from you.,
Start a training session.,
Put one finger to the cage bars.,
Be prepared with an alternative response.,
Do this several times.,
If your parakeet steps toward the finger, click and treat.

,
Do this several times.,
Only click when your parakeet touches your finger (or whatever target you have chosen).,
Move it outside.,
(Add a cue.)",How to Clicker Train a Parakeet to Target," Contrary to popular belief, you do not need a clicker to do clicker training. A clicker is simply used to mark a behavior. You can use anything to mark the behavior that your animal can hear (i.e. a whistle, a bell, a kazoo). A whistle would probably be too loud for your parakeet. You know if you have found a good marker if it can make a short and sharp sound.;
, You will need to choose a treat that is small and doesn't take long to chew. Then, give it to your parakeet through the bars of the cage. (Start in the cage for this training so your pet will feel more secure.) If your parakeet readily accepts the treat, whatever it may be, then you are ready to start.

, At the start of your training session, have a handful of treats ready. Give your parakeet one treat for free to start the training session.

, (We will be using a finger for the target. You can use whatever you want, as long as your parakeet is not frightened of it.) Your parakeet will react one of two ways: It will run away, or it will inspect your finger with its beak. If it runs away, obviously you need to gain its trust more first. If it inspects it with its beak, then click (or do whatever marker you have chosen) and treat. Your ""click"" must be exactly when the behavior is performed, not before and not after. Be accurate.

, There is a third way your parakeet might react. If your parakeet just does nothing, do nothing as well. Don't try to move closer. You may take your finger away for a few seconds and offer it again. If your parakeet looks at the finger (or target) click and treat.

, Do it until your parakeet gets the message. It will probably come towards your finger after a while. If it doesn't, stop clicking when it looks at your finger. It will try to figure out what you want it to do.

,, Stop the click if your parakeet makes no more progress. It should figure out that it needs to go farther.

, After a while of reinforcing this behavior with treats, your parakeet will catch on very quickly.

, You can now try the behavior outside the cage, leading your parakeet farther and farther distances. Soon it will learn to follow the target.

, You may, if you like, add a cue to the behavior. Only give a click and treat if your parakeet performs the behavior while you are giving the cue. Of course, the target may already act as the cue for you, which is just as good.

Locate budgies for sale from a reputable seller.,
Visit a store or an individual seller.,
Ask the seller how they care for their birds.Make sure they are cleaning the birds cages regularly.,
Examine the cage the budgies are in.,
Consider whether the birds look healthy and happy.,
Assess your potential budgie's temperament.,
Look for a budgie that is young.,
Determine if your potential budgie is male or female.,
Pick a bird that is attractively colored.",How to Choose a Good Budgie," You can find budgies for sale online, in want-ads, or in pet stores. You can also get one from your local animal shelter. Wherever you get your budgie from, make sure the seller has healthy and humanely treated birds.


Look at online reviews for the sellers you find. Are most buyers satisfied with the birds that they purchased from the seller?
If you have a friend that has budgies, ask them where you can get good birds. This is especially helpful if they got their bird, or birds, recently.;
, Assess how they make you feel. Does the space feel clean and well cared for? Do you think the people working at the store or the person selling the birds feels responsible and invested in the health and happiness of the birds? If any of this feels wrong, walk away.

, Are the sellers cleaning their hands before handling the birds? These are simple but important things that keep budgies healthy and happy.

, Budgies need a clean and spacious cage. Are there so many budgies in there they can't all move? Is the cage or bin dirty? Does the condition of the cage line up with what the seller told you they do to care for their birds? Do the birds have water? Do the birds have appropriate food, such as seed, pellets, and vegetables?These are all important things to assess before moving forward with purchasing a budgie.

, Are the birds interacting with one another? Look at the head, body, and legs of each bird you are considering. If it is healthy and happy its feathers should be smooth and shiny, not all puffed up. It should have a healthy appetite, so you should see it eating seed. Its beak and feet should not be crusted. Its vents should be clear and it should not have any nasal discharge.The feathers should have an appearance that is shiny, sleek, and smooth.The budgies should not have any growths or abnormalities.The budgies' feet should be clear of mites and its toes should be clean and smooth., If it is healthy and happy then it should be active and seem happy. Does it move around, eat seed, and drink water? While a budgie should be relatively calm when left alone, it is natural for a budgie to tighten its feathers when you come near its cage, so don't read that behavior negatively. Usually, the budgies from pet shops are not hand tamed, which means that you will have to be willing to take the time to help it get accustomed to your hand, if you want to be able to hold it. If you want to buy a budgie that is already hand tamed, you will need to go to a specialized budgie breeder.

, You can tell the age of a budgie by the black bars on the forehead. A young budgie (under 4 months) will have black bars all the way down to the cere, which is the fleshy part above the beak. Above 4 months, the bars will disappear.


If the budgie is ""molting"" it is around 6 months old, this is a good age to train a budgie.

, This only matters if you have a preference and only works when they are old enough that the bars are gone. For males, the cere is blue. For females, the cere will be very light blue, beige, or brown.


Male budgies are slightly better talkers, so if you are concerned with that you might want to make sure you get a male bird.However, a young healthy bird of either sex can be a great talker with the right training.

, If you are purchasing a budgie from a seller that has a lot of healthy and active birds, then feel free to pick your budgie based on looks. Budgies come in a huge variety of colors, so pick the color combination that you like best!"

Let the parents care for newborns.,
Ensure a dry, dark, warm nesting box.,
Keep the nesting box clean.",How to Care for Your Baby Budgie1," If you have a baby budgie which you have bred from a pair of budgies at home, it's important to allow the parents to do most of the caring. Part of creating the best possible environment for the chick to thrive is helping the parents look after him. The parents are the real experts, so you should enable them to do the job. You should, however, always keep a close eye on how the chick is progressing.Try to handle any chick as little as possible in the first couple of weeks especially.
The chick will be incredibly fragile, with a long neck that cannot yet properly support his head. Be very gentle and move slowly when you handle him.;
, The chicks are born blind and without feathers, so they are very vulnerable to environmental factors, such as light, heat, cold, and wet. They should stay in the nesting box for the first few weeks so they can develop in a protected area. Make sure that the nesting box is out of any direct light. There should be a good circulation of air, but the box should be warm and insulated from any drafts, cold or moisture.A wooden box that has plenty of nesting material such as plain rolled oats or safe wood shavings in it makes a good nesting box. The parents will construct the nest, but having a safe, closed space like a wooden box can help them feel secure.
A cardboard box is generally considered a bit too flimsy, and wood is preferable.
There should be enough room for the birds to move around the box, but it should be small enough to still feel closed and secure.
Place the box in the cage, but try not to interfere too much. Allow the parents to organise the nest. Having the nest attached outside the cage is the best option if possible as it allows the most space inside the cage., The chick's parents will try to keep chicks clean, but you can help by making sure the chick's feet and beak don't get clogged up with soiled bedding or anything else.Once the babies start getting feathered, you should begin cleaning out the nest box regularly. Keep an eye out for large build-ups of soiled bedding. Scoop these areas out and replace them with fresh bedding.


You should also scrape clean the wooden insert on the base as needed.
Try to clean out the nest once a week or more frequently if required.
Place the chicks in a large bowl, which you have lined with a soft towel, while you are cleaning the nest box."

Find or buy a spray bottle.,
Fill the spray with lukewarm to warm water.,
Turn the spray head to ""mist."",
Spray the water over your bird.,
Let your bird dry off.",How to Give Your Budgie a Bath2," You can often find these in the hair care section of a drug store or superstore. You can also often find them in the gardening section of a home improvement store.


An alternative to a spray bottle is a perch you can place in your own shower, which you can usually find at pet stores. Just place your shower head on a gentle spray, and turn the water on lukewarm.

, Once again, you don't want the water to be too cold. Budgies and other small birds are susceptible to cold.

, Most spray bottles have several settings for the bottle. You don't want a thin stream of water; you need a fine mist for your bird's bath., You want to create a gentle mist that showers down over your bird. Don't spray them right in the face, as most birds will not like that.You can offer this kind of bath everyday if you wish.

, Your bird will dry herself off. Just make sure the area where they are drying off is warm and free of cool breezes.

Monitor the chick in the first days.,
Check the babies for fixable developmental problems.,
Help the chick wean.,
Remove the chick from the nest.,
Consult your vet.",How to Care for Your Baby Budgie2," The chick's parents will care for it as best as they can, but you should regularly check on the health and development of the chick. If the chick develops an illness, you may need to consult a veterinarian. By the time the chick is a few days old, it should show some bright colour, and should be beginning to put on weight. Generally a lighter chick is more disposed to illness or is being targeted by red mites.


If your chick doesn't appear to be developing or gaining weight, consider contacting your vet or handfeeding if you can.
Once your chick has begun to develop feathers, and they have reached about half an inch long (approximately 1cm), they should feel strong when you touch them., If you think your chick is not developing properly, you should consult a vet for some expert advice, but there are some basic checks that you can do at home to help the chick develop healthily. The first of these is to look under the top mandible (beak). If you notice a build-up of food, this can lead to an undershot beak.


If you see some food stuck there, very carefully remove it with a toothpick.
If you think that your chick is beginning to develop splayed legs, try adding some extra bedding to the nest.If the chick cannot stand up straight, perch, or walk around easily, he may have splayed legs. Look to see if the legs lean out to the sides rather than underneath the body.If you are uncertain or you think your chick is ill, don't hesitate to contact your vet.

, Once the chick starts coming out of the nest on his own, you can help the process of weaning along, and then help him leave the nest. Once you notice the chick coming out of the nest, you should provide a shallow dish of food and place it at the bottom of the cage. The chick will start eating the food from the dish, beginning the weaning process.You should allow the chick to wean by itself, but monitor it closely to ensure that it is eating enough.Provide a dish of fresh water so the chick can learn to drink from it.
Monitor the chicks and parents; when they have not been fed by the parents for at least a week, have not asked for feeds and you can see they are cracking seeds and filling their crops well you can considered them weaned.

, Once a chick is weaned you can remove him the from the nest. This will help his development and the development of any younger chicks in the nest. Put the weaned chick in a large cage that you have set aside for young birds. Ensure the cage has plenty of food placed in different areas, but especially in a dish at the bottom of the cage, and a supply of fresh water.


Keep a close watch on the young birds and check that they are eating sufficiently.
Make sure the bird's crop is full before covering the cage for the night.The crop is the place where budgies store food. When it's full, there is a noticeable lump on the front of the chest., Once your chick is developed and independent, you can book him in for his first check-up with the vet. Bringing him to the vet will reduce the chances of a hidden problem developing. The vet will also be able to give you some good tips on how to care for a young bird. Before you go to the vet, it's a good idea to prepare yourself well.


Write down a list of all the foods and supplements you are feeding your bird.
Be able to describe the bird's living environment. Bring in photos if possible."

Have a limited number of parakeets.,
Make your parakeet comfortable with you.,
Pick the right time to train your parakeet.,
Repeat one word to your bird, over and over.,
Reward your parakeet if he or she says the word you're teaching it.,
Speak to your bird for a few minutes at a time.,
Don't let the bird get distracted during lessons.,
Keep each lesson focused.,
Be patient.,
Move on to more complicated words or phrases.,
Get your parakeet to name an object or an object's color.",How to Teach Parakeets to Talk," Parakeets can develop their ability to make noises by talking to other birds, so having a few birds can help both of them develop the variety of their chirping. However, having too many birds will focus all their communication on other birds, instead of on communicating with you.


Having a few birds will usually not limit your ability to train them to talk but more than a few could hinder your progress.
If you only have one parakeet, trick it into thinking it has a friend by placing a mirror in its cage. This will help it develop and practice chirping. However, you should take the mirror out of its cage before you start teaching it how to talk, so that your bird focuses its attention on you.;
, Make friends with your bird by spending time with it, speaking to it, and keeping it nice and comfy in your home. Basically, treat your parakeet like it is a part of your family, because it is.


The goal should be to build up trust between you and your parakeet. Don't force the bird to interact with you if it doesn't want to. If the bird is scared of you or ignoring you it is just a sign that the time is not right or that you are moving too quickly. It is not a sign that your bird will never bond with you.

, Make sure that the bird is calm and ready to focus its attention on you. If the bird is tired or distracted, it won't be as easy to train.


A good time to train your bird is first thing in the morning. You can even start repeating words for your bird before uncovering its cage at the start of the day.

, Speak clearly and slowly, teaching them only one word at a time. Your parakeet may not know to repeat the word right away, but just keep repeating it.


Note that parakeets are best with the consonants d,t,k,p, or b. A simple phrase like ""Hi, how are you?"" won't help because it is hard for your bird to say it.
If you don't know what word to teach your bird first, consider teaching it it's name. This is a word they have probably heard before, so the sounds should be familiar to your parakeet already.

, This will reinforce the behavior and also help to further the bond between you and your bird. Parakeets love millet sprays; Celery and carrots are also great treats and they provide essential nutrients for your budgie's health.

, However, don't try to train it for too long in one session. It's a good idea to work with your parakeet for about a half an hour a day. If you try to work with it for too long, your bird may get bored and could become less willing to learn. 

, Keep it focused by covering three sides of the bird's cage with a cloth. Stand right in front of their cage when talking to your bird, so it knows that it is you speaking to it.

, Don't move onto a second word until your parakeet can say the first phrase correctly at least three times in a row. Making sure that your parakeet really knows a word before moving on will make it more likely that it will repeat the same word or phrase at a later time., Do not try to force your parakeet to talk. Many parakeets never learn to talk, but it's fun to try!, Once your parakeet has mastered a few words, you can move on to full phrases. Just as with teaching it words, repeat the phrase to your parakeet when it is calm and willing to focus on you. The parakeet will be focused if you are the only one in the room,but others can cause your parakeet to be frightened.

, As you say a word, hold up the object. With enough practice, you should be able to just hold up the object and the parakeet will repeat the word you taught it. It will simply be repeating the sounds you made but it will appear as if it can actually identify the object.

Provide interesting food.,
Add a few perches.,
Weigh the pros and cons of a mirror.,
Examine the size of the cage.",How to Amuse Your Parakeet or Other Bird1," Good parakeet food mostly consists of seeds and fresh fruits and vegetables. Try to introduce pellets in the diet as well as a seed-only diets can lead to obesity.Vary the presentation to make it more exciting for the bird. Rotate certain food items to keep them interested in the food you offer.
Never feed your bird avocado, chocolate, caffeine, or alcohol. These are toxic to the bird.Make sure the bird has enough water to drink in its dispenser. Add more water if the bowl or dish is low. Change the water daily to prevent bacterial build-up.Add a cuttle-bone. This is a good source of natural calcium for birds. Mineral blocks can also be offered for calcium.
Don't feed your bird too many watery fruits or veggies, as this could cause your bird to get diarrhea. Diarrhea can cause dehydration and if left untreated, may cause it to die.;
, Perches are a great way for your bird to be comfortable in the cage. Parakeets are a very active bird and will love to have a variety of perches in its home. Try to vary the perches to keep them interesting to your bird. Look for different thicknesses, shapes and textures.
Rearrange and rotate perches weekly. This allows you to clean the ones not in use and keep things interesting for your bird.
Make sure that the perch is stable to avoid any injury.
Check that the wood is safe for the bird, such as eucalyptus.
Natural wood perches are a great choice as the irregular shape helps your birds feet to keep strong and stay healthy.
Dowel perches or plastic perches can cause foot problems due to the lack of foot exercise.
Some types of wood should be avoided. Do not use perches and toys made out of Prunus or Oak trees as they might contain cyanogenic glycosides and tannins. These chemicals may harm your bird.Try to avoid concrete perches, as they are hard on the bird's feet.
Don’t crowd the cage with too many toys or perches. Your parakeet must be able to spread its wings and move around.

, Adding a mirror in the cage can keep the bird entertained for hours. Be aware however that there are debates about potential psychological damages. Instead of a mirror, consider a second bird. Parakeets love company and will probably welcome a new friend.
If you decide to install a mirror, make sure that it’s fixed to the cage and doesn’t present a risk to your bird.
Look for a mirror offered at your local pet store. They will have ones specifically designed for a bird to use.
Don't simply place any mirror you find in the cage. Mirrors for birds are usually housed in a plastic case to prevent any sharp edges from hurting your bird.

, The cage itself will need to be of adequate size to house your bird. Of course, the size of your bird will determine how large your cage will need to be. There are some general guidelines you can follow when selecting the right size cage for your bird:Avoid tall circular cages. These cages might look nice, but they don't allow for enough room for your bird to fly in.
Your bird should at least be able to fully stretch its wings out while inside the cage. Ideally, your bird will have enough room to fly from perch to perch without trouble.
Keep in mind how many birds you are going to put in this cage. The more birds, the more space will be required.
Make sure the cage is easy to clean. Keeping the cage clean will help keep your bird happy and healthy.

"
"
Talk to the bird often.,
Play games.,
Let the bird fly freely in a room.,
Introduce them to new areas of your house.",How to Amuse Your Parakeet or Other Bird2," Your bird will love the interaction and is likely to become very chatty. Keeping your bird company will keep it happy and well adjusted, as well as build a better bond.


Try reading stories to your bird or even just tell them about your day.
Parrots listen more than you think. If you don't want them to pick up bad language, keep it clean around them.

, Parakeets love to interact with their owner. Try different games to see which your bird likes the best.Birds love to play “Peek-a-boo”
You could teach your bird to climb up on your finger. Put a few seeds on your finger and let your bird feed from it. Gently stroke its belly and it will be encouraged to jump on the finger.
Try to teach it tricks. Buy a bird ladder and position your little friend on the bottom step. It will learn how to climb it.
Position your parakeet on a tennis ball and let it finds its balance. Encourage it with a treat. Your parakeet will eventually balance itself on its own on the ball.
Every time your bird goes up or down, say ‘up’ or ‘down’ and do a hand gesture. Your bird will understand these actions after a while and obey your orders.

, Your bird will love the chance to fly freely in a safe room. Parakeets are migratory and extremely active, so the open flight will be enjoyed greatly by them. You can let your bird fly in a room with all of the windows and doors closed. To call your bird back, turn off all the lights but one, or leave a single curtain open. The bird will fly towards the light. Pick up and hold your bird gently and put it back inside the cage.
Have a play stand for your bird so it can have somewhere else to sit besides the cage.
Make sure that the bird is safe. Put the cat away and look out for potential escape routes or other hazards.
Think about your own hygiene. Your bird is likely to void on the floor. Don’t let it fly in a carpeted room.
Always supervise your bird when it is out of the cage, so it won't get hurt.
Don't force your bird to come out of its cage if it's not in the mood.

, New environments can be stimulating to your bird. Taking them around the house with you on your shoulder can be a great way to spend time together.


Talk with your bird as they ride on your shoulder.
Let them explore new places, such as the surface of your dresser or nightstand.
Always monitor your bird as it explores on its own. Keep it safe from any hazards.
Make sure any areas your visit together are free from dangers. Keep cats and other pets away, close all doors and windows, and turn off any fans.
Be careful when in certain rooms. Cooking or cleaning around your bird can release harmful elements into the air. Dust, smoke, and especially Teflon from a hot Teflon pan, can injure your birds respiratory system.

Introduce a new parakeet.,
Turn on the radio.,
Provide plenty of toys.,
Place the cage near a window.",How to Amuse Your Parakeet or Other Bird3," Parakeets love company and will welcome a new friend, especially if you’re often at work. If you decide to buy an additional bird, make sure that the cage is big enough for two parakeets.Separate the birds at first. Put them in different cages to let them look at each other.
Bring the cages closer after a few days. They will get used to each other.
After two weeks, put the new bird in the cage of the resident parakeet. Always monitor the reaction.
If any conflict occurs, separate the birds and try to reintroduce them again later.

, If you are often away, your bird might get lonely and depressed. It’s always good to turn on the radio or the TV and provide your bird with entertainment.


You could also record your voice and play it when away.
Make sure to put music you like. Your bird might start singing what it heard.
If leaving a radio or television talk show on, consider the language being used as your bird may repeat some of the dialogue.
Think about the volume. You don't want the sound to be too loud as the bird must be given the opportunity to sleep.

, Parakeets are playful animals and love toys. You can buy a great variety of them in your favorite pet shop. You should provide an assortment of toys to chew, explore and climb.Birds need at least one new toy a month. Toys are a necessity, not a luxury, for birds.
Rotate toys regularly to keep them fresh and interesting for your bird and allow you time to clean them.
Toys will help keep your bird entertained and happy.
Try different toys to see which your bird really enjoys.
Any metal, except stainless steel isn't safe, because it could contain zinc.Always check toys for safety, making sure there is no way your bird can get stuck in or on them.
Make sure toys are of appropriate size for your bird.

, Placing the cage near or in a window can provide an entertaining vantage point into the outside world. Your bird will be able to enjoy watching all the events that take place outside while you are away.

Avoid any windows with direct sunlight. This can be too hot and too bright for you bird to be comfortable in.
Check the window for any cold drafts or air. If the window allows chilly air to pass through, don't put your bird near it, as cold temperatures can be harmful to it.
Make sure your window is shut. Even if your bird is in a cage, take no risks. The bird may find a way out, or something could find a way in, if the window is open.

Be aware that a parakeet can damage its feathers for a number of reasons.,
Seek advice from your veterinarian.,
Be alert to any changes in the bird's eating or drinking habits.,
If your parakeet is lethargic, and won't respond to you calling or offering food, this is a sign of sickness.,
Watch for aggression.,
If the weather or room environment is hot, there is a possibility that the parakeet is too hot.,
If the weather or room environment is cold, there is a possibility that the parakeet is too cold.,
Check the bird's urine.,
Look for discharge.,
If you notice or feel lumps or swollen parts of the bird's body, this is a problem in need of immediate veterinary attention.,
Be alert to any vomiting or regurgitation.,
Check the parakeet's eyes.,
See the veterinarian first.,
Follow the vet's home-care instructions with great care.,
Keep the recovering bird in a warm place that is not too hot.,
Keep the fluids up.,
Ask your vet to suggest a feeding regime.",How to Tell when a Parakeet Is Sick," The damage can occur over time or within just a few hours, depending on the cause. Some possible reasons for feather damaging include:Boredom. If the bird doesn't feel mentally stimulated, it will grow bored. Picking at its feathers is a form of distracting itself, much as when a human bites at their fingernails out of boredom or frustration.
Diet. If the bird isn't getting a nutrient-balanced diet, it may resort to feather plucking.
Stress. A person, pet or habitat could be provoking the bird to feel stressed. Lack of exercise, overly large or small perches, noisy or busy cage location, lack of chewing toys, lack of exercise, etc., can lead to the bird being stressed. You should move the bird to a calm, quiet and low-traffic room.
Illness. A medical condition or disease can cause feather plucking or loss such as French Moult.;
, It is important to rule out an illness before assuming the feather-plucking behavior is caused by boredom, diet or stress. Moreover, unless you are an expert, it can be difficult to diagnose a bird's illness.

, A failure to eat food or drink water is a very concerning sign, and the bird should be seen by a veterinarian immediately., This may be accompanied by huddling low on its perch, puffing up the feathers or breathing heavily. In addition, the bird may show some of these signs:Weakness
Sitting in a corner of the cage or low in the cage
Falling off its perch
Continuous feather ruffling
Failure to preen itself
A lack of activity or a strange new posture
Walking in circles
Having seizures or trembling
Sleeping a lot
Changes to its singing, or a lack of singing
Hanging from the cage by its beak rather than perching.

, A normally placid and happy parakeet may suddenly start to snap at you or behave aggressively if it feels pain or is ill., Birds cannot sweat and must use other ways to dissipate heat from their bodies.Signs that your parakeet may be too warm include:Panting (rapid breathing or more breaths per minute than usual)––this is a very serious sign of overheating that needs immediate veterinary attention, first by phone, then by a visit
Spreading its wings out
Hot feet
Flared and red nares (nasal opening)
Hot beak
Note that these symptoms can also be found if the bird has a fever or respiratory distress, so it's important to seek help from the vet immediately.

, Signs that your parakeet may be too cold include:Fluffing out its feathers
Huddling or scrunching over its feet (to keep them warm)
Sitting in a corner or finding a hiding spot (possibly to get away from a draft).

, If there is a change in the color, consistency or quantity of the urine, then the bird may be ill. This also applies to its droppings.If there is a bad odor in the cage, either from urine, droppings or another source, assume that the bird is not well., If you see discharge from the nostrils, or crusted areas, the bird is ill.,, This usually signals illness. If regurgitating the budgie may shake its head side to side and expel whole seeds. If vomiting the head will appear wet and may include mucous and seed., If they look sunken, droopy, cloudy or have changed color, these are signs of poor health or an illness. A healthy parakeet will have clear and alert eyes., Use your usual bird-experienced vet to diagnose and treat the bird's illness.

, Be prepared to call if you're not sure about anything or if changes occur that worry you.

, Avoid situating the bird anywhere with drafts, noise or bright light. Keep human and pet traffic to an absolute minimum.


Remove distractions from the cage, such as toys, mirrors or bells.
Ensure that the bird gets at least 10 to 12 hours of sleep. This may include making the bird's resting area off-bounds to all household members.
In some cases, it may help to increase the humidity in your home. Talk to your vet about this; it can assist with improved breathing if the bird is congested, but the vet must okay it first.

, This can be helped by feeding the bird foods with a high moisture content, such as leafy greens and fruit, provided the vet has said this is okay first.If it is okay to give fruit, float a piece of grape or apple in the bird's water. This can encourage the bird to drink, as well as take the piece of fruit.

, Recovering birds often do well on a diet high in simple carbohydrates because these are easy for the bird to digest.Your bird's vet should give you appropriate suggestions.

A cat may jump on a couch near a window or get on a kitchen counter in search of food. Make your furniture less appealing by eliminating the built-in rewards cats seek by climbing on furniture.Keep blinds closed if you have furniture near windows. This way, cats will not be drawn to furniture to sunbathe or look out windows.
Remove any excess padding from furniture when it's not in use. For example, after you get done lounging on your couch to watch a movie, remove any blankets or pillows you used.
Keep surfaces in the kitchen free of food and other debris that cats will be drawn towards.;
, Cats dislike slippery surfaces. When not in use, line furniture with tinfoil. This will deter your cat from jumping up on the furniture as they will dislike sliding around.This tends to work best with small bits of furniture, such as coffee tables.

, For non-fabric surfaces, place double-sided sticky tape in stripes or criss-cross patterns on things like coffee tables, mantels, and kitchen counters. If your cat finds their feet get sticky after jumping on a piece of furniture, they're more likely to stay off that furniture.Do not place double-sided sticky tape on leather furniture. It will leave residue behind that's difficult to get off.

, Repellent sprays often work great for fabric surfaces. If you want your cat off a couch or a chair, spray that surface down with a commercial cat repellent spray. Commercial sprays will not harm cats, but will contain oils and other scents that repel them from furniture. Follow the directions on a spray bottle closely and apply it to your furniture to keep cats down.Always test a spray on a small, unnoticeable patch of furniture first. Make sure it does not cause any damage or discoloration to the surface before applying it all over your furniture.

, Plastic floor mats can be turned upside down and laid over furniture when it's not in use. Floor mats have small knobs on the bottoms that irritate a cat's feet. These knobs will not harm cats, but will be uncomfortable enough that your cat will be deterred from jumping on furniture., Cats respond better to built-in punishment. Rather than punishing your cat after it gets on the furniture, leave something on the furniture to startle your cat. Place some lightweight cookie sheets on the edge of the couch or chair, for example, that's balanced near the edge. When your cat jumps up, they'll land on the trays and be startled. With time, this may discourage your cat from getting on counters."

Go slowly.,
Let the cat sniff your hand.,
Try not to stare at the cat too much.,
Don't pick them up right away.,
Be careful how you touch them.,
Give them some space.,
Look for signs the cat is warming up to you.",How to Make a Cat Comfortable Around You," The first time you meet a cat, they will probably be very cautious around you. Make slow movements and try not to make too much noise. Approach slowly, and crouch down so you don't seem as big. Hold out your hand.;
, This may seem like something you should do for dogs rather than cats, but you really should do it for both. Hold out your hand straight, and let them sniff your fingers. If they put their sent on you (rubbing their mouth against your hand) that's a good sign!

, To animals, staring can seem like a challenge or a sign of aggression.

, Some cats love being held, others despise it. Either way, most cats probably aren't comfortable with you picking them up the first time they meet you.


If you do pick them up at some point in time, make sure they feel secure. Never take a cat when their legs are dangling, this may make them feel uncomfortable or even cause them pain. Pick them up with a hand on their back and a hand on their rear. Hold them close to you, so they don't feel like their dangling.

, Cats can be very sensitive and there are certain spots on their body that they tend to prefer not be touched.


Be careful touching a cat's face. Be extremely careful touching the bridge of their nose, which is also a weak spot. Don't cover their face in anyway, this may cause them to become afraid. Don't blow or breathe on their ears, their ears are very sensitive.
Never touch their stomach. Cats' stomachs are their weak spots, something they protect very much and would rather have you not touch. Some cats may seem like they want a tummy rub. They may roll over, or lay on their side, both exposing their stomach. That doesn't mean they want to be pet there. Try to avoid touching their stomach as much as possible. They aren't like dogs, tummy rubs aren't their thing!
Don't touch a cat's tail! This may cause them great annoyance.
Be careful when scratching a cat. Try to rub, and only scratch their back when they seem like that's what they want.

, Most cats will hide if there are many people around them, or even just one. Do not chase the cat or follow them to their hiding spot. If they run from you, they clearly don't want to meet you right now. Never take a cat out of their hiding spot, either.


If a cat comes out from their spot, that might mean they reconsider. Don't grab them quickly, or even pet them. Always let a cat come to you when your first meeting them.

, If a cat rubs against your legs, that means you've succeeded! A cat rubbing against a human's legs means they like you very much.

Get indoor cat furniture.,
Make an alternate area attractive for your cat.,
Feed your cat more.",How to Keep Cats off the Dinner Table1," Since cats naturally like to climb, you shouldn't try to discourage your cat from climbing altogether. Instead, give him alternatives to climbing on your table and counters. A good substitute is ""tree"" style indoor car furniture. These usually have perches and platforms for your cat to jump onto, which will satisfy the natural desire to climb. As an added bonus, they are usually coated with carpeting to make them a comfortable resting place for your cat., Your cat might gravitate towards the kitchen table because he finds it comfortable. Counteract this by making another area more appealing. In addition to buying specialized cat furniture, you can take a few steps to turn a different area in your cat's favorite.Rub catnip on a certain area to attract your cat to it.
Place your cat's food in the area you want him to go.
Play with your cat in the new area. Pet him and give him praise so he learns to associate the new area with good feelings.

, Cats often roam around looking for food, which can lead them to kitchen tables and counters. If your cat keeps going up on the kitchen table, he may be searching for food. You can counteract this instinct by using a few different techniques to feed your cat.Try breaking up your cat's meals into several feeding times throughout the day. The continuous supply of food will help keep your cat's hunger satisfied and he won't roam around looking for food.
You could also try free feeding your cat. With this method, you simply fill your cat's bowl at the beginning of the day and allow him to eat whenever he wants. This could also help keep him satisfied so he doesn't roam. Closely monitor your cat's weight, however, since free access to food could make him overweight."

Try clicker training.,
Use treats as a reward.,
See if your cat responds to praise.",How to Get Your Cat to Stand Up1," Many cats respond to clicker training. This is a form of training where you use a clicker, a small store-bought device that makes a clicking sound when a button is pressed, which you can purchase at a local pet store. You teach your cat to associate the clicker with praise and rewards. When training your cat to perform a certain behavior, you would use the clicker as a way of telling your cat he's performing well.To help establish a positive connection with the clicking sound, start with treats. Choose a type of treat or food your cat likes. Then, break up that treat into small portions. Spend a few minutes each day clicking your clicker and immediately following the sound up with a treat.
With time, your cat will learn the clicker is used as a reward. When he hears the click, he will know good things are coming. You can use the sound of the clicker to reinforce positive behavior during training.;
, You can also used treats on their own as a reward. Many cats are willing to work for food as a prize. Before you begin training, however, take some time to figure out what kind of treats your cat likes. Cats have different tastes and your cat is unlikely to work for food he dislikes.You can experiment with a variety of store bought treats. If your cat favors a certain flavor of cat food, like tuna or salmon, he may respond well to a treat of that flavor.
You can also offer some human food to your cat as a reward, like small bits of deli turkey. However, avoid using dairy as a reward. Contrary to popular belief, dairy is not good for cats. It can cause indigestion and other stomach problems., Cats have different temperaments. While many cats tend to be more independent, some cats are more people-friendly and may work to win praise. See how your cat responds to petting and verbal praise. If your cat seems to enjoy being petted and talked to, that may be enough of a reward during the training process.

Get a clicker and target stick.,
Teach the cat to follow the stick.,
Pick a command.,
Guide the cat down when saying the command.",How to Keep Cats Off Furniture2," Cats can be trained to move on command using clicker training and a target stick. You can buy a clicker for training at a local pet shop. A target stick is simply a long stick you use to guide your cat on and off surfaces. You can use any long stick you want, such as a wooden rod you would buy at a craft store., To start, you want your cat to learn to follow the stick. Place the target stick near your cat's nose. As soon as it starts sniffing the stick, move the stick. If the cat follows the stick with their nose, click the clicker. Give the cat a reward, like a small treat. This will teach the cat it should follow the clicker stick to get rewarded.For a few days, spend short training intervals teaching your cat to follow the stick. Once your cat consistently follows the stick, you can train your cat to stay off furniture.

, Choose a command to use to get your cat off furniture. The command can be something like, ""No"" or ""Get off."" You want your cat to eventually jump off the furniture in response to this command., Each time you see your cat on the furniture, get your training stick. Say your command while guiding your cat off the furniture. Reward your cat with a small treat when they obey.If you consistently guide your cat off furniture each time you see them on a couch or counter, they will eventually respond to the command without the help of treats or a training stick.

Stay away from spray bottles.,
Make sure your cat has scratching posts.,
Give your cat room to play.,
Do not punish your cat.,
Play with your cat daily.",How to Keep Cats Off Furniture3," Many owners use a spray bottle to punish a cat when they get on furniture. However, spray bottles are unlikely to help much when training your cat. Your cat is unlikely to make the connection between the punishment and the behavior. A spray bottle also only succeeds in stressing your cat out. Stay away from spray bottles as a training tool., Cats need to scratch to keep their nails trim. Unwanted scratching and pawing is often the result of uncomfortably long claws or nails. Keep a scratching post in your home. This will give your cat an outlet to scratch and keep it off the furniture., Cats may take over areas like furniture if they don't have space of their own. Have a room in your home, or a corner in one of your rooms, where you keep your cat's toys, food, and bed. When you play with your, play in this area. If your cat feels it has its own space, it's less likely to invade yours., Punishing cats is rarely an effective means of keeping them off furniture. Yelling at your cat, or putting in its cage when it misbehaves, will only stress your cat out. Stick to positive reinforcement, like giving your cat a treat when they get down from furniture, over using punishment., Cats sometimes act out as a form of boredom. Make time each day to play with your cat to keep it active and entertained. The less bored your cat is, the less likely it is to resort to climbing on furniture for attention.Pick up some cat toys at your local pet store. Cats enjoy objects that are easy to bat around. They also tend to be attracted to noises. Pick up toys that do things like jingle, such as balls with bells in the them.
You can tie a toy to a string a drag it off the floor. You can also throw items for your cat to chase.

Avoid leaving any food out.,
Place lightweight cookie sheets on the edge of the table.,
Place plastic carpet runners on the table.,
Use double-sided tape on the table top.,
Investigate other commercially available deterrent devices.",How to Keep Cats off the Dinner Table2," An easy preventative measure to keep the cat off the table is to take away his reason to go up there. If your cat is roaming around because he's hungry, finding food on the table or counter will reinforce his reason for going up there. Don't leave any food out. That way, he'll learn that there's nothing to eat up there and may gradually stop going up on his own., Punishing the cat yourself when he goes up on the table probably won't get the desired result; he'll probably just end up afraid of you, not the table. Instead, make the environment punish him so he finds the area undesirable. One way to do this is with lightweight cookie sheets.Place the cookie sheets along the edge of the table. That way, when your cat jumps on the table, he'll knock them over. The resulting loud noise will startle your cat and he'll learn not to jump up on the table.

, These usually have plastic bumps on the bottoms to provide traction on a carpet. Place the runner upside down so these bumps are facing up. Your cat won't enjoy the sensation of walking on this and should gradually stop going on the table., Cats also don't like sticky sensations on their paws. A product called Sticky Paws serves this purpose. It is sticky enough to stay in place and get your cat's attention, but not so sticky that it will damage furniture or your cat's paws. Place this on your table to discourage your cat from venturing up there.Remember that if you don't use a specialized pet product, the tape might be too sticky and you could hurt your cat and damage your furniture. Always test out the tape before using it to make sure it's not too sticky.

, There are a few specialized deterrent devices available in pet stores. In addition to these do-it-yourself methods, you can look into some devices to help keep your cat off the table. Remember to use all devices as they are intended and ask your vet or a pet store employee if you need any suggestions.The Snappy Trainer acts like an upside down mouse trap, but is much weaker and won't hurt your cat. Any touch will cause the device to shoot up in the air, which will startle your cat and keep him off the table.
The SSSCAT is a motion sensing device that shoots out a blast of compressed air when tripped. This blast will scare your cat away from the table or anywhere else you don't want him to go.
The ScanMat is a plastic sheet that holds a static charge. When your cat steps on the sheet, he won't like the sensation of the electricity on his feet.

Get your cat's attention.,
Encourage standing.,
Reward the behavior when it occurs naturally.,
Be stricter about rewards over time.",How to Get Your Cat to Stand Up2," If you want to begin training your cat to stand, you'll first need to get your cat to pay attention to you. Use a treat to get your cat to focus. Then, you can begin training your cat to stand.Hold a treat in front of your cat's nose. This will allow him to smell the treat, grabbing his attention.
When your cat begins to sniff the treat, pull it up. Your cat will end up looking at you, giving you his attention.

, Find ways to encourage your cat to stand. Then, say a command, like ""Stand up,"" and reward the behavior.


You can keep pulling the treat up higher. If you need to, place the treat near the cat's nose again to get him more interested. He may follow the treat as you pull it away a second time. As soon as he stands up, say a command like, ""Stand!"" and give him the treat as a reward.
You can also use toys. Dangly toys, string toys, or toy mice can be held above your cat's head. As soon as he stands up to reach the toy, say the command and offer the reward.

, You want your cat to understand that you want him to stand up on cue. Pay attention to your cat during day-to-day activities. Cats may occasionally stand up on their hind legs if they're curious about something or trying to get your attention. Try to reward this behavior as it naturally occurs to help establish a connection between the desired behavior, a command, and a reward.


If you see your cat standing up, say a command. You can say something like, ""Stand up!"" or ""Beg."" Then, reward the behavior using your chosen method.

, At first, you can reward your cat for simply engaging in behaviors that are close to the desired behavior. For example, if your cat raises a paw, reward him. As time goes on, withhold treats until your cat completes the command. Do not give your cat a treat, praise, or press the clicker until he's standing with both paws in the air. This will help establish how you want your cat to behave and teach him to stand up on cue."
"
Do not punish a cat.,
Watch for negative body language.,
Avoid teaching this trick to cats with joint problems.",How to Get Your Cat to Stand Up3," Cats do not respond well to punishment. When punished, most cats get aggravated and simply disengage. Punishing a cat during training will end up alienating your cat. If a cat is scolded consistently over time, this can cause stress which can lead to litter box issues, compulsive grooming, and health problems. If your cat is not behaving, simply do not offer a reward. Avoid yelling at your cat, placing him in a cage, or any other form of punishment.Never hit or physically harm a cat as punishment. This causes your cat a lot of stress and lead to a bad relationship between you and your cat.

, You want to make sure you end training sessions on a high note. If training becomes stressful, your cat may refuse to behave. Watch for body language that indicates stress, fear, or aggression. If your cat seems upset, cut the training session short and try again the next day.If a cat's ears are held back slightly, he may be feeling scared or aggressive. Watch his eyes as well. Slightly dilated pupils tend to indicate fear while fully dilated pupils can indicate aggression.
A cat's tail can also be an indicator of mood. If the fur on the tail is standing up, your cat is likely angry or frightened. If your cat holds his tail low or tucks it between his legs, he's likely scared. A tail that's thrashing back and forth indicates anger and potential aggression.

, If your cat has existing joint problems, or is very overweight, avoid teaching him to stand. Standing up can put stress on your cat's joints, which may aggravate existing medical conditions.

Keep the cat active during day.,
Schedule a play session right before bed.,
Feed your cat a meal before bed.,
Put a perch near your bed.,
Let the cat explore the bed.,
Try a new cover on the bed.,
Reward the cat if it joins you in the night.,
Correct any negative behavior from your cat in bed.,
Do not reward your cat for waking you up.,
Address restless or noisy behavior at night.,
Take your cat to the vet if night meowing doesn't stop.",How to Get Your Cat to Sleep With You," An active cat during the day leads to a sleepy cat at night. Enrich your cat’s life with play sessions in the morning and when you get home from work, or a short walk around the block on a cat leash.You can also leave out toys the cat enjoys playing with on its own, but this should not replace bonding time.


Puzzle toys with treats inside are an enticing, stimulating option. Do not leave out toys with string, which the cat could choke on.
It is normal for adult cats to sleep 16 hours out of every 24, while kittens and old cats need even more sleep.Let them nap during the day as long as they are getting enough exercise as well.;
, Establish a nighttime routine with at least ten minutes of evening play. This will tire out your cat and, if you stick to a consistent schedule, teach the cat that this signals bedtime. Start with energetic play, but wind down with slower, calmer movements for the last few minutes.
Have a hyper kitten? Redirect its attention to a treat when it's time to stop roughhousing.Old cats still benefit from play, even if they need convincing. Use soft, slow-moving toys., Most cats will take a snooze after a big meal, so encourage sleep by feeding your cat right before you head to bed., Cats enjoy cozy, high perches where they can observe the room. Encourage the cat to sit there using treats if necessary, while you get into bed. This gets your cat comfortable with your nightly routine, one short step away from joining you in bed.If your cat has a cat bed or a favorite object to sleep on, move it onto the perch. Cats are notoriously picky about their sleeping arrangement, so yours might not follow, but it's worth a try.

, Your cat will have more positive associations with the bed if you leave it to make the decision. Lure your cat up with treats, or catnip if your pet responds to it.Praise your cat and give it another treat if it decides to spend time on the bed, but don't fuss or force it back on if it walks away. The cat's more likely to come round to your point of view if it doesn't associate the bed with annoying activities.

, Some cats are clean freaks, and more likely to sleep on a freshly washed blanket.Many others love the smell of their owner. If you've been keeping your sheets too clean for your cat, it might help to put yesterday's sweatshirt on the bed for your cat to play with or hide inside.

, Some cats are hesitant to fall asleep in the bed, but still explore it in the night. If your pet is like this, you could reward it with a treat when it shows up. Hide the treat under a pillow or in your pajama pocket for the cat to find on its own so you don't reward it for waking you up. Once the cat starts joining you in bed, gradually taper off the number of treats until your cat is back on a healthy diet:Consistency is key early on. Make sure it can get a treat every night. (Just don't give extras if it paws or meows, or you'll never get any sleep.)
Once it's in the habit, give a treat about ¾ of the time. On other nights, reward the cat with a head scritch or another enjoyable activity.
Gradually reduce the treats to once every other night, then once every three nights, and so on, until it's just a rare reward.

, Once you shut off your bedroom light and your cat settles into your bed, you may think you can both drift off to sleep. But cats can be skittish at night, even after a long play session before bed, and may playful swat your face, sit on your head, or meow to get attention. It’s important that you reinforce your status as the pet owner by correcting your cat after this behavior.This might mean sending your cat to the other side of the bed by saying “no” and moving your cat away from you. Or, you can send your cat to the corner by placing its carrier (or a preferred sleeping box or cat bed) in the corner of the bedroom. If the cat starts to act up when you are in bed, say “no” and point to the carrier. Continue to point until it goes into the carrier for a time out.

, If your cat wakes you up at any time, including the morning, do not feed it, play with it, or react in any way — not even by yelling at it or shutting it out. These responses teach your cat that waking you up is a successful way to get your attention.Instead, get out of bed when you want to, and spend at least fifteen minutes on other activities before giving your cat any food or attention. You may need to put a pillow over your ears through a few meow-filled mornings, but most cats will lose the habit if you stay firm.


An automatic feeder is an excellent solution to this problem, especially if the cat's accustomed to breakfast as soon as you get up. You can set it to dispense food at the time of the morning meal, or divide it into two or three smaller meals throughout the night if your cat begs for food in the night., If your cat keeps you awake by running or meowing at night, start looking for a solution immediately. If this behavior appears suddenly, take your cat to a vet to check for medical issues. Even if you think the cat is healthy, a quick response is important to prevent the bad habit from becoming permanent.A kitten that races around during the night needs more play during the day, ideally with another kitten. If your new kitten meows and doesn't want to cuddle you, provide a ticking clock wrapped in a blanket, plus a hot (but not too hot) water bottle.Most cats over the age of ten have some form of mental or sensory decline, which can interfere with sleep. Keep a regular daytime exercise schedule to help tire your cat out for a restful night. If your cat meows plaintively or soils the floor, you cat might be getting lost or scared due to deteriorating eyesight. Install night lights between your bed and the litter box., If your cat is very restless at night or cries and meows frequently, it's likely that your cat is stressed or experiencing pain from a medical issue. Bring the cat to a veterinarian for a checkup and discuss the situation."

If you adopt or befriend a cat during this timeframe, it is easier to develop a relationship with it.Make interaction positive. Cuddle, praise and play with the cat as much as it wants. Unless it compromises safety or wellness, avoid any and all situations that could create pain or negativity for the cat. Demonstrate to the cat that you are trustworthy and loving.;
, Cats are notoriously independent and aloof when they choose to be. Don’t view this as a sign that the cat dislikes you. If a cat chooses to be in the room with you, this means they are curious about you, even if they do not immediately approach.


Ignore the cat. When a cat you are not familiar with wanders into the room you are in, acknowledge it is there by looking briefly at it, but after that, ignore it and refrain from more than periodic, glancing eye contact.
Avoid staring. Sustained eye contact is construed as a threat to many animal species. When looking at a cat, if it looks back at you, look back then slowly blink your eyes a few times, then look away. By doing this, you are indicating you are non-threatening to the cat.Try sitting or laying on the floor. Humans are very tall when compared to cats. As a result, we can seem intimidating to them when we stand or sit on furniture and reach down toward them. To make yourself more approachable, consider sitting or laying in the floor while petting or playing. This can make the cat more comfortable.

, One way to interact with a shy but curious cat is to engage it in play.


Try a wand. Wands are great to use with a new cat friends because they provide distance between you and the cat while facilitating interaction. If a wand toy isn’t available, try a string or make your own with a piece of string or twine tied to a long stick.
Avoid rough housing. Humans are strong and huge from the perspective of a cat, which can trigger its instincts as a prey animal. When we rough house a cat, we can run the risk of frightening it or teaching it aggressive tendencies.
When playing with a cat, never grab, throw, pinch, or offer any other behavior that could be construed as threatening. Additionally, don’t tickle the belly, as this can trigger an attack response in even the calmest, sweetest kitty.

, Archaeologists tell us that the first domesticated cats became so because humans offered gifts of food or scraps that encouraged cats to live with them. The same offerings of food and treats can help cement cat bonding even with modern domesticated felines.Don’t give people food. Feeding cats people food can lead to negative behaviors like begging, food stealing, or scavenging kitchen scraps when your back is turned. Plus some human foods will upset a cat’s digestion and lead to food poisoning. Always feed foods and treats that are designed for consumption by cats.

, Animals have unique glands in the roof of their mouth that helps them both smell and identify people and other animals. The sensory areas in their nose track a different set of smell data. This means that, sometimes, a cats will both lick and sniff you to become acquainted.The licking can also be an allo-grooming behavior of affection.Don’t grab. Sniffing for a cat is an introduction. For example, when interacting with other people, it would be considered rude if someone asked for your name and you grabbed them in a hug. Don’t grab or hug a cat when it shows interest in your by sniffing.
Don’t move suddenly. Cats can be prey in the wild and have instincts to flee when a nearby larger animal moves suddenly. Avoid triggering this panic response, as it can make the cat skittish and jumpy when around people.

, Just because a cat is near you doesn’t mean that it is asking for you to pet it. Pay attention to the body and vocal language of the cat to note when petting and affection has been given the green-light.


Recognize encouraging behavior. Cats are demonstratively affectionate when they want food or petting. Below are some of the characteristics to look for:
Bunting: Bunting is when the cat nuzzles our hands or legs when it wants our attention. Cats have scent glands in their chin and the top of their head that they rub against people they like and want to claim.
Rubbing. Cats that want pets will often rub up against our legs or curl their tail around them, actually petting humans with their body.
Lap sitting. When a cat wants human companionship, they will often invite themselves to sit next to us or in our lap.
Stretching. Some cats engage in standing stretching, or stretching while laying on the ground as a show of relaxation and an encouragement to humans to give pets. Just remember that, even if it is showing, the belly is not a good place to start.
Chirping or barking. Cats do not vocalize with other cats frequently. They are, however, known to have complex vocal relationships to human caregivers. The cat is not actually using direct, lingual communication; however, it does learn how to use the right vocal tones and pitches to communicate its needs and attitudes toward humans., At all times when making friends with a cat, be sure the cat has access to a safe space where it can go if it feels tired, overwhelmed or frightened.


Don't pull or remove the cat from its safe space. When it goes there, it is telling you that it is overwhelmed and needs a break. Removing a cat from its safe space while it is frightened may mean that the cat will no longer believe it has a safe space, creating anxiety and possible acting-out behaviors like scratching or marking.
Don't corner or block the cat. Let the cat move freely throughout the house, even if you aren't entirely ready to be done interacting. Remember that letting the cat go now means it will return later so visit with you, instead of being afraid of you and refusing your friendship.

, “Feral” refers to cats that were socialized without human contact.


Pay attention to the cat’s condition and appearance. Disheveled or dirty looking cats are typically strays that have been abandoned and never learned how to clean properly outside of a home environment.
Do not approach feral cats directly. Feral cats were born out of doors and grew up apart from human socialization. In fact, they usually show no interest in human socialization, are fundamentally wild, and should be treated with the same caution exercised toward animals like foxes or raccoons, known to carry diseases like rabies., Stray and feral cats are scavengers. For this reason, they are likely to accept offerings of kibble or wet cat food if offered.


Put the food out when you see them. If the cat comes around, take the food out then. Using a soft voice to talk to the cat, set the food down in a safe, open area.
Give them space. After setting the food down, retreat at least 20 yards, possible more, so that the cat feels non-threatened. If the cat is interested in the food, you may see a kind of nodding movement, where the cat is sampling the smell of the food from the air.
If the cat approaches, continue talking to the cat in reassuring tones. Talk while it eats and watch its body language. Does the tail move gently and restfully or does it lay flat? Do the ears swivel or remain folded back against the head? If the body language shows in restful tail movements and the swiveling ears, the cat is paying attention to you, likely stray, and can be approached gradually over time.
Build a routine. If you put food out at around the same time each day, the cat will start to expect this behavior and even wait for you to put out the food. After several days, you can begin moving closer while the cat eats. Try decreasing distance by a couple of feet every feeding. If you reach a point where the cat seems evasive or unwilling to eat, slowly back up a few feet until it returns to the food.

, It is important to make sure outdoor cats are spayed or neutered to prevent any increase to the homeless pet population. Caging is often required to bring these cats into captivity to surgery. This is also a way of capturing a stray cat for adoption or medical attention.


Cages can be rented for a returnable deposit from the humane society or SPCA. Simply add food to the back of the cage and set in an area you know stray or feral cats frequent. Check back every 4 hours or the morning after setting the trap to see if a cat has been trapped.
Unless very sick, a feral cat will become extremely aggressive when caged and will require special handling, like gloves and a blanket to cover the cage.

, Stray cats are often that way because they were abused or abandoned by a prior owner. This means they are very likely to be afraid of humans.


Bringing a stray back around to human interaction can be a long process, depending on factors like age, the amount of time within a human home, and the nature of mistreatment it experienced.
Strays often become devoted to their caregivers but, because of their abandonment or mistreatment, never really come around to other humans who visit the home. It’s a good rule of thumb to prepare visitors for how to interact with the cat to avoid stress or misunderstanding for either party.

, Although their aloofness has bred a reputation for apathy and a lack of love, cats actually have the same chemical responses in their brain when they have positive interactions with people and other friendly animals and can build close bonds and attachments to humans and other cats.The love response is created by oxytocin, a chemical secreted by the brain when we experience strong attachment.

, Cats are intelligent enough to master vocalization with their human companion, provided humans pay attention.


What sounds does you cat make in response to various activities like feeding? Cuddling on the couch? Play time? When it wants to get in your lap? Note trends in vocalization to better understand what your cat is attempting to tell you.
Purring means different things. Science hasn’t completely nailed down why cats purr. We know mother cats do it when nursing. We also know that cats purr when they are happy. But cats also purr when they are attempting to calm themselves down, even when giving birth. When your cat purrs, take notice of the context and that can help explain the purpose of that specific purr.

, Tail up means “Hi! I’m feeling friendly.” Tail down means “I’m hunting, or not interested in interacting with you at the moment.” Staring means “I don’t know what to think about you, and I might be a little concerned.” Long, slow blinking means “I am comfortable around you. You are my friend.” Laying down on her side and stretching means “I’m relaxed and would like petting.” Laying down with ears back and a rigid posture means “I’m really frightened and will kick, scratch, or bite if you come closer.”There are some responses among cats that are universal; and yet, there are others that are specific to each feline. Some cats puff up slightly when they are feeling cuddly or excited about affection (this is normally a reaction associated with aggression and fear). Some cats will grab you lightly with their claws when they want to get your attention to be picked up, petted or fed (this can also be a sign of unhappiness or aggression). Be sure to pay attention to your specific cat and learn the nuances of his or her behavior.

, Cats consider a closed door to be a personal challenge. They will attempt to sneak in to sate curiosity. The same thing can be true of closed cabinets, drawers, closets, and other storage areas.


If the area is off limits because it is dangerous to the cat, install child locks or doorknobs that the cat cannot tug to open.
If the area is not dangerous but they don’t need to be there without supervision, try to give the cat regular, supervised time in the space to explore and demystify it. This will sate their curiosity and prevent them from darting in each time you open the door.
Think about your cats when you make life choices. Cats get bored and need stimulation that satisfies their natural instincts. Where you live, furniture you bring into the home, and the amount of window space can place a significant role in creating a cat-friendly environment. Below are some considerations to keep in mind:
Are you living in a place where a cat can reasonably sit in or look through a window? Cats will look for ways to get to windows where they can look outside, even to the detriment of drapes and objects of furniture required to vault to these spaces. Try to provide window seating for your cat, using either a window shelf or putting a piece of furniture under a window that the cats can rest on.
Can you arrange furniture and shelving to let your cats perch above a room? Cats in the wild climb trees when they want to nap safely or feel threatened. Put a tall scratching and play tower near a bookcase or window. If near a window, put shelving over the window that is reachable from the top tier of the cat tower. Now when the cat feels insecure or wants an out of the way place to nap, they can climb up to a high spot in the room and feel more confident., Cats are active, particularly at night, and will climb, run, and play throughout the house.


Is the couch you want in the kind of material that will do well with cats? Thin, easily scratched materials like microsuede or woven, easily picked materials like brocade can be quickly destroyed by active felines. Choose something like a duck canvas or velour, or get a couch cover for day-to-day use.
Do you have scratching posts? Cats have scent glands in their feet and are predisposed to scratching in high-traffic areas to remind other animals and people that they have a stake in this room. If you notice the cat scratching something it shouldn’t, put a scratching post in that area or consider rearranging the room so that the scratching post is located in a high-traffic area near a busy doorway. You can also put double-sided tape on the edges of furniture, etc. to prevent cats from scratching.

Preparing comfortable and clean spaces for your cat can help her relax and more readily accept you as her caregiver and “parent.”You may want to prepare a cozy bed for your cat. You can either buy a cushy pet bed or even make one yourself. Cats love boxes and making a bed out of a box with some blankets or towels in it may just be the trick. Consider putting something you wear in the bed to help her get used to your scent.
Make sure your kitty has a clean and new litter box.You may want to create a space where your kitty can play. For example, you could purchase a scratching post or have a box of toys she can chew and fetch that you put in an easily accessible area of your living room.Have another space designated for her food dishes. This can encourage her to eat in one place and lets her know that her meals will always be in the same place.;
, Your cat’s health relies in part on getting regular and healthy food. But you can also use her feedings to help establish your bond and help her love you.Consider feeding your kitty at the same time every day so that she gets into a routine and can approach you when the time(s) comes.Feed your cat a mixture of canned wet food, from which she can also get some moisture, and dry food. You can either mix these or put them in the different dishes.Give your kitty a bowl of water, too. Make sure to fill the dish with fresh and clean water every day.Many feline health professionals recommend feeding your cat at specific mealtimes as opposed to free feeding, which can make her gain weight.It’s best to not feed your cat table scraps, which can upset her stomach., If your cat is hesitant to come near you, place a cat treat on your hand, call her name, and let the cat eat it. This can show her that she can trust you and enjoy your company.


Be careful feeding your cat too many treats, which are often filled with sugar and can contribute to unhealthy weight gain. If you are concerned about this, consider giving her a taste of canned food instead., Cats are very sensitive to cleanliness, especially that of their litter box.Clean your cat’s litter box daily, or more if needed, to help keep her happy and healthy.Consider purchasing a new litter box whenever you get a new cat and make sure it is large enough for the size cat you have. This can minimize the risk that she smells another cat and doesn’t want to use the box.
Litter boxes that are not clean can be frightening to cats, undermining your attempts to get her to like you.Cats do not avoid the litter box out of spite. Instead, it’s a sign that something is wrong. Determine what the problem is and rectify it as soon as possible.The most common reasons cats won’t use a litter box are: the cat is not neutered; she is unhappy with something about the litter box such as size or type of litter; she is sick; she feels unsafe around other cats; she is stressed by something and marking her territory.If you cannot clean the litter box regularly, you may want to invest in an electronic litter box, which will automatically clean the litter as soon as your cat is finished using it. You can purchase these at most pet stores.

, A healthy cat is a happy cat, which will make her less likely to snap or dislike you. In addition to feeding and cleaning her litter box regularly, watch for signs of sickness or disease and visit your vet if something concerns you.


Not using the litter box can be a sign of a urinary tract infection, which will require that you visit the vet.
Like humans, dental issues can be serious and painful for cats. Watch for signs that eating is difficult for her including eating less, weight loss, or eating only on one side of her mouth.
Cats also need regular vaccinations against rabies, and distemper. Schedule an annual visit with your vet to get these vaccinations and have your cat’s overall health checked.

, Just like humans, there are times when it’s best to give your cat some space. Allowing him to clean or sleep in peace can help him trust and like you and forge a strong bond.Avoid moving, petting, or playing with your cat when he is washing himself, eating, drinking, or sleeping. Doing so may scare, stress, or annoy him, which could result in an unpleasant reaction., Always be gentle and loving with your cat. This demonstrates to him that he can trust you and may make him more likely to approach and seek out quality time with you.


Always pet and pick him up softly, keeping in mind that he is a lot smaller than you are.
Never squeeze your cat or pull his tail.

, Although you might be tempted to show your kitty love by following him and picking her up, this often goes against cat behavior. Allow your cat your approach you whenever he wants to help him relax and feel comfortable getting your attention.You can teach your cat to come when you call him—for food or otherwise—with simple training methods.Never chase your cat or use a loud voice with him. This can scare him not only in the moment, but also in the future.
If your cat doesn’t seem to want to come to you, try enticing him with a treat or some catnip., If you squat, lie, or kneel down to the same level as your cat, you may appear less threatening. This may make him feel more relaxed in your presence and more likely to form a strong relationship with you.


You may find that lying down on the floor helps draw him to you.
Sitting on the sofa or in a chair may also be another way to get your cat to comfortably approach you.Since cats like to watch other small animals, consider lying or sitting near a window, which can provide him entertainment and give you the option of petting him while he perches., Cats are very alert and observant, which requires them to frequently hold up their heads. Pet and stroke your cat as he likes to relax her and help him to like you more.You can massage your cat’s neck or any other area that he might like such as his back, under his chin, or even his belly.
With time, you will recognize the spots on which your cat likes to be stroked and petted and you may find that he seeks you out for this.
Make sure to always be gentle when petting your cat.
Pet your cat as a reward for doing something good such as using his litter box. You may even want to offer occasional pats as you place his newly-filled food dish on the floor.
If you want to pet your cat and he is reluctant, just hold your hand out and let him sniff it. He might rub his cheek on your hand and feel more comfortable with you petting him at that juncture.
If your cat likes, allow him to fall asleep on you as you pet him.

, One of the best ways to get your cat to like you is by showing affection beyond basic care. Petting, stroking, and playing with him helps form a bond of trust and love between you and your cat. Some typical ways your cat will show affection that you can reciprocate are:


Bumping heads. This is the way a cat says hello. It stimulates the oil glands in the front of his ears, leaving his scent on you. If he bumps your head, bump him back gently.
Presenting his butt. Your cat may back up to your face and lift his tail. This means he wants you, his parent, to clean him. You can reciprocate by blowing gently at his bum, which he will associate with you and your cleaning style.
Kneading you. This is a sign that your cat is happy and associates you with his mother. Allow him to knead as much as he likes to help him relax and forge your bond.
Licking you. Grooming is one way that cats establish a common scent among their clan. Licking allows him to claim you as his own and may help further promote your relationship., It’s important that your cat knows his name, so talk to him often and refer to him by name. If he meows, talk back to her. This can make your cat happy and more likely to seek you out when he wants attention.For example, if it’s close to your cat’s mealtime and he starts to meow, you can say “Are you hungry, Sam?” and carry on the conversation as long as he continues to meow.

, Cats are naturally energetic and require enrichment through play to stay happy and healthy. Playing with your cat and providing him with toys to stimulate him can help him stay happy and get him to like you more.Give your cat a variety of toys including ones that he can throw himself, ones that require your interaction, and others that give him the opportunity to “hunt.”Most pet stores will offer different types of toys to stimulate your cat.
When using toys that require interaction with you, such as wiggling or dangling options, talk to your cat and offer him pats for playing well.Give your cat other opportunities to play, too. Place paper bags without the handles or boxes around the house, which will allow him to explore and investigate.Create a “cat tree” near a window that allows your cat to watch birds, squirrels and other small animals."

Use the right treats.,
Calm your cat.,
Teach him his name.,
Use treat training.,
Be patient.,
Keep it short.,
Try clicker training.,
Try more advanced tricks.",How to Make a Hyper Cat Sit," The key to training a cat to sit is to find the treat that he finds the tastiest. This will vary depending on the cat. It can range from small cubes of chicken to small flakes of canned tuna to commercially made treats. In general, cats love human foods high in protein the most.


You can also try prawns, steak, and cheese as possible treats for your cat. These are popular treats as well. ;
, Before you can begin a training session, you need to burn off some of your hyper cat’s excess energy. Plan to spend 15 minutes playing rambunctious games with him to help him lose some of the energy. Try games such as chase, which can be done with a laser pointer, or keep away with a feather toy. You can also try going up or down the stairs inside your home dragging your cat’s favorite toy behind you. He will stalk and pounce on it and chase after you.


After your cat starts to slow down, he should be able to concentrate on a training session., Before you can teach your cat to sit, your cat needs to know his name. To teach him to come when you call his name, you can use a training technique with treats. Make sure to keep treats on you, either in a small plastic container or a zip topped bag. When your cat is in the same room as you, get his attention with a small treat in your hand. When he sees the treat, say his name as he comes over. When he gets to you, reward him with the treat.


Do this until he is consistently coming to you when you say his name.
Slowly phase out the treats. Replace it with praise and attention when he comes to his name., Once you have tired your cat out and found the right treats, you can teach him to sit with treats. Begin by sitting in front of your cat with a treat in your hand. He should be standing on all fours to best teach him to sit, so try to get him into this position if he doesn’t naturally do so. Let him see the treat in your hand, then hold the treat two or three inches above his head. Slowly move it back between his ears, rubbing it slightly against his head. In order to follow the treat, he will follow your hand and begin to sit.


As he does, tell him “sit .” Immediately after he does, say “good, sit” and give him the treat.
This may take a few tries to get right. Make sure you aren’t holding the treat too far above his head at first either. This will cause him to jump up instead of leaning back, which can teach him the wrong thing., Your cat will not learn this overnight or after one try. It will probably take anywhere from seven to 14 training sessions until your cat understands that the motion above his head and the word “sit” means to sit down. With patience, persistence and consistency in training, your cat will soon be sitting like a pro., Your cat will get distracted if you train too long, especially if he is hyper by nature. To this end, make sure you keep the training sessions short. Five to 10 minutes is long enough for kittens or hyper cats.


Practicing for too long can make your cat aggravated, which may cause him to bite or scratch you.
When you feed your cat treats, only feed him very small amounts as treats. A small sliver half the size of your pinkie finger thumbnail is plenty to give him. This way, he won’t fill up during your short training sessions and won’t over eat., In addition to treat training, you can also try the clicker training method. For this method, you need to buy a small hand held clicker, which you can get at pet stores or online. To start clicker training, you get your cat to associate the clicks with treats. To start this, produce a click and random and then give your cat a treat. He will start to realize that the click sound means a treat.


Keep doing it until he understands. You’ll know he understands when you click and he starts looking at you or running to you for a treat. Once this happens, begin the treat training routine, which will be easier with the help of the clicker.Clickers become a powerful tool for pet training. Your cat will know that once he hears a click, he is doing something right. So when you treat train, click the clicker the moment your cat sits, then give him a treat. He then associated the click with correct behavior, which will translate into sitting for your without the help of the clicker., Many hyper cats are simply bored cats. After you’ve taught him to sit, you can continue with other tricks. Do this by taking his clicker training to a higher level by training. You can do more elaborate things, such as teaching your cat to follow a target, such as a toy.


You can also teach him to follow the target through an obstacle course such as cat tunnels and to jump over low lying obstacles."

If your cat does or you're worried about your cat scratching or biting you, this is usually because they have energy to burn.",How to Gain a Cat's Trust," You won't be able to force your cat to do anything, let alone to trust you. Instead, the cat has to be convinced that she'll benefit from an action. For example, maybe she'll give up her nap if you offer her her favorite treat. Don't be offended if she decides not to be persuaded. By nature, cats often choose to remain aloof or unpredictable.Your cat will have a harder time accepting you if you're chaotic and noisy. Cats dislike stress, noise, or a lot of activity. Your cat will accept you faster if you're calm and relaxed around her.;
, A good way to make your cat comfortable is to give the cat their own space. A comfortable, warm place to sleep, eat, play and excrete/urinate. Another point is to look in pet stores and maybe even ask staff about cat shelves. These can be nailed to a wall in whatever position suits you and your cat so they have somewhere to look over the room and feel safe up there.

, There will be times when your cat feels insecure, scared, or anxious. Give her plenty of hiding places to go to when feeling frightened, like a closet or spot under the bed. It's fine to know where her hiding place is, but don't force your cat out of it unless you absolutely have to. You should also make sure your cat can access high perches (like window ledges, furniture, or a high cat scratch platform) and toys for when she's bored and wants to look around or play.


Immediately creating a safe and secure place is important. If you're trying to gain the trust of a new cat, keep her in one room so she can get familiar with her territory without feeling overwhelmed.You should also take care to set the litter box in a private corner of the room. It should be away from anything noisy, like a dryer) and she should feel protected when she uses it (the 2 walls will offer this protection if it's in a corner).

, Feed your cat on a regular basis so she understands that you provide food and shelter. When you set the food down, talk in a soft sing-song voice so she starts recognizing your voice and associating it with something positive, like mealtime. When your cat comes over to eat, back up and give her plenty of space. If you'd like to keep her company, sit down on the floor so you aren't towering over her, which could intimidate her.


Make sure your cat can easily get to the food and water dishes. If she's shy, set them within reach of her hiding place, so she doesn't feel too traumatized or stressed by going out to get them.

, Your cat may have trouble relaxing or feeling calm in a new environment. You can purchase a synthetic cat pheromone product (like Feliway) to diffuse in the room. This is a synthetic version of the chemical messengers a mother cat gives off to make her kittens feel safe and secure. The pheromone can reduce overall stress and can help the new cat settle in faster.You might also consider getting your cat used to your scent as something familiar. This will help her recognize you when you start to make physical contact. For example, you might try letting your cat sleep with one of your old T-shirts that has your scent on it., A cat might be frightened of its new surroundings, regardless of how cozy you've made it. This is especially true if the cat was abused or neglected. Never yell at the cat when you notice her doing something she shouldn't. Chances are, she's just exploring her new environment. Instead, use a calm soothing voice to praise her for any good behavior she shows.


If your cat still seems frightened of her new surroundings, make sure that you're not scaring her. Never sneak up on your cat or make sudden movements that may catch her off guard. Cats that have been abused are more likely to be skittish, when you surprise them., Always let your cat come to you, rather than approach her. If you clearly see that your cat appears tense and is watching you intently (standing, tail stiff, pupils dilated), do nothing. Sit very still, preferably with your eyes closed. You'll be less of a threat this way and the cat will get used to your presence. On the other hand, if your cat is ready for contact, she may:Stay in your sight after she finishes eating, instead of running for cover
Take a few steps towards you
Sit near you and wash (which shows she's relaxed)
Sit with her back to you (which shows she trusts you)

, There are several ways you can appear less intimidating and make your cat feel more comfortable. Lie down, if space allows. Being on her level keeps you from towering over her. Avoid eye contact, since direct eye contact is a challenge or threat display in cat language.Instead, turn your head aside and look away.


If you wear glasses, you may even want to take them off since the lenses can look like large eyes to cats. This may look like a threat.

, Don't feel like you have to rush things. Eventually, your cat will begin trusting and approaching you. When this happens on a regular basis, the cat will then voluntarily bump her head against your hand or body. This bumping puts her scent onto you and shows that she's accepting you.


You can encourage your cat to come closer to you by offering tasty treats. Rest your arm on the floor and scatter a few treats around you. Let the cat pluck up courage to come and eat the treats. Gradually, set treats closer to you so she can approach without feeling threatened.

, Allow them to play or eat near each other. Of course, this will be a whole other process as you will have to start from a longer distance and move them closer each day. Of course it would be helpful to have someone else involved in this.

, When your cat signals (by bumping her head against you) that she's ready for more contact, you can rub her ears or chin. Take it slowly and start by just extending a single finger to rub her. Don't make any sudden movements, and as her confidence builds, you can scratch her chin.Avoid rough-housing, since cats don't like it.

, When your cat starts approaching you regularly and purrs when you cuddle her, you can stop lying down around her. Sit up and cuddle her. She may even start to sit on your lap, which shows she completely trusts you.


Make playtime a regular part of your daily routine. This will strengthen your cat's bond towards you and she'll expect this attention from you. Studies have also shown health benefits for humans (such as lowered cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and less anxiety) from touching and talking with pets., This is especially important if you're rehabilitating a cat that has been abused or neglected. You may find yourself cautiously petting the cat, when all of a sudden, she bites you. This, along with surprise scratching, might mean that your cat is overwhelmed by the physical contact or affection. Give the cat some time on her own to calm down, since she's probably surprised too. Next time, avoid petting her for as long.Never punish the cat by yelling or hitting. Cats won't understand why you're hurting them. Instead, remove yourself from the situation for a while.

, So always play with them at least once a day. A good time to do this is before you go to bed. This burns their energy which will help them associate that time of night with winding down and going to sleep just as you do.

Do all of the following when the kitten is in a good mood.,
Handle the kitten's paws a lot.,
Rub the kitten's belly often.,
Encourage the kitten to use a scratching post.,
Hold the kitten often.,
Have a wide variety of people handle the kitten.",How to Establish Good Habits in a Kitten," Do not try to force a kitten to do anything when it's scared or startled.;
, This will make it easier to trim the cat's nails later on. Touch, hold, and squeeze the paws often. Put the kitten in nail-cutting position and pretend to clip its nails, so the kitten gets used to having to be in this position for the required amount of time and doesn't fight it when it gets older.

, Many adult cats don't like having their bellies touched, and might claw or nip at strangers who come too close. If you get the kitten used to having its belly rubbed a lot, though, it's more likely that the cat will enjoy being pet there later. A hyper kitten won't particularly like being put on its back and having its belly rubbed, but it won't fight it aggressively, either, and will probably start to enjoy the attention.

, Those little claws can't do much damage yet, but now is a good time to teach the kitten to use a post. Spend a lot of time near the post (which should stay in one place) and gently put the kitten's paws on the post occasionally.

, Many cats are uncomfortable being held, but a kitten will tolerate it quite well, so this is a great time to get it used to the feeling of being held.

, Many cats learn to be wonderfully friendly, but only to their caretakers. If you get your kitten used to being around other people, it won't be as skittish later in life. Most people are eager to play with fluffy kittens anyway. Ideally, have them do the above steps as well.

Choose a high-quality cat food.,
Develop a regular feeding schedule.,
Provide plenty of fresh, clean water.,
Give your Maine Coon treats.",How to Care for Maine Coons1," Maine Coons require a high-quality cat food to stay healthy. Choose a brand name cat food that is meant for cats. If your Main Coon has any special dietary needs that your veterinarian has identified, then make sure that the food you select meets those needs. For example, if your Maine Coon is overweight, then your veterinarian may recommend feeding him food that is meant for overweight cats.


If you are not sure if a food is considered high-quality, then ask your veterinarian.
When choosing food for your cat, look for taurine in the ingredients list. Taurine is an essential amino acid that cats require. Not getting enough Taurine or other required nutrients may result in heart and eye problems.;
, Cat food packages list the amount of food that you should give your cat each day. You can use this amount to help you develop a regular feeding schedule. Divide the total amount of food that your Maine Coon is supposed to eat per day into two portions. Then, feed these portions to your cat about eight to twelve hours apart.For example, you might give your cat her breakfast at about 7:00am and then give her dinner at around 6:00pm.
Since cats prefer smaller meals, feeding your cat her daily food intake in two separate meals will make it more likely that she will eat all of her food., Maine Coons need to have access to a source of fresh, clean water at all times. Make sure that you clean your cat’s water dish daily and keep it filled with clean fresh water at all times.Do not place your cat’s food and water bowls near a litter box. Cats do not like to eat and drink near their litter boxes.

, Treats provide your Maine Coon with a little reward now and then, so it is nice to keep some cat treats on hand. Just make sure that you do not give your Maine Coon too many treats or he may become overweight or obese. Try to limit treats to about 5% of your Maine Coon’s daily intake.
Look for treats that can help to clean your cat's teeth as she chews. These treats can help to maintain your cat's dental health along with regular tooth brushing.

Choose a breeder.,
Know when to adopt the kitten.,
Vaccinate your cat.,
Neuter or spay your cat.,
Get your cat dewormed.,
Be aware of breed specific diseases.,
Consider making your Egyptian Mau your only pet.",How to Care for Egyptian Maus1," The Egyptian Mau is an unusual breed, and many breeders have waiting lists for their kittens. However, do not let this pressure you into buying a kitten from a disreputable breeder. Wait until good quality kittens that are well-socialized are available.


Find a breeder who is also a cat lover. This means they are more likely to treat their breeding stock like pets, which means better socialization for the kittens as they are more likely to be raised in the home, rather than outdoors in runs.Avoid breeders who keep their breeding stock in outdoor runs, since this means they are less well socialized.
Never buy a Egyptian Mau without seeing the mother. This might seem tempting if there are no local breeders and you find one willing to meet you halfway with the kitten. However, this is a sign of unscrupulous breeding since no serious breeder would stress their kitten this way on the off chance of making a sale.;
, Most kittens can be adopted from around nine weeks of age. Be suspicious of anyone wishing to home kittens at less than eight weeks, as they are unlikely to have the kitten's best interest at heart., You should vaccinate your Egyptian Mau against common infectious diseases, such as cat flu, feline infectious enteritis, and feline leukemia virus. You should also vaccinate against rabies.The initial kitten vaccinations require two doses to be effective, given from nine weeks of age and given three to four weeks apart.
The rabies vaccine is a single dose which is given from 12 weeks of age.
Make sure to get your cat booster injections, usually given once a year.

, Your Egyptian Mau cat should be neutered or spayed unless you intend to breed from them. The most common age is around five to six months.When you have your cat neutered or spayed, it is also a great time to have an microchip fitted. ID chips are a permanent way of identifying your cat.

, Other preventative health care includes parasite control and deworming. You need to get a flea medication for your cat. Deworming is an important part of keeping your Egyptian Mau cat healthy. Typically this should be done every three months.A good broad spectrum multi wormer tablet will get rid of round, tape, and hookworms.

, The only listed problem for an Egyptian Mau is a rare condition known as Leukodystrophy or ""Krabbe's"" disease. The disease leads to a deterioration in nerve function, commonly to the limb muscles, leading to weakness, poor coordination, and the inability to stand. There is no treatment or cure, so euthanasia of affected cats is recommended.The first signs can appear as young as seven weeks of age and progress rapidly so the kitten can be severely disabled at just a few months old.

, Egyptian Maus are very loyal and form strong bonds with their owners. However, the breed does not generally do well with other animals. This breed is great if you only want one cat."

Feed your cat two or three meals a day.,
Feed your cat a mix of wet food and dry food.,
Keep out a constant supply of water.,
Give out treats in moderation!",How to Care for Long Haired Cats1," Don't leave out a constant supply of food. Your cat may be tempted to eat too much, which can lead to obesity and other health problems.;
, This will ensure your cat will get all the proper nutrients. You can, however, feed your cat only one type of food if you choose.


If you feed him dry food, make sure you give your cat plenty of water.

, Your cat needs to stay well hydrated!


Change daily and when your cat runs out.
If it's hot out, put some ice in the water dish. Cats get hot too, especially longhair cats!

, At most, your cat should receive two small handfuls of treats a day.

Brush your Maine Coon’s fur daily.,
Trim your Maine Coon’s claws.,
Clean your Maine Coon’s teeth.,
Give your Maine Coon a bath if necessary.",How to Care for Maine Coons2," Maine Coons have thick coats that require some care to maintain. Their coats are oilier than most cats’ coats, so they do not require as much grooming as other long haired breeds, but they still need occasional grooming.Try to brush your Maine Coon once per week to keep his coat tangle-free.


Most Maine Coons do well with brushing, but it is a good idea to start brushing early to ensure that your Maine Coon will tolerate it.
To brush your Maine Coon, use a stainless steel comb and run it over your cat’s entire body. Give special attention to your cat’s tummy and tail because these can become matted more easily than other parts of your cat’s body.

, Your Maine Coon can wear down his claws somewhat by scratching and moving around, but he may still need a trim now and then. To keep your Maine Coon’s claws from becoming too long, you will need to trim them about once every three weeks.When you trim your Maine Coon’s claws, trim the white tips only. Do not trim the pink part of your cat’s claws further down the claw.
Do not use scissors to trim your Maine Coon’s claws. Use a special guillotine style pet nail trimmer.If you would rather not trim your cat’s nails yourself, then you can also take your cat to the veterinarian or groomer for a trim.

, Cats are prone to dental problems just like humans, so regular brushing is essential. Brush your Maine Coon’s teeth once per day to keep her teeth healthy. Make sure that you use a special cat toothbrush and toothpaste on your Maine Coon.Never use human toothpaste on your cat. Human toothpaste contains fluoride, which is toxic to cats.

, Maine Coons are more tolerant of water than most other cat breeds. In fact, some Maine Coons even enjoy the water, so bathing your Maine Coon now and then should not be too difficult.


Maine Coons do not need regular baths, but if your Maine Coon ever becomes dirty and requires a bath, then you should give her one.

Spend lots of time with your Maine Coon.,
Give your Maine Coon some mouse-like toys.,
Put up some scratching posts.,
Keep a couple of litter boxes for your Maine Coon.",How to Care for Maine Coons3," Maine Coons love to be around people, so you will need to make sure that you can accommodate your Maine Coon’s social needs. Your Maine Coon may even try to follow you around the house and participate in your daily routine.Try to set aside some time to just sit and pet your Maine Coon every day.
Most Maine Coons are not fond of sitting on laps. Your Maine Coon may prefer to sit next to you while you pet her., Maine Coons are well-known for their excellent mouse catching skills, so try to provide your Maine Coon with toys that will stimulate these skills.Try sticking to toys that stay low to the ground. Some good possible toy choices for your Maine Coon include:


fur mice
crinkly ball toys
jingle ball toys
electronic mouse toys
a laser pointer aimed at the ground

, Cats need their claws and they also need to scratch. The problem is that sometimes cats will try to scratch things that they should not scratch. To prevent your Maine Coon from scratching things he shouldn’t, provide some scratching posts for your Maine Coon.Corrugated cardboard and rope-wrapped wooden posts make great scratching posts. Try placing a few of these around your house.
If you catch your Maine Coon scratching something he shouldn’t, do not yell at him or hit him. Just gently pick him up and take him over to one of his scratching posts.
Try rubbing a catnip on your Maine Coon’s scratching posts. This may attract him to the posts and make him more likely to use them.

, Your Maine Coon should always have access to clean litter boxes. Fill up the boxes with two inches of fine-grained, clay, clumping cat litter. Scoop out the litter boxes daily and change the litter at least once per week.Always make sure that you have one more litter box than your total number of cats. For example, if you have three cats, then you need to have four litter boxes.
Cats can learn how to use a litter box if you show them where the box is located. After you get your Maine Coon, take her to the litter box so she will know where to find it.

Take your Maine Coon for regular veterinary checkups.,
Spay or neuter your Maine Coon.,
Watch for breed-specific health problems.",How to Care for Maine Coons4," Maine Coons need vaccinations and regular checkups just like all other cats do. When you first get your Maine Coon, you will need to take her to see a veterinarian as soon as possible. During her first veterinary visit, your cat will have a physical exam and get tested for feline leukemia as well.


To keep your Maine Coon in good health, you will need to schedule an annual appointment for your Maine Coon and also take her to the veterinarian if you ever notice a problem., If you are not planning to breed your Maine Coon, then have your cat spayed or neutered to prevent unwanted kittens and protect your cat’s health. Spaying and neutering your pets helps to prevent pet homelessness and it also offers some health benefits for your Maine Coon, so your pet may live a longer, healthier life.Spaying and neutering prevents hormonal behavioral issues and may also protect your cat from some health issues, such as uterine infections, enlarged prostate, and some forms of cancer., Maine Coons tend to be quite healthy, but they are more prone to a few conditions than some other cat breeds. Some of the conditions that you and your veterinarian will need to watch for include:Spinal Muscular Atrophy. This condition is a type of paralysis that occurs mostly in Maine Coon kittens. If you notice that your Maine Coon is having trouble using his rear legs, then take him to see your veterinarian right away.

Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. This is a thickening of the heart wall. Your veterinarian will need to perform regular heart exams to monitor the condition of your Maine Coon’s heart.

Polycystic Kidney Disease. With this condition, cysts form in the kidney and destroy the organ. The condition can be detected with a DNA test or ultrasound.

Hip Dysplasia. This is a type of arthritis in your cat’s hips. Watch your Maine Coon for signs that she is having trouble walking or jumping. If you notice that she is avoiding doing these things or showing signs of pain (yowling or hiding), then take her to see your veterinarian.

Feed your cat quality food.,
Keep your cat from being overweight.,
Brush your cat’s coat.,
Trim your cat’s nails.,
Brush your cat’s teeth.,
Keep your Egyptian Mau warm.",How to Care for Egyptian Maus2," Feed your Egyptian Mau a good quality, protein rich food. This means that meat is listed first and second on the pet food label.Avoid foods that are heavy on carbohydrates and have grains or cereals listed as a main ingredient.

, It is important your Egyptian Mau doesn't become overweight. This will predispose her to health problems such as diabetes or arthritis.Monitor your cat's weight and be alert for weight gain, reducing her portion size accordingly.


Each cat has a different frame size, so it's not helpful to give a suggested weight. Instead, make sure you can feel your Egyptian Mau's ribs easily, but they aren't staring out through the coat. A good guide is to think how it feels when you run your fingertips over the back of your closed fingers. That kind of gentle bump is how your cat's ribs should feel.

, The Egyptian Mau’s coat is easy to care for, but it does benefit from daily to weekly brushing.This helps to remove shed hair, which reduces the risk of the cat ingesting that hair and having furballs. Regular brushing also helps spread the natural oils over the hair, which adds to the satin-gleam that is associated with the breed.

, Trim your cat’s nails once every two weeks. This helps keep them from being too sharp and catching on your carpet or furniture.If you aren't confident how much to clip away then it's a good idea to have a groomer or vet tech show you how to this.

, Get into the habit of brushing your Egyptian Mau's teeth. This is best done by introducing the toothbrush to the cat as a toy, so she gets used to it. Teach her each step of the brushing process, and allow her to become comfortable with each step before progressing onto the next.Start by lifting her lip, then touching the brush to her teeth, then wetting the brush with water and wiping it up and down, then adding a blob of cat-toothpaste onto the brush.
Never use human toothpaste as the high fluoride content is toxic to cats if swallowed.

, Egyptian Mau’s like to be warm, so they do better in warmer climates. Their fur insulates them, but they prefer a warm cosy house. This means they need to be inside cats. If you live in a cold climate, make sure you keep your cat warm."

Socialize your cat.,
Provide your cat with a lot of attention.,
Provide your cat with the proper toys.,
Provide your cat with chase toys.,
Play with your cat often.",How to Care for Egyptian Maus3," Egyptian Maus can be very shy and reserved. Because of this, your cat may not like anyone outside of her family. She may also be startled by sudden noises or movements. To help with this, make sure to socialize your cat so she gets used to being around people., Egyptian Maus want to be with people. If you are looking for a sofa cat that will leave you in peace, then think twice before getting a Mau. Your Egyptian Mau is liable to follow you around like a shadow. A Mau is going to want to play with you and ride around on your shoulder, so be sure that level of interaction is something you can provide., Egyptian Maus are extremely intelligent cats. Because of this, give you Egyptian Maus puzzle toys that challenge her, provide her with mental stimulation, and offer rewards like treats when she figures them out.Because of how intelligent your Egyptian Mau is, you can also teach her how to perform tricks.

, Egyptian Maus love to hunt and pounce, so let her play with things to chase. This can include a variety of toys, such as such as wings-on-strings., Egyptian Maus are inquisitive and interactive, and so regular play sessions are essential for your cat to feel happy and fulfilled.Play with your Mau at least twice a day, for 10 to 20 minutes.


Be patient during play because cats are sprinters and will play in a burst, stop to recover, then play again. Don't think because she stopped to pant the game is over. She's just catching her breath before she is ready to go round again.

Take your cat to the vet at least once a year for a checkup.,
Give your cat a flea collar or flea treatment, especially if he goes outdoors.

,
Give your cat at-home health checks.,
Help your cat exercise.,
Try to brush your cat's teeth daily.",How to Care for Long Haired Cats2," That way, your cat will get any needed vaccines, as well as getting checked for any underlying conditions.

,,


Make sure your cat's eyes are clear and bright, and don't have any goop coming out of them.
Whenever your cat comes indoors, if he is outdoor, run your hands over his fur and check for ticks. If you feel a bump, check it out. If it is in fact a tick, remove it.
Look at the ears. They should be pink with no goo and no odor.
Watch your cat. Make sure he doesn't limp.

If your cat does not pass your home health check, take him to the vet.



,


If you can, take him on walks.

Buy your cat a variety of toys, such as fishing rod toys, fake mice, and laser pointers.

Play with your cat daily.



, If your cat's teeth weren't brushed as a kitten, your cat may hate it and scratch you. If your cat scratches you or bites you when you try to brush his teeth, give him a FEW tartar control treats a day.

Brush your cat daily.,
Choose the right brush.,
Shampoo your cat once a month.,
Untangle knots as soon as you see them.,
Trim your cat's nails.,
Take your cat to the groomer.",How to Care for Long Haired Cats3," Longhair cats have more fur, and it's longer, too, and therefore needs to brushed more often than regular cats.

, Pin or wire brushes are a great choice for longhair cats, since they are stronger and can untangle knots easier.

, If your cat likes baths, give him a bath. If he hates baths, sprinkle him with some dry shampoo.

, Because longhair cats' fur is more susceptible to tangling, knots will quickly become worse.

, Nails that are too long will be more likely to get caught in things, as well as make it hard to walk if they get really long.

, Seem like too much work? Take your cat to a groomer! The groomer will know what she's doing, and you won't have to deal with a bath-hating cat or your cat running away when he sees the brush!

Think of your and your cat's safety first.,
Use a calm voice and calm behavior.,
Lure the cat towards you.,
Move the cat into isolation if it is still upset.",How to Calm a Cat1," Only approach the cat if it is necessary to do so, such as a trip to the vet. The majority of agitated cats benefit from being left in peace, rather than being petted or picked up. If you do have to approach the cat, the very first thing you need to do when your cat is upset is to protect yourself and then the cat. Scared or aroused cats can and will bite their owners and they will scratch. This displaced aggression means your cat is so upset that it will bite or scratch anyone handy if it cannot get at the object or thing making it upset.


It is imperative that you approach your upset cat with extreme caution.
Approach the cat cautiously, preferably wearing long sleeves and pants.
Have a towel handy in case you need to catch your cat.;
, Talk to your cat calmly. For example, say ""It's okay, Peaches, it's okay. Shh. Shh."" Sit quietly and wait for your cat to calm down, and let it realize you mean it no harm and don't pose a threat.Speak quietly and in a lower pitched voice.
Singing can soothe or relax your cat, much like talking quietly. Singing anything from an upbeat song to a slow melody can work. Just don't sing loudly, harshly, or anything with rapidly changing pitches.
Play something softly on the TV.

, Feed your cat some food if it is still skittish. Wet food is usually more appealing to cats than dry food and fish has an even greater odor than meat.


Let the cat climb to a higher place to allow it to feel safe and able to see what is going on.
If possible, stroke the cat's face by running your thumb lightly up from the bridge of the cat's nose.

, Placing the cat in a confined space where it can be alone should help it to calm itself down.Close all doors to the area your cat is in, close shades, blinds, or drapes on windows so it cannot see outside. Remove children and other pets from the area as well. The aim is to provide a calm, non-threatening environment so that cat's anxiety levels fall.


To move the cat to a room it can be alone in, wrap the cat in a towel snuggly with only its head sticking out, much like a burrito. Then you can place it in a quiet room, like a bedroom, along with access to a litter box, until it is calm once more.

Observe where your cat likes to sleep.,
Place the bed in a low traffic area.,
Give your cat a good view.,
Elevate the bed or go with a perch if your cat likes height.,
Try a new spot if your cat ignores its bed.",How to Encourage a Cat to Use Its Bed1," Paying attention to where your cat likes to sleep will help you find a good spot for its bed. Most cats like to sleep in warm areas that offer safety and seclusion but still offer a good vantage point.If you notice your cat likes to sleep in a specific spot, try placing the bed at or nearby that location first.;
, Cats prefer to maintain some personal space, so go with a quiet location away from your home’s main thoroughfares. In high traffic areas, your cat will feel like it's always visible and won’t want to rest or sleep.Examples of quiet spots include a spare bedroom, under a table, or a quiet corner in the den or living room.

, Cats love to be able to see without being seen. In addition to providing warmth, placing the bed by a sunlit window lets your cat watch out for passing birds and other wildlife.Partially concealing the bed with floor-length curtains will further encourage your cat to use it. The window will provide a view and warmth, and the curtains will give it a sense of security.

, Cats naturally enjoy heights and, for some, sleeping on the floor makes them feel too vulnerable.Try placing the bed on an ottoman, chair, or other piece of furniture. You could also provide your cat with a tree perch or a bed that attaches to a window sill.An elevated perch might be your best option if your cat prefers sleeping on the back of the sofa, a dining room chair, or other elevated surface.
It might seem counterintuitive to place a bed on a chair or sofa, but it might help you reduce the amount of cat hair that builds up on your furniture.

,  If your cat doesn’t seem interested in a new bed, your first solution should be to switch up its location. Finding a more desirable spot for the bed is usually an effective way to encourage your cat to use it. Place the bed somewhere secluded, sunlit, and warm, or where you see it sleeping the most.You can also try moving it to various spots in your home to follow the sun as it moves across the sky.

Remove all food from your cat’s bowl within five minutes of feeding.,
Get a small portion of food that will lure your cat toward you.,
Present your cat with food and wait for it to come to you.,
Walk away and store the food if your cat doesn’t follow.,
Ignore your cat instead of punishing it.",How to Do Lure‐Based Training with a Cat1," If your cat has food lying around in its bowl all day long, it is less likely to obey when offered food. Five minutes after each feeding, pick up all food remaining in the bowl and save it for teaching tricks. If your cat learns that it needs to eat food while it is available, it will also respond better to treats., You can lure your cat with a small piece of kibble. Alternatively, to closely monitor how much you give out, you can try putting a liquid food in a syringe. Try, for example, yogurt or a mixture of wet food with water., If you are presenting your cat with an unfamiliar lure, like food in a syringe, you might want to let it sample the food. Then walk away, call your cat and wait for it to come., While you’re training your cat, your cat will try to train you. It might refuse to come to the food, hoping that you will learn to bring the food to it. Don’t concede. Walk further away. If the cat doesn’t follow, put the food up and try again another day. Hopefully, your cat will learn that it should take advantage of the offer while it stands.


If, after multiple tries, your cat still doesn’t respond to the food, it is likely that the food is not valuable enough to it. Try to find a more desirable treat to reward it with., Negative reinforcement, even spraying with a water bottle, will only make your cat less eager to be around you, making it harder to train it. It is better to ignore your cat when it does something bad and reward it when it performs a positive alternative.


For example, if your cat is scratching furniture, reward it with food when it goes for its scratching post. Then, when it scratches furniture, refuse to acknowledge its existence. Ultimately, it will learn that it receives positive results when it scratches surfaces that it is supposed to scratch."
"
Figure out what is making your cat agitated.,
Use pheromones to calm your cat.Pheromones are chemicals released from glands on the cat's body—face, feet, back and tail—that cats release to communicate with other cats.,
Use other non-medication calming aids.,
Consider using short-term medication.,
Discuss with your vet the possible sedatives that could help your cat.,
Explore options for long-term medication.",How to Calm a Cat2," After the emergency is over, you need to reassess the situation. What in particular set your cat off? If it was a one-time occurrence, such as workers in the house, you can anticipate for next time and put your cat in a quiet room until they leave. If it was a stray cat outside, you can use techniques to rid yourself of stray cats, such as water sprinklers or chemical sprays that deter cats from your yard.


If it is a problem that is likely to recur (such as trips in the car, company, thunderstorms) you can take some steps to help your cat better cope with the situation.

, Certain pheromones, such as those released from the cats face when they rub on objects or their humans, have a calming effect on stressed cats.


Scientists have managed to synthesize these chemicals which come in various forms such as collars, sprays, wipes, and plug-in diffusers.

, There are a few other non-medicated options available to calm an anxious or stressed cat. Essential oils or herbal blends can mimic pheromones and can be tried in place of the synthetic pheromones. Food supplements have also proved helpful to relieve anxiety and stress in cats. The ingredients in these supplements help to support the cat’s natural chemical balance to aid in relaxation. They come in liquid, chew and tablet forms.


Body wraps (thunder shirts or anxiety wraps) are another non-medication calming aids. These cloth and Velcro wraps wrap around the cat’s body and exert gentle pressure on pressure points which aid in calming cats. The principle is similar to swaddling an infant or wrapping the cat into a towel.
Not every cat will respond positively to having to wear a wrap or to the pheromones or blends. You may have a period of trial and error to see what response your kitty has to these products.

, Some cats have a certain chemical makeup that necessitates the use of medications to help them cope with anxiety or stress producing situations. There are short-term options to use for the occasional trip in the car or visits from certain people your cat has taken a disliking too. Various medications are available to sedate a cat for a short term, temporary situation. These medications require an examination and a prescription from a veterinarian make certain the cat is healthy enough to take them.Not all cats react the same to the same medication, so most veterinarians will suggest an initial trial with a medication while at home to gauge your cat’s reaction to the sedative.
Keep in mind, some sedatives need to be given an hour or so prior to travel or anticipated stressful event so the cat doesn’t override the medication effects due to a buildup of anticipation anxiety.

, There are a broad range of sedatives used in cats. They all have side effects and precautions for use especially in cats with health conditions like kidney failure, heart disease, and diabetes. Only your veterinarian can advise you on the right one for your cat. Sedatives used in cats include:


Benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, midazolam, and lorazepam. These are the most widely used sedatives in cats. They work almost immediately to reduce fear and anxiety in cats working on the same part of the brain as alcohol does in humans. Note: NEVER give alcohol to a cat.
SARI’s. Trazodone is an example of this type of sedative. It works quickly to relieve anxiety.
Clonidine and gabapentin. These have sedative and antianxiety effects in animals including cats.
Chlorpheniramine and Benadryl are allergy and cold medications which have been used for cat sedation.
Phenobarbital is another sedative used in cats.

, There are long-term solutions for those few cats that are suffering from constant anxiety. In cats with severe, crippling anxiety long-term medication (given daily for months to years) is the best solution to make life more pleasant for them and their humans. Luckily, there are now fairly safe medications which can temper down the chemical imbalances which make life miserable.


These medications include: Amitriptyline (an antidepressant that helps animals with anxiety), Buspirone Hydrochloride (helpful with phobias, such as a fear of people in uniform or a fear of thunderstorms), Clomipramine (Clomicalm), and Fluoxetine (Reconcile, Prozac).
In order for these drugs to work effectively, they need to “build up” in the cat's body, so it may take up to 6 weeks to find out if they work on the cat.
Also, they should not be stopped abruptly or adverse effects might occur. The best remedy is to slowly taper down the medication to give the body a chance to adjust to the medication decrease.

Make sure the bed is clean.,
Place some of your cat’s toys in the bed.,
Offer treats and praise when your cat goes to its bed.,
Try not to force your cat into the bed.",How to Encourage a Cat to Use Its Bed2," Cats don’t like soiled environments or strange smells, so you should make sure the bed is clean before introducing your cat to it. If your cat avoids a new bed even though you’ve placed it in a good sleeping spot, it might not like the way the new bed smells. If your cat suddenly stops using a bed, chances are it’s due for a wash. Keep in mind a brand new bed will smell like the factory and store it came from, so it’s a good idea to wash it before introducing it to your cat. If you’ve acquired a bed secondhand, be sure to wash it before letting your cat use it.
Beds with removable washable covers or that are entirely machine washable are excellent options.

, Once you’ve chosen a good location for the bed, place some of your cat’s toys in it. The toys will smell like your cat and help familiarize it with its bed.Leave the toys in the bed for least a day, but don’t pick your cat up and bring it to the bed. Give it time to figure out what the bed is for on its own.

, Giving your cat attention when you notice it using its bed will help it form a positive association with the bed. Offer lots of verbal praise, pet it, and offer it a small treat.Give your cat treats and praise only when you first see it get into its bed. Cats don’t like being disturbed while they sleep. Petting or praising your cat while it’s sleeping might make it dislike the bed.

, Do your best to make sure your cat doesn’t form a negative association with the bed. Switch up the bed’s location and make it more appealing instead of holding your cat in the bed, yelling at it, or otherwise forcing it to use the bed.If your cat associates the bed with being held down or yelled at, it won’t go anywhere near the bed.

"
Use catnip to coax your cat to its bed.,
Try lining the bed with clothing or fabric that smells like you.,
Provide your cat with multiple beds.",How to Encourage a Cat to Use Its Bed3," If it seems disinterested, try sprinkling some catnip in the bed to encourage your cat to lay in it.Keep in mind catnip makes some cats mellow, others more playful, and has no effect on almost half of cats. For best results, pay attention to how your cat reacts to catnip., While cats prefer a nice, clean bed, they also love familiar scents.Line the bed with a towel or old article of clothing with your scent. Fleece is a great fabric choice, as most cats enjoy how it feels.Making its bed smell like you will help encourage your cat to use its bed instead of getting into your bed.

, Cats instinctively sleep in multiple locations over the course of a day.To encourage bed use, try placing multiple beds throughout your home in each of its preferred sleeping locations.Try incorporating different kinds of beds, like elevated beds, cave or hooded beds, and pillow beds.
From using cardboard boxes to repurposing an old sweater, you can reduce the cost of providing multiple beds by creating homemade cat beds.

Position the lure strategically so the cat naturally does the trick.,
Use a hand or verbal cue with the lure.,
Offer food and verbal encouragement once the cat performs the trick.,
Repeat in different locations and at different times of day.,
Perform training sessions daily for no more than ten minutes at a time.,
Demand more each time in return for the reward.,
Combine several smaller tasks to teach complicated tricks.",How to Do Lure‐Based Training with a Cat2," The attraction of lure training is that you can use the lure to naturally position your cat. Correctly placing the lure can cause your cat to perform tricks, including “come,” “sit,” lie,” or “jump.” Do not give your cat the lure until it has fully performed the task.


For example, if you place the lure close to the ground, your cat will lie down to reach it.
If you place the lure high in the air, your cat will stand up., You want to train your cat to respond even when you don’t have a treat. So, as you position your hand with the lure, also call out the name of the trick. Try to use a different hand signal with each trick too, so that there are more cues to alert your cat to the trick.For hand signals, you could, for example, present the lure in an open palm for sit, or present it dangling from two fingers for stand.

, After the cat is in place, give it the treat and say something positive like “good.” Use the same word every time so the cat associates it with reward. Alternatively, use a clicker to make a clicking sound, which the cat will learn means that it has done a good job., Repeating the trick over and over again will help your cat master it and recognize cues. However, you also want to repeat it in different rooms and different times of day. Otherwise, your cat might think that the trick only applies to a particular time and place and won’t correctly respond to the cues in different contexts., Training sessions can become counterproductive if they stretch on too long, boring or irritating your cat. It is better to do shorter, more frequent training sessions. Once your cat seems to understand the calls, intersperse tricks throughout the day, rather than trying to do them in a single, long block of time.

, For harder tasks, you should wait progressively longer before giving your cat a reward, until it is willing to do the whole task. If for example, you are brushing your cat, reward it the first time when it is willing to come to you with the brush in hand. Next time, make it sniff the brush before offering food. The next time, brush your cat for a couple of seconds before feeding it. Then, each time afterward, brush it a little bit longer., You might have to get creative, combining multiple steps, to teach complicated tasks. At each step along the way, you will need to lure your cat to make a motion, reward it, and then move on to the next task.


If you want to have your cat lie on a blanket next to you, you might first need to teach it “come.” Then, you will need to teach ""lie."" Finally, you will need to teach it “stay.”"
"
Replace food with a valued toy.,
Ask your cat to repeat the trick without a treat.,
Reward your cat, but don’t keep the lure visible.,
Offer treats progressively less often.",How to Do Lure‐Based Training with a Cat3," Toys can also be a good lure that doesn’t put your cat in danger of obesity. If you are trying to use a toy as a lure, find one that your cat particularly likes, and don’t give the toy to it unless it successfully completes the trick. If the toy is always available, it will make it a less effective lure.

, To teach your cat to perform the trick without a treat—what is called “fading the lure”—begin by using your call and/or hand signal to ask your cat to repeat the trick even after the treat is gone. You can try to begin by asking your cat to perform the trick multiple times, only giving a treat after successfully completing a string of tricks., Perform the hand signal and the call without showing a treat. On the first few occasions, you might want to give your cat a treat anyway. This way, it will learn that even if they don’t see a treat, they might still get rewarded. Always provide verbal encouragement and/or use a clicker as positive reinforcement., Once your cat has successfully responded to a call without the lure on a couple of occasions, do one trick without offering a treat at all. Then, offer the treat the next couple of times that your cat does the trick, but, after that, go a little bit longer without offering a treat. Over a few months, slowly transition from giving your cat a treat nine out of ten times that it completes the task, to only one out of every ten times.

Be sure to put its litter box, food, and water dishes in the room. This way the cat can feel secure in one room as it acclimates to its new home.


Spend time with your cat and get to know it by playing, talking, and brushing it. You don't want it to spend most of its time trapped in the room alone.
Give your cat gradual access to the house. After a few days you can allow your cat to start exploring the rest of the house. If you have a kitten you may want to keep exploration to the main level of the house, as it may be too small to safely navigate stairs.;
, Potty training is one of the first things you need to do for your cat. Most cats are extremely easy to potty train, as long as they know where their litter box is located. The first thing you should do when you bring your cat home is to place it in the litter box. Even if it doesn’t go to the bathroom, and jumps out right away, it now knows where the box is and can find it.


There are many types of litter available: clay, plant based (pine, wheat, corn, wood, beet pulp), clumping litter, silica based, and scented litters.Research on cat preferences have shown that most cats prefer the fine-grained, unscented litters.An unscented scoopable litter is generally an acceptable litter type, although it may vary with your cat. If you find a litter that your cat uses consistently then stick with it, as switching litters may cause your cat to seek an alternative place to go to the bathroom.

, Scratching is a normal, healthy activity. It removes the dead outer claw, gives the cat exercise and helps mark its territory. To keep your furniture and wood trim safe from cat scratching purchase a scratching post or similar item for your cat to scratch.If you catch your cat using a non-acceptable item as a scratching post do not yell or hit it. Instead, pick it up and place it near the scratching post. You can use a cat deterrent spray or wipe on the forbidden item, however test a small spot on it first to make certain it doesn’t damage the item.

, Cats are classified as obligate carnivores, meaning they have an absolute need for animal-derived food. They require certain amino acids found in meat-based proteins or they might suffer serious health consequences.Because of this, cat food manufacturers make sure their foods are nutritionally balanced to provide cats with the necessary nutrients.


Generally, if you look at the cat food bag ingredient list, meat should be the top two or three ingredients. With quality comes a price, so expect to pay more for the food. However, a quality food will be more fully digested and keep your cat at its healthiest.

, The food bag label will also give suggestions for feeding your cat according to age, weight and activity level. In general, cats prefer to eat frequent, small meals throughout the day.Many people find twice a day feedings work for adult cats keeping the cats satisfied. Make sure to measure the food with an actual measuring cup as the American Longhair is prone to obesity.Remember that an excessive amount of treats can add a lot of calories to your cat's diet. Choose only high quality treats and using them sparingly.

, Have clean water available for your cat to drink at all times. Water fountains, or bubblers, will encourage your cat to drink more water if it is a poor drinker.


If your cat is not getting enough water, consider feeding it wet food instead of dry (or at least half wet food and half dry food). Because of its water content, it can help with dehydration. As will all food changes, however, you need to transition between different types of food very gradually or your cat's digestive system may get upset.

, Finding a good quality food can be a bit tricky. You should feel free to ask your veterinarian for advice. You can also ask your veterinarian how much you should be feeding your cat.

, American Longhair cats have a soft, long coat that needs frequent grooming to avoid matting. While daily grooming with a pin brush is ideal, every other day is an acceptable schedule if that is enough to keep the hair tangle free.

, Grooming also gives you a great time to bond with your cat and to check its skin for any problems. As you groom, check your cats for fleas, lumps, and bumps on the skin. If you find any lumps or bumps take note of them and call your veterinarian if its concerning or doesn’t disappear within a few days.


Fleas should be treated with a topical product once a month.

, When brushing your cat, take the time to look at its claws too. If they need trimming this is the time to do so. Use a scissor-type or guillotine-type clippers on your cat’s nails.Hold the cat in place by putting it on your lap and placing your dominant forearm on the cat’s upper body. Then use your other hand to pick up a paw and gently press on the middle of it to expose the claws.


You should only trim the white tip. Avoid the pink part, as that is where the blood supply and nerves reside.

, This isn’t a hard process and takes less than a minute a day. It requires a soft-bristled tooth brush and veterinary toothpaste, both of which can be purchased at pet stores or a veterinary clinic. Do not use human toothpaste as the fluoride in it is toxic to cats.To get your cat used to the process put a small amount of the toothpaste on your fingertip and let your cat taste it. The next day do the same, but then rub your finger along the cat's gums. The following day put the toothpaste on the brush and gently rub it along your cat’s gums. Each day build up the process until you are able to work the bristles along the teeth in small circles.
The entire process should take less than a minute. Brushing in this manner reduces the plaque and build up on the visible surfaces of the teeth. It doesn’t get the deeper buildup under the gums, so dental cleanings may be necessary. Your veterinarian will examine your cat’s mouth at its appointments and can let you know if your cat needs one.

, Aside from obesity, and a tendency for its fur to mat without daily grooming, the American longhair cat is no more prone to any diseases than any other cat. A yearly examination for your cat should keep it in top-notch condition.At the examination your veterinarian will examine your cat from top to tail. Make sure you bring up any concerns or questions at this time so they can be addressed promptly. Your cat’s vaccines will be updated and a fecal examination performed to check for internal parasites.
While vaccinations vary depending on the community you live in and how your cat is housed, the core vaccines are distemper and rabies. Feline leukemia vaccination may or may not be in your cat’s routine vaccinations.

, Consider spaying or neutering your cat if it is still intact, whether it is a kitten or a full-grown cat. This operation has the benefits of reducing the chance of acquiring reproductive tract diseases, roaming or heat activity, and, of course, reducing the overall population of unwanted cats.You should try to have your kitten desexed before it reaches sexual maturity, at about 3 to 4 months old, but not before it is 8 weeks old., Because American longhair cats are lively, they need mental stimulation. Give your cat a variety of toys, so that when you are gone it can occupy itself.


Figure out what kind of toys your cat likes so you cat give it a lot of them. Bring home a variety of toys and pay attention to the ones your cat favors.
Never let your cat play with strings, thread, yarn, or rubber bands unsupervised. It can ingest them and this can cause serious and sometimes fatal injuries to the intestinal tract., Toys can't replace your time and attention. Play with your cat and stimulate its mind. Consider getting a feather toy or a laser pointer toy to use when playing with your cat.

, Don't force your affection on the cat but make yourself available if it decides it wants to snuggle. While cats can be finicky about the kind and amount of affection they want, try your best to give it the love it wants and deserves.

Choose a high-quality cat food.,
Set up a regular feeding schedule.,
Provide plenty of fresh, clean water.,
Give your Himalayan treats.",How to Care for Himalayan Cats1," Most commercial cat foods will provide your Himalayan with adequate nutrition, but a high-quality food will help to ensure that your cat looks and feels his best. Look for a cat food that lists meat (not just a meat by-product) as the first ingredient.


If you are unsure about whether or not a food is high-quality, ask your veterinarian for a recommendation.
Make sure that the cat food you choose contains taurine. This is an essential amino acid that all cats need.Only feed your cat a food that is specially formulated for cats. Other foods may not have the nutrients and amino acids that your cat needs to be healthy. This may lead to heart and vision problems for your cat.;
, To keep your Himalayan at a healthy weight, you will need to create a feeding schedule and stick with it. Free-feeding (placing food out and allowing your cat to eat whenever he wants) can cause your cat to become overweight.That is why it is ideal to feed your cat a measured amount of food twice per day.


Use your cat’s weight and age to determine how much food to give for each feeding. The food that you purchase for your Himalayan should indicate how much food to give your cat for his weight and age. For example, a cat that weighs five to nine pounds needs about 1/3 to 2/3 of a cup of dry food per day. A cat that weighs between 10 to 14 pounds needs about 2/3 of a cup to one cup of food per day.
If you are not sure about the amount to give your cat, then ask your veterinarian for a recommendation.Split the amount of food that you are supposed to give your cat every day into two or three feedings because cats prefer smaller meals.For example, you might give your eight pound cat 1/3 of a cup of food in the morning and 1/3 of a cup of food at night. If your cat weighs 12 pounds, then you might give him 1/2 cup of food in the morning and 1/2 cup of food at night.

, Your Himalayan will need to have access to fresh, clean water at all times. Make sure that you place the water somewhere that is easy for your cat to access and that is not near a litter box. Cats do not like to eat or drink near their litter boxes.Change your cat's water at least once per day.

, You can purchase special kitty treats in pet stores and grocery stores, just make sure that you do not give your cat too many of these treats. Too many treats may cause your cat to become overweight or lead to picky eating habits.


Offer him a few treats per day, but make sure that treats do not make up more than 10% of his daily calories.Give your cat a little piece of turkey, chicken, fish, or lean deli meat now and then. Cats are natural carnivores so they tolerate these foods well. Just make sure that the meat has been cooked to protect your cat from harmful bacteria.Try making some treats for your cat using canned tuna.

, Most cats will wear down their own claws by scratching and moving around. If your Himalayan is not active or does not use scratching posts often, then you may need to trim her claws once every few weeks.When trimming your cat’s claws, make sure that you only trim the white tips, not the pink parts further down the claw.

Prepare your home for the cat.,
Give the cat room to explore.,
Provide entertainment.",How to Care for a Siberian Cat1," Buy a scratching post, litter box, food, water bowls and a cat bed before bringing your cat home. Make sure to put the litter box in a quiet, low-traffic area--such as a pantry, a guest bathroom, or any secluded nook--where the cat can do its business in private.


Buy a large cat carrier, as the Siberian cat can get quite large. It's okay if the carrier seems too large at first; the cat will grow into it.
When you bring the cat home, put the carrier in a room, open the door of the cat carrier, and close the door of the room. Leave the cat to explore the room on its own terms.;
, Siberian cats have high energy levels, and they enjoy roaming around. Most prefer having access to the outdoors. If kept indoors, they should have at least a large apartment to explore.


Indoor cats are at risk of obesity due to lower activity levels, so watch their food intake carefully. Outdoor cats are at higher risk of injury and disease--so be careful letting them roam in areas where they may encounter heavy vehicle traffic, wild animals, or pesticides and other chemicals.
Siberians are strong jumpers, and they enjoy exploring high places. They are agile cats, and they don't tend to break things, but you may consider keeping precious or expensive items out of reach.

, Siberian cats are intelligent, and they need stimulation. Bored Siberian cats may overeat, scratch up the furniture, and Here are a few ways to prevent boredom:


Buy a ceiling-high ""tree"" where the cat can jump up to survey his territory.
Give the cat toys and feline puzzle games. Experiment with yarn, toy mice, lasers pointers, and catnip. Many Siberian cats enjoy playing fetch. Encourage him with treats or kibble as a reward.

Protect the cat from heat.,
Bathe the cat occasionally.,
Check the cat's health weekly.,
Schedule regular vet checkups.,
Feed high-quality cat food.",How to Care for a Siberian Cat2," Even though Siberian cats have thick coats, grooming is easier than with most longer-haired cats. Siberian coats don't tend to mat or tangle too quickly, so grooming once or twice a week is enough to keep it healthy. Brush gently with a slick, soft brush.


Siberians molt twice a year, shedding fur in large clumps. During these times, daily brushing is the easiest way to keep the coat from matting and tangling.
Brushing reduces the likelihood of hairballs.

, Do not keep Siberian cats in temperatures above 33ºC (91ºF). They are adapted to cold climates, and they can overheat easily in their thick coats. Take the following precautions during summer months:


Put ice in the cat's food or water. At the very least, use cold water instead of warm or room-temperature water.
Take the cat to a professional groomer and have her shave away most of the fur. The fur will grow back by the winter, but it may make your cat much more comfortable through the summer months.
Visit a veterinarian if your cat seems uncomfortable. You may notice it going to great lengths to keep cool, such as rubbing against the refrigerator or spending time in cold spaces. If the cat makes painful yowling noises, and it doesn't seem particularly hungry, it might be uncomfortable.

, Siberian cats have a water-resistant, triple-layered coat. Many of them enjoy water and may try to jump into the bath or shower. Even if your cat doesn't like water, bathe him whenever the coat gets dirty. Bathing can also reduce allergens, if someone in the house is allergic to cats. If necessary, use a mild, conditioning, oatmeal-based cat shampoo.


Your Siberian cat has a somewhat oily coat that keeps the skin healthy and manages the cat's temperature. Bathing too frequently can strip away these protective oils.
Because of the thick coat, it can take up to 45 minutes to fully soak the cat's fur.

, If you have a kitten, start these care habits early so your kitten gets use to it. If you have any trouble with these procedures, ask a veterinarian to show you how to do them:


Trim nails once a week or as needed. Use nail trimmer scissors.

Brush your cat's teeth regularly with vet-approved animal toothpaste for overall good health and fresh breath.
Siberian cats can quite easily get ticks or fleas. Check outdoor cats regularly, and remove ticks and fleas if you find them.

, Siberian cats have a chance of getting stomach issues such as IBS or Lymphoma. Make regular vet visits to keep an eye on their stomachs.


Siberians are also susceptible to at least one hereditary health issue: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Siberians that will be bred should be screened for HCM, and cats identified with HCM should be removed from breeding programs. Do not buy a kitten whose parents have not been tested for this disease.

, Foods can actually cause higher or lower allergen levels. A high-quality food can prevent many health issues in the cat as well. Feed vet-recommended amounts only, taking into account treat consumption as well. Keeping a Siberian at an appropriate weight is one of the easiest ways to protect his overall health.

As a breed, the Abyssinian cat is prone to various diseases. This does not mean your Abyssinian will come down with a disease, as it may well live out a healthy disease-free life. However, it is wise to keep these tendencies in mind in case a problem arises. The diseases Abyssinians are prone to include:Amyloidosis
Heart disease
Gum disease
Nose polyps
Myasthenia gravis
Progressive retinal atrophy
Psychogenic Alopecia
Hyperesthesia Syndrome
Hip Dysplasia
Patellar (knee cap) luxation
Congenital hypothyroidism (different from the more common hyperthyroidism in older cats);
, In order to find any disease or condition at its earliest stage, it is advised to have twice yearly veterinary exams.Kittens generally see the veterinarian at least twice during the first three months of life, once more at around five to six months of age, and then follow the adult examination schedule.


Your veterinarian will examine your cat thoroughly during the examination. This is the time to share any concerns or questions so they can be addressed promptly.
Your Abyssinian’s vaccinations will be updated, and a fecal examination will be performed in order to check for internal parasites. Each community has their different requirements and need for vaccinations but the core vaccines are distemper and rabies.
Feline leukemia vaccination may or may not be a part of its vaccinations depending upon your Abyssinian’s lifestyle. If your cat is an outdoor cat, has been in contact with lots of other cats (such as at a shelter), or has potentially been in contact with a cat you know has feline leukemia, then it should get vaccinated., You will need to decide if you will have your Abyssinian spayed (female) or neutered (male). This important operation has the benefits of reducing reproductive tract diseases and roaming or heat activity. It is also a community service, as it will help reduce the overall population of unwanted cats.


If you do not plan on breeding your cat, you should definitely have your cat spayed or neutered.

, Regular brushing reduces the plaque and buildup on the visible surfaces of the teeth. It’s a simple, quick process that, after the learning period, takes less than a minute a day. To do so you need a soft-bristled tooth brush and veterinary toothpaste, both which can be purchased at pet stores or a veterinary clinic. Human toothpaste cannot be used as the fluoride in it is toxic to cats. The process is:


Place a small amount of the toothpaste on your fingertip and let your cat taste it.
The following day do the same, then rub your finger along the cat's gums.
The following day put the toothpaste on the brush and gently rub it along the cat's gums.
For the next few days, slowly work the bristles along the teeth in small circles until your cat will sit still long enough for you to do the entire mouth.

, Proper feeding goes a long way to ensuring you have a healthy cat. Cats are obligate carnivores, which means they require certain amino acids that are only found in meat-based proteins. If they do not get these essential amino acids, they can acquire some serious preventable diseases., Finding a good quality food can be a bit tricky, although all cat food manufacturers balance their food to meet a cat’s basic requirements. Ask your veterinarian for suggestions for cat food. You can also look at the food bag ingredient list. This will help you decide whether a food is good quality.


If meat is the top two or three ingredients, it’s likely a good quality food. You want to avoid foods that have less than 40% protein (by weight) and look for foods that are grain free.If you cannot find a quality canned or dry food, consider feeding your Abyssinian a raw diet. Commercially packaged raw foods are available at most pet stores and, while more expensive than traditional dry or wet foods, the food usually includes fewer unhealthy additives and ingredients., You will see that the food bag label gives suggested amounts for feeding your cat. This is based on age, weight, and activity level. In general, cats prefer to eat frequent, small meals throughout the day.Twice a day feeding will keep your Abyssinian full, satisfied, and hopefully not constantly begging for food., When you bring your cat or kitten home, confine it to one room in the house with his litter box and food and water dishes to allow it to acclimate to its home in a quiet, unhurried manner. Of course, make sure you spend a few hours interacting with the cat to help him feel at home. After a few days, let your cat explore the rest of the house. If you have a kitten, you may want to keep it confined to the main level of the house until he can manage stairs on his own.

, Most cats are easy to potty train, as long as they know where their litter box is located and they are able to access it easily. One major choice you need to make is which type of litter to use. There are many types of litter available: clumping, clay, silica based, and plant based (such as pine or wheat).You need to show your cat the litter box immediately when it arrives in your home. Cats tend to have a natural instinct to go to the bathroom in litter and usually are shown how to do it by their mother. By the time you bring home a kitten, it should have a good idea of what it is supposed to do. It just needs to know where the box is and it needs access to the box.
Most cats prefer the fine-grained, unscented litters.An unscented scoopable litter meets this standard, as it probably has a softer feel on its paws. However, you may find your cat prefers a different litter type, especially if it has used a particular style since kitten hood. If you find a litter that your cat likes, keep with that kind or your cat may decide to relieve itself elsewhere.
Clean the box daily so your cat has a fresh, inviting bathroom.

, While training a cat the same way as a dog is trained won't usually work, you can teach your cat some things. Teach it to play simple games and what it should, and shouldn't, scratch on. For example, set up an agility course for the cat in your living room and clicker train it to go through it.You can even teach an Abyssinian to walk outside on a leash!


Provide a scratching post. To keep your furniture and wood trim safe from cat scratching, provide your Abyssinian with a scratching post or similar item to scratch. Scratching is a normal, healthy activity to help remove the dead outer part of the claws, to let the cat mark its territory, and to give it necessary exercise.If you catch your cat using a non-acceptable item as a scratching post, do not yell or hit the cat. Instead, pick it up and place it near the scratching post. To keep the cat from using unacceptable items you can use a cat deterrent spray, especially those with the smell of citrus, to keep them away from these items.

, Abyssinian cats are very smart, and so they need to be entertained and stimulated mentally. This does not mean that the cat will always be in the mood to play with you, but you should try to when the cat acts interested.


Laser pointer toys are a great way to exercise your cat. They are also a good way to have some fun with your cat.

, Have a bunch of toys available to your cat, so that it hopefully plays with them instead of getting into trouble. Provide puzzle feeders and balls and mice to keep your cat occupied.


Place a bird feeder outside your window where the cat can see it. This could potentially entertain your cat for hours.Get the cat a cat tree to climb.It would be good to place it in front of a window, so it can climb and get a good view at the same time.

, Fortunately, the Abyssinian’s short, dense hair coat only needs a weekly brushing. Use a soft bristle brush or a slicker brush to gently brush your cat along with the direction that the fur is growing.

, When you do brush, make sure to check the skin for any fleas, lumps, or bumps. If fleas are found, treat your cat immediately to control the problems. Any lumps or bumps should be noted for size, shape, and color. If it doesn’t resolve or grows within a week, contact your veterinarian.

, Brushing time is also a good time to check its claws. If they are long and have sharp points, then it’s time to trim them. There are a variety of types and brands of cat nail clippers but most are either scissor type or guillotine type.Whatever type you choose, avoid trimming the pink part of the nail as this is the blood and nerve supply. Cutting this part will cause bleeding and pain.


Human nail clippers can be used on your cat’s nails to trim just the very tips off.
To trim the nails, place the cat on your lap and place the forearm of your dominant arm on your cat’s upper body to gently restrain it. Use your non-dominant hand to pick up a paw and gently press on it to expose the claws. Your dominant hand is then used to trim the claws.

If your cat does not commonly go outside or if she is not around other cats who may have it, your vet may decide not to give your cat the feline leukemia vaccine.;
, Every year when your cat is young, you should take your cat for a general checkup at the vet. This is when she will get her vaccinations, vaccination boosters, and tests for parasites. Once she turns seven, she should be taken twice a year to keep a check on her heart as well as other conditions that are common with ages.


When your cat in young, she will need to be dewormed. It is possible that the shelter or breeder where you got your cat will have records of her first deworming session, since it is supposed to be done before she is old enough to adopt.
If your vet finds internal parasites, such as worms, your vet will give you medications to kill these parasites. , Once your cat reaches six months of age, you should have her spayed (or neutered if your cat is male). This will help prevent your cat from having kittens if you don't want her to as well as cut down on aggressive or marking behavior in males and heat behavior in females.

Take your cat’s measurements.,
Make a cat jacket pattern.,
Add a ¼” seam allowance to your pattern.,
Buy the jacket-specific items.,
Gather your general sewing items.,
Cut out your fabric, lining and interface.,
Sew the fabric pieces together.,
Add the D ring and webbing to the back of the jacket.,
Sew the velcro pieces to the jacket.,
Put the jacket on your cat.",How to Make a Harness for Your Fat Cat1," Measure your cat in three places: the circumference of your cat’s neck, near their shoulders (not near their throat where a collar would go); the length between your cat’s neck to the middle of their rib cage (straight line); the circumference of your cat’s chest around the middle of the rib cage.If you visualize these three measurements, you’ll have two circles (one larger than the other) and a straight line between the two circles.


For the sake of our example, let’s assume our three measurements are 8”, 6” and 15”, where 8” and 15” are the two circle circumferences.;
, A cat jacket is essentially a vest for your cat, with a D ring on the back for the leash clip.Instead of a zipper or buttons for closing the vest, as you’d find on the human version, you’ll want to use velcro. Velcro allows for slight changes in your cat’s size, and keeps the vest secured around your cat even if they pull on the leash. You can find and download a cat jacket pattern online, or you can make your own. To make your own, you’ll need your cat’s measurements, paper, a pencil, a ruler or measuring tape, and probably an eraser. The cat jacket will be assembled from two parts, but since all the parts are the same size and shape, you’ll only need to draw one pattern.


The paper you use will have to be at least as wide as your cat’s larger circle measurement plus a couple of inches, and as tall as your cat’s length measurement plus a couple of inches. In our example, you’ll need a piece of paper at least 17” wide and 8” tall to be certain the pattern will fit on it. Alternatively, you can use two separate pieces of paper taped together. Since you don’t need any special paper to draw a pattern, you could use a piece of a newspaper, the back of a poster, or something similar.
The exact shape and design of the cat jacket can be anything you want, but the important parts to remember is that each section you measured on your cat has to be the same size on the pattern. However, since you’ll need to add velcro to the two circles that go around your cat, you’ll need to make sure these flaps overlap each other so both sides of the velcro will touch.

, In order to ensure you cut your fabric large enough, you need to add ¼” to the perimeter of your pattern. This ¼” space will be the distance between the very edge of your fabric and where the stitches will be.Once the pattern is complete, cut it out and test it on your cat. If any sections don’t fit, draw a new pattern and try again.

, For this jacket you will need to obtain enough fabric (outside) and lining (inside) for the size of the jacket you’re making. You will also require interfacing, nylon webbing, a D ring, thread (in a colour that matches your fabric), and sew-on hook & loop velcro.If you prefer, you can use regular fabric as the lining, in which case you’ll need enough fabric to cut out 2 full sections using the pattern.
You can use any type of fabric you want, but you may find lightweight cotton to be the easiest to sew. And it comes in the largest selection of patterns and colours. An alternative to cotton for the outside of the jacket could be polar fleece - which comes in a multitude of colours as well. In this case you might consider a satin-like material for the lining.
Interface fabric is normally used to strengthen or thicken another type of fabric. As such it is not a requirement for the jacket unless you feel you need to reinforce the fabric you’re using. If you want to use interfacing, make sure it is the same weight, or less, than the fabric you’re using. If you decide to use cotton, you’ll want to look for standard non-woven interfacing. If you’re using polar fleece, which is stretchy, you’ll want to look for knit interfacing.The nylon webbing needs to be at least as long as the middle, straight-line measurement you took of your cat. Ideally you should pick a colour that matches your fabric.
The thickness of the webbing is really up to you, based on the look you want, what might match your fabric, and how heavy your cat is. The thicker the webbing, the harder it will be to sew to the jacket using your sewing machine’s “normal” needle.
The D ring needs to be at least wide enough to allow the nylon webbing to be placed through it. For example, if you buy a D ring that’s ½” wide, your nylon webbing has to be ½” wide as well, and vice versa.

, In order to make this cat jacket, you’ll need a sewing machine, iron, measuring tape, scissors and straight pins.You can pick-up a measuring tape, scissors and straight pins at your local sewing/fabric store. If you do not have either an iron or a sewing machine, consider asking a friend if you can borrow one or both items.


You could make the cat jacket using hand sewing and not a sewing machine, if you have no way to obtain a sewing machine. However, it might not be a strong as one made with a sewing machine.

, Layout your fabric pieces flat on a table, with the grain of the fabric going up and down (i.e. vertical) in front of you. Pin the pattern to the fabric using straight pins. Cut the fabric to be the size of the pattern plus the ¼” seam allowance.As a tip, you can lay your piece of fabric, plus your piece of lining material, plus your interfacing material, all on top of each other and pin the pattern through all three layers. Then when you cut out the shape, you can cut all three pieces in one step. If these three layers are too thick (i.e. the pin can’t easily go through them plus the pattern), you’ll have to do them separately.

, Remember that when you sew items that have a top and a bottom (in this case an outside and an inside) you sew the items together inside-out. Line up your fabric pieces appropriately and sew the perimeter of the fabric, except for approximately 4” along the neck, which will be used to turn the fabric right-side-out.Once all the pieces are sewn together, and turned them right-side-out, sew the 4” gap closed using hand-stitching.


As an alternative to interfacing, you could stuff the inside of the jacket with batting to give it a puffy, down-like look! You could even sew a criss-cross pattern on top of the vest, after it’s completed, to add to the effect.

, The nylon webbing needs to be sewn to the back of the jacket, where your cat’s spine would be. But before sewing the nylon webbing down, make sure you’ve threaded the D ring through with the rounded edge sticking out. Since you want this part to be strong, use your sewing machine to sew the nylon webbing to the back of the jacket.


Note that some nylon webbing can be quite thick. If you’ve decided to use really thick webbing, make sure you have the proper needle in your sewing machine.

, The velcro is used to fasten the two circles of the jacket around your cat. Velcro can be purchased at any sewing/fabric store but for the jacket make sure the velcro is not the adhesive kind. While you could technically sew adhesive velcro onto the jacket, the adhesive itself can get onto your needle and ruin the inner workings of your sewing machine.Remember that when the two sets of flaps go around your cat, they’re going to overlap each other. So one piece of velcro needs to be on the inside of a flap and the other piece needs to be on the outside of a flap.
If you’re an experienced seamstress, you could use some other type of closure other than velcro - buttons, a zipper, hooks, etc.

, Make sure it’s velcroed securely, but that you’re still able to slide 2 fingers underneath each circle. Have your cat wear the harness around the house for a while to get use to it, and show it off to everyone. When ready, clip a leash to the D ring and take your cat outside for some sunshine and fresh air!


Not all cats are going to tolerate a jacket or harness right away. There are methods you can use to help train your cat to wear a harness, but beware of your cat’s limits. If these training methods don’t appear to be working, or your cat is really stressed and upset, you should stop and consult a veterinarian before continuing.
Let your cat get to know the jacket. Put it down for them and let them sniff it. Give them treats while you do this. Associate positive things (like treats) with the harness so they aren’t scared.Lay the jacket over your cat, but don’t connect the velcro pieces. Feed them treats at the same time to keep them in a good mood. Do this a few times until they don’t appear overly nervous.
After they’re use to the feel of something on their back, put the harness on and connect the velcro pieces. Again, do this while giving them treats and praising them. Some cats might simply walk around like nothing happened, others might try to fight the jacket or pretend like they can’t move. Leave the harness on for a little while, or until your cat is too upset. Repeat this several times, increasing the length of time your cat wears the harness.
When you feel you cat is ready, attach the leash, carry him/her outside, and let them walk around. Always supervise your cat while they’re outside.

Take your cat’s measurements.,
Gather all the required materials.,
Cut a piece of paracord for the ribcage circle.,
Fuse the tips of the paracord.,
Attach the plastic buckle.,
Knot the paracord using the cobra stitch.,
Repeat for the shoulder circle.,
Prepare the two circles for connection.,
Cut, fuse and attach paracord for middle section.,
Knot the middle section using the cobra stitch.,
Finish knotting both circles with the cobra stitch.,
Test the harness out on your cat.",How to Make a Harness for Your Fat Cat2," Measure your cat in three places: the circumference of your cat’s neck, near their shoulders (not near their throat where a collar would go); the length between your cat’s neck to the middle of their rib cage (straight line); the circumference of your cat’s chest around the middle of the rib cage.If you visualize these three measurements, you’ll have two circles (one larger than the other) and a straight line between the two circles.


For the sake of our example, let’s assume our three measurements are 8”, 6” and 15”, where 8” and 15” are the two circle circumferences.

, For a paracord harness you’ll need 2 plastic buckles, several packages of paracord, scissors and a candle.For our example measurements, we’ll need at least 203” of paracord.


The plastic buckles should be the type that is called a “side release” buckle. An example of what one would look like can be found here.

, Because of the amount of paracord taken up by the stitching/knotting, you’ll want to cut a piece of cord that’s 7 times the length you need.In this case you need 15” for the finished circle, so you’ll want a piece of cord that’s 105” long.

, Light the candle and put each tip or end of the paracord into the flame to melt it enough to form a solid seal - sort of like the ends of a shoelace.Melting and fusing the ends will make sure the paracord doesn’t start to fray or unwind in the future.


Do not fuse or melt two ends of a piece of paracord together.

, Fold the paracord piece exactly in half (now you’ll have 52.5” of paracord). Attach one side of the buckle to the end of the paracord that’s folded (i.e. not the end that’s in two pieces) by bringing the looped end of the paracord through the buckle attachment by about 1.5-2”, then threading the two loose ends through the loop and pulling tight., Starting at the end where you attached the buckle, use the cobra stitch until you get about ¼ of the way through the 52.5” length.For a step-by-step video on how to complete a cobra stitch, see here.

, For this example, the shoulder circle is 8” around so we’ll need a 56” length of paracord. Fuse both ends of the new piece of paracord using the candle. Fold the 56” long piece of paracord in half (28”). Attach the second plastic buckle to the looped end of the paracord piece. Knot the paracord using the cobra stitch until you’re about ¼ of the way through the 28” length., Place the shoulder circle on the table in front of you to the right. Then place the ribcage circle on the table in front of your on the left. Make sure you can see all 4 pieces of loose paracord coming out of both partially stitched pieces. Loosen the left loop from the last stitch on the shoulder circle, and the right loop on the last stitch of the rib cage circle., This section is suppose to be 6” long when complete. Multiplied by 7 means you’ll want to cut a length of paracord that’s 42” long. Fuse both ends of the new piece using the candle. Fold the 42” length of paracord in half so it’s 21” long. Using the same method as when you attached the previous paracord pieces to the buckle, attach the looped end of this piece to the loosened loop on the shoulder circle., Stitch the entire length of this section of paracord.Do not stop at the ¼ way mark. Attach the end of this section to the rib cage circle where you loosened the loop.

, Using the remaining paracord for both circles, finish knotting them using the cobra stitch.Attach the remaining parts of both buckles to the ends of the paracord circles.

, Put the harness on your cat to test out the fit. Allow your cat to get use to his or her new harness and then take them outside for some fresh air.


You can attach a leash clip directly to the paracord in the middle section, or you could attach a D ring to the middle section while you’re doing the cobra stitch.

Placing multiple water bowls throughout the house and changing the water daily.

, Russian Blues are a very nit-picky breed and many will not even enter the litter box when it is not cleaned.As a result you should scoop out feces daily and fully change the litter box at least twice a week. The Russian Blue is extra particular about hygiene, which means you may have to clean the litter box more frequently. Monitor your cat and find a routine that works.Frequently cleaning the litter box can also reduce smells and odors.
Place the litter box in a quiet space, such as a bathroom or laundry room, in order to reduce odors in your living space. It is also important to make sure that the litter box is not placed behind a closed door because the cat needs to be able to access it at all times.

Comb your cat once or twice a week.,
Examine your cat’s eyes.,
Trim your cat’s nails.,
Examine your cat’s ears.,
Brush your cat’s teeth.",How to Care for a Russian Blue2," The Russian Blue is distinguished because of its beautiful grey-blue coat. The coat is called a “double coat” because of the two distinct layers, which make the cats appear much bigger than they actually are. In order to maintain their beautiful, thick coats, you should brush a Russian Blue 1-2 times per week. Russian Blues typically enjoy being brushed because they like the attention.Use a medium to small toothed metal comb.Weekly brushing will help remove any loose hair and can prevent your cat from ingesting a fur ball., Prior to brushing your cat, get into the habit of doing a quick, at home, eye exam. This will help you identify any potential health issues related to tearing, crust, cloudiness, or inflammation. In order to conduct a basic eye exam follow these steps:In a brightly lit area of the house face your cat directly and look into their eyes. They should look clear and bright, and the area around the cat’s pupils should be white.
Roll up your cat’s eyelid with your thumb and examine the lining of the eyelid. It should appear pink in colour, not red or white.
Gently remove any gunk or crust from your cat’s eye using a damp cotton ball.
Talk to your vet if you notice cloudiness or change in colour, red or white eyelid lining, excessive tearing, and crust build-up.

, Cat’s should have their nails trimmed every 10 days to 2 weeks, in order to avoid splitting and breaking. The best way to trim a cat’s nails is to find a quiet, stimulus free area of your house. Do not try and clip your cat’s nails in front of a window because they may get distracted by animals or sounds outside and try to leap out of your arms.Cradle the cat in your lap and gently press the bottom of their pads so that they display their nails.Russian Blues have clear or translucent nails, which makes it easier to see the pink vein (or quick) that runs about half-way down the nail.Using a pair of nail clippers that can be purchased at a local pet supply store, clip the nail just below the pink vein. Do not clip the vein because this will cause the cat to bleed, be in pain, and likely not trust you to cut it’s nails in the future.If you do accidentally cut the vein while trimming your cat's nails, you can stop the bleeding by using styptic power. This powder can be purchased at your local pet supply store.You can give your cat a small treat following the nail clipping to reward them for good behaviour.

, It is also important to check your cat’s ears periodically for wax build-up and any other health issues that may develop. Examine their ears weekly. If you notice any wax build up, simply place some olive oil on a Q-tip and swab out the ear. In addition to wax removal, pay attention to the following signs when conducting an ear exam:Persistent scratching of the ears.
Redness and swelling.
Black or yellow discharge.
Odors.
Hearing loss.
If any of these occur talk to your vet immediately.

, In order to keep your cat in overall good health, brush their teeth once per week. Talk with your vet in order to find out what toothpaste and brush they recommend. You can purchase feline toothpaste and toothbrushes at your local pet store. Gently brush your cat’s teeth. In order to get the cat comfortable with this process you will need to introduce the brush and toothpaste slowly over time."
"
Introduce your cat to new people, pets, and places slowly.,
Schedule 2 10-minute play sessions every day.,
Provide your cat with toys.,
Purchase scratching posts for your cat.",How to Care for a Russian Blue3," Russian Blues are fairly timid and can take a while to adjust to new people, places, and pets. They like routine, and anything out of the ordinary can cause them stress. When you first get a Russian Blue, you should slowly introduce it to your family members and home environment. For example, try confining the cat to one room for a few days, until they are completely comfortable with you and have adjusted to the environment.If you have another pet, you should keep them separated in the beginning until they have had a chance to learn each others scents in a non-threatening manner.
When you have guests over, your Russian Blue is likely to hide initially. Your cat may venture out for a visit once they have deemed the guests safe and non-threatening., The Russian Blue is a sensitive cat and doesn’t like to be ignored. A lack of attention can cause your cat to become anxious and fearful, so it is important that you spend time petting and playing with your cat on a daily basis.Despite their love of attention, the Russian Blue can also play alone and entertain itself for hours while you are at work.

, Russian Blues love to play and are especially fond of retrieving. Some of them will even play catch with you if you toss them a small colorful ball. Make sure that your cat has a variety of toys, such as feather-like toys or toys that mimic mice or birds, to swat and chase., In order to avoid having your cat scratch the furniture, you should have multiple scratch posts situated throughout the house. You could, for instance, have a post in your bedroom and one in the living room. Keeping their nails short will also diminish any damage that comes as a result of scratching."

Now you and your cat can enjoy your handcrafted DIY cat closet.",How to Make a Cat Closet," Either have the pieces cut into the same-sized squares at the hardware store or be able to do this at home. (The squares should be large enough to form a little closet enclosure for the cat; take along measurements.);
, It should be as high as one of the squares. This will form the cat shape.

, The shape you choose must involve a lot of space under the cat or somewhere around the cat, that serves as a hole for the real cat to enter under. Some ideas for the shape include a cat sitting upright with space to the side, a cat stretching up high with space to the side or a cat arching its back, with plenty of space under the cat's stomach (centered). The hole area must be large enough for your cat to walk under or alongside.


If it's hard for you to draw a shape, look online for suitable cat shapes and print some off to trace around or copy.

, Next, hold the cur-out template against the wood piece and trace around it. This will provide the guidelines for sawing out the cat shape.

, Sand down the edges if needed.

, Paint it any color you like, adding features such as patches, paws, whiskers and eyes, etc. Allow to fully dry before proceeding.

,, Allow to dry in place fully.

, This now allows the cat entry to and exit from the closet.

, Allow to dry completely. Check that it is firmly held together by pushing on the whole structure gently; make any adjustments needed.

, This can be made from net fabric, plain fabric or similar. However, it can be good to leave it uncovered, to allow you to peek on the cat as it sleeps inside the closet.


Temporary objects can be placed on top to provide the cat with more privacy, such as a newspaper, an oversized book, a piece of thick card, etc.

, Paint the sides of the cat closet or add patterns, stickers, etc.

, An old sweater wrapped about a cushion that is the exact size of the closet shape is ideal.


If you need to make a cushion to fit the dimensions, this can be done simply. Measure the inner square, and cut two pieces of fabric to this size. Sew together three sides and fill with stuffing. Then sew up the final side. That's all there is to it! And as puss doesn't care how neat it is, it's a great first sewing project for an older child.

Cut 2 inches (5 cm) of elastic.,
Glue the elastic to both ends of the suede.,
Write your contact information on the collar.,
Slip the collar onto your cat.",How to Make a Cat Collar1," Loosely wrap a soft tape measure around the base of your cat's neck. Keep the tape measure taut but not tight.


You should be able to slip your thumb between the tape measure and your cat's neck without choking your cat.
Take this measurement and add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to it. The result will be used for the length of the collar.;
, Obtain 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide suede strip material. Using scissors, cut the strip down to match your measured length.


If you are unable to find suede strip material, you can purchase any strong, flexible suede. Cut the length down to size, then trim the width down to about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).
You could also vary the look of this collar by using nylon webbing, leather strip material, canvas strip material, or durable ribbon. Make sure that the material is strong enough to hold its form yet flexible enough to bend with ease.

, Snip 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide braided stretch elastic down to a length of about 2 inches (5 cm) using sharp scissors.


The elastic can be anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) wide, but it should not be wider than the width of the suede strip. Only use elastic band material; do not use elastic cords or elastic thread.

, Using super glue, adhere one side of the elastic strip to the ""wrong"" side of the suede strip at one end. Glue the other side of the elastic strip to the ""wrong"" side at the opposite end.


Overlap the elastic and the suede by about 3/4 inch (2 cm) on each side. When finished, there should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of excess elastic showing between the ends of the suede.
Allow the glue to dry completely before you handle the collar further.

, If desired, write your phone number on the side of the collar using permanent marker.


This will enable anyone who finds your cat to call you and report your cat's whereabouts should it ever go missing. Make sure that you can read the printed information on the side of the collar, then let the ink dry.

, Once the glue and marker are completely dry, stretch the collar over your cat's head and around its neck.


Check the fit. You should be able to fit two fingers in between the collar and the cat's neck once the collar is around the neck.
Note that the elastic should stretch enough to fit over your cat's head, but it should not need to stretch at all once the collar rests around your cat's neck.

Let the igloo dry.",How to Make a Cardboard Cat Igloo," You will need a clear table or a workbench, a box cutter and possibly some cardboard scissors. Although you can complete the job with box cutters, a good pair of cardboard scissors, such as Fiskars or Canary scissors, may make the job a little easier., An igloo is a traditional type of home that is made from blocks of ice, which are stacked on top of one another. It is traditionally dome shaped, with a circular floor area and one entrance. Instead of blocks of ice, you will be using layers of cardboard. However, the basic dome shape and single entrance will be the same for your cat igloo.To make the dome shape, you will have to vary the size of the layers of cardboard., If you are designing a unique cat igloo, you will need to determine the dimensions for the outer diameter (outside walls), inner diameter (inner walls) and opening or door to the igloo.Design it so that your cat has enough room to crawl and move around in the igloo.


The inner diameter should be at least 37.5 centimeters (15 inches)., The first six layers should gradually increase in size and will form the floor of the igloo. Since these layers form the floor, you will not need to cutout the inside diameter. In other words, there are no inner diameters to consider for the first six layers., You want to make the igloo wide enough so that your cat can easily enter and exit the building. Take the opening into account when designing layers 7-27.From layer 7-16, the size of the opening should gradually expand. At layer 7, the width should be 15.7 centimetres (6.18 inches). The largest width, at layer 16, should be 20 centimetres (7.8 inches).
From layer 17-27, the width of the opening should gradually decrease until it is about 4 centimetres at layer 27.

, The walls of the igloo are comprised of layers 7-39 of cardboard. You want to design the walls so that they slowly expand and then decrease in diameter.


Layers 7-16 should gradually increase in size to create a roomy interior. For these layers, you will need to cut out the interior diameter so that the inside of your igloo is empty. While increasing the diameter of each successive layer, you will need to maintain a consistent wall thickness of approximately 10 cm (3.9 inches).Layers 17-39 should decrease in size to create the dome shape. Once you get to layer 17, start decreasing the diameter of each layer. This will give your igloo a dome shape., The roof of the igloo is comprised of layers 40-45. For these layers, you will not need to cut out the inner diameter. Blocks of cardboard should be stacked on top of one another to form a solid roof.

, Use a large compass to draw these dimensions directly onto the cardboard. After drawing the specific dimensions, write the number of the layer on the sheet so that you know where to place it during the construction phase.For the first six layers and the last five layers, you will just need to draw out the outer diameter.
For layers 7-27, you will need to draw the outer diameter, inner diameter and the entrance dimensions.
For layers 28-39, you will need to draw the outer and inner diameter.
If you do not own a compass, you could make your own compass by attaching two clamps to a small piece of 1’’ by 3’’ wood. Place a screw under one of the clamps for the center of the compass and then a pencil under the other clamp for drawing the circles.If you make a regular size cat igloo, you will need about forty five layers of cardboard.

, Use the cardboard scissors or box cutters to cut each layer of cardboard. If you are using the box cutters, remember to cut away from you, so that you don’t injure yourself. Cut along the lines you have drawn for the outer and inner diameter of the igloo. Depending on the layer, you will also need to cut out the entrance., To determine the accuracy of your work, you should stack the layers of your igloo prior to applying any glue. Following the numbers you have assigned to each layer, stack the cardboard layers in the appropriate order. After stacking each layer, you should have a dome shaped structure with a central entranceway., If everything looks good, you can go ahead and glue each layer together. Cover the top of the first layer with paper glue and then place the second layer on top. Then, cover the top of the second layer with glue and place layer three on top. Repeat this process until you have glued together all of the layers of your cat igloo., To compress the igloo and improve the drying process, you can place a few books or other heavy objects on top of the igloo. This also helps ensure adequate contact between the layers of cardboard., Leave the igloo for a few hours to let it dry. If it is a cold day or there is not a lot of air circulation, you could turn on a fan in the room where you are working.To determine the correct drying time, read the label on the glue you are using, such as tacky glue, school glue or super glue.

Attach the ring and other clasp half to the opposite end.,
Put the collar on your cat.",How to Make a Cat Collar2," Cut a piece of fabric measuring about 15 inches (38 cm) long and 1-1/2 inches (4 cm) wide.


To save some time, you could use 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide double-fold bias tape instead of regular fabric. Cut it to a length of 15 inches (38 cm). Skip the folding step of the process, and proceed directly to the stitching step.

, Fold the long edges of the fabric toward the center until the meet along the lengthwise middle. Fold the strip again along this lengthwise center, hiding the raw edges inside.


The first folds should be made with the wrong sides together and the right sides facing out.
Use an iron to press and crease each fold after making it. This is important; if you don't press the material, it won't lie flat around your cat's neck.

, Using a sewing machine, top stitch along the open length of the strip. A standard straight stitch should suffice.


Place the line of stitching as close to the open edge as possible.
You can stitch down both the open and folded sides of the length for the sake of uniformity, if desired, but doing so is not necessary to hold the collar together.

, Weave one end of the fabric strip around the bar of an adjuster ring. Pull about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of material through the ring, and sew it to itself on the opposite side.


Essentially, you're folding the end of the strip over by 1 inch (2.5 cm) and positioning the adjuster bar inside the fold.
Fold the raw edge in between the overlapping layers of material by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm), then stitch the overlap in place at the open end.
If any raw edges are still visible from beneath the fold, dab a small spot of seam sealant over them to prevent the edges from fraying.

, With the ""wrong"" side of the collar facing up, slide the hooked end of the breakaway clasp through the opposite end of the fabric strip.


Weave the end up through the portion of the clasp closest to the teeth, over the bar, and back down through the opposite side.
Pull the clasp along the length of the fabric strip until it is 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) away from the adjuster ring.

, Pull the free, unattached end of the fabric strip through the adjuster ring.


The strip should come up from beneath the ring, over the bar and the attached material, and back down through the other open end.
Slide the fabric strip through the adjuster ring until only 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of material remain. This remaining material will overlap the material attached to the adjuster ring bar. Note that the threaded half of the breakaway clasp should sit at the center of this doubled material.

, Slip a metal D-ring down 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the open strip end. Thread the opposite end of the breakaway clasp 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) above it at the same end. Sew that end in place.


The rounded portion of the ring should face toward the ""right"" side of the fabric.
Fold the strap ""wrong"" sides together so that the end overlaps around the bar of the clasp. Fold 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the raw edge between the two layers, then stitch the layers down.
Use seam sealant to secure any visible raw edge that remains, if applicable.

, The collar is finished, and you should be able to snap it around your cat's neck. Adjust the length to size by pulling material through the adjuster ring.


You should be able to slip two fingers between the collar and your cat's neck when the collar is sized correctly.

Carefully cut just beneath the seam on the side facing the body side of the shirt (not the collar side). Cut as close as possible to the seam without cutting through it.

, Dab a thin line of seam sealant over the raw, cut edge of the collar to prevent any fraying.


Let the seam sealant dry completely before you continue.

, Cut a 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide strip of nylon webbing to a length 1 inch (2.5 cm) wider than the circumference of your cat's neck.


You can measure the nylon webbing directly against your cat's neck or use a soft measuring tape to take the measurement. Either way, the cut piece of nylon webbing should be wrap around your cat's neck loosely, allowing you to fit two fingers between it and your cat.
Alternatively, you can skip the nylon webbing and use an old collar that has been previously fitted to the circumference of your cat's neck.

, Draw a line of fabric glue or hot glue down the length of the webbing, then press the webbing to the inside of the shirt collar.


Lay the unbuttoned collar on a flat surface with the ""wrong"" side facing up and the folds pointing down.
Place the glue on the nylon webbing, then press the webbing onto the wrong side of the collar adhesive-side down. The ends of the webbing should lie just to the insides of the button and button hole.
You can pinch and fold the collar to match the length of the webbing, if necessary, but you should not fold the webbing to match the length of the the collar.
Let everything dry completely before continuing.

, Once the glue dries, wrap the collar around your cat's neck with the webbing-side facing in. Button the front together to hold the collar in place.

Brush your cat’s teeth.",How to Care for a Havana Brown Cat1," Havanas have a beautiful, silky brown coat. The type of fur makes it easy to take care of without any special care. Brush your Havana Brown’s coat weekly with a rubber brush to spread the natural oils and keep them look neat.Consider shining your cat’s coat with your hands, a chamois cloth, or silk scarf.The Havana Brown doesn’t shed very much.;
, Proper nail maintenance is part of caring for your Havana. To trim your cat’s nails, make your cat comfortable and make sure they are in a calm mood. Hold the cat in your lap by wrapping your more dominant hand around the cat’s upper body. With your free hand, gently hold one paw and carefully press on it. The claws should extend. Use your dominant hand to trim the nails.


You need to use cat nail clippers, which can be found online or at a pet store. There are two types, scissor clippers and guillotine clippers.
Avoid cutting the quick when you cut the nail. The quick is the living tissue part of your cat's claw. You can see it underneath or through the top of the nail. The quick is the pink triangle part of the nail. Only cut the clear bits of nail, not the pink part.

, Wipe your cat's ears often to remove dirt and buildup. Check the ears once each week to see if they are clean. A clean ear will be pink and odorless. If the ear is dirty, it will be darker because of dirt or debris. It may smell.Dampen a cotton ball. Gently rub the inside of your cat’s ear to remove any dirt or debris.

, Help promote a healthy mouth for your Havana Brown by brushing their teeth often. Use cat toothpaste and a cat toothbrush with soft bristles. Never use human toothpaste on a cat because the fluoride is poisonous.You need to get your cat used to the toothpaste before you brush their teeth. Start by letting the cat taste the toothpaste. Place a small amount of toothpaste on your finger and let the cat lick it. When your cat gets used to the taste of the toothpaste, start rubbing your finger along their gums.
After your car is used to the feel of you rubbing their gums, carefully drag a toothbrush with toothpaste along the gums. Work the bristles along the teeth in slow, tiny circles. Continue this until your cat allows you to brush their teeth.

Give the cat a calm environment.",How to Care for a Korat," This cat has short hair that doesn't tangle or mat, and therefore, it doesn't need daily brushing. Brushing once a week is usually enough. Brushing the cat helps remove dead hair so that your cat doesn't ingest it.In springtime, you may have to brush the cat more often as it is getting rid of its winter coat.You'll only need to bathe this cat if it gets dirty.;
, Brushing a cat's teeth is not as difficult as it sounds. You'll need to start by getting a cat-specific toothbrush and toothpaste. You shouldn't use your own toothpaste, as some ingredients may be poisonous to cats.Your cat isn't going to like the idea at first. Begin by lifting its lips and just touching the gums. You can use your finger, the toothbrush, or a cotton swab. Do this action a couple of times a day to get your cat adjusted to the idea.
Move on to the toothpaste. Let your cat smell it or lick it. It should be a flavor the cat likes. Put some on the toothbrush, and apply it gently to the teeth. You may need a couple of sessions to get all of the cat's teeth., A cat's claws get too long and need regular trimming. Of course, most cats don't love having their claws trimmed, but if you make it a regular practice, it won't be too bad for you or the cat.To get your cat used to the idea, start by just holding your cat's paws several times during the day.
When it comes time to trim the claws, you may need to try several positions before finding one that works for you. For instance, you can hold the cat in the crook of your arm while trimming, or you can have the cat in your lap facing outwards. Sometimes, having another person can help.
Be sure to only trim the tip of the nail. You'll see a pink nerve/blood vessel running through the nail. Don't clip that, as it's painful for the cat and will cause the nail to bleed.
Be patient. It may take several tries to get every nail.

, Your cat's ears will need to be cleaned but only when they get dirty. Look inside for wax and other debris buildup. If they're dirty, use a bit of cleaner (ask the vet) on a cotton ball, and rub it on the inside of the ear, moving it towards the tip to remove the wax., As with any pet, this cat should visit the vet regularly. Establishing a vet while your cat is still a kitten can help acclimate your cat to the process. Plus, most cats will not show symptoms of many diseases until they are advanced, so regular checkups help keep your cat healthy.

, When picking out a food for your cat, look for foods that have protein (meat, fish, or meat byproducts) in the first few ingredients. Because cats are obligate carnivores, they primarily get their calories from meat.The food should also be about 20 percent fat and 25 to 30 percent protein.When picking out foods, get ones appropriate to each age. A kitten should eat kitten food, while a senior cat should have food formulated for it.
The term ""meat byproducts"" can be off-putting. However, it's perfectly healthy for your cat to eat, as it is mainly things like fatty tissue and organs. It may have bone in it, as well, but it won't have feet or fur.
If you're unsure what to pick, choose a food with a seal from the Association of the American Food Control Officials (AAFCO). This certification means the food is balanced for your cat's diet.

, Obesity in cats can lead to health problems, and the Korat can suffer from this issue just like any cat. Your cat only needs 20 calories per each pound of weight to stay the same size. Therefore, a 7 pound cat only needs 140 calories a day to stay the same weight. When thinking about calories, don't forget to consider any treats you feed your cat.To put your cat on a diet, lower the cat's intake by 40 calories a day.

, Cats are clean creatures, and they prefer to have a clean litter box when using the bathroom. You wouldn't like to wade through sewage to use the bathroom, and your cat feels the same way. Try to scoop the litter box once a day if you have clumping litter, and change the whole thing once a week or every other week. For clay litter, you may need to change it out a couple of times a week., A health guarantee is important anytime you're buying a specialized breed like the Korat. However, it's especially important with Korats, as they have a genetic disposition to GM-1 and GM-2 gangliosidosis, which is a fatal condition. This disease can be tested for in the parents, which is why a health guarantee is important. When buying a cat from a breeder, ask for the health guarantee before finishing the purchase., On average, Korats have lower body fat than other cats. For the most part, that will not present a problem. However, if your cat needs anethesia, the vet may need to adjust how much the cat gets due to this issue., These cats often attach themselves to a single person, though sometimes they divide between two people. They tend to follow their ""person"" around, often wanting attention. They won't ignore other people; they just have a preference for a certain person. In other words, expect an affectionate cat, and be prepared to be affectionate back., Because these cats are so affectionate, they need a lot of attention. If you expect to leave the cat home alone during the day, providing animal companionship, such as another cat (particularly a Korat), will help keep this cat happier., These cats are smart and energetic, and they love to play when they aren't cuddling. Puzzle toys are a great option for these cats, the kind that will release treats as they play. Of course, other small toys and lure toys you use to play with the cat are also good options.You can also probably teach this cat to play fetch., Generally, these cats prefer a quiet environment. They aren't skittish exactly, but if there are too many loud sounds, these cats will likely hide for a while. That being said, they do usually like children, even with the noise."

Start as young as possible.If you have the option, start crate training your cat very early.,
Allow your cat to get used to the crate.,
Acclimate the cat to a closed crate.,
Travel to positive locations at first.,
Get the right sized crate.,
Clean the crate.,
Provide familiar bedding.,
Give treats and toys.,
Use feline pheromones.,
Position the crate.,
Hold the cat correctly.,
Place the cat in the crate.,
Close the crate and reposition it.",How to Help Your Cat Love His Crate," A small kitten will adapt easier to a crate than an adult cat that has a lifetime of crate distrust built up.


However, starting crate training early in life is not always possible and that shouldn't dissuade you from trying. Just because you have an adult cat, for instance, that doesn't mean it can't grow to love its crate.;
, If you don't want your cat to be fearful in its crate, then the cat needs to be allowed to get used to the crate at times when it is not traveling. Place the crate, with its door open, in your home on a permanent basis and let your cat explore it.The goal is to make the crate somewhere that the cat willingly hangs out and takes shelter.


Do not force the cat into the crate. This will only give it negative feelings about the crate. The cat needs to go in on its own accord.
To lure your cat towards the crate, put familiar bedding and a treat or your cat's favorite toy inside.
Allow the cat to go inside, get the treat or toy, and then leave the crate without interference. Do not close the door. After you do this several times, the cat will begin to trust the crate as a location where good things happen.

, The hardest part of getting your cat to love its crate can be getting it used to a closed crate. Confinement can be hard for many animals, and add the stress of travel to that and your cat could have bad associations with a closed crate. So, the goal is to make your cat feel like the crate is a safe haven instead of a dangerous trap.


Begin closing the crate door momentarily while the cat is inside. Do this only briefly at first, as extended confinement immediately can make your cat panic.
Begin to lengthen the amount of time the door is closed. Always stay right there and reassure your cat that all is well.
Finally, close the crate door and then lift up the crate. If your cat remains calm, move the crate outside to the car. If you work up to this gradually, your cat is more likely to remain calm., You do not want your cat to assume that it is going to the vet every time it gets in its crate. To accomplish this, you need to take your cat to pleasant places the first couple times you take it in the car in its crate.For example, put the cat in its crate in the car, drive around briefly, and then return home. Give the cat a treat once you return home. Do this several times so that it connects a car ride with getting a treat.

, Your cat will never love its crate if that crate is too small for its body. A cat should be able to stand up and turn around in a crate. Also, it shouldn't be hard for you to physically fit the cat in the crate.Even if you have a crate that is the right size, a cat that is resistant to getting in a crate can make it hard for you. With this in mind, just make sure that your cat have some extra room around it when sitting in its crate.
Most crates that are sold at pet stores or online will provide a general weight range that will fit comfortably in the crate. Take this into consideration when buying a crate.

, Bad smells and uncleanliness can make the crate very unattractive to your cat. Take the time to wash your cat's crate regularly. Use soap and water to scrub it down, remembering to clean all surfaces. Then thoroughly rinse off the soap.


A crate can be especially unattractive to a cat if it has the smells of other cats on it. If you borrow a crate or get a used crate, be sure to wash is very thoroughly before attempting to put your cat in it.

, In order to make the crate more comfortable, provide a soft surface to sit or lay on that has comforting smells. A piece of familiar bedding, such as a blanket that the cat lays on normally, can go a long way towards making a crate more comfortable.Make sure that the bedding does not take up too much space in your cat's crate. You want to assure that your cat has enough room to move around in its cage comfortably and too much bedding can limit that movement.

, Once again, make your cat comfortable by providing items that it is used to. The cat's favorite toy or a treat that it always goes wild for will help it to remain calm and embrace the crate as a safe and happy place.Messy treats in the crate are not a good idea. You want to limit the treats to ones that will not get all over the cat and make a mess that the cat will dislike.

, There are feline pheromone products that are sold at many pet stores and online that can calm your cat down while it's in its carrier. These pheromones decrease the cat's anxiety and relax it by making the smell of the carrier familiar.Most feline pheromone products need to be sprayed in the crate a length of time before placing the cat inside, for instance many need to be sprayed a half hour before contact with the cat. Plan ahead for this time requirement so that you can use pheromones before you need to take the cat somewhere.

, It is easiest to get a cat in a carrier if the door is on the top of it. This allows you to set the cat down into the crate instead of having to angle it in sideways. If you have a crate with a door on the side, place it on its back so that the door faces up.Be sure that when you place the crate so that the door faces up that it is still stable and won't tip over easily. This may mean that you need to lean it up against a wall for stability.

, To get your cat into its crate you need to have a firm hold on the cat but you don't want to hold it so tight that it tries to escape. To do this, support the cat's chest with one hand and its rear legs with the other hand. This will allow you to control its body easily.If your cat is really resistant to being picked up, you may need to restrain it a bit to get it in the crate. Wrap the cat in a towel so that its legs are immobilized before picking it up and putting it in its crate., Lower your cat into its crate feet first. Since you have its feet under control, this should be relatively easy. Once your cat's rear end is at the bottom of the carrier, you can let go of its feet and chest.


As you lower it down, be sure to keep control of the cat so that it doesn't fall and hurt itself.

, Once the cat is in the carrier you should close and lock the door so that the cat can't escape. You will also need to place the carrier on its bottom if you repositioned it to get the cat in.If your cat is doing well and not trying to escape, give it a treat to reinforce the good behavior.

Decide what information you want to print.,
Include a personal message.,
Add a rabies vaccination tag.,
Buy online.,
Go to the pet store.,
Look into ID tag accessories.,
Decide if a microchip is right for your cat.,
Have the chip implanted.,
Update your information.",How to Get an ID Tag for Your Cat," At minimum, your cat’s tag should include your cat’s name as well as a phone number where you can be reached. If possible, it is also helpful to include the city in which you live in case your cat happens to get far from home.Make the phone number on your cat’s ID tag one that you are able to answer most of the time. Include your mobile phone number on the tag if you have one.
Make sure any phone number is connected to an answering machine or voicemail service in case you are unable to get to your phone at certain moments.
If the tag has space and if you are comfortable with it, you may want to consider adding your address to the tag. This is especially useful for indoor cats should they escape.;
, You may want to consider adding a personal message on the backside of your tag, or purchasing an additional tag letting others know whether your cat is an indoor or an outdoor cat. This can help others assess whether they need to call you if they see your cat near home and in good health.A message for an indoor cat may read, “If you find me, I am lost. Please call my owner.”
A message for an outdoor cat could include, “I can go outside. Please only call if sick or injured.”

, In addition to a customized ID tag, you may want to consider attaching your cat’s rabies vaccine tag to their collar. The ID number on the vaccine tag can sometimes be cross-referenced by a vet to pull up your contact information should the normal ID tag get lost.A new rabies vaccine tag should be given to you whenever you get your cat vaccinated. If one is not provided upon checkout, ask the vet or technician that administered the vaccine for a new tag.

, Tags can easily be purchased and customized online through a number of websites, including online retailers like GoTags, and websites for pet stores such as Petco and Petsmart. Online orders generally cost about as much as in-store purchases, and sometimes enable a greater degree of customization.Many online retailers have a wider selection of tag colors and styles than will be available in stores.
Online orders will take longer than in-store orders as most stores have same-day engraving, while online orders will need to ship.

, Most pet stores have machines where customers can buy tags directly. Typically, a customer will buy tokens or credits for the machine at the register, then use the tokens or credits with the machine to choose and customize the tag.Machines are generally able to engrave quickly, with the tag ready in three to five minutes after the ID information is input.

, Many pet stores and online retailers that sell cat ID tags also sell accessories to help increase your cat’s safety and visibility. Consider investing in an accessory such as a GPS tag, which can help you track your cat’s real-time location if they escape, or a bell to help keep wildlife away while your cat is outside.A GPS tag can help identify the overall region your cat is in, but it may not be able to pinpoint an exact location to within a few feet. It is still important to have an ID tag to offer your cat the best security and chance of returning home.
Bells are easily purchased at the pet store or craft store. Look for one that does not have tapering slots where your cat's claws could get caught.

, In addition to an ID tag, your vet can almost painlessly implant a small microchip in between your cat’s shoulders. This chip can be read by any vet, rescue, or even pet store with a scanner, and can pull up detailed records regarding your pet and your contact information.Unlike tags on collars, microchips are permanent and cannot be snagged or broken off while your cat is wandering around.
Microchip service providers allow you options to include more information than you can generally fit on tag, such as contact information for a second individual if you cannot be reached, as well as vet information.
Remember that a microchip works best in addition to an ID tag. Since they can only be read with a machine, an ID tag is still the fastest way for the average concerned citizen to reach you if they find your cat.

, Microchipping is a fast and near-painless process that can be done by most any vet. Set an appointment with your cat’s vet and bring them in to be microchipped as soon as your vet has open availability.The chip is implanted through a fast injection, no different in process than a routine vaccination.
The cost of implantation will vary depending upon the chip brand and your vet’s fee structure, but often the procedure is around $45.

, Once the chip is implanted, use the chip servicer’s website to make sure the chip displays the most accurate information. Go online and fill out as much information as you can provide, including your cat’s name, your name, your contact information, and information for a secondary contact.Remember to update tags or microchip information every time you move or get a new phone number.

Choose a scratching post that is tall.,
Make sure the post is stable.,
Select a texture that your cat will like.,
Get more than one post.",How to Get Your Cat to Use a Scratching Post1," Cats need to be able to reach up as high as they can to scratch and stretch. If the scratching post is too short, your cat may not even look at it. The post should be high enough to allow your cat to stand on her back legs and reach above her head with her front paws.;
, To make sure your cat’s scratching post is stable, try fixing it to a surface or making sure the post has a sturdy base so it won’t budge when the cat scratches it. If your cat feels the post move or shift, she won't feel secure and may refuse to use the post.


Scratching boards which you lean against a wall or hang like a picture are unpopular with most cats.

, Individual cats favor different textures to scratch on. If you are not sure what your cat likes, a good starter scratcher is natural rope wound around a sturdy column.Avoid plastic ropes or artificial fibers because these materials can create static, which cats dislike.
If your cat likes to scratch carpet, then consider nailing a piece of carpet to a sturdy post.
Other textures to consider trying include corrugated cardboard, and cloth.

, Chances are that your cat likes to scratch in more than just one spot, so plan to purchase or create more than one scratching post in your house. Having multiple posts will ensure that your cat always has access to a scratching post where ever she is. Having multiple posts is even more important if you have multiple cats."

Place the posts somewhere that your cat can access them with ease.,
Make your cat’s favorite piece of furniture unappealing.,
Clap your hands to discourage your cat from scratching.,
Make scratching posts more attractive to your cat.",How to Get Your Cat to Use a Scratching Post2," For maximum use, place the posts where the cat is going to get ""value"" from using it as a territory marker. Good places for a scratching posts include near entrances or exits, near a window, or in front of an object she already favors as a scratching post.Do NOT place the post in an inconspicuous, out of the way place. Your cat will ignore it.
Make sure that the post is positioned in a way that your cat likes to scratch. For example, if your cat prefers to scratch vertical surfaces, like the side of the sofa, make sure that the post is in a vertical position.Cats often like to scratch after waking up, so place a scratching post near your cat’s favorite napping spot as well.

, If your cat likes to scratch furniture, consider wrapping the part she likes to scratch in tin foil or double sided sticky tape. Cats hate the feel of tin foil and sticky surfaces so it should discourage your cat from scratching.You can also cover the sofa with rugs, but this can be an imperfect solution because your cat may just start scratching the rugs.

, If you catch your cat in the act of scratching something she should not be scratching, clap your hands loudly to interrupt the behavior. Do not yell at your cat or punish her physically. Just pick up your cat and take her to the scratching post. Doing this will give her the idea that you want her to scratch there., You can make scratching posts more attractive to your cat using her own scent or some catnip. Try showing your cat how to use a post by rubbing her paws on it or rub some catnip into the scratching post to draw her attention to it. Encourage your cat to use the post by making gentle scratching motions with her paws on the post. Doing so will help to add her scent to the post make her more likely to use it. Make sure that you praise your cat while you do this.
Try spritzing the scratching post with Feliway. Feliway is a synthetic feline pheromone that makes cats feel safe and secure. It also amplifies her scent signals, which she will appreciate."

Understand that cats communicate using scent.,
Know that some cats have a specific preference for scratching places.,
Recognize that scratching is a form of stretching exercise for cats.,
Be aware that cats often prefer to scratch surfaces that feel pleasant.",How to Get Your Cat to Use a Scratching Post3," Cats have scent glands on the backs of their paws. The pads of their feet also produce sweat that has a unique scent. Cats often communicate by reading the smells around them.A cat will scent mark her territory to let other cats know she is around, to tell other cats when she was last there, and to make herself feel safe and secure.

, Cats like to scent mark vertical surfaces at or around nose height (to maximize the signal for other cats). They also like to scent mark entrances and exits because other cats may have to pass that way in order to get into the territory.

, Cats also scratch as a way to stretch their muscles. As cats scratch, they are stretching the muscles in their back and legs, which feels nice to them. It is similar to the way that we stretch in the morning or after sitting for a long time., Cats like to scratch surfaces that feel nice under their paws. That is why some cats will end up shredding a nice piece of furniture or an expensive rug. Scratching acts as a kind of stress reliever, so it is necessary for them to engage in it.Try to provide a substitute scratcher with a similar texture to your cat's preferred scratching surface.

When choosing a room for your cat, try to make it one that does not get much traffic from the rest of your household, especially from guests.If you have dogs, you want to make sure that they do not have access to the cat room, as your cat will probably use the room as a way to escape from the dogs. To do this, install a small cat door that is big enough for your cat, but not for your dogs. You can also block the area off with a gate that your cat can jump over, but your dogs cannot.
If you don't have room in your house to devote a room 100% to your cat, try sharing a quiet room with her. It's fine for you to be in the room with her from time to time. A laundry room or seldom-used office would work nicely.;
, Remove anything from the room that may cause a potential hazard for your cat. This includes cords and wires, toxic plants, and anything else that you don't want your cat to put in her mouth.If you need to store cleaning products or other potentially toxic substances in the room, make sure they are in a cabinet that closes securely so that your cat will not be able to access them.
You should also remove anything that your cat might be able to knock over, or at least secure it somehow. If you want to keep knickknacks on shelves or tables in the room, consider securing them to a surface with removable museum putty so your cat can't knock them over.

, Cats tend to feel more secure when they are able to sit on a high perch and observe their surroundings from above. Many cats also enjoy enjoy snuggling up out of view in a cozy hiding spot.


You can buy cat trees from the store to provide your cat with perches, or you can build your own with some wood and scrap pieces of carpet.
Tall pieces of furniture can also serve as perches as long as your cat is able to jump high enough to get on top of them. If your cat isn't a great jumper, place a shorter piece of furniture, like a small table, next to the higher piece for her to use as a step.
Good hiding places can be behind or under a piece of furniture, inside the enclosure of a store-bought cat condo, or even inside a cardboard box. Your cat might appreciate it if you put a cat bed or a soft blanket in her favorite hiding spot.
Providing your cat with multiple options for places to perch and hide is ideal.

, Especially if you have other animals in your house, your cat will feel much more secure if everything she needs is in her safe place. Provide food, water, and a litter box in the cat room.Some cats may not want their food, water, and litter box too close to one another. Try to scatter them around the room as much as possible.
If possible, give your cat multiple options for places to use the litter box and drink water. Providing these amenities both inside and outside of the cat room would be ideal. In general, it is best to provide one water bowl and litter box for each cat you have, plus one extra.
If you spend a lot of time away from your house, you may want to consider automating your cat room. You can purchase feeders that dispense a set amount of dry cat food at a specified time each day, water fountains that circulate and filter your cat's drinking water, and even self-cleaning litter boxes.
Providing at least one scratching post is also a good idea, as this will hopefully discourage your cat from clawing other items around your house.

, Looking outside can be very stimulating to your cat, so make sure there is a window in your cat room and that your cat is able to sit in the window sill.


If the sill is not large enough for your cat, place a piece of furniture or a shelf directly beneath the window for your cat to sit on. You can also purchase cat perches that are specifically designed to be attached to windows.Cats also love windows because they let in the sunshine. Cater to your cat's love of the sun by providing soft places to sleep in areas where the sun shines at different times of the day.
Large windows, particularly full-length windows and glass doors, might make your cat feel uncomfortable in her space if there are cats or other animals outside. You can make her feel safer by applying an opaque film to the bottom of the window and providing her with a perch from which she can look out the top part of the window, or by placing other items, such as plants or pieces of furniture, in front of the window for your cat to hide behind if necessary.

, If possible, let your indoor cat enjoy the outdoors safely by giving her access to an enclosed outdoor pen or ""catio"". Position the pen directly outside the cat room and install a cat door to allow your cat to come and go as she pleases.


You can purchase or build an outdoor cat pen, but make absolutely sure that it is secure enough so that your cat cannot get out and no other animals can get in.If you can't give your cat an outdoor enclosure, you can still provide her with some plants to help make her feel like she is outside. Cats like to munch on plants, so be absolutely sure that you choose varieties that are safe for cats. Cat grass is probably the best option, and it's easy to grow yourself., Indoor cats can get bored if they are not provided with stimulating activities. To keep your cat active and entertained, make sure she has a variety of things to do.


Make climbing a challenging activity by providing a variety of perches and shelves around the room at different heights. If possible, create a climbing course that allows your cat to navigate the entire perimeter of the room without touching the floor.Scatter lots of small cat toys, like toy mice, around the room, or place them in a basket that is easy to access for your cat.
Puzzle toys are a great way to keep your cat busy. You can hide treats or toys in them and your cat will need to figure out how to get them out.You can also purchase high-tech toys that are motion-activated or move randomly to keep your cat's stalking instincts sharp.To keep things interesting, move things around and add new challenges on a regular basis.Keep in mind that cats don't need expensive toys to be entertained. A winding tunnel made out of a series of cardboard boxes could provide hours of fun! Be creative.

, Your cat won't really care what the room looks like, as long as it has plenty of cat-friendly elements, so this part is for you. Paint the room a fun color and decorate the walls with hearts, fish, mice, or nature pictures.


Wall decals, removable wall paper, and stencils are all relatively inexpensive ways to add some interest to an otherwise boring wall.

, The flooring that is already in your room may be fine, but if you need new flooring, make sure that it is cat friendly. You will want to choose something that is durable and easy to keep clean.


If your cat tends to have accidents outside of her litter box, you should probably avoid carpet and hardwood flooring. Tile, vinyl, and linoleum are much easier to clean. If you are converting a room with a concrete floor, such as a basement laundry room, you can also apply an epoxy finish to the floor.
If the flooring you choose is cold and hard, like tile, consider adding some inexpensive and machine-washable throw rugs.

, Attach pictures to a bulletin board, frame them, or attach poster-sized printouts of your cat to your walls.


To enhance the cat theme, add some extra posters and knickknacks with pictures of cats, paw prints, or fish. If you have shelves, you can adorn them with books about cats.

, You probably want to make your cat room comfortable for humans as well so that you can spend some time cuddling and playing with your cat. Make sure to put a comfortable couch or chair in the room.


You can also add a television if you plan on spending time in the room with your cat.
Remember to keep the cat room quiet and calm. It's fine for you to visit her, but don't invite lots of friends to hang out in the cat room.
When you are in the cat room, let your cat come to you instead of removing her from her perch or hiding spot.

, If your cat room also serves another purpose and you don't want to look at a litter box, find a creative way to keep it out of site. You can put it behind a decorative screen or create an enclosure for it. You can even disguise the enclose as a piece of furniture.

Do not submerge the base in water., How frequently you perform a basic cleaning will depend on the number of cats that you have and how well you can manage the odor of a dirty box. If you see any signs that the waste drawer is full, empty it. Otherwise perform a cleaning about every month., There should be a long, flexible filter that fits against the side of the waste drawer that faces out from the base. This helps prevent odors from escaping. When the litter box begins to smell, call the manufacturer or visit their website to order a replacement.Each filter should last a few months, but how often you replace it will depend, in part, on your own personal preferences.
Neither the carbon filter nor the brush seal are essential for the operation of the litter robot. They will, however, reduce the odor.

, There is also a seal, that looks like a brush, which wraps around the inside of the base, where it meets the globe. When the box begins to smell, call the manufacturer to order a replacement of the brush seal."

Use a stiff brush.,
Vacuum the post.,
Clean up any further cat fur.,
Spot clean the post in the moment.,
Clean pee with an odor-neutralizer.,
Disinfect the whole thing.,
Try a carpet or steam cleaner.,
Put it in the sunlight.,
Let it dry.",How to Clean a Cat Scratching Post," A stiff cleaning brush can help loosen and remove dirt and cat hair on the post. Go up and down the post, moving the brush in short, heavy strokes across it. Pick up any loose cat hair that comes off and throw it away., Start by vacuuming the post. You obviously can't go over the post with the whole vacuum if you only have a standup vacuum. Use an attachment, and go over it inch by inch. An attachment with a brush on the end can be helpful. A handheld vacuum also work., If you still see cat hairs, try rubbing a fabric softener sheet up and down the post. The sheet coats the hairs in fabric softener, making them release from the post more easily. Vacuum again after you do this step.You can also use a damp washcloth. Rub it up and down the surface to help capture hairs. Pick off the hairs, or vacuum again.
Try a lint roller to pick up hairs.
You can also use other methods to loosen hairs. For instance, put a cup of water and a half a cup of fabric softener in a spray bottle. Spray it on the post to loosen hairs. Once it dries, you can vacuum it.

, When your cat has created a mess on the post in the form of a vomit or a hairball, it's best to clean it right away. It's easier to pick up when it's still wet.Wipe up the mess with a wet washcloth. Pick a cat-safe disinfectant, available at pet stores. Make sure it doesn't have citrus in it, as that will turn your cat off the post.
Spray the disinfectant on. Let it soak in, then wipe it off along with the mess.

, If your cat has peed on the scratcher, that presents a bit more of a problem. It's best to use a cleaner that's designed to neutralize urine odors, especially if your cat is male. You can find these cleaners at big box stores or at your pet store. Make sure it is marked for soft as well as hard surfaces and doesn't have a citrus odor.You can also use one part vinegar to three parts water to help clean and neutralize the smell, but the commercial product will probably do more good.Start by blotting up the stain with paper towels. Get as much up as you can.
Follow the instructions for the commercial product. Generally, though, spray the cleaner on, saturating the spot. Let it sit for a few minutes, then blot up the cleaner.

, You can also spray on a disinfectant to clean the whole post. When picking out a disinfectant, remember to get one suitable for pets. In addition, make sure you pick one that's right for the surfaces you're attacking.For instance, pick a carpet cleaner if you have a carpet post.
Carpet cleaner may also work on rope scratchers, as they have similar characteristics.
Follow the cleaner's directions. Usually, though, you spray it on and let it sit. Once it's sat for a while, wipe it off with a clean, wet rag, then let it dry.

, Another option is using a carpet or steam cleaner to clean the post. If you're using a carpet cleaner, make sure to pick a shampoo that's cat friendly.With the carpet cleaner, use the upholstery attachment. Work in the shampoo with the carpet cleaner, then use it to rinse with clean water.With a steamer, it's best to use one that's meant for upholstery. Run it up and down the post to steam it clean.

, Let the scratching post sit outside in the sunlight. The sunlight can help bleach out odors, and being outside will help get rid of odors, too. The sunlight will also lightly disinfect it. Just be sure all sides get equal sunlight by turning it, and leave it out there at least 3 or 4 hours., Before giving it back to the cat, let the cat scratching post dry. Keep it out of the way until it's dry in a safe place. A closet or a closed bathroom is a good option.

Try a cat tree.,
Hang cat shelves on your walls.,
Encourage your cat to climb on existing furniture.,
Create a path across vertical surfaces.",How to Create More Space for Your Cat1," A cat tree is an easy way to create vertical space for your cat. You can purchase a simple cat tree at your local pet supply store. You can also build a cat tree for your feline friend. For example, you can build a cat tree using old dresser drawers, wooden boxes, or wooden tubes., Shelves are a great way to create space for your cat. By hanging cat shelves on your walls you can give your cat climbing space without sacrificing any floor space. You can purchase shelves made especially for cats or hang standard shelves. Just make sure the shelves are designed to hold the weight of your cat., An easy way to create more vertical space for your cat is by encouraging them to climb on existing furniture and fixtures in your house. For example, you can encourage your cat to play and climb on tall bookshelves, the refrigerator, or kitchen cabinets.


Make sure that any tall furniture is safely secured to the wall so that your cat can’t knock it over.

, Try to create paths across your cat’s climbing surfaces. For example, you can hang cat shelves between your refrigerator and a cat tree. This will allow your cat to climb easily between all the surfaces, creating additional vertical space for your pet."

Think about what type of highway you want to create.,
Decide where you want your superhighway to start.,
Determine where you want it to end.,
Draw your superhighway.,
Buy cat climbing shelves.,
Purchase pre-made cat furniture.,
Find furniture or other shelving units.,
Include furniture in your highway system.,
Fasten your shelves to the wall.,
Space everything appropriately.,
Adjust the highway.",How to Create a Cat Superhighway," Before you start building your cat superhighway you’ll need to do some thinking about it. Without a comprehensive vision, your project may not be a success. Decide whether you want:

A pathway where your kitty can jump from object to object.
A somewhat contiguous path for your cat to follow.
A highway that runs through most your home.
A highway that leads from one active part of your home to another.;
, The starting location is critical to the cat superhighway project. Not only should the starting location be in a place where the cat usually spends time or passes through, it should also be a comfortable spot for the cat.

Pick a place that is somewhat low to the ground. Ultimately, it should only be as high as your cat can jump from the ground or a piece of furniture.
Consider picking a part of your home you spend a lot of time in, like your TV room, den, or office., The ending point of your cat superhighway is as critical as the starting point. Ultimately, you’ll want your project to end in a place that your cat travels to frequently.

Much like with the starting point of the highway, your ending point should be somewhat low to the ground. Not only will the cat need to jump off it, but they’ll need to be able to jump back onto it.

, Once you’ve imagined your superhighway and determined starting and ending points, you need to commit it to paper. Without a blueprint, you won’t know what pieces you’ll need or where they will go.

Create a blueprint of the areas of your home where the superhighway will pass through.
Indicate whether the superhighway will have bridges, be spaced out, or be entirely contiguous.
Your blueprint doesn’t need to be exact or to scale. It should just give you a general idea of where your highway will go and where you’ll need to put the pieces.
Use a pencil so you can change your design if you want., You can purchase shelving specifically made for cats to climb on. These shelves are designed for the needs of cats. They’re wide enough for them to walk or sleep on and they have anchors that help them stay in the wall.

Feel free to substitute cat climbing shelves with regular shelves used for books or other purposes.
If you don’t want to buy shelves, purchase wood and carpet and create your own custom shelves., There are a variety of pre-made pieces of cat furniture that you can purchase to incorporate into your superhighway. These pieces will add diversity to your superhighway.

Buy cat scratching post towers. By incorporating a few of these, you’ll create a few points where your cat can get on and off the highway.
Use a cat condo or treehouse. This way, your cat can hangout and relax along the superhighway., You can fulfill two needs by buying furniture that fits your and your cat’s needs. Ultimately, you’ll find that a bookshelf or other shelving unit may be able to store your own items while serving as a critical piece of your cat superhighway.

Purchase a couple tall bookshelves and place them in convenient areas. Remember, though, you want to make sure the cat can safely reach the bookshelves from another piece of the highway.
Buy shelving units. You can incorporate standalone wooden shelves, wire shelves, or just about anything to serve as a piece of your cat superhighway., If a specific piece of furniture or feature of your home, like a fireplace mantle, is in the path of your highway, you should include it. By including it, you’ll save money, save time, and add a different element to your highway system.

Clear off the tops of furniture or home features that you are going to include in your system. For example, if there is a bookshelf along the highway, make sure nothing is on top of it, so your cat can travel on it safely.
Secure pieces of furniture that you are including. For example, bookshelves often come with small pieces of fabric that you can secure to the wall behind them. This way, your bookshelf won’t fall when the cat jumps on and off it., Perhaps the most important safety aspect of creating your superhighway is to make sure the shelves and other parts of the highway are fastened to the wall. This way, they won’t fall off when your cat jumps or walks on them.

Secure shelves into studs or fasten bookshelves to drywall.
Add extra vertical supports to shelves if you don’t think the shelf will support your cat’s weight.
Put a 10 to 20-pound (4.5 to 9 kg) weight on the shelves. Consider leaving the weight on the shelves for a few hours. This will help you verify that the shelf will hold your cat’s weight., When putting up your superhighway, you’ll need to make sure that the pieces of your project are spaced so your cat can either walk or jump along the highway without falling.

Try to avoid spacing pieces more than 1 or 2 feet apart.
If you want, you don’t have to leave any spaces between the pieces. You can create a continuous highway from one room of the house to another room., You’ll likely also have to adjust the highway to make it better suited to your cat. This is important, as the initial design of your project may not fit the needs of your cat. In the end, you may have to adjust the highway several times before your cat is happy with it.

Observe your cat. Spend a little time watching your cat use the highway. Try not to be obvious about it, though.
If you notice your cat getting off the superhighway before it ends, you may need to adjust it. In addition, if you notice your cat skipping several pieces of the highway and getting on elsewhere, you should change it.
You may need to move pieces closer to each other, add new pieces, or substitute pieces of the highway that are problematic. For example, your cat may not like jumping down from a high piece onto a bookshelf. You could fix this by lowering the higher piece by about a foot."

Give your cat a window perch.,
Build a catio.,
Hang a cat bed near a window.",How to Create More Space for Your Cat2," You can create more space for your cat by hanging a window perch for your feline friend. This can be as simple as hanging a sturdy shelf under the windowsill or positioning a set of shelves in front of a window. You can also purchase a window perch for your cat., A catio is a screened-in enclosure that gives your cat access to the outside world from an existing window. You can create a catio by building a screened enclosure on the outside of your window. Then leave the window open and allow your cat to experience the outdoors from the comfort of your home or apartment., Creating more space for your cat can be as simple as hanging a window bed. If a simple perch isn’t comfortable enough for your kitty, you can purchase a cat bed that is specifically designed to hang under a window. The bed will allow your cat to nap and relax in the sun without stepping outside.

Create a private retreat for your cat.,
Position multiple scratching posts where your cat wants them.,
Consider multiple litter boxes.",How to Create More Space for Your Cat3," Cats need safe spaces where they can retreat from the mayhem of everyday life. This is especially important for shy and nervous cats. Create a space in your home where your cat feels comfortable. This can be as simple as placing a cat basket in a cozy corner in a quiet room or buying an enclosed cat bed.Your cat will choose spaces in your home where it feels comfortable. For instance, if your cat enjoys sleeping under the bed, you can make this place more comfortable for it by placing a soft blanket or cat bed in the area where they like to rest.

, Do you find your cat scratching your favorite furniture instead of its scratching post? You can help curb this behavior by positioning multiple scratching posts around your house, rather than a single post in a place of your choice. This will create more comfortable spaces for your cat to scratch around the house., One way to create more space for your cat is by placing several litter boxes around your home. This will give your cat multiple bathrooms and expand their household space. Try placing the litter boxes near places where your cat spends a lot of time, like by your cat’s favorite window and in the bathroom.In general, you should have as many litter boxes as you have cats plus one, so if you only have one cat, you should have at least 2 litter boxes. You should also make sure you have a litter box on each level of your home. Your cat should always have access to its litter box.

, It needs to be wider than your cat's water dish and a little bit taller. It also needs to be tall enough that your cat can still reach into it while drinking water. Keep in mind that most cats like to crouch low to the ground while drinking water.


It is highly recommended that you use a planter with a drainage hole at the bottom. If your planter does not have a drainage hole, your plants have increased chances of getting root rot and dying.

, Cat grass is an excellent choice. It is easy to take care of and many cats like to munch on it. Catnip is another great choice, but mind your cat's behavior around the plant! Every cat reacts to catnip differently. If your cat tends to roll around in catnip, you might want to stick with cat grass, or you might end up with soil and water all over your floor!


If you choose catnip, your planter will need to have a drainage hole. Catnip requires well-draining soil.Even though there are things you can do to help a solid-bottomed planter to have more drainage, it is not enough for catnip.

, It would be easier to buy young plants than to start them from seeds. Your kitty also won't have to wait as long! How many plants you get depends on how much space you have between the two bowls. Place the water dish into the planter and move it so that the edges touch. Note how much space you have left in the crescent shape between the two bowls.


You can buy catnip and cat grass in pet stores and nurseries.

, If your planter has a drainage hole at the bottom, place a coffee filter, a piece of broken pottery, or a scrap of fine, mesh screening over it. This will help trap the dirt and keep it from falling out while allowing the water to drain.If your planter does not have a drainage hole, do the following:


Spread a layer of pebbles, stones or pumice across the bottom. The excess water will drain into this layer and help prevent root rot.Consider adding some activated charcoal as well. Activated charcoal has antimicrobial properties and will help keep rot at bay.Add a thin layer of mesh screen or landscaping cloth on top. This will keep the soil from falling into the pebbles., You want the soil to be damp and spongy, but not soaking. If it starts to look like mud, you used too much water. Let the excess water drain out, then press down on it to drain the excess out.


If your planter does not have a drainage hole, prepare the soil in a separate contain that does have a drainage hole.

, You want some of the water dish to be sticking out over the top of the soil. This will prevent dirt from falling into the water. Try to get the water dish close to the edge of the planter so that you have a crescent shape in the dirt.

, Carefully pull the plants out of their containers. Set them down on the soil around the water dish. Once you are happy with the arrangement, use a spoon or small trowel to dig holes into the soil.If you decided to start the plants from seeds, dig holes in the soil at the depth specified on the seed packet.

, Place the plants into the holes, then gently pat the soil around them. If you planted your catnip from seeds, expect the seedlings to show up after 7 to 10 days.If you planted cat grass from seeds, expect the seedlings to sprout after 3 to 7 days., Even though the water dish was partially sticking out of the soil, there's a good chance that some soil still got into it. Take the dish out of the soil now, and wash it.

, Remember to empty and refill the water dish each day. Cats can be very picky animals, and they will not drink water that is old, dirty, or not fresh., Spread a thin layer of colorful stones across the soil. Not only will this hide the soil and add a hint of color, but it will also help keep the surrounding area clean., This won't do much for your cat's enjoyment of his or her new water dish planter, but it can make the whole arrangement look more charming. Consider using a small fairy garden figurine that has a spike in the bottom. This will keep your cat from knocking it over.Your cat may not appreciate this figurine. If you notice that your cat keeps trying to pull it out, simply take it away and put it in another flower pot.

Choose quality wood and coverings.,
Make sure the scratching post is covered in rope.,
Study how the condo is put together.,
Determine if you want extra features.,
Determine if the base is sturdy.",How to Choose a Kitty Condo1," The cat condo you choose should be made of quality materials. Wood is the best material. The wood should be covered by carpet that is not looped, which can get caught in their nails. Fake fur and fleece may also be a good choice.Avoid treated wood because it can contain chemicals harmful to your cat.;
, Scratching posts are intended to keep the cat from scratching your furniture. This should be covered in sisal rope. The rope should be thick to provide an adequate surface to scratch. The rope provides a better scratching post than one covered in carpet.Make sure not to get a scratching post with oiled rope. Oiled rope can be toxic.

, The materials used to put the kitty condo together is important. Putting the frame together using screws is better than nails. Screws can be tightened after the cats have jumped on it and loosened it.Make sure the carpet is not glued on the condo. Glue can be very toxic to cats. Instead, the carpet should be stapled.

, Some kitty condos come with additional features that may be helpful for your cat. You can get ones with hanging cat toys, hammocks, and stairs. Decide if the price is worth the extra features.Hanging cat toys may be beneficial if you think it will help stimulate and engage your cat.

, Make sure that the base of your condo is wide and sturdy. If you buy a condo, especially a tall one with platforms and other accessories, the base must be sturdy. Look for a wide sturdy base that won’t cause the whole condo to topple over if multiple cats jump on it."

Grow catnip in your garden or in containers.,
Use catnip for your cat.",How to Choose Plants to Make Your Cat Happy1," Catnip is beloved by many cats, although not all cats will respond to it. If you find that your cat loves it, plant it in abundance. Some ideas for where to plant catnip include:


Plant next to a walkway that heats up in the sun. This will allow your cat to roll about under the catnip and enjoy both its scent and the warmth of the pathway.
Grow in containers. The beauty of containers is that you can move them around to take advantage of the best parts of the garden, the places where you know your cat enjoys spending time. Also, you can plant many different catnip plants and place them strategically through the garden.;
, Some of the ways your cat might enjoy catnip include:


As a bruised fresh leaf, or chopped slightly fresh from the garden.
Dried and stuffed into a catnip cat toy.
Dried on the twig. Simply let the cat chew it as much as desired.

Identify the bird.,
Determine the bird's age.,
Test their grip.,
Check for injuries.,
Cut free any entanglement.,
Pick up the bird.,
Place in the bird in a towel-lined box.,
Call a rehabilitation center immediately.",How to Take Care of a Wild Bird1," Not all birds found on the ground are in need of rescue or care. Some bird species raise their young on the ground, including killdeer, plovers, and seabirds as well as all chicken and duck species.Furthermore, identifying whether the bird is a seed or insect eater or whether they are prone to certain diseases will be essential in caring for your bird. When identifying the bird, pay attention to different parts of their body. Juvenile birds have different markings from adult birds, but their species can usually still be determined by their shape, weight, and coloration.What is their silhouette or shape? How big are they?
What markings do they have? Where on their bodies are the markings located?
What color are they? Where do the colors appear on their bodies?
Where did you find them? The woods? A marsh? A meadow?;
, At this stage, you should also check to see if a young bird is a nestling or a fledgling. Nestlings are young chicks who are not yet moving much. They have been pushed or blown out of their nest. Most nestlings will not have developed markings or coloration yet. They will either have no feathers or fluffy downy feathers. Fledglings can flap their wings and are training to fly. They will have a thin layer of feathers and may have some slight markings. It is normal for fledgling birds to be outside of the nest, and it is harmful to capture them., Place the bird on your finger and see if they can grip. If they have a strong grip, they are a fledgling. They are in no need of rescue! If they have a weak grasp or are unable to stay upright, they are likely a nestling. Try to locate their nest before you try to rescue them., The bird may be stunned from an injury. If the bird flew into your window or is found paralyzed on the ground, there is a chance that they are in shock. Birds can recover from shock with rest.If the bird is alive but unmoving, be aware that they may be suffering from a blood clot or concussion. They require quiet rest in a dark location to recover. Handle them carefully as you remove them.
If they have a broken wing or leg, avoid touching it as you handle them. Call an avian vet immediately.

, If the bird is injured because of entanglement with a rope, line, or cord, you should hold the bird still as you cut free the bindings. Keep a hold down on the bird's wings. Otherwise, the bird may flail as you try to save it, causing injury to both yourself and the bird., Use a towel or wear gloves while handling wild birds. When rescuing an orphaned or stunned bird, you should cup your hands around them and hold them upright, so that they can breathe. Gently hold together, but do not squeeze, their wings.While small songbirds can be handled with a towel, birds of prey, such as hawks or owls, should be handled wearing thick leather gloves. Be extremely aware of their beaks and talons. If you are inexperienced with these types of birds, you may want to call animal control or a wild bird rehabilitation center to rescue the bird for you., A pet carrier can also work for these purposes. The box should be ventilated so that the bird can breathe; you can poke holes in the box to provide air. Place the box in a warm, dark place. If the bird is injured, he may simply need rest to recover from the shock. Check on the bird every half hour.


Do not bring adult birds into your house. You may keep the box outside in a safe place where dogs and cats cannot reach it. You may also want to keep the box far enough away from the noise of the house or road.
If the bird has recovered from its shock after an hour or two, you may re-release the bird back into the wild. Open the box or carrier away from your house, and let him fly away. If the bird does not recover, he may need further care. Consult a vet or a wild bird rehabilitation center., It is illegal in most areas for unlicensed individuals to care for wild birds, especially native or migratory birds. If the bird is an injured adult, you will not be able to care for the bird without the advice of a wild bird specialist. Call your local game warden or search the internet for your local wild bird sanctuary. They will be able to provide advice on injured wild birds."

Consider the inside surface.,

Place them away from the food and water bowls.,
Think about your cat's needs.,
Try different locations.,
Buy one more box than you have cats.,
Fill the box with the right amount of litter.,
Skip liners.,
Avoid covers.,
Try different litters.,
Keep the box clean.,
Reconsider self-cleaning boxes.",How to Choose a Litter Box for Your Cat," For a small cat, a smaller litter box will probably work just fine. However, a large cat will likely want a larger box. Make sure it's big enough for the cat to fit its whole body in and turn around in. Otherwise, it might unintentionally go the bathroom over the edge.Of course, every cat is different, and you may need to try a couple of different boxes before finding one that's right for your cat. Some large cats prefer smaller boxes, while some small cats may want a large box.;
, When choosing a litter box, check out the sides of the box. Most cats are okay with semi-high sides, but an older cat or a disabled cat may have trouble getting in a box with high sides. For those cats, pick a shorter one.Kittens also need boxes that are shorter., Some cats may decide that they want to go on soft surfaces (like blankets and rugs), while other cats may go outside of the litter box on tile. If you notice your cat using the bathroom where it's not supposed to, consider changing up the inside of the litter box.For instance, if your cat wants a soft surface, try picking a softer, finer litter.
If your cat is going on tiles, try placing tiles in the bottom of the cat's box. Cover it with a little bit of litter.

, Obviously, you probably don't want the litter box in the middle of the kitchen. Your cat, on the other hand, doesn't want to be shunted off to a scary corner. Try to pick someplace relatively active that you can still live with.Avoid places that have loud noises, such as near the washing machine, as the noise can be scary.
Bathrooms and hallways are good options.

, Cats are clean creatures, and they aren't big fans of eating and drinking where they go to the bathroom. Instincts may also tell them not to use the bathroom near the food. Therefore, it's best to avoid placing the litter box next to their food and water bowls., If you have an elderly cat, don't put the litter box in the far corner of the basement. The cat may have trouble navigating down there, and in fact, the cat may have trouble making it to go to the bathroom.If you have multiple floors, you should have a box on each floor.

, If your cat doesn't seem to want to use the litter box, move it to another location. It may just be that the cat doesn't like where it is for whatever reason. For instance, many cats don't like having three walls around the litter box, as they can't easily escape if something blocks the one open side.If your cat is going outside of the litter box, try moving the box to where the cat is going.

, Having just one box for multiple cats isn't going to work. The best choice is to have a box for each cat, plus an extra box. That means if you have two cats, you need three boxes. If you have one cat, you need two boxes.Try buying different types so each cat kind find one it likes.

, Most cats don't like the litter to be too deep. A layer that's a couple of inches deep is fine for most cats. Nonetheless, cats will often show individual preferences, so you may need to add more or less litter., While liners can make it easier for you to change the litter, cats aren't always a fan. Many don't like the way they feel underfoot. Others may not like the noise. Either way, having a liner in place can make your cat not want to use the litter box, which is never a good thing.Even if your cat doesn't mind the liner, it will often shred the liner while burying its waste in the litter, so liners are usually not helpful., Another item that can cause issues for some cats is a cover. Some cats may have an issue being enclosed with the smell. Others may be more cautious, and they want to see if a predator is approaching. Try to skip the covers to make your cat more receptive to using the litter box.In addition, some large cats may find it hard to maneuver in a box with a cover.

, Cats also have preferences for certain types of litter. Many cats like clumping litter, for instance, because it is very fine and doesn't hurt their paws. Some clay litters are also very fine. However, every cat is different, so try out litters until you find one your cat likes., Cats are very clean, and they don't like going in a box that's filled with urine and feces. Scoop out the box once a day to keep the box clean enough for your cat. After all, you wouldn't want to walk in an area that was covered in urine and feces, either., While self-cleaning boxes are just fine for some cats, other cats may have an issue with them. If the box is cleaning when they go to use it, they may decide they don't want to use the box anymore because it scares them."

Take the number of cats into account.,
Determine the weight limit on the condo.,
Note your cat's habits and physical health.,
Think about the size of your cats.",How to Choose a Kitty Condo2," The size of the kitty condo or cat tree you get depends on how many cats you own. Each cat should have their own area on the cat condo. They each need their own platform, scratching post, and sleeping area on the condo., Kitty condos and cat trees are not all made the same. Some are intended for light loads, while others can have more weight because they are sturdier and more secure. Figure out the approximate weight of your cats and choose a condo that will support that weight.Cats will run and jump onto the cat condo. If multiple cats are doing this to a condo not intended for heavier weights, it can crash to the floor.

, When choosing the type of cat condo, think about your cat. Consider their age, size, activity level, and habits. This will determine the type of condo and furniture you get your cat.Older or less mobile cats should not have condos that are too high or require a lot of climbing and jumping. Consider shorter condos with easy access.
If you have a young, energetic cat, consider a cat tree with an enclosed condo way up top so there are opportunities for play in addition to the condo.

, Some platforms, tunnels, and enclosed condos may not be large enough for your cat. If you have overweight or larger breed cats, you may need to buy condos with large surfaces so your cat doesn’t fall off or feel insecure."
"
Consider your budget.,
Choose a condo style that fits into the room.,
Measure the space in your home.",How to Choose a Kitty Condo3," Cat condos are elaborate pieces of cat furniture that feature multiple accessories, like tunnels, platforms, perches, and boxes. Because of how elaborate a cat condo is, they can be very pricey. While you may not want to go for the cheapest option, more expensive doesn’t always mean best quality.Cat condos are investments, so spending over a hundred dollars may be worth it. Think about your budget and what you are willing to spend.
Read the reviews on the item to see what other cat owners think. Look at the materials the condo is made with, looking for solid wood and sisal rope especially.

, You want to place the kitty condo in a room where you or your family spends time. This allows your cat to be in the condo and near you. Choose a style that you like and that you think looks good in the room., Cat condos can be very large. You want to put them in a space your cat will like, like where they can get sunlight during parts of the day. Even if you don’t put it near a window, measure the space to make sure the condo will fit. If you live in an apartment or small house, you will need to think about available space.Make sure the ceiling is high enough for the cat condo. Cats like high perches, so a tall cat condo will make your cat happy.

Grow luscious lawn grass somewhere in your garden.,
Grow lemongrass.,
Grow cat grass (Dactylis glomerata).,
Grow oat grass.",How to Choose Plants to Make Your Cat Happy2," Cats will appreciate rolling in it and using it to play pounce. Many cats also eat grass to aid with digestion and regurgitating those fur balls.


If you're not keen on letting your lawn get out of control, allow a clump of grass to grow somewhere in the garden that is reserved just for your cat.

, Cats tend to enjoy munching on lemongrass even though they're not partial to lemons. It is something to do with the grassy lengths and perhaps that citrus odor isn't so bad after all.

, This is great for chewing on to aid digestion.

, It's nutritious and will capture your cat's attention for a good chew.

"
"
Grow catmint (Nepeta x faassenii).,
Plant and use members of the mint family.,
Grow the herb valerian (Valeriana officinalis).,
Try honeysuckle wood (Lonicera tartarica).,
Grow cat thyme (Teucrium marum).,
Grow other cat attractant herbs.",How to Choose Plants to Make Your Cat Happy3," This herb is yet another much loved plant for rolling in. It can also be used dried in cat toys. If planting it, grow where there is plenty of space for lying on it and rolling around, under and in it.

, Most members of the mint family entice cats. A little nibble here and there won't be a bother if you're sharing the mint for your own culinary needs.

, Cats enjoy playing with the foliage and flowers.

, Honeysuckle wood is a cat attractant.It is safest to put the wood inside a sachet or fabric mouse, etc. so that your cat cannot choke on the wood; or, give a thick branch rather than a stem that can split easily.


Honeysuckle flowers can upset the cat's digestive system. Hence, don't encourage gorging on the flowers. One flower for play might be okay but no more. If you think it will be a problem, don't encourage it.
Honeysuckle berries are poisonous. Another reason not to encourage close engagement with the plant.

, Sometimes cats that aren't thrilled by catnip enjoy this plant instead. It will release its odor when bruised.

, These include: buckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), Northern groundcone (Boschniakia rossica), yellowbells (Tecoma stans), Guelder rose (Viburnum opulus, sometimes called cranberry bush or snowball tree), the perennial Dittany of Crete (Origanum dictamnus), the spring-flowering annual Baby Blue-eyes (Nemophila menziesii) and Zinziba (Lippia javanica)."

Feed adult birds only if necessary.,
Find appropriate food for baby birds.,
Use a syringe for unfeathered baby birds.,
Feed often.,
Wean them off the syringe once they start moving around.",How to Take Care of a Wild Bird2," With adults, it is advised that you do not feed the bird at all, especially if you are uncertain of its species or its dietary requirements. Furthermore, if injured, it may not be able to handle solid foods. If you must feed the bird and are absolutely positive that it can handle solid foods, be sure to locate the appropriate food for their species. Consult a vet or wild bird center for advice.


Insect eaters can be fed mealworms or small crickets but not thick worms (like earthworms) or ants.
Seed eaters can be fed a fortified mix, such as a fortified cockatiel seed mix.
Fruit eaters can be fed berries or diced fruits. Be sure to cut it up for them., Nestlings require soft foods. In the wild, chicks would be fed regurgitated foods by their parent. You can replicate this by feeding the bird wet canned dog or cat food. You can also soak dry dog or cat food in water to make it mushy.


Baby bird formula may be available at your local pet store.
Do not feed your chick bird seed, sugar water, or bread. These are extremely unhealthy for baby birds and may result in the chick becoming malnourished., Nestlings will need to be fed with a syringe. Feeding syringes can be found at your local pet store or at a drug store in the baby section. Fill the syringe with wet canned dog, cat, or jars of mushy baby food (preferably fruit).Make sure not to shove the eye dropper down the chick's throat. It could choke them.


If you cannot find a feeding syringe, you can also use a toothpick. Skewer the food on the pick. Be careful not to stab the chick as you feed it., Baby birds will eat every fifteen to twenty minutes from dawn to dusk. When hungry, they should call for you with an open mouth. Do not feed them until they exhibit this behavior. At night, the baby birds may not call for food; this is normal.That said, if you have a bird under a week old, it may call for food every few hours in the night. You may feed the bird again if this happens.The bird’s crop (or bottom of their throat) may expand as they eat. This is normal. As you feed the bird, don’t fill the crop entirely. Their swallowing reflex will start when food reaches their crop. The bird should stop when full.Do not give babies water. Chicks will absorb water from the food they eat. By giving them water, you may be inadvertently filling their lungs instead of their stomach. This can cause death., As your chick grows, you will notice it is beginning to sprout feathers and move around its shelter. It is entering the fledgling period of its growth. At this point, a varied diet is important.


For insect eaters, you can introduce bugs such as mealworms or crickets, which can be bought at a local pet store.Seed eaters can start eating spew millet or seeds that have been soaked until they sprout. After a few days, you can add seed, nuts, and pellets to the mix.If the bird is a fruit eater, you can start them on baby food jars of fruit before moving on to diced berries and fruits."

Place birds in a box, not a cage.,
Place their shelter in a dark, quiet place.,
Keep the bird warm.,
Allow the bird plenty of rest.,
Give baby birds space to move as they become fledglings.",How to Take Care of a Wild Bird3," Wild birds are not domesticated like house birds. A cage may alarm them, and they can injure themselves in an attempt to escape. Ventilated boxes lined with towels are actually best for birds, especially adult birds who have lived in the wild their whole lives. The dark calms them, and the enclosed space gives them a sense of protection against predators.Make sure you poke air holes in the box.


Remember this will only a temporary solution for keeping birds. The end goal to caring for wild birds is to reintroduce them into the wild, not to keep them as pets.

, Birds will be quiet as they recover so do not be alarmed if they do not sing or chirp in the box. In fact, the quieter their shelter, the better it will be for their healing.If the bird is an adult, you should keep the box outside as far away from the house as possible.
Baby birds should be kept close to you for constant supervision. You may choose to keep them inside or outside. If you do choose to leave their shelter outside, make sure that they remain close to the house, and give them an insulated shelter for warmth and protection.

, Especially if the bird you have rescued is a baby, you will want to keep the bird warm. There are a few methods you can use to warm a bird bed. If the bird is an adult, it may only need towels and grass shavings for warmth. If the bird is an unfeathered chick, it will need a more substantial source of warmth.You can pour warm water in a bottle and wrap it in paper towels. You may also want to put paper towels around the bird so that this doesn't burn them. This is a good option if you are keeping the bird outside.
Alternatively, you may make a bed of towels or old t-shirts in a pet carrier. Place the bird inside. Leave a heating pad beneath the carrier on throughout the day and night. The heating pad should warm the entire carrier.This is ideal if you are keeping the bird inside.

, If it curls up and isn't moving, it's not dead! It's sleeping, and this bird needs to sleep. It will tell you when it's awake and hungry again. Make sure you stay nearby when they're sleeping; they will need your absolute attention when they wake up.

, After a few weeks, you will notice the bird has sprouted more feathers. The bird will also start flapping its wings and shuffling around on its own. It is becoming a fledgling. It is extremely important in this stage that the bird has room to move around as it will be learning to fly. Supervise the bird carefully but give him room to move.


To ensure successful reintroduction into wild, take the chick outside once or twice a day. Hold the nestling in your hands, and if they try to fly off, don’t stop them. This exercise will strengthen their muscles and help them learn to fly. As time goes by, they will fly away for farther distances and longer periods of time but may still return for feedings.To prevent injury inside the home, you can teach the fledgling to avoid mirrors and windows. Hold the bird up to the glass and allow them to poke their beak against it. Do this repeatedly to teach the bird to avoid these as they learn to fly."
"
Be sure that it can fly.,
Ensure that your fledgling knows how to feed itself.,
Teach him how to hunt and forage.,
Familiarize your bird with its species.",How to Release Wild Baby Birds," Before it can be released, your baby bird has to be able to fly. When your baby bird is fully feathered (a fledgling), it should be moved to a cage with perches where it can practice by hopping from perch to perch. The fledgling should also be let out of the cage where it can take short flights. Don't worry about the baby bird flying away; it will return when it's hungry and wants you to feed it.;
, Once the fledgling is able to fly, it should also begin to feed itself. You can still feed it, but begin putting small dishes of food and water in the bird's cage. Make sure the food you put in are things that the fledgling would be eating in the wild. Feed the bird from the dish, and after a couple of times, it should be pecking at the food out of curiosity. Begin feeding it less and less once it does this and the soon the bird should begin to eat on its own.

, Different species of bird eat different foods, so depending on your type of bird, it will have to be taught how to hunt and forage for different foods.

For insectivores, or insect-eating birds, introduce your birds to a place where the type of insect it eats are abundant. Pick up a few and feed it to the bird, and after a while it will begin pecking at them and looking for more on its own.






For fruit eating birds, put the bird in a tree or bush that has edible berries that it can eat. Show the bird a branch that has fruit and give it some. After a few tries it should eat the fruits on its own.






For seed eaters, scatter some of the seeds it likes near where you've observed other birds foraging. The bird will learn to forage on its own and it can also learn from watching others.







, If you are raising two birds of the same species this should be fine, but if you're only raising one, it will need to be taught the songs and behaviors of its kind. This is very important to learn, because birds use many different signals to indicate things such as danger. To teach a baby bird the songs and other sounds its species uses, you can look for recordings, although your bird will still need to learn from other real birds of its species.

Use two sticks, a cord, a rock, and your pocketknife to build to an Ojibwa Bird Pole.,
Sharpen both ends of the longer pole.,
Drill a hole through the pole near one of the ends.,
Tie one end of the rope firmly around your rock.,
Wedge the thin stick into the hole you drilled.,
Thread the string through the hole and tie a small knot in it.,
Tie a slip noose knot in the end of the string.,
Run the end of the rope through the noose knot, back towards the pole.,
Tie a simple overhand knot right where the two sticks meet.,
Test the trap by gently pushing the perch down.,
Place your trap in an open area, where it is the best option for a bird to sit.,
Note that this trap is a supplement for a survival diet, not a main source of food.",How to Trap a Backyard Bird1," This trap has been used in Canada since prehistoric times. It looks a bit like an upside-down ""L."" Birds will perch on the smaller stick, which is rigged to a simple noose that tightens when a bird lands on the perch. While it requires some knowledge of knots, the Ojibwa Bird Pole is the simplest, easiest trap you can make in the wilderness. You'll need:


A large branch, roughly the width of a few fingers and 5-6 feet long.
A pencil-thin stick, roughly six inches long.
A rock, roughly the size of your fist.
A 3-4 foot cord or rope. This can be a shoestring, a sleeping bag cord, a sturdy vine, or twine.
A sharp pocket knife.;
, The bottom end will be driven into the ground, and the top needs to be sharp so that birds perch on your trap, not the pole.

, It doesn't need to be wide, just wide enough to push your thin stick through.

, The rock acts as your counter-weight, holding the trap in place until a bird springs it. Any knot will do.

, It should be right next to the string, but the string should still move freely. You don't want to put the stick all the way in, just enough to keep it in place. This ""perch"" needs to fall under the weight of the bird in order to snare it.

, The weight of the rock will try and pull the string back through your hole. You want to make it so that, combined, the knot and the stick hold the rope in place, with the rock hanging freely about halfway up the pole. This may take some trial and error since your hole and stick size will be different depending on your materials.


The knot should be able to move freely through the hole in the pole when the stick isn't jammed in.
Some trappers tie the small knot first, then put the stick in. Experiment with what works for you.
You should have two feet of string or more on the other side of your knot.

, Take the end of the string and make a noose big enough to fit your fist through. To make a slip noose:


Double the string back on itself to make a U-shaped loop.
Run the end of the string back towards the top of the loop. It will look a bit like a flattened ""S.""
Wrap the end of the rope around the doubled line 2-3 times.
Pull the rope tight, cinching the wrap around the doubled string., You'll be left with a circle of rope draped over your perch. The end of the noose will be at the end of the perch, and the noose knot itself will be close to the pole. You should have two semi-circles of rope draped off of the stick.

, An overhand knot is simply when you create a loop and pull the string through. All you have to do is wrap the end around the rope near your hole, creating a circle, then run the end through that circle. This should be right at the point where your two sticks meet., As you do, the weight of the rock should pull the rope through the hole, which will quickly tighten the noose and grab your finger. Note, however, that these traps are very variable. Play with the size of the noose and the perch -- the closer they are to the same size, the more effective your trap will be. Also, try and tie the smallest knot possible in the beginning so that the rope can move freely through the hole -- you want it to snap shut quickly once the stick is removed.

, If you place this trap in the woods, you significantly decrease the chances a bird will land there -- there are plenty of good trees around. Place it in an open area where it is the only place for them to land for the best results., Small birds, in general, only provide about 100 calories apiece. Unless you have 4-5 successful traps, there are much better returns on your investment when looking for food, including insects and game traps for rabbits and squirrels. Still, especially in the winter, these traps can be a viable source of nutrition when paired with other methods."

Turn the lights off and close the blinds.,
Watch the bird for a few minutes to determine her flight path.,
Stretch you're netting between both hands, making sure to shake out any wrinkles or folds that might allow the robin to escape.,
Walk up behind the bird slowly, moving in as close as possible.,
Put your gloves on and pick up the bird, making sure the net stays around her.",How to Trap a Robin Bird," Quiet,dark locations will help calm the bird and make him easier to capture. If there are no blinds, wait until it is dark outside to make the robin easier to catch.;
, Robins like to perch on raised surfaces and move frequently. To avoid the capture in the wild, observing her will allow you to figure out the best place to catch her at.

, Choose netting that is small enough to prevent the robin from escaping, such as quarter bird netting. Substitute an old towel or curtain, if you do not have netting on hand.

, The bird may fly away on you're first approach, so move with her to the next perch. If she becomes frightened, once you get within a couple of feet, throw the net over the robin so that it totally covers her.

, The gloves will prevent the robin from pecking at you as you move her outside. Gently untangle her from the netting, making sure she is totally free of it before turning her loose.

Place the bird’s cage near you.,
Talk to your bird.,
Offer the bird food.,
Avoid sudden movements at first.,
Be patient.",How to Socialize a Lory or Lorikeet1," The more time spent with your lory or lorikeet, the better socialized they will become. You have to get your bird used to you and other people. Put the cage somewhere where your bird can see you and others so they can get used to you.Sit close to the cage or walk by it throughout the day. Let them realize you are not a threat by becoming part of their environment.;
, Interact with your bird by talking to them. Whenever you enter the room or walk by their cage, speak to them. Talk to them in different tones of voice to rouse their curiosity. You can even try singing to them to get them used to you.Do this multiple times each day.

, You can try to build the trust between you and your lory or lorikeet by sharing food. Birds often feed each other, so offering the bird food can help establish that trust and relationship. Try feeding them different foods so they can stay curious and learn to trust you., When you first get your lori or lorikeet, avoid any sudden movements or loud sounds. They are prey birds, so they may see that as a threat. Whenever you are around them, move slowly in a controlled manner. Eventually, the bird will get used to you.For example, don't reach towards the bird quickly or run over to the cage. Instead, move in a calm manner past the cage, or reach into the cage in a controlled way.

, Not all birds will become socialized and accept you at the same rate. Some birds have traumatic events in their past that have made them distrustful to humans. Others may have a difficult personality. Remember to keep interacting with your bird and to stay patient. Eventually, your bird will trust you wholeheartedly."

Watch how your cat scratches.,
Pick a post that suits your space.,
Consider a horizontal model.,
Consider a flat vertical model.,
Consider a cat tree.,
Get a piece of faux furniture.,
Buy an appropriate height.,
Make your own scratching post or pad.,
Stick to your budget.",How to Choose a Scratching Post or Pad for Your Cat1," Take a few days and observe how your cat scratches the furniture or other objects in your home. Make a note as to whether or not they stay horizontal or prefer to stretch out vertical. Do they favor a particular material, such as your carpet? Do they feel the need to scratch up high, like on the back of your couch?If your cat tends to scratch high, then a vertical scratcher will work the best. Look for a hanging or wall-secured model.
If your cat tends to scratch the carpet or the back of your couch, then a horizontal scratcher that stays flat on the floor will work best.;
, You will want to make sure that the scratcher that you select can comfortably fit into your home. You’ll need free wall space if you are planning on installing a wall-based vertical scratcher. A cat condo can potentially take up a fair amount of floor space. Have a good idea about where you will place the scratchers before you buy them.

, A scratching pad of this type will lay flat on the ground, perhaps with a low ridge. It could be rectangular, round, or another shape entirely. You might be able to attach toys or another small scratcher vertically to one end. These scratchers are often a cheap option.Be aware that if your cat scratches very aggressively, they may succeed in flipping this type of scratcher over.
A horizontal scratcher provides a good back and shoulder exercise for your cat. This movement also mimics the actions of cats marking their territories in the wild., A vertical scratcher can hang from a doorknob, be a stand-alone post, or be secured to a wall. All of these options allow a cat to stretch out and extend their arms fully out and up. Pulling downward can then release any old claws. Be aware that these scratchers need to be a bit sturdier, so they can be more expensive than their horizontal counterparts., A cat condo is a great way to provide a scratching option and hiding place for your cat, all in one piece of furniture. If you place the cat condo near a window, your cat will enjoy the benefits of extra sunlight and an almost tree-like experience. Some cats even choose to sleep on their condos.You might notice that your cat rubs their face all over their condo. This is their way of marking territory via scent glands in their paws and facial area.

, These are pieces of traditional human furniture that are miniaturized and then covered in a scratchable material, such as rope or carpet. Cats can enjoy the option of tearing up furniture without actually ruining any of your real pieces. Cat faux furniture also provides a diverse workout for a cat’s varying muscles.These are often custom pieces, so they will likely be more expensive than a traditional scratcher. You can buy these pieces via specialty pet stores or online via sites like Etsy.

, Cats prefer a scratcher that allows them to fully extend their arms, paws, and claws. As you watch your cat scratch, try to get an idea as to the size of the scratcher that you’ll need. When in doubt, it is always better to buy a taller, bigger one., If you just can’t find a scratcher that you prefer, or if you are particularly handy, you might try to make a post or pad for your cat. You can cut out a custom scratcher from a block of corrugated cardboard. You could also cover a hard surface, such as a book, with a rough fabric and batting.If you choose to attach carpeting to the post or pad, make sure to choose one that is designed for heavy usage. This will ensure that it lasts awhile before it needs to be replaced.

, Cat scratchers can vary from quite cheap for cardboard models to rather pricey for custom pieces of furniture. Determine your budget in advance and make sure to comparison shop. Don’t spend too much on a scratcher as it is only temporary and will need replacing in the future.

Nail the mouse trap into the ground.,
Tie a loop in one end of the thread.,
Tie a loop in the end of the thread opposite the mousetrap.,
Tie the mouse-trap end of the string around the spring.,
Place some bread or birdseed on the mousetrap as bait.,
Leave the trap alone for 6-12 hours.,
Always wear long sleeves and gloves when grabbing a live bird.",How to Trap a Backyard Bird2," This simple trap will drop a box on the bird, containing it until you get to it later. It can also be used to catch small game, like rabbits and squirrels.

, You want the ""classic"" kind -- a simple wooden board with a spring-loaded trap wire. You can find these traps at almost any hardware store., The box should be about twice as big as the bird you want to catch., Place a nail in the center of the trap and hammer it into the ground. You should use a fairly long nail. It will secure the trap into the dirt so that it doesn't move when the bird lands.Balance the box on one edge by slipping it slightly under the mouse trap., Temporarily loop it around part of the mouse trap. Thread the other end through the hole in the top of the box. Later on, you'll attach this loop to the spring. But, for now, you just need it looped somewhere on the trap to create tension in the line.

, Nail that end into the ground, pulling the nail out enough to tighten the line so that the box balances on one edge. The inside of the box should be facing the ground, with one side raised to allow birds to enter. Adjust the thread so that the highest edge of the box is only a foot or so in the air.The box needs to be high enough the a bird flies into it, but low enough that it can shut quickly.

, Load the spring but not the arm. You want the string to be on the mechanism that spring when a mouse (or, in this case, bird) steps on it. When the bird releases the spring, the box will fall around the bird, trapping it.The tension of the string is holding the box in place. Make sure you tie the string so that it sits correctly.

, Remember, you want the bird to land on the trap, springing it and releasing the string. It will cause the box to fall and allow you to trap the bird., Constant human activity near the trap will scare birds away. If you see that the box has fallen, go check it to see if you caught anything.

, To get the bird out of your trap, lift the box slightly, reach in, and grab the bird firmly around the body. Wear gloves and long sleeves to prevent any pecking or scratching wounds.


There is always the chance that you'll catch a rabbit or squirrel as well with your trap since it is on the ground. Be ready for anything.

Call your vet or your local wildlife authorities.",How to Trap a Backyard Bird3," Sometimes adult birds simply need a moment to recover after running into something. Let the bird try to recover before you attempt to catch it. You may only injure it further as it tries to get away.Similarly, baby birds that have their feathers are often learning to fly, which is why they are out of the nest. Their parents are likely nearby, keeping an eye out, and they should be left alone unless they are injured.If you think a baby bird has been abandoned, call a wildlife rehabilitator. You can find one through your local veterinarian or wildlife agency. Humane societies can also help you find one. Once you call, the rehabilitator should be able to tell you what to do with the bird, such as leave it alone or bring it in., Birds carry diseases, mites, and bacteria. They can also injure you as you try to catch one. Putting on a sturdy pair of gardening gloves is a safe bet to help protect your hands.If you are helping a bird of prey, upgrade to sturdy leather gloves., If possible, come up out of sight of the bird. Birds can fly away even with injuries, so you can startle it into flight by coming from the front.Another method is to use a piece of cloth, such as a pillowcase. Come up behind the bird and drape the cloth over it.When you do pick up the bird, pick it up with the cloth around it., Use a small cardboard box. A shoebox works fine for this purpose. Poke holes in the top, and place something soft inside, such as a washcloth., Hold small birds in one hand and big birds in two. With one hand, the bird's head should come between the first and middle finger. Wrap the rest of your hand around the bird's body. Rest one hand on either side of the body. Hold the bird firmly, but don't squeeze too tightly., Set the bird gently in the box and quickly put the lid in. Put the box in a quiet, dark area until you can call a wildlife rehabilitator., They will have information about finding a local rehabilitator. Rehabilitators are trained to care for injured birds, so once you call one in your area, she can share information on what to do next."

Play with your bird regularly.,
Play instructional games with your bird.,
React positively to behavior problems.",How to Socialize a Lory or Lorikeet2," Spending time with your lory or lorikeet and playing with them daily helps to socialize them. Use toys and different games to amuse them. You also may bring them with you into different rooms throughout the day.For example, you may pull toys out of their cage and play with them with your bird. You can also put an empty box on the floor with something inside they can chew, and then gently tap the box with something until you finally place it in their view. You can also try playing peek-a-boo with a toy.
Lories and lorikeets love just about every kind of toys. They love foot toys, balls, cardboard boxes or rolls, and toys that make noise. You can use just about anything to play with your bird.
Take the lory or lorikeet into the bathroom with you when you’re grooming yourself, or bring them in the living room. Just don’t take them into the kitchen because kitchen fumes can be harmful to birds.

, Playing games is important to keep your lory or lorikeet happy and healthy, but it can also help socialize them. Instructional games are particularly important because it helps tame your bird, build trust, and let them know that you are the one who can guide them.For example, you can teach your parrot to get your attention through spreading their wings instead of screaming at you. Whenever they spread their wings, spread your arms and say “Eagle pose!” Practicing this over and over will show your parrot this positive behavior.
You can also try to teach the bird how to slap your hand with their foot using a verbal cue.
Give the lory or lorikeet a lot of praise and treats when they perform a new behavior learned in your instructional games.

, You may unknowingly reinforce negative behavior by the way you react to behavior problems like screaming and aggression. If you scream at a screaming bird, you are giving it positive reinforcement, just as you are positively reinforcing biting behavior by getting angry. Try to react calmly and positively to get the behavior you want.Most negative behaviors happen when your bird is upset. Walk away from your bird and calm down before interacting. This also gives your bird time to calm down. Approach them later more calmly.

"
Tell visitors to ignore the bird at first.,
Explain to guests how to approach your lory or lorikeet.,
Allow the bird out of the cage.,
Make visitors act as a human perch.,
Allow the bird to build trust with the person before they move towards it.,
Use tricks to help your bird get used to stepping up to strangers.",How to Socialize a Lory or Lorikeet3," As you begin socializing your bird, instruct your visitors to ignore the bird. Many people may want to run up to your lory or lorikeet’s cage to see the bird, but this could reinforce negative associations for your bird. Keep visitors away from the bird for around 10 to 60 minutes.This helps your bird watch the people and determine they are not a threat.
Tell your visitors, “I can introduce you to my lorikeet soon, but for now we need to ignore them while they get used to new people.”

, Your bird has a very specific way it needs to be approached. Especially if you are teaching it how to be social, you need to make sure everyone handles your bird in the correct way. This helps provide positive associations for your bird with strangers.Go through the steps on how to handle the bird, including how to pet it. If your bird will allow it, demonstrate with the bird.
Explain to your guests that the bird is not a dog, cat, or child, and they cannot treat it like most pets.

, After your guests have been in your home for a period of time, you can let your lory or lorikeet out of their cage. Make sure that the guests do not approach the bird, but that the bird approaches when they feel comfortable. This helps the bird retain control and feel out the situation.Explain to your guests, “Don’t approach the bird, but allow the bird to come to you. It’ll take a few minutes to feel comfortable, but then it will get curious.”

, When your lory or lorikeet is getting used to people, have people only let the bird perch on them. Don’t let visitors put their arm out towards the bird because this could spook or upset the bird. Letting unfamiliar people make motions towards the bird can cause them to mistrust strangers.Tell your visitors that they should remain still and not interact with the bird if they decide to land on them. They shouldn’t pet or touch the bird while they’re perching on them.

, No one should ever move towards a lory or lorikeet before they build trust. This trust can be established by letting the bird use them as a human perch, or by being around the bird and letting them get used to the person., You should already have your lory or lorikeet trained before socializing them, so you can use this training to get them used to people. After the bird gets used to a person, you can give the person treats. Have the person cue a trick, and then to receive the treat, the bird has to step up onto the arm.After the bird gets used to this, then have the bird step up onto the visitor’s arm before they get the treat.

Socialize young birds with other birds.,
Introduce young birds to a variety of different people.,
Let young birds experience changes in their environment.,
Feed young birds various foods.",How to Socialize a Lory or Lorikeet4," Lories and lorikeets need to learn socialization with other birds, especially if you are going to keep more than one bird. If you have a young bird, introduce them to other birds and let them interact. This helps them avoid being aggressive or angry with any other birds you get., If you have young lories and lorikeets, you should try to get them used to a variety of different people. This helps them get used to people and not be frightened by people who look different than you.For example, you can bring people around them that are different genders or ethnicities or with different color hair. You can also allow them to get used to people who wear hats, glasses, or other accessories.

, Another way to socialize young lories and lorikeets is to let them experience many different things. This helps them adapt to changes in their homes and piques their curiosity.Change things around in your home or in the room the birds are kept. You can also take the birds into different rooms so they can experience different environments.
Play music around your bird, let them walk on different surfaces, and let them be moved around in a basket.

, Another thing that can help your lory or lorikeet become socialized is to feed them an array of foods so they get used to any food that they are given. This also helps them learn that curiosity is a good, safe thing. Fostering their curiosity helps your bird be more involved with their surroundings."

Consider DNA testing.,
Buy a baby mynah bird.,
Make sure you have enough space.,
Provide perches.,
Install a nest box.,
Manage the light, heat and humidity.,
Keep away from smaller birds.,
Place the cage in a busy place.,
Keep a bathing dish and water bottle in the cage.,
Feed the bird a low iron diet.,
Give them some supplements.,
Provide lots of toys.,
Allow plenty of exercise.",How to Raise a Mynah Bird," Depending on where you live, there may be restrictions or certain licenses you will need to own and raise a mynah bird. It is important that you check with the local government body that deals with wildlife management, such as the game and parks or the fish and wildlife commission.This is particularly important if you are raising mynah birds to sell later on. Although you will not need a license to buy a mynah bird, you may need one to sell it. Check your local laws and regulations.;
, Because of its popularity as a pet, the illegal trapping of mynah birds has significantly depleted the bird’s wild population. This has resulted in the growth of illegally caught and traded Mynah birds.In order to avoid buying an illegally caught bird, you should always purchase from a dealer certified with the United State Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.You can find dealers online through various bird buying sites.

, The birds can be extremely expensive and buying through a certified dealer. Because of the restrictions against obtaining a mynah bird, they can be extremely cost between $500 and $1500. Consider whether you are willing to pay this expense before contacting a dealer.


You can also consider adopting a mynah bird. However, this option is also extremely difficult because of the bird’s rarity.

, Because it is nearly impossible to differentiate between male and female mynah birds, you may want to get them DNA in order to tell the gender of the bird you are purchasing. Often a dealer will have already tested the bird on their own and let you know the sex of the bird. You can also buy DNA testing kits online and simply mail a feather to the laboratory for testing., If you want to tame the bird yourself and teach it to talk and do tricks, you should buy a 6-8 week old bird. They tend to quit learning new words once they reach two years of age. Unless you are okay with the words that they have already learned, you may want to consider a baby mynah bird.Mynahs begin speaking at three to four months of age.
Begin speaking to the young bird as soon as you bring it home. Initially, give it simple words like “hello” or “hi.”

, Because mynah birds are a larger bird species, they require a lot of room. The typical dimensions of a mynah bird cage are 3-4 feet wide (90-100cm) by 2 feet tall (60cm) by 2 feet deep (60cm). Their rarity makes it hard to find an affordable cage that is specifically made for mynah birds, with most being built for parrots. However, you can put together two parrot cages in a pinch.Because mynah birds tend to hop around from side to side, it is best to give them lots of vertical space.
If you are breeding a pair of mynah birds, you may want to consider purchasing an outdoor aviary., It is important that you place multiple perches in your bird’s cage. These will help prevent foot injuries and the development of arthritis. Avoid rope perches because the brid’s toenails can get caught in them., If placed in their cage, a mynah bird will sleep in a nest box. The birds tend to take multiple short naps during the day and sleep all night. This will give them a dark and comfortable place to rest.You can also cover their cage at night or provide a cardboard box for them to go inside of.

, Be sure to place your bird’s cage near sunlight, but not in direct sunlight. This can lead them to get overheated. If your bird’s cage is not exposed to sunlight, you may need a light fixture designed for caged birds. Mynah birds enjoy room temperature (76 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) but can acclimate to slightly colder temperatures. Provide your mynah bird with a spritz of warm water every day to keep them comfortable., Mynah birds can attack smaller birds, so it is best if your bird is kept in its own cage. However, they will sometimes cohabitate with another mynah bird. This may be particularly useful if you are looking to bread mynah birds.A nesting pair of mynah birds form a strong bond and both birds share nesting duties. If you do intend to breed mynah birds, leave the breeding pair together., Mynah birds are extremely social and tend to enjoy human interaction. Be sure to put them in place where they can talk to multiple people and develop their language skills. They may form a strong bond with the person who cleans their cage and feeds them.Mynahs also have good memories and remember mistreatment. They will hold grudges and dislike people who resemble the person who mistreated them.

, Mynah birds do not need much water to drink because they get most of their moisture from their food. However, they will need to ingest some fresh water. It is also important for them to have access to water in order to take a bath. Mynah birds will take two baths a day. This will ensure that their feathers stay clean and healthy.Mynah birds should only be given distilled water and not tap water.

, Mynah birds suffer from hemochromatosis, or an inability to store iron. Therefore, they need a diet that is low in, but not absent of, iron. You should provide them commercially produced, low iron (150 parts per million) mynah bird pellets, which you can find online or at most pet stores. Pellets should be roughly 60% of your bird’s diet.Mynah birds also enjoy some fresh fruits (figs, oranges, papayas, apples, plums, grapes).
They may also enjoy insects (crickets, mealworms and wax worms).
Insects should not be more than 5% of your bird’s diet unless you are breeding birds.

, If your mynah bird’s diet is less than 60% pellets, you may want to consider various supplements. Your bird may develop a deficiency in certain vitamins, minerals, or amino acids.Your bird may have a deficiency if they fail to malt during a year. A healthy mynah bird will malt twice a year, and failing to malt may be a sign of a vitamin deficiency.
If you believe that your bird is suffering from a deficiency, talk to your veterinarian.

, Because they are relatively intelligent animals, mynah birds enjoy playing with toys. Mirrors, bells, bottle caps, and other small items can serve as toys for your mynah bird. This will keep them happy and engaged. Avoid rope toys because they can get caught in your bird’s tongue or toenails.

, Mynah birds need exercise and should be allowed out of their cage daily. Before you let your bird out of its cage, make sure that you have closed all of the windows and doors, turned off any fans, covered any water, and ensured that there are not any predators around, such as house cats. Keeping you mynah bird in good shape will improve its quality of life.You may want to clip your birds wings. Without a clipping, mynah birds can lose their balance and have a difficult time landing. This can result in injury or death.

Weigh your texture options.,
Be wary of carpet coverings.,
Check the sturdiness.,
Check the attachments with wall-mounted models.,
Look at product reviews.",How to Choose a Scratching Post or Pad for Your Cat2," When you visit the pet store or look online, you will see a variety of covering options for your scratcher. You will need to choose from rope, fabric, cardboard, natural wood, or a combination. Outdoor cats often prefer more natural surfaces, while cardboard is easier for older cats to scratch.Rough sisal rope is probably the most popular option. The sisal captures and removes dead claws as your cat scratches. In contrast, cardboard is less helpful in removing dead claws, but is a gentle way for cats to relieve aggression and mark.
Think about the type of clean-up that you are willing to do as well. Cardboard scratchers have a tendency to result in tiny pieces of cardboard spread throughout the floor. Sisal rope is less messy overall.

, Carpet covered scratchers can be visually appealing, but they are not as useful in keeping your cat’s claws healthy. They also make it more difficult for your cat to really dig in their paws. If the carpet is too loopy, your cat may also get stuck as they scratch, which can turn them off the post entirely.


Carpet covered scratchers can also pose a problem as cats begin to fail to distinguish between their designated post and other areas of carpet. They may, therefore, start scratching in hallways or at other parts of the floor., A good scratcher is a sturdy and stable scratcher. Your cat will stop using it if they feel it wobbling too much or if they are afraid to knock it over on themselves. You need a post that can withstand your cat launching itself at it or pulling on it during a sustained scratching period. Test this by applying pressure to the post and mimicking your cat’s movements.You will also want to check the various attached parts that come with the scratcher to make sure that they are not loose. For example, sometimes the toys attached can come off too easily and will only cause your cat to be frustrated and distracted.
A good rule to follow is that a tall post requires a wide base. The taller the post, the more secure and wide the base needs to be., If you have free wall space and plan to attach the scratcher to it, then spend a bit of extra time looking over the mounting brackets and hardware. These items need to be able to bear the full weight of the scratcher and your cat. For extra security, you may want to replace standard screws with drywall mounts.Feel free to add extra brackets to make your cat’s vertical or wall scratcher even more secure. It is best to do the installation right the first time.

, Before you make your final purchase, do a bit of online research to see if a particular brand gets excellent reviews. Pay particular attention to those reviews that talk about long term usage and the quality of customer service. If you have any issues, you want a responsive seller."

Put the post in a central location.,
Provide multiple posts.,
Use catnip or treats to peak your cat’s interest.,
Use toys or accessories to peak your cat’s interest.,
Offer praise.",How to Choose a Scratching Post or Pad for Your Cat3," Don’t hide away the scratcher. Find a spot in the middle of the action and place it there. You want it in a place that your cat frequents as they will not usually go out of their way to find their post or pad.It is also a good idea to block off pieces of furniture that your cat targets by placing new posts or pads right before them. After a while, you can move the post away to a more preferred location. Just go slowly and don’t move the post more than half a foot per week., If you have multiple cats, you will need to get them at least one post each. This will allow each cat to have their own territory. If you have a multi-story house, then you will need at least one post per floor. It is also a good idea to vary the type of posts or pads, so that your cat can exercise a variety of muscles.Position a post near your cat's bed, as they like to scratch when they wake up. Consider placing other posts near door frames, as cats like to mark entrances and exits.
If you move, make sure to take along the old scratchers while providing new ones as well. This will help your cat to feel less anxiety and claim the new space., You can get a sachet of catnip and rub it all over the post or pad. You could also sprinkle catnip directly on the scratcher. This will help to lure your cat in. You could place a few treats around the perimeter of the scratcher as well., If the scratcher has a spot for you to attach a toy or feathers, make sure to do so. This will increase your cat’s positive association with the scratcher. You can also incorporate the scratcher into play sessions by hiding toys on top of it or dragging a feather over it., If your cat tries to scratch furniture, distract them from this behavior by clapping your hands or making other loud noises. Then, point them in the direction of the scratcher. After your cat uses the scratcher successfully, you might give them a treat or a quick rub."

Make sure the bird is truly an orphan.,
Protect your health when dealing with wildlife.,
Avoid imprinting on the bird.,
Avoid giving the bird water.",How to Raise a Baby House Sparrow1," If it has feathers, it is a fledgling and could be learning to fly. Therefore, it should remain on the ground - only remove it if it is in danger from a predator, or the parents do not return within one hour. If the bird has no feathers, it is a nestling, so look around to see if you can spot the nest. Gently pick him up and place him back in the nest.


House Sparrows were originally recorded in Eurasia, North Africa, and the Middle East but now live all around the world. Because there are so many sparrows globally, they are not a protected species.This means there are no laws prohibiting them being kept as pets.;
, It is not advisable for pregnant women or people with compromised immune systems to handle baby birds. They may carry diseases, such as salmonella, which can infect humans.


Always observe strict hygiene when handling the bird. Thoroughly wash your hands before and after care. Dispose of waste in a sealed bag.

, If the bird has too much human contact, it may start to think you are its parent and will lose its fear of you. This makes it difficult to release the bird back into the wild. If your intention is to rear the bird to a stage when it is strong enough to be released, then avoid picking the bird up and handling it, especially during feeding. You want to retain the bird's natural fear of humans.


Try to avoid the baby bird becoming imprinted on you. This means the bird assumes he is human rather than a bird and can lead to difficulties when releasing him back into the wild.Do your best to avoid speaking to the bird. The goal should be to feed and care for the bird as if you are an ""invisible force.""

, Nestlings and fledglings are fed on an all insect diet by their parents, and do not drink water. If you try to drip feed the bird water, you stand a good chance of it inhaling water and drowning.

Read information on lories and lorikeets.,
Visit your local zoo or exotic bird rescue.,
Talk to people with experience.,
Foster a lory or lorikeet, if possible.",How to Know if Lories and Lorikeets Are Right for You1," Lories are large birds with short, blunted tails. They're usually red with yellow, green, and purple patches. On the other hand, lorikeets are small with long, pointed tails. Their feathers are mostly green with patches of yellow and red., Check your local library for books and/or magazines written by veterinarians and other credible experts. Search Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or scholarly databases for articles from scholarly journals. Read information online from government websites based in Australia and the South Pacific, where lories and lorikeets live in the wild., Many zoos house exotic birds. If yours houses lories and lorikeets, spend some time observing them. Volunteer at an exotic bird rescue to get hands-on experience. Talk to employees with advanced knowledge of lory and lorikeet behavior and needs., Find parents of lories and lorikeets through friends and/or social media. They'll be able to relate their experiences. Make sure you learn the downsides, as well as the benefits. If you have a local bird society, you should also talk to its members for some insight., Fostering will allow you to determine whether or not bird parenting is for you. Search for an exotic bird rescue in your area. Complete the necessary paperwork and agree to a background check, if necessary. Talk to the staff about how you'll need to prepare your home. Finally, honor any obligations you sign off on, such as returning the bird within a certain period of time if you choose not to adopt them."

Warm the bird.,
Keep the bird's beak clean.,
Measure the bird's progress.",How to Raise a Baby House Sparrow2," Put a heating pad set on low in a tissue box, and place some tissues in top of it. An alternative is to use a small bowl lined with paper towels. You can stand the bowl on a hot water bottle, or use an overhead heat lamp to keep the bird warm. Whichever you use, gently place the baby bird in it.


The ideal temperature is 85- 90 F.
Do not use terry clothes to line the nest as the claws and beak may become tangled to it.
Put the nest in a dark, quiet place where it won't be disturbed by children or pets.

, After feeding, wipe the bird's beak and face clean with a disposable wet wipe or cotton wool soaked in water. A soiled beak area can lead to bacterial infections., A Gram Scale may be used to measure the overall progress of your bird. Everyday before you feed your bird, weigh it. A healthy baby bird should gain weight everyday.


If your aim is to release the bird back into the wild, then consider not weighing the bird as the more contact you have, the more likely he is to imprint on you. If your intention is to raise the bird as a pet, then go ahead and weigh regularly to check progress.

"
"
Begin by feeding the baby bird puppy or cat food soaked in water.,
Add as many bugs as possible to the puppy or cat food.,
Dust all live foods with a vitamin and mineral supplement.,
Feed the bird often.,
Offer water, but only from a budgie sipper bottle.,
Change the food you feed the bird as it gets bigger.",How to Raise a Baby House Sparrow3," Add a baby bird formula or Pronutro to the water before mixing it into the food. Canned puppy or cat food has a higher protein content and are closer to the natural diet than adult dog food. Mash the food into a shallow bowl.


If the bird is not old enough to feed itself, break off small pieces, about half the size of your little fingernail, and tweezer feed it by hand.

, Sparrow natural diet includes dry foods such as buds and seeds, and live food such as spiders, snails, aphids, caterpillars, and other small invertebrates. Young birds tend to take live food better than dry food.


Please note, do not give earthworms to captive baby sparrows. There is something toxic about earthworms that makes captive birds die.Instead, trying offering the smallest sized crickets (available from reptile supply shops).
Another option is to offer clean white maggots, as sold by angling shops. Again, the maggot should only be fed when it's gut is empty. The black line in a maggot his food in his gut, so wait until this black line disappears before feeding to the baby bird.
You could also consider feeding dried insects, as sold for reptiles such as bearded dragons. Check your local pet store for supplies.

, You can use supplements such as Nutrobal (sold for reptiles) or Cricket Diet Calcium Paste (IZUG), which are sold at pet stores. This helps ensure balanced nutrition if the live food are deficient.

, Depending on the sparrow's age, either offer the food on tweezers directly into the gaping beak, or if the bird is old enough to feed himself, put the feed in a shallow container. Be aware it takes around 2 weeks for a baby bird to develop enough to feed himself.If the bird is very young and does not have many feathers, feed every half hour. If older feed every hour or two. The bird will start chirping and gaping when hungry and will stop eating when full.

, Young birds are not great at drinking from a shallow container. This is liable to cause accidental drowning., As the baby grows older, continue to feed soaked dog or cat food but add a variety of different foods for the bird to choose from as well. A good quality wild bird seed is ideal as the bird matures enough to take grain of its own accord. Place the seed in a shallow bowl to allow the bird to start feeding when they are able.


Keep the food clean of fecal soil, so clean the bowl at least once a day.

"
"
Put the baby bird in a cage when it begins hopping.,
Give the bird more and more time outdoors.,
Make sure the bird is ready for release.",How to Raise a Baby House Sparrow4," Begin leaving the cage outside during the day so other sparrows can visit. If you are avoiding close interaction with the bird and it is interacting with wild sparrows, then its chances of re-acclimating to the wild are much better.


If the baby bird is not interacting with wild birds then it needs to learn the songs of its species another way. This will allow it to communicate with other birds when it is released. There are audio files available online that you can play for the bird., Let it hop around on the grass after about 7-10 days old. If releasing the bird is your ultimate goal, try putting it in open space areas so they can learn to fly. Instinct will teach the bird to fly and discover what its wings are for.


Wait until it has wing feathers, then if it doesn't seem to know what to do then its probably isn't ready. To test out whether he's ready, take him outside and place him on the ground in an area that's safe from predators.
Leave the bird to its own devices for 20 minutes, if nothing happens bring it back indoors and try again another day.

, If you're going to release it, make sure the baby can eat on its own. You also need to be sure that it is not imprinted on you.


If the bird is imprinted on you, then it cannot be released into the wild. It needs to continue as a pet."

Expect to give your bird lots of attention.,
Prepare to clean every day.,
Expect to replace their water several times a day.,
Familiarize yourself with the diets of lories and lorikeets.,

Read up on common diseases in lories and lorikeets.",How to Know if Lories and Lorikeets Are Right for You2," Lories and lorikeets are social birds who are happiest among other members of their species. Be prepared to devote lots of time talking to and playing with your bird. If you have a demanding schedule that requires you to be away from home a lot, you should consider adopting at least two birds to prevent them from getting lonely.

In captivity, lories and lorikeets can live between 10 and 15 years. This is quite a responsibility if your long-term plans include relocation, marriage, starting a family, or other changes that could be stressful for a companion animal., You can't train a bird to use a litter box. They poop where they please, whether they're in their cage or not. Bird droppings can carry dangerous bacteria and viruses that can be inhaled. Expect to clean inside and around the cage every day with non-toxic disinfectants like animal safe dish soaps. You'll also have to clean the water bowl, food bowl, toys, perch, etc., Lorikeets like to use their water for bathing, as well as drinking. They can get food, feathers, even poop into their water. Check their bowl every few hours. When you see stuff floating in the water, clean the bowl and replace it with fresh water., Unlike other psittacine species, lories and lorikeets thrive on flowers, pollen, and nectar. Make sure their diet is at least 75 to 80 percent nectar. Substitutes from your local pet store require regular mixing to prevent spoilage. You can also feed lories and lorikeets fruits and veggies like pitted apple cherries, dark leafy greens, and boiled potatoes.

You'll also need to learn about foods that you need to avoid at all costs. Avocados and chocolate, for instance, are toxic to exotic bird species. Pale greens, like celery and iceberg lettuce, lack the nutrient density that lories and lorikeets require., Lories and lorikeets live in trees and are used to flying between branches. Look into creating perches that will give them (literally) a bird's eye view of the room. Prepare to give them places to hide as they do in the wild.Lories and lorikeets also need UVA and UVB light to produce their own Vitamin D. If you can't give your bird at least four hours of unfiltered sunlight each day, be prepared to buy a full-spectrum UV lamp from your local pet store., Familiarize yourself with prevention, treatment, and cures. Visit your local library or read veterinary journals for information. Talk to your local veterinarian for a first-hand point of view and for a better idea of which diseases are common in your area.For example, diseases like Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) have no cure and can be devastating for lories, lorikeets, and their parents. Consider whether you're prepared to deal with this possibility."

Then, deduct your current expenses and amount of money you save or invest. The difference is the amount of money you'll be able to dedicate to your lory or lorikeet., Expect to pay at least $200-$300 for the adoption fee for each bird.Add the cost for their cage (at least $200) and UV lamp. Consider buying a mister for daily showers. You'll also need to buy one bowl for water, one for nectar, and one for fresh fruits and veggies. On average, expect your initial costs to run between $300 and $1,800., Figure out your monthly costs like food and toys.

Thread the end of the rope through your noose, towards the pole.,
Tie a simple overhand knot right where the two sticks meet.,
Check your trap by gently pushing down on the perch.,
Place your trap where it is the best place for a bird to land.,
Note that small birds only provide minimal calories.",How to Make a Bird Trap1," Looking somewhat like an upside down ""L,"" the Ojibwa Bird Pole has been a staple of indigenous hunters in Canada for centuries. Birds perch on a small horizontal branch, which you rig to fall under their weight. They are then caught in a noose positioned underneath before they can fly away. You'll need:



The Pole: A large branch, roughly the width of a few fingers and 5-6 feet long.

The Perch: A pencil-thin stick, roughly six inches long.
A rock, roughly the size of your fist.
A 3-4 foot cord or rope, shoestrings and sleeping bag chords will work.
A knife.;
, You drive the bottom side into the ground, so it needs to be sharp enough to plant. The sharpened top end prevents a bird from landing on the top, not your perch.

, It should be as wide as your smaller stick. Your perch is inserted into this hole, as well as the string.

, You just want the rock secured to one end of the string. You can use any knot that will keep the rock in place.

, The knot should be small enough that the string can still move freely through the post hole. The stick will jam in next to the string, creating the perch and also holding the string, and thus the rock, in place.


The knot should be able to move freely through the hole in the pole when the stick isn't jammed in.
Some trappers tie the small knot first, then put the stick in. Others put the stick in first. Experiment with what works for you.

, The perch should be right next to the string, though the string should still move freely. This ""perch"" needs to fall under the weight of the bird in order to snare it, so don't jam it in too tightly.


You should have two feet of string or more on the other side of your knot., Make a noose big enough to fit your fist through. If you're unfamiliar with the slip noose knot, you can still make one easily with some practice:


Double the string back on itself to make a U-shaped loop.
Run the end of the string back towards the top of the loop. It will look a bit like a flattened ""S.""
Wrap the end of the rope around the doubled line 2-3 times.
Pull the rope tight, cinching the wrap around the doubled string., You'll be left with a circle of rope draped over your perch. The end of the noose will be at the end of the perch, and the noose knot itself will be close to the pole. You should have two semi-circles of rope draped off of the stick.

, An overhand knot is simply when you create a loop and pull the string through. All you have to do is wrap the end around the rope near your hole, creating a circle, then run the end through that circle. This should be right at the point where your two sticks meet., As you do, the weight of the rock should pull the rope through the hole, which will quickly tighten the noose and grab your finger. Note, however, that these traps are very variable. Play with the size of the noose and the perch -- the closer they are to the same size, the more effective your trap will be. Also, try and tie the smallest knot possible in the beginning so that the rope can move freely through the hole -- you want it to snap shut quickly once the stick is removed.

, These traps are effective in open fields, where it is the best place for the bird to land. In the forest, most birds will choose tree branches.For more effective traps, place a little birdseed on the trap, adhering it with peanut butter.

, Small birds, which are about all this trap can handled only provide about 100 calories apiece. Unless you have 4-5 successful traps, there are much better ways to look for food, including insects and game traps for rabbits and squirrels. Still, especially in the winter, these traps can be a viable source of nutrition when paired with other survival methods."

Schedule daily flying time.,
Get an out-of-cage playset.,
Give your birds a bath.,
Get your finches a long cage.,
Provide more perches than you have finches.,
Buy a climbing ladder for your finch.,
Make your finch feel secure with a nest.,
Buy some toys they can destroy.,
Make a foraging toy part of dinner.",How to Keep Finches Entertained," Your pet finch needs to stretch its wings every day. Flying time is important for both their physical and mental health. Let your finch out in a closed area such as a living room or office for at least an hour every day so that it can fly around. Just be sure that all openings out of the room and harmful obstructions are closed or covered.Close all windows and doors. This is the best way to keep your finch from escaping. Make sure all openings that could lead out of the room, and especially those that lead outside, are closed.Cover windows with curtains or blinds and mirrors with a towel or sheet to keep your finch from mistakenly flying into the glass.
Turn off all fans and small appliances such as stoves or lamps that may run hot. Also make sure to cover up or move chewing hazards such as cords and house plants while your bird is out. ;
, Finches are active, so giving them with some entertainment when they are out of their cage is a good idea. Cage-top and tabletop play gyms are available from most pet stores and bird speciality stores and can provide your finch with climbing, chewing, and flying activities all in a safe space., Finches like to keep clean, and their out-of-cage time is a great time to entertain them with a bath. Let your finch bathe itself in a shallow dish of tepid, clean water. They only need around one inch (2.5 cm) of water, and the dish should be heavy enough that your finch can’t flip it.Some finches also like being misted with cool water and preening. Try using a spray bottle of clean water and gently misting your finch, making sure to not get them too wet, if your bird doesn’t seem to enjoy bathtime.

, Finches love to fly even more than most birds. Even with daily fly time, they need a cage big enough to let them fly without much obstruction from toys, perches or dishes. Look for a rectangular cage that is at least 24 inches (61 cm) long, and at least half that size in width and height. If you have multiple finches, double that size.Make sure your finch has a clear flight path from one end of the cage to the other without being blocked by perches and dishes.

, Finches love to hop from perch to perch. Help keep them entertained while they are in their cage by giving them multiple perches on which to hop. Find perches of different sizes and textures to help keep their feet strong. Natural wood and rope-wrapped perches are great for small birds.Try to avoid plain wooden dowels, as these are too smooth and
If you have more than one finch in a cage, they can sometimes be territorial about having another bird on their perch. Providing more perches than you have finches helps keep the peace.

, Finches naturally like to climb, and adding a climbing ladder to their cage helps them fulfill that instinct. Colorful wooden climbing ladders are great toys to keep your finch entertained when they are in their cage.Finches also like swings where they can perch and rock back and forth.

, Finches are nesting birds, so they constantly look for nesting materials. If you have a single finch or a single pair of mixed-sex finches, providing them with a nesting box and nesting material such as twigs, moss, and dead leaves will help them satisfy their nesting instinct.It also provides them with a place where they feel secure.If you have multiple finch pairs or multiple finches of the same sex in a single cage, they may become territorial about the nest. You can try putting multiple nests in the cage, but you should watch your finches closely for fighting.

, Finches like to peck and chew. Give them a few toys that they can destroy so that the rest of their cage stays nice and intact. Rope toys and soft, undyed wood toys with bells or other noisemakers are often appreciated., Foraging toys help birds work for their food the way they would in the wild. They are a great mental activity for your finch. Place some treats or some of your finch’s daily meal in the foraging toy. Try not to put more than half their meal in there, though, as your finch should have easy access to food if it doesn’t feel like playing."

Assure that birds are disease free.,
Keep the birds in individual cages at first.,
Introduce your birds to each other when they are young, if possible.,
Introduce the birds outside of their cages.,
Put cockatiels together in the same cage only if they get along.,
Consider keeping your birds in separate cages permanently.",How to Keep Multiple Cockatiels1," Before you put multiple cockatiels in the same home, you should make sure that they are all disease free. Do not allow them to have contact with each other right away and have all incoming birds assessed by a veterinarian before they share space with your existing birds.You should try to quarantine a new bird in your home for 30 days before introducing it to your other birds.A healthy bird should be generally alert, should have well cared for feathers, clear eyes, and should not have discharge coming from the eyes or nares, which are what the bird breathes through.;
, It is important to let the birds adjust to each other before attempting to put them into a cage together. Allowing them to get to know each other while they each have their own cage will let you assess whether the birds have the personalities to be able to coexist together., Younger birds can typically adjust to life with other birds more easily than older birds that have been raised away from other birds. If you have a young bird and you are contemplating adding another bird to your flock, do it sooner rather than later.However, young birds that are raised together will always be more focused on each other than on you. They will likely form a strong bond that lasts their whole lives.

, A cockatiel's cage is its special safe place, so they can be territorial when a new bird is introduced into their space. To make sure your bird's first contact goes more smoothly, take both birds to a neutral location and let them meet face to face away from their cages.

The key is to minimize any chance of friction or aggression when the birds are first meeting each other, so that they can get to know each other peacefully.
This meeting must be supervised so that you can move them away from each other if they do not get along., Typically, putting cockatiels of the same sex together in a cage together works well if they have gotten along during initial meetings. However, to avoid potential territorial behavior, consider getting a new cage that is big enough for both birds and have them both move into it at the same time. With enough space and a neutral territory to begin with, the stage is set for them to live peacefully together.

If you put male and female cockatiels together they may get along but you will likely end up with baby cockatiels.

, Sometimes when you have multiple birds it is easiest to just keep them in different cages. This will assure that they each have enough space and that they each get all the food, water, and access to toys that they need. It will also help assure that you avoid the chance that they are aggressive or territorial with one another.Keeping birds in separate cages doesn't mean that they won't interact with each other. You can put the cages next to each other and you can let them out of their cages at the same time, if you like.

Buy a birdcage.,
Consider it's surroundings.,
Keep it and the cage hygienic.,
Also, about once a week you'll want to sterilize the cage - but don't use bleach.,
Keep it healthy and give it a healthily balanced diet.,
Buy a little friend and keep it entertained.,
Show care.,
Now and then you should let your bird out of their cage in a secure room.",How to Look After Pet Birds," Birdcages can vary in size - but you'll want to get a fairly big one. Depending on the type of bird, you'll want to invest in different types. Make sure the bird cannot escape through the gaps and has enough room to stretch its wings and fly about. Tip: remember perches for the cage!;
, Keep the cage in a safe place, and keep it away from any cats (or dogs). Over time, your bird(s) may feel more secure around any other pets - so don't abandon them, just avoid any possible threats scaring the bird.

, Perhaps add a birdbath to the cage to freshen itself up. Bird do naturally keep them clean - but a small and extremely shallow (a centimeter deep) bird bath won't hurt. Also, clean out the cage properly. Do this on a basis (2-4 days - or it could be once or twice a week), depending on how long it takes for the cage to start to show any signs of uncleanliness. Cleaning out the cage means:


wiping down the whole cage, perches and toys too






replacing the sandpaper at the bottom of the cage






new food and water






clean bird bath water (if you have one)







, Just sterilize the perches and food and water bowls in boiling hot water.

, Feed your bird food suitable for that specific species. Most pet shops sell much different bird food for many different species. Keeping it healthy otherwise (exercise) just consists of different bird toys and making sure it has enough space. If you think your bird has developed any possible illnesses, speak to a vet.

, A little friend to keep it company. This is particularly useful if owners aren't in the house for long periods of time on a daily basis.

, Care for your bird(s) and show you love it. Give it lots of attention, and make things fun for it. Add a few bird toys to the cage and always keep it healthy and happy. Remember as long as your bird has the following:

Food and drink






Safety






Warmth






Love







, Make sure all curtains are drawn over the windows and all poisonous plants and wires are covered or even better removed. Also, make sure there is no water in the room so the birds don't drown and all ceiling fans are turned off. If you think your bird will get harmed by something it is best to prevent it in some way. You also need to know how to catch the bird.

Pet your lories and lorikeets regularly.,
Let your bird spend time out of the cage.,
Keep your lory or lorikeet close to you whenever possible.",How to Entertain Lories and Lorikeets1," While it may take a few weeks for a new bird to get used to you, lories and lorikeets are highly sociable birds. They enjoy being petted and handled. Once your bird seems comfortable in your presence, make petting a part of your daily routine.If your bird seems uncomfortable and moves away from your touch, it may need more time to get used to you. Wait until your bird comes to you and remains relaxed during petting to handle it regularly.;
, Due to their social nature, lories and lorikeets enjoy time out of the cage with their owner. During downtime, allow your bird to come out of the cage to explore and interact with you. Strive to let your bird out of the cage at least once a day.Make sure any windows are closed and that you remove any hazards, like small items that can be swallowed, before releasing your bird from the cage.
Keep other pets out of the room when letting your bird loose, especially pets like cats that may prey on a bird.

, Lories and lorikeets enjoy being near people and may develop behavioral problems if left alone too often. Keep their cages in a room where you spend a lot of time. If your bird does well out of the cage, bring your bird from room to room with you whenever possible."

Build a backyard trap using a mousetrap, a cardboard box, and some string.,
Purchase a live rat or mouse trap, the kind with a spring.,
Cut a small hole in the center of a cardboard box.,
Fasten the mouse trap to the ground with 2-3 long metal nails.,
Tie a loop in one end of the thread.,
Tie a loop in the end of the thread opposite the mousetrap.,
Tie the string around the loaded mousetrap spring.,
Place some bread or birdseed on the mousetrap as bait and wait for a hit.,
Wear long sleeves and gloves when grabbing a live bird.",How to Make a Bird Trap2," This simple trap attaches a cardboard box to a mouse trap spring. When the bird lands on the trap, the box falls and contains it for later. The trap will also spring on squirrels and other small game, so it can be an effective trap in a survival scenario as well.

, You want the ""classic"" trap with a wooden board attached to a spring-loaded trap. They catch the mouse by flipping a metal bar on them when they touch the bait-laden trap. You can find these traps at almost any hardware store., Use a pen to punch a whole in the middle of the box. You want the box to be roughly twice the size of the bird to trap it., You want the trap to be secure enough that it doesn't move when the bird lands on it.

, Temporarily loop it around part of the mouse trap. Thread the other end through the hole in the top of the box. Later on, you'll attach this loop to the spring. But, for now, you just need it looped somewhere on the trap to create tension in the line.


Rest the box on it's edge, so that the open part faces the trap. It should be angled up, so that a bird could fly under the box and land on the trap.

, Run a nail through the loop, then nail this end of the string into the ground. Pull the nail out enough to keep the line tight and the box stays balanced on it's edge. The inside of the box should be facing the ground, with one side raised to allow birds to enter. Adjust the thread so that the highest edge of the box is only a foot or so in the air.


The box needs to be high enough the a bird flies into it, but low enough that it can shut before the bird can fly out.

, Load the spring but not the arm, as if you were setting it for a mouse. When you press on the trap, it should unload quickly. You want the string to be on the mechanism that spring when a mouse (or, in this case, bird) steps on it. When the bird lands on the trap the box will fall around the bird, trapping it.


The tension of the string is holding the box in place. Make sure you tie the string so that it sits correctly.
Test the string by pushing on the trap. The string should lose tension and box will fall.

, Do not go near the trap, since constant human activity near the trip will scare birds away. If you see that the box has fallen, go check it to see if you caught anything. , To get the bird out of your trap, lift the box slightly, reach in, and grab the bird firmly around the body. Wear gloves and long sleeves to prevent any pecking or scratching wounds. The darkness should disorient it enough that you can easily pick it off the ground.


There is always the chance that you'll catch a rabbit or squirrel as well with your trap since it is on the ground. Be ready for anything.

Set aside more time for bird-related chores.,
Spend quality time with all of your birds.,
Be prepared for a change in your bird's interest in you.",How to Keep Multiple Cockatiels2," Having multiple cockatiels will increase the amount of time it takes to properly care for them. You will need to spend more quality time with your pets but you will also need to spend more time cleaning cages and changing out food and water dishes.Even if you have multiple birds in the same cage, that cage will get dirtier quicker. It will require more frequent cleaning than it did with only one bird.

, When you have multiple birds, it's important that you give each of them some focused time. Take each of them out of their cages on a regular basis and take the time to train and socialize all of them, so that all of your birds continue to be healthy and happy pets.It is a good idea to make a schedule for when you hang out with each bird, so that they all get equal attention.
One-sided attention can make some birds jealous and aggressive towards you over time.

, When you only have one cockatiel, it will likely focus all of its attention on you. It may sing or whistle at you and it may like to spend time sitting on your hand or your shoulder. However, if you introduce a new bird into your home, then your first bird might give a lot of attention to your new bird. This is totally normal behavior that may or may not occur with the addition of new birds but you should prepare yourself for that change.The downside of a change in interest in you is typically outweighed by the benefit that your bird will receive by being able to interact with another bird all of the time. They can give each other more interaction and attention than a human typically has time to provide.

Provide a home with sufficient space.,
Give your birds rattling toys.,
Provide foraging toys.,
Rotate toys weekly.,
Provide perches.,
Use food to entertain your birds.",How to Entertain Lories and Lorikeets2," In general, the larger the better for a lory or lorikeet's cage. Opt for the biggest cage you can fit in your home. Lories and lorikeets should have cages that are at least 36 inches high by 48 inches long and 28 inches wide (approximately 91, 123, and 71 centimeters). If you have space for a bigger cage than this, however, get one., Rattling bird toys are sold in most pet stores. They can also be purchased online. Rattling toys are particularly popular with loris and lorikeets as they enjoy toys that make noise. Look for bird toys that rattle, jingle, or otherwise make sounds.Keep in mind, however, noisy toys can cause irritation. It may be a good idea to remove noisy toys from the cage during the night.

, Lories and lorikeets forage naturally in the wild. Foraging toys, which you can buy online or at most pet stores, provide necessary stimulation that prevents boredom. It's vital to have several quality foraging toys in your lory or lorikeet's cage to keep it entertained.Foraging toys are toys you can use to hide food and objects your bird likes. This will give your bird a chance to scavenge in their cage like they would in the wild.

, Lories and lorikeets do get bored easily. If you leave them with the same toys, they'll quickly get tired of playing with them. Have several different sets of toys for your birds and rotate the toys once a week. This will prevent your birds from getting tired of their toys.It's okay to use the same types of toys, however, as long as they're a different style or design. Lories and lorikeets always enjoy noisy toys and foraging toys, but may get bored with the same toy for weeks on end.

, Lories and lorikeets love climbing on perches in their cage, so be sure to stock the cage with plenty of perches. These can be purchased at a pet store and then installed in the cage. Go for perches made of natural wood over artificial materials, as these will help prevent sores on your bird's feet., Before you leave for the day, take a small treat or piece of food. Hide it somewhere in the cage for your bird, such as under a toy or in a box. This will give your bird something to do during the day."

Due to their social nature, lories and lorikeets tend to do better with cage mates.Lories and lorikeets generally don't get along with other species of birds. Avoid pairing them with other types of birds.

, When petting or handling a lori or lorikeet, focus exclusively on that bird. Lories and lorikeets are possessive animals that are jealous by nature. They may become territorial and act out if they don't have your full attention., Before bringing a toy home to your lori or lorikeet, examine it carefully. Watch out for broken edges or loose strings. Avoid toys that unscrew easily, as lories and lorikeets may unscrew toys and swallow small parts., Lories and lorikeets should never be let out without supervision. Due to their curious nature, lories and lorikeets may get into things if left alone. Watch them closely to prevent accidental injury. Intervene quickly if your bird gets into something dangerous."

Roll up two rags like a burrito and lay them together in the box to form a circle or a ring in the middle. The width of the ring will depend on how many eggs you have an how large they are., The number depends on how large the stuffed animals are and how much room you have in the box. Arrange them around the circumference of the circle to enclose the egg more for warmth. Make sure the stuffed animals are big enough to press against the sides of the shoebox and push the rags closer to the eggs.

, Place it in the corner of the box to prevent spills. Refill the water daily or as the water level goes down with evaporation. Check the water at least twice a day., Look for an inexpensive one at charity shops or garage sales. For a high-quality lamp, shop at your local pet supply store. Buy a lamp with an adjustable neck that you can reposition to achieve the ideal temperature., Digital readouts make it easier to track temperatures to the tenth of a degree. You'll need this kind of precision when incubating eggs. Look for these instruments in any big box store. Many locations sell single devices that measure both temperature and humidity., Position the lamp so that the light is shining into the box. Place the thermometer and humidity gauge in the location you'll place the eggs. Aim for a temperature of about 98.6 °F (37.0 °C) and a humidity level between 55 and 70 percent., This will help you to recreate the ideal temperature and humidity level. Take the eggs to your local extension office for identification. You can also visit several online resources, such as:


The Audubon Society's Guide to North American Birds (U.S., Canada, Mexico)The Woodland Trust (UK)The Cornell Lab of OrnithologySialis, Lay them in the washcloth ring you set up. Place them side by side. Don't lay them on top of each other. Otherwise, you could break them during rotation.

, Sunlight provides more warmth without lowering the humidity. Keep the box out of direct sunlight, which could raise the temperature to dangerous levels. You could put the box in an west-facing window in the morning or an east-facing window in the afternoon. If the weather is warm enough, put the box outside in a semi-shaded spot out of the reach of predators during the day.


Depending on the species of the bird, longer periods of daylight might make your eggs hatch a bit sooner., Turn off the heat lamp if the temperature goes above 101 °F (38 °C). Keep it off until the temperature drops to the ideal level. If you notice the heat getting too high on a regular basis, try repositioning the lamp., The exact level depends on the species you're incubating.Add more water to raise the humidity. If you keep getting readings above 70 percent, reduce the amount of water you have in the incubator.

, Don't spin them, just turn them. You could buy a mechanical egg rotator at your local farm supply store. However, if you're around the incubator regularly, you can rotate the eggs by hand. How often you need to rotate them depends on the species, but the average rate is about two rotations per hour., Most species can handle cool temperatures as low as 61 °F (16 °C), so it shouldn't hurt the eggs if you switch off the lamp when you go to sleep.Replacing the lid will help to lock in some heat overnight. Just remember to remove the lid and turn the heat lamp back on in the morning. Set a reminder for yourself to be on the safe side.

Only female parrots produce eggs. In the wild, a female parrot only lays eggs after having sex with a mate. But female parrots in captivity may or may not lay eggs in their cage.Parrots do not lay eggs until they reach the age of sexual maturity. For many birds, this occurs at approximately 3 years old.
Egg production can have a negative impact on a bird's health. If you have a solo parrot laying eggs, contact your vet.;
, Many people do not want to wait several years to determine the sex of their bird. For instance, if you are a parrot breeder, you want to know if the birds you have are sexually compatible. It is possible to have a DNA test performed on your parrot. These results are typically fairly accurate, but not absolute.Ask your vet if he performs DNA-testing.
There are labs you can send samples to. You will need to follow the specific instructions for shipping either a feather or nail-clipping.

, Surgical sexing should be performed by an experienced vet. If you are not an expert in animal medicine, it is unlikely that you will be able to properly find and identify the sex organs of birds. Ask your vet if he performs surgical sexing, or if he can recommend a doctor who does.


This method is not used regularly since the advent of DNA testing.
Surgical sexing is mostly used to determine adult parrots with an unknown history. It has been known to harm the reproductive systems of smaller, younger birds.

, When you purchase or adopt a parrot, make sure that you ask for information about the breed. Different types of parrots look and behave differently. Some of them have easier ways to discern gender, too. With the Quaker Parrot, the only definitive way to tell the gender is to wait for the bird to lay eggs.Some female Quakers do not lay eggs until they are more than 10 years old. You might have to be very patient to determine the sex of your Quaker.
You can make an educated guess based on some behavioral traits of Quaker Parrots. For example, a male parrot may move his tail briskly side to side during high hormonal periods. Females are more apt to move their tails up and down.

, African Grey parrots have several physical characteristics that can help you tell whether you have a male or female. However, it is important to remember that these are general traits and do not lead to a scientific determination. The best way to tell the sex of an African Grey is to wait for eggs or have a DNA test performed.Male African Greys tend to be larger. They are typically 12-14 inches in height, while females are usually less than 12 inches tall.
Male African Greys usually have eye patches that are pointed, while a female's eye patches are mainly rounded.
Female African Greys have light grey feathers on the underside of their bodies. In males, these feathers are typically a darker grey.

, The Ringneck differs from some other breeds because it is sexually dismorphic. That term means that there is a way to visually distinguish the gender of these birds. A male Ringneck develops a brightly colored, dark ring around his neck. The female will have a very faint ring.The ring does not develop until the bird is sexually mature. This will occur when he is about 3 years old.
A female Ringneck typically has a rounder face than a male.

, There is a fairly accurate way to determine the sex of Senegal Parrots. The under-tail feathers of a male Senegal is almost always pure yellow. It is very rare to find a male Senegal with any green in these feathers.Female Senegals have under-tail feathers that are a combination of yellow and green.
This method is not 100% accurate.

, The Eclectus is one of the simpler breeds to visually sex. The male typically is mostly green with vivid splashes of red on his wing bends and the sides of his body. The female Eclectus is mainly red, blue, or purple.


The male has a candy corn (multi-colored) beak, while the female almost always has an entirely black beak.

, If you are considering adopting or buying a parrot, make sure that you have considered all aspects of bird ownership. For instance, in order to be happy, parrots like to have at least a little bit of time outside of the cage each day. Be certain that you are comfortable having a parrot flying around or house before bringing one home.If you have a spare room, consider devoting that room solely to your parrot. She will appreciate having her own space to fly.
Parrots like to chew, so make sure to cover wires, candles, air fresheners, or anything else that would be harmful to a bird.

, Parrots are very smart and can make wonderful companions. Remember, she is not just decoration. She has a personality, likes, and dislikes. Take some time to get to know your bird.Parrots like to be social, so spend time with her each day. Talk to her or try singing to her.
Consider adopting two parrots. They will enjoy having company.

, If your parrot will spend most of her time in a cage, try to make it a comfortable space. Purchase the largest cage that you have room for. Make sure there is room for her to have several perches and toys.Place perches on different levels so your bird has a variety of places to play and rest.

, Like humans, parrots need food from a variety of sources, including grains and vegetables. You can purchase commercial parrot pellets as a base for your parrot's diet. Then, supplement the pellets with specific ""human"" foods.Feed your parrot a variety of vegetables, such as zucchini, peas, and green beans. Cut them into small pieces to feed her.
Your parrot can eat almost any type of grain-based breakfast cereal. Feed her dry cereal each morning.
Table foods should make up 20-40% of your parrot's total diet.
Provide your parrot with fresh, clean water daily.

, If you do not have a perch you can use the back of a kitchen chair, or any chair which has a back that they can easily perch on, and not move too far around on.

, You can use a pen or pencil (just be careful and don't let them destroy it or be injured by it) or a wooden chopstick, or a Popsicle stick. You'll want to use an item that they don't normally play with too much, but that they're not afraid of and are interested in. If your parrot doesn't show interest in the objects at first, play with them yourself. Don't allow them to hold it, they'll quickly decide they want it if you're playing with it.

, Hold it near them to make it especially attractive. Once they take it in their beak and want it, take it away (gently and kindly).Hold the object just out of their reach until they raise a foot (usually to take it with their foot). Once their foot is raised, even slightly, praise the parrot (Good bird!) and give them the object immediately. Repeat this several times until they clearly make the connection between raising the foot and the object.

, However you will need to pick a phrase you don't normally use with your parrot. ""Hello"" and ""Hi"" alone are not good choices, because you probably say this to your parrot already, or they hear you say it all the time on the telephone. If you really want to use ""Hello"" or ""Hi"", change your tone and how you say it, so it's different than normal. Like Heeeeeelllo! Or Hiiiiiiiii!

, You can use both a verbal and physical command, and simply wave your first finger, bending it up and down. Offer the stick and say the command or action before they raise their foot. Once they complete the trick (by raising their foot) praise them.

, Repeat the above, but do not give them the stick every time and do not offer the stick at all during the trick but keep it visible in your hand that you're doing the physical command with (or if no physical command, then the hand you used before). Reduce the reward to only occasionally. But always give the verbal praise when they perform. You also want a clear and distinct foot raise. If they only raise it a little bit, ignore it at this time. You want the correct behavior and they'll be testing how little they can do for the verbal praise.

, Continue doing it, and reward occasionally with the stick as well, but keep it out of view while doing the trick. Once you've done all that, you can lose the stick completely. They now know the behavior (raising their foot) and know the reward (praise and attention).

, You won't need to start from scratch though, just use the stick again from step 7, and they should relearn it immediately. You only need to do this trick every week or so for them to remember and enjoy it.

Be patient.",How to Teach Your Bird to Talk," Not all birds can or will talk, so the first thing you should do is find out more about your bird. There isn't much point trying to teach a bird to talk if it's just going to whistle back at you. Some of the bird species that can learn to speak include:Budgerigar
Monk Parakeet
Amazonian Parrots
Indian Ringneck
Quaker Parrot
Eclectus
Hill Myna
African Grey
Cockatiel
Cockatoo;
, Birds that are capable of speech are social animals. It is very important to develop a relationship by speaking to them often, so that it trusts you and grows accustomed to your voice. It is recommended to spend as much time as possible with the bird the first few months, speaking to it in gentle tones.Make sure to play with your bird often, every day. These birds in the wild have many interactions each day, and they engage with lots of stimuli. Evolved for group life, these birds like to be well-socialized. Spending lots of time with your bird will help ensure you foster a good relationship.

, Like training any animal, talking birds need short, frequent and regular training sessions. Make sure you build a plan such that you are able to give your bird the time and attention it needs in order to maximize its learning potential.


Make a schedule.
Limit training sessions to five minutes, two to five times a day.Plan to work with your bird many times a day.

, Pick expressions it is likely to hear often from you and other people, such as:


hello
bye-bye
night-night
your bird's name

, The psychologist B.F. Skinner taught pigeon to twirl and read by training them with baby steps. The imitation of a tones or parts of words, can be a first step in learning to imitate words. When training incrementally, it is important to continually raise the bar for your animal., The closeness will help build the relationship between you and your bird, as well as help focus the bird on the sounds you want them to make.

, Experiments involving African Grey parrots, such as the infamous Alex, show that these birds learn better when two people are involved. This is called the model/rival method, wherein another speaker demonstrates the desired communication, and the bird learns to speak by observing articulations in context.Escaped birds have even been found to teach wild birds to talk.This highlights the social nature of how birds learn to communicate.

, For example, say ""Up"" when you lift up your bird. This will teach it to associate a movement with certain words., Just like a child, birds benefit when learning from a sense of fun. By giving rewards, such as treats, and engaging with your bird in an excited way, it encourages the bird to enjoy this new language game.


Rewards should be given immediately after the desire behavior is performed. This helps the bird know it is doing something correct.
Avoid rewarding the bird when it is not talking. This will strengthen its desire to perform.
Experiment. Maybe you're pet's less of a hello and more of a howdy kind of bird. If your bird does respond well to what or how you're trying to teach them, try something else.
Give your bird a variety of sounds to produce, you not only make sure they're entertained, you stimulate their brain's natural tendency to learn with novelty. Studies have shown that song birds learn to sing in much the same way human babies learn to talk, through babble and vocal experimentation., Do this for up to 5 minutes at a time. Longer than this can cause boredom, overly straining the bird.

, Learning capacities vary species to species and bird to bird. Some species can begin speaking after just a few months, and some take years to develop the capacity to speak.Give your feathered friend some time to express themselves, and they'll return the respect.

Decide on a word to teach your bird.,
Tell your bird this word often.,
Be persistent!,
If your bird is an exceptionally intelligent kind, like an Amazon, Macaw, or African Grey, try to teach him the meanings of words.,
Whenever your bird learns a new word, reward her with a special treat like a nut, seed, or a tiny bit of cheese, along with plenty of scratches and praise!

",How to Teach Your Bird to Speak," An easy first word is your bird's name, term of affection (""sweetie,"" ""baby,"" etc) or another word you often tell your bird. Avoid long words or words that have the letter ""P"" in them, as these are difficult for your bird to say.;
, Don't just mindlessly repeat it - say it with enthusiasm and happiness! Your bird will then pay more attention to the word, and hence is more likely to learn it.

, It might not seem like it, but your bird will probably learn the word. However, remember that sometimes your bird will not be able to learn how to speak. If this is the case with your bird, value him for his companionship, not his speaking ability.

, In other words, only say nut (example) when you or your bird has a nut, not just randomly.

Teach a hand-tamed bird.,
Encourage with a treat.,
Slowly move the treat around in a circle around him horizontally.,
Reinforce the desired behavior with a reward.,
Repeat.,
Provide cues.,
Move to advanced tricks.,
Enjoy the bird's tricks.",How to Teach a Parrot to Spin in Place and Do a Flip," This trick is easiest to teach if the bird is hand tame and already comfortable with sitting on its owners finger.;
, With the bird on your finger of one hand, take his favorite treat (such as a slice of apple or a small piece of millet) in the other hand and hold it in front of him so that he can see it but where it is just out of his reach.

, Keep the treat in front of him so that he can see it. At the same time, say a short command word like ""Spin"". 


If the bird is interested in the treat, he will likely follow the treat and spin in place. Moving your hand in a circle around him will become the visual cue and the command word will be the audio cue for the trick.

, After he makes his spin, reward him with the treat and reinforce his good behavior by praising him in a cheery voice. Say: ""Good bird!"".

, Reward when the bird does the trick successfully. It's best to train in short periods. Repetition is key with consistent praise. If the bird loses interest or isn't making progress, it's best to stop and try again at another time. Be patient and positive.

, After several successful training sessions with the bird consistently performing the trick, try giving the visual cue and audio cue without holding the treat. If the bird does the trick successfully, reward him with the treat after he finishes. The bird will learn to associate the trick with the visual and audio cues.

, Once the parrot has learned this trick, you can try to teach more complicated but similar tricks. By moving the treat in a circle underneath your finger, the bird has to follow the treat as it goes underneath him and flip like a gymnast on a high bar.  Remember to give an audio cue such as ""Flip!"", reward the bird with a treat and give verbal praise. ""Good Bird!""

, Soon the bird will understand the difference between the visual/audio cue for a spin and a visual/audio cue for a flip and will perform on command. Very smart birds who learn this trick can perform it when they are sitting on a perch or spin while standing on a flat surface!

Gain your bird's trust.,
Offer your bird treats.,
Provide your bird with a large cage.,
Feed your bird a balanced diet.",How to Stop a Greenwing Macaw from Biting1," Spend a few days getting to know your macaw before beginning training. Physical affection isn’t always the best way to go early on. Engage in low-stress, low-demand activities such as talking to your bird in a calm, soft voice. , When your bird feels more comfortable around you, the next step is to get it to accept a treat from you. Don’t force the treat acceptance process – wait for your bird to come to you. Once a treat has been accepted, you can gently pet your bird on the chest.


The best treats for macaws are nuts, such as macadamias, pecans, filberts, almonds, and walnuts. , Macaws are big birds that need a substantial amount of exercise. Purchase a cage that provides ample space for toys, multiple perches, and food dishes, while still leaving enough room for your bird to move freely.


Bring elements of the natural world into your cage. Try making perches out of sticks and placing small branches with leaves in the cage to make your bird feel more at home.
Give your bird time out of the cage, too. This will let the macaw get much needed exercise and stimulation. Place perches around the house, especially in areas where you or family members tend to hang out, so that your bird can feel socially engaged., A balanced diet consists of 85% pellets, 5% varied seeds, and 10% fresh fruits and veggies. Parrot mixes are available that combine formulated foods, seeds, dried foods and nuts. Additional supplements, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and cooked chicken and meat, are good ways to give your bird extra vitamins and protein. Be sure to provide your bird fresh drinking water everyday.

Embrace the chaos.",How to Take Care of a Quaker Parrot," Quakers are not the largest or most colorful of parrots, but they are among the smartest and (depending on the individual bird) most talkative. Familiarize yourself with the following general details before considering an acquisition:They average about 11-13 inches in length, and are typically grayish-white and green in color. They can live for 30 years in captivity, so consider this a long-term addition to your household.
Quakers hail originally from temperate parts of South America, but seem to thrive in just about any climate.
Concern about escaped Quakers’ ability to thrive and overwhelm native ecosystems is part of why ownership of the species is banned or restricted in over a dozen states, including California.Check your home state’s current policies before moving forward with any acquisition plans.;
, Terms like “smart,” “fearless,” “curious,” and “mischievous” pop up frequently in descriptions of quakers, and with good reason. Living with one is akin in many respects to living with a small child.They are typically fast learners and gifted mimics, so quakers usually make very talkative avian companions. (Never assume that any individual parrot, regardless of species, will be a talker, however.) Despite being talkative (and “squawkative,” for lack of a better term), however, they are not usually overly loud compared to other parrot species.
Quakers build nests in the wild that are akin to apartment blocks, with multi-room “apartments” built adjacent to those of other surrounding “tenants.” For this reason, they are naturally adept borrowers (or thieves, depending on your perspective).
Quakers will take anything from eyeglasses to pens to paper scraps and stash them away in their cages, as part of their instinct to collect materials for their elaborate nests.

, Quakers often cost between $50 and $200 to purchase, making them manageable for most interested buyers. Not only the price but the personality of the bird you’re getting may be determined by where you acquire it. Common places include:


A responsible breeder. This will cost more than alternatives, but is your best bet for getting a loving, hand-fed baby.
A parrot rescue. Quakers may not be commonly available here, but if you are lucky, you might be able to find one. You will not get a baby, but the cost will be less, and the parrot will be in a needful and loving home.
A shelter. It is unlikely that you will find your quaker here, but check nonetheless. You probably will not have any idea of your Quaker's history if you adopt from here, and the shelter route is only recommended to experienced bird owners.
A pet store. Do your homework before considering whether to buy from here. The prices might be cheaper, but you may be getting an unhealthy bird that is less than your money's worth. Not to mention that many pet stores buy their parrots from disreputable sources that use inhumane methods for acquiring and breeding their birds.
From the newspaper, online, etc. Some people may be re-homing their quakers, and this is a fine place to get one, but remember to check that they are not rehoming their parrot because of medical or behavioral issues.

, It may be tempting to think that an adult bird that has already been trained and socialized would be easier to care for, especially for a novice, but that may not be the case. The best chance of training the bird, establishing good habits and handling the bird is with a youngster.


Quakers can develop a strong attachment to a particular individual, so an adult quaker may have trouble adjusting to a new home and ""parent.""
Also, unless you are sure of the bird's history, you may be acquiring one with a history of behavioral issues, perhaps even because of neglect or abuse. It is a noble gesture to take in a rescue quaker, but it may present too great a challenge if you do not have previous experience.
As indicated in the previous step, acquiring a baby quaker that has been hand-fed is probably the safest route (if likely most expensive), especially if you don't have much experience caring for birds. There are no guarantees, of course, but a quaker that has been cared for responsibly since birth is most likely to become a well-adjusted, loving adult.
If you do choose a baby quaker, set up your home with its cage, toys, etc. prior to its arrival, like you would with a baby's crib and such. Be ready to welcome it to its new home., Quakers are a smaller breed of parrot, but because of their active nature, they do best with a roomy cage. An 18” x 18” x 18” cage should probably be the minimum size for your bird, but also consider safety and security features.Quaker parrots are known for being escape artists, so make sure the bars on the cage are not too far apart, nor at the same time narrow enough that a curious quaker can get its head stuck between them. ⅝-inch spacing between bars is a good reference point.
Likewise, to counteract their curiosity and escapability, choose a gate that swings open (not a guillotine-style gate that a quaker may be able to lift up only to have it become a trap). Quakers have been known to figure out how to unlatch a gate, so consider a lock as well.

, A repetitive daily diet of bird food pellets not only lacks the diversity to provide proper nutrition, it may also cause boredom (and thus a lack of eating) in birds like quakers.


Make the pellets part of the diet, but also mix in a variety of fruits and vegetables, and occasional seeds and nuts.Avoid feeding birds avocados, however, as this can be toxic to them; also skip chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol., Birds are messy — there is no way around it. In addition to droppings, quakers will strew food scraps, destroyed toys, and bits of anything else they can get their beaks on throughout the cage and on your floor.


Give the cage a quick cleanup daily, removing large bits of junk and replacing the newspaper liner (you may want to subscribe to a daily paper if you’re going to be a bird owner).
Each week, give the cage a more thorough cleaning, scrubbing down the bars and such.You may want to place the cage over an easier-to-clean floor surface, such as tile or hardwood rather than carpet.

, Take your quaker for annual checks (and more as warranted) by a veterinarian, preferably one with a bird specialization.


Beak, claw, and feather health should be areas of particular focus for you and your vet, as problems in these areas are often indicators of larger issues.Quakers may be more susceptible to fatty liver disease, so don't let your bird become overweight. Limiting seeds and other high-fat foods may be necessary. Talk to your vet if you are concerned.
Feather plucking is another disorder that can be common among quakers, and can have physical or behavioral causes. A good avian vet can help you with this issue as well., Because of their mischievous and sometimes reckless nature, you need to take steps to protect your quaker from itself, not just people and other pets.


The practice of wing-clipping is controversial. Clipping makes escape less likely and reduces the risk of injury by flying into objects. See How to Clip a Parrot’s Wings or visit your vet for more information. However, the bird's ability to fly is curtailed. This means he gets less exercise and is more likely to feel frustrated. In addition, many birds try to fly but crash land and damage their brisket. These injuries can be quite severe and the thinking is now that wing-clipping is outdated. Instead, adequate training (such as clicker training) is preferred, to control the bird during out of cage time.
Some quakers are fearless (or perhaps foolish) enough to go after cats or dogs, which can result in severe injuries or worse, so take care if you have other pets in the house. The only way to know how they will interact is to let it happen, but be prepared to keep quakers separated from other pets if necessary.The same goes for other birds as well. Some quakers thrive with an additional “partner in crime,” others not so much. Exposure at a young age is probably the best bet for success.
Exposing you quaker to other people early on is also the best way to keep it from becoming a “one-person bird” who only interacts well with you. It is a two-way street, though, and you may have to instruct people (especially children) how to act around your parrot., Quakers need attention and generally love to play, so find time each day to spend engaging your bird’s mind and body.


Teach your parrot to “step up” (hop up on your finger when you tap it on the bird’s breast) early on — this is a gateway to other commands, tricks, and games.Provide your quaker with toys, and mix them up frequently to keep your parrot engaged. Quakers regularly destroy toys, so you may want to mix in homemade toys, games, and challenges. For instance, something as simple as balling up a treat in a wad of paper can provide your bird with some mental stimulation (at least the first time).
Talking is no guarantee with any parrot, but quakers usually like to talk and take to it easily. Repeating phrases during playtime is an easy way to teach new words, or move up to focused lessons of 10-15 minutes apiece.Keep mind of what quakers hear from you (or the TV, etc.), however, as they are usually skilled and eager mimics.See also How to Care for a Parrot and How to Play with a Large Parrot for more play ideas.

, Quakers want to be “a part of the action,” so don’t isolate them in a cage tucked away in a low-traffic spot. Like a small child, regular, active attention will make your quaker happier and healthier.


Locate your birdcage in a main living space, such as a living room. Place it in a (non-remote) corner of the room, however, so that your quaker can feel actively involved yet have a piece of territory to call its own.Give the bird plenty of daily time out of the cage as well. Do this not just for playtime but during daily activities when possible as well. Make your quaker a true part of the family.

, If you prefer your home and life to be neat and tidy, quiet, regimented, and predictable, a quaker (or any parrot, for that matter) is probably not for you. If you can accept an occasional giant mess, a missing watch, and regular squawking as a fair trade for a good bit of fun and constant companionship, a quaker parrot may be just the thing for you.

Associate your hands with positive behaviors.,
Teach your bird to step up.,
Implement safe zones.,
Always use positive reinforcement.",How to Stop a Greenwing Macaw from Biting2," Some people make the initial mistake of using their hands to shoo away or throw objects at their bird as a way to punish bad behavior. This makes it hard for your bird to know whether your hands are going to be used for a positive activity, such as petting or holding, or a negative one. *For the first few days, use a wooden stick or a perch to pick up your bird instead of your hands. When your bird starts to feel more comfortable around you, switch to picking it up with your hand and placing it on your finger.

, Getting your bird to step up onto your hand is essential for any further training. Go slow, and be sure to smile and make eye contact while teaching your bird to step up. Macaws can read your body language, and will know if you are stressed out or frustrated.


Start by putting a treat in one hand and put the other close to the bird. The bird will likely go for the treat. Give the treat and offer praise. Then, try again, this time asking your bird to step up. Repeat this process until your bird is comfortable enough to step up. Once the bird steps up with one foot, continue until it begins to use both feet.

, Once you’ve started picking up your bird with your hands, it’s important to teach it some boundaries. Otherwise, you run the risk of letting your bird fly recklessly around the house, which can result in injury or escape.


Start by taking your bird out of its cage. Whenever the bird attempts to fly away, pick it up gently and place it on either your shoulder, hand, or the outside of the cage. This lets the bird know that these are acceptable landing zones.
Once your bird becomes familiar with its safe landing zones, let it fly a bit more freely around the house. Be sure to monitor where your bird lands. If it does not land in a prescribed safe zone, continue to replace it on your hand, shoulder, or the cage until it no longer lands on unwanted places., Never hit your bird or use any kind of physical punishment, as this will immediately break the trust. Instead, offer treats and praise for positive behavior. If your bird misbehaves, simply say nothing and do not give a treat. "
"
Listen for beak clicking.,
Look for eye pinning.,
Don’t handle a growling bird.,
See if your macaw is hanging on the cage bars or raising his foot.",How to Stop a Greenwing Macaw from Biting3," If your bird clicks its beak several times in a row, you should take this as a sign that your bird is either feeling defensive, aggressive, or does not want to be handled. Often beak clicking is accompanied by raising of a foot or neck stretching. Be mindful of your bird’s behavior. Attempting to play with your bird at this time might result in a bite.


Tongue clicking, on the other hand, is a sign that your bird wants to play. Learn the difference between beak and tongue clicking and respond appropriately. , Flashing eyes are a potential signal that something is wrong. Eye pinning could mean that your bird is excited, but it often forewarns anger or aggression. When you notice your birds’ eyes flashing, look for sources of distress in the immediate environment, and do not attempt to handle your bird to avoid biting., Growling is a bird’s vocal way of telling you that they do not want to be touched. If a bird is feeling aggressive, growling is often coupled with dilated pupils and raised feathers. Retreat and give your bird some time to calm down.

, This is a sign that he wants to come out, so take advantage of it! Open the cage door, and offer your arm to him, and say ""step up"" or ""up"". Make sure you yourself aren't nervous, because your macaw can tell. Make eye contact and he'll be less likely to bite. If he lunges at your arm, tell him firmly ""no"" and close the door. This will teach him that he can't come out of the cage unless he steps up onto your arm.

Look into getting a larger-sized parrot.,
Feed your parrot a healthy diet.,
Place your bird cage in an ideal spot.,
Give your parrot plenty of toys.,
Let your bird out of its cage every day.",How to Select a Pet Parrot," The first consideration you should keep in mind when selecting a parrot is that particular bird's health. The last thing you want is to take home a bird and find out it has extensive (and costly) health problems or a short life ahead. Check out how the bird behaves at the pet store and pay close attention to whether the bird looks healthy overall.Tight feathers close to the body are a sign of good health. Avoid birds with ruffled, unkempt, or missing feathers.
Look for bright eyes and a lively appearance. Birds that sleep a lot and/or never leave their perch are usually in poor health.
Avoid any birds that have no appetite or exhibit any discharge from the nose or mouth, as these are signs of illness in birds.;
, Remember that the size of your bird will dictate the cage and environment it will need at home.A larger parrot will need a bigger cage, more room to move around, and more food than a smaller bird. Larger parrots may also be more vocal than some of their smaller counterparts, which may be a factor worth considering.


Think about whether you have shared walls and noise-intolerant neighbors. A very vocal parrot could potentially cause problems in such a housing situation.
Assess whether you have room for a bigger cage in your home. If not, a smaller bird in a smaller cage might be better suited to your house or apartment.

, Parrots are generally very long-lived birds. Some parrots can live up to 80 years.Even shorter-lived parrot species tend to live for up to 20 years.Owning a parrot can be a life-long commitment, and you may even have to consider whether any friends or relatives would be able to care for your bird if it outlives you.

, Smaller parrots may still be vocal, but they tend to be less noisy than larger parrots.If you want a very vocal bird, you may want to consider a medium- or large-sized parrot. However, if you have concerns about noise, or if you live in a smaller home and can't house a large bird, a small parrot might be a better fit.


Meyers' parrots are affectionate, quiet, and generally easy-going. They're very social birds and they generally form bonds with all members of the family.Poicephalus parrots are small but stocky. They're known for being quiet birds, but they can still be somewhat playful and affectionate.Senegal parrots are very calm, good-natured, and very affectionate towards people. They can be somewhat active and will need a lot of toys and play time., Medium-sized parrots tend to be smart and very affectionate towards people. They may be slightly vocal, though they will not have the vocal capabilities of a larger parrot. However, medium-sized parrots can generally learn to mimic a few words if you spend enough time teaching them.African grey parrots tend to be very sensitive, intelligent, and destructive. Many bird experts agree that experienced parrot caretakers make the best owners for African greys.Amazon parrots are very playful and entertaining. They will try to sing along to music, though they can be very noisy at times.Double yellow-headed Amazon parrots are very popular birds known for their big personalities and long lives, with some parrots living up to 80 years. They can learn to talk (and tend to be very vocal) and have a lot of energy.Orange-winged Amazon parrots are very colorful and tend to be tamer than other Amazon parrots. These parrots tend to be energetic and full of personality.Yellow-naped Amazon parrots are rare and very expensive, with some birds selling for up to $30,000. They're very playful as young birds but often get aggressive as they age.Pionus parrots are generally quiet, affectionate, and easy-going. Some owners report that Pionus parrots occasionally have a musky, somewhat sweet smell to them.Vasa parrots are very active, and as a result they tend to have large appetites. Adequate cage space and plenty of toys are necessary for these playful parrots., Larger parrots will need a larger cage to live in. Large parrots also tend to be very vocal. This may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your living situation. Remember, though, that large parrots also have larger beaks, and if a large parrot bites you it could be very painful.Cape parrots are extremely vocal and very long-lived, with many pet Cape parrots living up to 30 years.Large macaws like the Scarlet macaw are very good pets at a young age, but may be prone to more aggressive behavior as they age.

, Parrots need to be fed at least one meal each day. They should also be given treats periodically throughout the day. You can buy parrot food at a pet store, but the best diet for birds includes fresh vegetables, fruits, and peanuts. Some parrot owners even give their birds small bits of cooked fish and beef, cheese, and other human foods.Two foods that should never be given to parrots are chocolate and avocado. Both foods are poisonous to birds and will result in illness or even death.

, In addition to having the right sized cage for your bird, you should also be aware of where you place your parrot's cage. Exposure to windy drafts or direct sunlight could negatively affect your bird's quality of life, resulting in discomfort or even death.Never place a parrot's cage near windows or door ways.
Keep your parrot's cage out of direct sunlight, as birds can easily overheat.

, Some parrot species are known for being more playful than others, but in general, all parrots love to play. Make sure your bird has plenty of things to chew up, shred, and destroy.Toys made of natural materials, such as wood and rope, are the best options for birds.
Some household items like cardboard can be given to parrots. The cardboard tube inside of toilet paper and paper towels make excellent toys that can be easily torn and shredded.

, Parrots are naturally suited to flying long distances. While you'll need to keep your parrot in its cage for much of the day to prevent the bird from injuring itself or destroying your home, you should still give your bird plenty of free-flying time outside the cage.Try to let your bird out of its cage at least once every day.
Always supervise your bird when it's out of the cage. Birds love to chew on things around the house, including wall paper and furniture.
If you have other pets in the house, consider isolating either the parrot or the other pets in a separate room to avoid conflict.

Look for feather plucking.,
Examine your parrot's energy levels.,
Check out your parrot's body language.,
Watch how much your parrot eats.,
Take note of any aggression in your parrot.",How to Recognize Stress in Your Pet Parrot1," When parrots become extremely stressed out, they will break or pull out their feathers. This stress coping method can leave your parrot open to infection and can cause dangerous amounts of blood loss. If you notice any feather plucking, visit your veterinarian to learn the causes and to discover how you can put an end to it.


Some cases of feather plucking can turn into self mutilation if left unchecked.
Causes for feather plucking can vary greatly from case to case. You'll need to work with your veterinarian to learn more about your bird's unique situation.;

Senegal parrots tend to eat all kinds of seeds, fruits, and vegetables, and even human food if offered.,
Movements and what do they mean: if the black part of their eye becomes small, it mean he/she is enjoying something.,
Start from little to potty train it.,
Spend at least 1 hour everyday giving complete attention of him/her.,
If possible, try to have an extra open or closed cage that you will keep outside, and everyday, leave him/her outside to breathe fresh air, unless there is a possible danger of him/her flying away.

,
Once it starts getting used to you, start teaching it little tunes whistling.",How to Raise a Senegal Parrot," But there are several things that should be never introduced to it: chocolate, onion, and avocado are some. It's a myth that parsley will kill your bird, in fact parsley is chock full of health promoting vitamins and minerals, and in moderation will in fact boost your parrot's health.;
, If they become larger it means they are scared, angry of just in a normal mood. When it is scared, its feathers will lie flat down. If angry, they will fluff up. Screaming is normal for parrots, and they always scream, it's a way of talking.

, Make it learn a special word that will eventually tell it that it means that it must poop. Try this method: if he/she wants to come unto you, don't allow he/she to come until he/she poops. Keep repeating that same word, and if it doesn't understand, walk away. If it does, give it a treat and let him/her come unto you. In a matter of time, they will understand that they must poop before coming on.

, This will create a bond between you two, especially if you cuddle him/her, give treats, and talk to him/her.

,, Remember that Senegal parrots can't speak, but they can very easily learn to imitate whistles, and even alarms, phones, and other things.

Consider the region where the bird was spotted.,
Know the parrots of South America.,
Study the birds of Africa.,
Understand that Asia is populated by parrots south of the Himalayas.,
Learn about the parrots of Australia.",How to Identify Parrots1," This can assist greatly in its identification. Each continent has its own array of species of parrots, and of course each type of bird lives within certain regions on a continent. Take note of where the bird was spotted, being as specific as possible, and compare that region to what you know about where different kinds of parrots live.


Some species are found in places where they are not native, having been imported or otherwise introduced to these areas. Consider this possibility before you rely on location as a means of identifying a parrot, and ask a local expert if you think this might be the case.;
, This continent is home to the majority of macaws, conures, Pionus parrots, 'typical' parrots, some hanging parrots, parrotlets, amazon parrots, and the atypical hawk headed and Quaker parrots.

, Africa is inhabited fairly sparsely with the well known African Grey parrot, along with all of the lovebirds, all of the Poicephalus parrots, and the black or Vasa parrots (from Madagascar). There is also the African ringneck, Africa's only member of the psittacula genus.

, The resident species include the Psittacula parakeets and hanging parrots. The tropical regions of Indonesia and surrounding islands is home to parrots similar to those in Australia. These include lorikeets and lories, fig parrots, tiger parrots, Eclectus parrots, pygmy parrots, the Geoffroyus genus, small Corellas, palm cockatoos, some white cockatoo species, and some true parakeets.

, This crazy region is home to all of the black cockatoos, a subspecies of the both the palm cockatoo and eclectus parrot, the majority of larger corellas, the grey cockatoos (Galah, cockatiel and gang gang cockatoo), the greater sulphur crested cockatoo, two rainbow lorikeet subspecies, the endemic 'southern lorikeets', Rosellas (platycercus), Polytelis parrots, grass parrots(neophema and neopsephotus), one fig parrot, a geoffroyus parrot, the rare swift and ground parrots, and the mysterious and elusive night parrot. Nearby New Zealand is home to the enigmatic Kakas, the Kea, the world's only Alpine Parrot, the heaviest (and technically largest) parrot, the flightless Kakapo, the cyanoramphas genus (the kakarikis). New Zealand is also home to some of Australia's native species, but these are all introduced and will not be discussed further.

Note the color of the parrot.,
Use erectile crests and colour scheme to identify cockatoos.,
Take note of the parrot's tail and other features.,
Consider the parrot's diet.,
Notice the size of the parrot.,
Understand that many different parrots look alike.,
Understand what lovebirds are like.",How to Identify Parrots2," If the parrot is mainly blue, it can only belong to the macaw or lorikeet families. This excludes colour mutations. Other colors may help you to identify other species or types of parrots.

, Due to the structure of these birds' feathers, they can only produce white, yellow, pink, red, or black colours. They also have specialised beaks, but this is not easily observed. Most have a short tail, but the cockatiel almost resembles a parakeet.

, Conures all have long, tapered tails, they fall under the classification of aratinga, pyrhurra, or miscellaneous. The Pyrhurra conures all have scalloping under the breast along with a red belly patch. The Aratingas are brightly coloured (some bright orange yellow), and may have a horn coloured beak. They also have prominent eye rings.


If the parrot has an unusually long tail, it may be part of the psittacula genus. This can be confirmed by a different head colour, a shoulder patch, or a ring encircling the neck (this only appears on males in most species).
Australian parakeets have thin, long tails, small beaks, thin toes and legs, and are most likely to exhibit sexual dimorphism. They usually prefer not to hang upside down.

, Lorikeets look similar to parakeets, but their diet consists almost entirely of nectar. They are perfectly at home hanging upside down to reach suitable flowers. Lories are genetically similar to lorikeets, but usually have short tails.

, Macaws range from 30 centimeter (11.8 in) to over 100 centimeter (39.4 in). They all have bare facial skin and most have individual feather tracts over this skin.

, Kakarikis are genetically similar to Australian parakeets, but appear almost like conures. They all have a two tone beak, and are mainly green. The Kaka, Kea, and Kakapo are all large, short tailed parrots with very large beaks, and largely drab plumage. Notably, the Kakapo is flightless.


Amazons often have a scalloped appearance. Most are mainly green, but have contrasting patches of blue, yellow, orange, lilac, or red. These are used in visual displays. They also all have red undertail coverts. Pionus parrots are similar to Amazons but are usually smaller and lack the red tail patch.

, These are small, heavily built parrots, mainly green but usually with a different coloured head. In captivity these are rarely purebred, as interbreeding was once extremely common.

Look for pellet food made for lovebirds.,
Pick a high quality seed mix.,
Give the lovebirds fresh vegetables.,
Feed the lovebirds fresh fruit.,
Offer the lovebirds small nuts.,
Do not give the lovebirds food high in fat, sugar, or preservatives.",How to Feed Lovebirds1," Pellet food is the ideal food for lovebirds, as it is formulated to give your birds the nutrients they need. Pick pellet food based on the age of your lovebirds. Make sure the pellet food contains natural ingredients and no additives or preservatives.Baby lovebirds will have different pellet food than mature lovebirds. Mature lovebirds are 10 months or older.
Look for pellet food made for lovebirds at your local pet store or online.;
, Look for a seed mix that has a wide variety of seeds like millet, canary grass seed, hulled oats, niger seed, flax seed, sunflower seeds, safflower, and rape seeds. The seed mix may also contain soybeans, rye, canary seed, whole brown rice, fennel seed, poppy seed, and sesame seed.Make sure the seed mix contains a small amount of milo, as this ingredient is often used as a filler.
Only use fresh seed mix. If the seed mix smells dusty or old, do not give it to your lovebirds.

, Lovebirds also do well with supplemental foods in their diet like green lettuce (not iceberg lettuce), spinach, carrots, green peas, endive, tomatoes, parsley, dandelion, radish, cucumber, watercress, broccoli, sprouts, and kale.They also do well with wheatgrass, as it is high in chlorophyll.
Do not give lovebirds avocados, as they are considered toxic to birds.

, Lovebirds do well with fresh fruits like pears, bananas, grapes, strawberries, raspberries, apples, oranges, tangerines, kiwi, figs, melon, pitted cherries, and rose hips.You can give the lovebirds dried fruits as long as they do not contain sulfites.

, Lovebirds also enjoy shelled and unshelled peanuts, Brazil nuts, acorns, horse chestnuts, and hazelnuts. You can give the lovebirds nuts as a small treat or as a supplement to their regular diet., Lovebirds should not be given fast food or foods high in artificial sugar like candy, ice cream, or sweets. Do not give lovebirds french fries, chips, or deep fried foods.You should also avoid giving lovebirds any foods that contain preservatives or additives.
Do not give lovebirds alcohol or coffee.

Encourage your parrot to forage.,
Monitor your parrot for obesity.,
Monitor your parrot for vitamin A deficiency.",How to Feed Parrots," Pellets are an important component of your parrot’s diet. They come in a variety of colors, sizes, and even flavors.Because pellets are made up of a combination of fruits, vegetables, grains, and seeds, they have a very high nutritional value.


When selecting pellets at your local pet store, be sure to read the ingredients label. Do not select pellets that have a lot of preservatives.Since there are so many varieties of pellets, consider talking to your veterinarian to determine which pellet formulation would work best for your parrot.;
, Even though birdseed should not be a mainstay of your parrot’s diet, it still provides some nutritional value that is good for your parrot. Just like with pellets, there are many seed formulations to choose from at the pet store. It is ideal to purchase a package of seed mixture, but you could also purchase individual seed types and mix them on your own.Sunflower seeds were once thought to be addictive to parrots, but this is actually not true.Before purchasing the birdseed, make sure that it is fresh. It should not smell moldy or rancid, and should be free of insects and fungus. Good birdseed should also be shiny.Your parrot may prefer seeds that are sprouted or germinated.To germinate seeds, soak a daily a portion of the seeds in clean, fresh water overnight, either at room temperature or in the refrigerator. After 12 to 24 hours, you will start to see the root tips of the seeds, which means that the seeds have germinated. At this stage, you can feed them to your parrot.Seeds for parrots are like candy for people–they are tasty treats, but should only be eaten on occasion. You can use seeds as rewards if you are training your parrot., There are many types of fruits and vegetables that you can feed your parrot, including apples, broccoli, collard greens, and peaches. Whichever type of fruit or vegetable you choose to feed your parrot, make sure that you wash it thoroughly with fresh water before feeding it to him.Keep in mind that fruits have a relatively high sugar content, so they should not be a large part of your parrot’s diet.Remember that pellets are partially made up of fruit, so your parrot will likely get the same types of nutrients from the pellet mixture as he would from the fresh fruit.Chop the fruit and vegetables into smaller portions to make it easier for your parrot to eat.
Some fruits may stain your bird’s droppings,but this is not a cause for concern.

, Nuts are another component of your parrot’s healthy diet. They are high in protein and other vitamins and minerals, but are also high in fat. Because of the high fat content, you should feed them to your parrot in moderation. For example, you could feed your parrot nuts as a training reward or occasional treat.Examples of nuts that you can feed your parrot include macadamia nuts, walnuts, pistachios, and cashews.The nuts that you feed your parrot should be unsalted.If possible, leave the shell on the nuts. Wild parrots often use their beak to break open the nutshell. Leaving the shell on will make your parrot put a little extra effort into eating his food, which is good physical and mental stimulation for him. Keep in mind that breaking the shell is a learned behavior.Macaws tend to need more nuts and fat in their diet than other parrot species., Legumes include beans, peas, and lentils, and have a high nutritional value. Examples of legumes that you can feed your parrot include black beans, greens beans, and chickpeas. Tofu is another type of legume that you can feed your parrot if he likes it. Legumes can be fed raw or cooked.The grains that you feed your parrot should be whole grains, such as cooked brown rice, whole grain pasta, and barley.The grains should also be low in salt., Parrots are omnivores,so they can have meat in their diet as well. Chicken is a healthy meat source for your parrot. Make sure to cook the chicken fully before feeding it to him.Too much meat in your parrot's diet could damage his kidneys, so meats should be fed only in small portions., Although your parrot can eat wide a variety of human foods, there are certain human foods that you should not feed him. For example, avocados and chocolate can be toxic to your parrot and should be avoided. Alcohol can also be toxic to him.Caffeine should be avoided as well.Peanuts that are improperly stored (warm, dark, damp conditions) can release aflatoxin, a toxin produced by a type of fungus. Aflatoxin can be deadly to parrots, so it would be best to avoid feeding peanuts to your parrot. , Your parrot should have a fresh supply of water at all times. Keep in mind that parrots can be very messy eaters, which means that bits of food may land in his water bowl. Change out his water bowl twice a day, or whenever you see that it has a lot of food particles in it., The exact amount of food that your parrot should eat depends on such factors as his age, species, and overall health status. Your veterinarian can provide you with additional guidance on what how much of each dietary component he should eat. In the mornings and evenings, feed him small amounts of birdseed and fresh food (fruits, vegetables, etc). Wait about an hour and remove any food that is leftover so that it does not spoil.Consider feeding no more than 1 to 2 teaspoons of birdseed to your parrot.
After he has eaten his birdseed and fresh food, feed him pellets (morning only). He will likely snack on these throughout the day rather than finishing them in one sitting, so you do not have to remove the pellets that he does not finish in the morning.Small parrots can be served about 1/4 cup of pellets per day. Large parrots can probably handle about 1/2 cup of pellets per day.Rather than putting the entire amount in his cage at one time, you can add pellets in small portions at a time if you able to do so.
The other dietary components can be fed in very small amounts. For example, if your parrot is small, he will need about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of fruit, 1/2 spoonful of vegetables, and 1/2 tablespoon of a protein source (nuts, cooked meat) per day. If he is large, he will need 1 tablespoon of fruit, 1 spoonful of vegetables, and 1.5 tablespoons of a protein source., Wild parrots spend a large amount of their time foraging for food.You don’t want your parrot to become complacent or lazy when it comes to eating his food, so encourage him to put a little extra effort into eating. For example, sprinkle some pellets and gravel in his food tray. This will make your parrot sift through the gravel before he gets to the pellets.You can also put his food in foraging toys, which are available at your local pet store.Working to eat his food will keep your parrot busy and mentally stimulated, which can help reduce the likelihood of behavioral problems., Obesity can be a major problem in parrots, especially if they eat too many high-fat foods. Obese parrots can also develop fatty liver disease, which is a serious medical condition. If you notice that your parrot is starting to look a little pudgy, take him to your veterinarian. Reducing his food intake will help him lose weight, but you want to make sure that you keep his diet healthy and balanced.


Certain species of parrots, including budgies, cockatiels, and Amazon parrots, are especially prone to obesity and fatty liver disease., Vitamin A helps your parrot fight off infection. Deficiency in this nutrient is common in birds and can make them very sick. Their respiratory system is often affected by vitamin A deficiency, so your parrot may develop respiratory problems (nasal discharge, difficulty breathing, sneezing) if he is not receiving enough vitamin A.If you notice any of these signs, take him to your veterinarian for treatment.


Vitamin A deficiency can also affect your parrot’s kidneys and digestive organs.Provided that you are feeding your parrot a healthy and balanced diet, he will receive enough vitamin A to keep him healthy."

Consider the body.,
Examine coloration.,
Examine tail feathers.,
Check the wings.",How to Determine the Sex of African Grey Parrots1," There are slight differences in body type and size between males and females. First consider your bird's general body type to get a gauge of whether your bird is more likely male or female. From there, you can look at more subtle physical characteristics.Males are usually 12-14 inches (30-35.5 cm) in height. Hens are generally somewhat shorter than this.The body of a male African Grey is somewhat round, while females tend to be more slender.
Males heads tend to be small and flat, and their necks are shorter. Females tend to have longer necks, with larger, rounder heads.;
, Males typically have a darker and more uniform color than hens. Females, on the other hand, have a gradual light-to-dark coloration from their neck to their belly.This technique should only be considered in birds older than 18 months. A chick's feathers are still growing, so the color will change with age.

, Traditionally, male Greys have darker tail feather colors than hens. You need to check what are called the ""ventral feathers."" These are a set of about 10 feathers found directly under the bird's tail. You can pick up your African Grey and gently flip him or her over to examine the feathers.Females will have ventral feathers that are edged in a shade of gray. Males will have ventral feathers that are solid red. There may be a small white hairline on male feathers.
Keep in mind, this test is not accurate for young parrots. You cannot rely on tail feathers to determine gender unless your grey is 18 months of age or older.

, Observe your parrot when it is flapping its wings. You should be able to see three bands of gray on the underside of the wings. The colors of these bands are slightly different in males and females.In females, the bands are usually gray, white, and dark gray. In males, the bands are usually gray, gray, and dark gray.
As this difference is very slight, it can be hard to spot. You should look into other physical characteristics of an African Grey, in addition to wing color, in order to determine gender.

Give the lovebirds 1 tablespoon (14 ml) of food a day.,
Have separate food bowls for each bird.,
Wash fruits and vegetables before giving them to the lovebirds.,
Provide clean water for the lovebirds.",How to Feed Lovebirds2," Measure out 1 tablespoon of pellet food per bird. You can also try giving the bird ½ tablespoon (7.3 ml) pellet food and ½ tablespoon (7.3 ml) seed mix. The majority of their diet should come from pellet food and/or seed mix.Try to feed the lovebirds at the same time each day. This will ensure they know when they are going to be fed.

, If you have more than one lovebird in a cage, provide one food bowl per bird. This will ensure there is no pecking or fighting over food at mealtime. It will also help you monitor the eating habits of each bird by checking their individual food bowls., Use clean running water to wash all fruits and vegetables. Then, cut them into small pieces and put them in a bowl that is separate from their food bowl. You do not need to peel the fruits or vegetables, as most lovebirds can digest the skin.Try to give the lovebirds a variety of different fruits and vegetables. Switch up the types of fruits and vegetables you give to the lovebirds.
Fruits and vegetables should make up 20-25% of the bird’s diet. Give them to the lovebirds as small snacks once or twice a day.

, Lovebirds need lots of fresh water. Put fresh water in their water bowls and refill it as needed. Make sure their water bowl is full before bed so they have access to fresh water at night.Always use water bowls that are shallow so your birds are not at risk of drowning.

Hand-fed baby lovebirds until they are 10 months old.,
Get a syringe and baby bird food.,
Feed the lovebirds slowly.,
Check the baby’s crop for a bulge.,
Clean the lovebird’s beak after feeding.",How to Feed Lovebirds3," Newborn or baby lovebirds do well with being hand-fed, where you feed them by hand. This can be a time consuming process but it is ideal if you are raising a baby bird from infancy and want it to do well.Often, hand-fed lovebirds grow much stronger and happier than baby lovebirds that are fed from a bowl.

, Look for a small syringe with a small opening. You can find them at local pet stores or online. You will also need baby bird food, which often comes in a powder. You will need to mix the powder into boiling water to make the formula for feeding. Follow the instructions on the package for the ratio of water to powder.

, Hold the baby lovebird in one hand with your fingers wrapped lightly around its chest. Fill the syringe with the formula to 6-8ml. Put a small amount on your palm to make sure the formula is not too hot, just warm to the touch. Gently tilt the baby’s head upwards. Place the syringe into the baby’s beak and start feeding it.Let the baby bird consume the formula slowly and at its own speed. Do not try to force the baby to eat from the syringe.

, The crop is a upper section of the baby bird’s stomach that inflates as it eats. Once it is bulging, you can stop feeding the bird.

Feed the bird the formula every three to four hours. Always feed it until its crop is bulging, never any more than that.

, Use a clean towel to gently wipe off the lovebird’s beak once it is done eating. Most lovebirds will go to sleep after eating."

Have your avian veterinarian determine gender.,
Conduct a DNA test at home.",How to Determine the Sex of African Grey Parrots2," Avian specialists are trained vets whose primary focus is birds. The Association of Avian Veterinarians (AAV), and their website, provides information about finding a certified vet in your area.You can also do a basic internet search for “avian vet in my area.”
If you have other pets, talk to their vet. He or she might be able to refer you to a specialist or be able to conduct blood or DNA tests in house.
Make sure your vet is certified with the AAV or American Board of Veterinary Practitioners (ABVP). They should be able to provide documentation to prove this., Vets can usually determine gender for you. A vet can use laboratory testing to determine the gender of your bird. It can be costly to take a bird in just for gender identification. However, you may need to know your bird's gender. If you're trying to breed, you will need a male and a female. If you're introducing a new Grey to your home and want to prevent breeding, you need to make sure the birds are of the same sex or look into neutering your grey.Vets often use endoscopies to determine gender.This is involves using a telescope to examine a bird's internal organs.Your vet may have other laboratory means to test the gender of your bird. Gender testing methods depend on your bird's overall health and medical history, so talk over options with your vet.

, You may want a less invasive procedure to determine gender. With surgical and laboratory tests, there is always some risk of harm to your bird. You can acquire do-it-yourself DNA kit or blood card that you can mail in to get a DNA test for your parrot. These kits are easily assembled and easy to use.


You can gather DNA from plucked feathers, eggshells, or toenail clippings. DNA collections from these samples are equally accurate as a DNA test from a blood sample.You can talk to your vet to see if they can offer you this kit. However, be sure to get a certified DNA document from this testing.
It is important to note that blood feathers nor molted feathers contain enough DNA data for accurate testing. You'll have to pluck feathers directly from your bird.
You should get your test results pretty quickly. It takes about 2-3 business days. A testing kit will cost you around $15.00."

Consider the various types of parrots.,
Locate local parrot owners through groups onlineand visit with their adult birds.,
Find a good breeder or pet store that specializes in birds.,
Think about why you want to adopt a parrot.,
Be prepared for a social and playful animal.,
Expect to clean a lot.,
Know what parrots eat.,
Create a budget.,
Calculate initial costs.,
Calculate recurring costs.",How to Decide if a Parrot Is Right for You," Parrots vary widely in size, color, lifespan, and habits.Understanding the differences between these birds, and knowing what to expect in terms of their cost, care, and habits is crucial to deciding which, if any, is the right one for you.Smaller varieties (Budgies and small Parakeets,Lovebirds,Cockatiels,and Parrotlets) are best for beginners. They are smaller, quieter, cheaper, and have relatively shorter lifespans (10-30 years).
Medium-sized parrots (Caiques,smaller Conures,Lories,and larger Parakeets) are a bit bigger, make a little more noise, cost a little more money, and live slightly longer (up to 40 years). These parrots require more space, more food, more interaction, and a longer commitment than smaller varieties.
Large parrots (African Greys,Amazons,Cockatoos,and Macaws) are loud, costly, and can live long lives (more than 50 years). They require a lot of attention and interaction, as well as a lot of space.;
, You should also look into parrot sanctuaries if you have any close to you. Many of these have classes on parrots that are a good resource to first time bird owners, or people looking into adopting an older bird. Remember, if you get a baby parrot, his or her personality is not guaranteed! Just like with a child you experience babyhood, puberty, young adult, and then adult stages of life.

, Spending time with parrots is a good way to see what it might be like to have one as a pet. And since each parrot has its own personality, this is an opportunity to get to know some parrots. The more parrots you can spend time with, and the more experienced parrot people you can talk to, the better equipped you’ll be to make a responsible decision about owning a parrot.


Breeders tend to have mostly babies, and baby parrots act very differently than adult parrots. They are often quieter, more friendly, more adaptive to change, and more interested in cuddling.

, Parrots are complex and misunderstood animals.While parrots are beautiful and some can learn tricks, if you are looking at a parrot because of its appearance, don't waste your money or time. Parrots are intelligent additions to your family and need the right kind of attention, varied activity, and a fresh diet.Caring for a parrot is a lifetime commitment of time and energy every day., Parrots are companions, not ornaments; they want significant daily interaction and stimulation, in addition to training. If a parrot would be left alone all day in your home, then it is probably not a good pet for you. Larger birds require more handling and training than smaller varieties. Improper care or handling of a parrot can lead to behavioral and even health problems.


While a cage is a practical necessity and a home for a parrot, this doesn’t mean that they’re happy while in them. All parrots need cages large enough for them to be active in as well as time outside their cage.They also like to be handled, and may learn to talk or mimic sounds. And they will definitely make a lot of noise; parrots are naturally noisy and will do flock calls several times throughout the day, though smaller parrots have a quieter call then others. Most parrots are not good for people living in apartments or who don’t like noise.
Parrots bite to communicate that they don’t like what is happening to them. If you don’t like being bitten or the idea of going to work with a bite on you face, a parrot may not be right for you.
Parrots are masters at hiding illness; as a defense mechanism that evolved in the wild, they do not show signs of illness unless they are extremely sick. It takes a caring and attentive bird owner to catch the early signs of illness.

, There is no such thing as a parrot who isn't messy. Parrots can, and will, fling food and they will poop almost everywhere. They'll make a big, big mess! It's really ideal to have the parrot cage on a hardwood or tile floor. Expect to vacuum or mop around the cage daily. You’ll also need to wash bowls and toys, and clean the bottom of the cage daily.

, Parrot diets vary greatly, though the core of their diets consist of pellets, fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains.Cooking for your parrots is a great way to display your love for them. Its also a great way to offer them more food and expand their eating options and habits.
Parrots can also eat in moderation almost anything that humans eat, including cooked meat and fish, and cheese.

, Visualizing startup and recurring costs will help you to decide if you're financially capable of providing the care and conditions that a parrot needs to thrive.For a small parrot, initial costs could be $110 to $150 with annual recurring costs of $300 to $500. Larger parrots could cost $1,500 to $11,000 initially and then $700 to $1,200 annually.

, At the outset you will need to consider the cost of:


the parrot. A parrot can cost anywhere from $20 for a Parakeet to $12,000 for a Macaw, though most people spend between $50-$2,500 for a hand-fed baby parrot.
a cage. Cages can cost between $35 and $1,000. This can be expensive, especially for larger birds, but think of it as an investment. The initial purchase of a cage and other essentials will last for years to come. If you can't afford the cage you want for the parrot you want, rethink the purchase.water and food bowls. You should have 3 bowls in the cage at all times: one for fresh water; one for the regular diet; and one for fresh daily food. You can add a fourth bowl for treats and toys if you like.

, In addition to costs at startup, you have to consider the cost of a parrot’s upkeep. Be prepared to spend regularly on:


food. Seeds and fresh food will cost between $10 and $60 a month, depending on the size of bird.
toys. Healthy and happy Parrots love to chew and destroy items. You should buy several toys of every type that are appropriate for your parrot, including acrylic, wood, and rope toys. Replacing toys will cost between $10 and $40 per month. Cardboard boxes and empty toilet rolls also work well.
cleaning supplies. A dustpan and brush, reusable rags, as well as carpet cleaner are musts.
trips to an avian certified veterinarian. A typical annual checkup will cost between $50 and $75, while a typical exam if the bird is sick or requires medication could cost between $200 and $500. Real emergencies could cost upwards of $1,000. You need to have the financial ability to pay high veterinary bills if the need arises. Avian medicine is more specialized and expensive than medicine for other common domestic pets.

Study the robin’s plumage.,
Discover which bird is building the nest.,
Observe nesting behavior.,
Pay attention to mating behavior.",How to Tell a Male Robin from a Female Robin1," The breast on male robins is a rusty red, deeper than that of their female counterparts. The female breast will be lighter in color, trending towards reddish-orange.Wing and tail feathers will also be different. Male robins tend to have darker black wings and tail feathers, while females typically have a charcoal tone to their plumage.
There is less contrast between the head and back feathers in females (where they are typically a blackish gray color) than among males.;
, Nests are built primarily by females. Male robins assist the building effort only occasionally.If you can catch a robin in the act of building its nest, chances are you've identified a female.

, Male robins will care for the young at night during their first year. Female robins use this time to incubate the second brood but return during the day to feed and care for the hatchlings., Males pursue females and may engage in fights with other males to ward them off their nesting grounds. Males often sing to attract females, though both males and females are capable of vocalizing.

"
"
Look for differences in color.Male and female scarlet robins differ in their plumage significantly more than their European or American counterparts.,
Pay attention to nest behavior.,
Observe how nesting grounds are established.",How to Tell a Male Robin from a Female Robin2," Males are black with prominent bright red breasts and a white patch above the bill (frontal patch). Females, on the other hand, are brown with a rusty reddish-orange breast and white underparts.

, Females sit on the eggs to incubate them. Males, on the other hand, provide their mates with food.This arrangement ensures the eggs stay warm and safe until they are ready to hatch.

, Female scarlet robins build the actual nests with moss, spider webbing, and animal fibers. Males declare a nesting ground off-limits to other birds by vocalizing from a nearby lookout branch. "
"
Follow migration patterns.,
Pay attention to mating behavior.,
Observe nesting behavior.,
Examine the robin's breast.",How to Tell a Male Robin from a Female Robin3," Female robins will move to an adjacent nesting territory during the summer. Male robins, by contrast, remain on the same territory year-round., Male robins bring females food -- seeds, worms, or berries -- in order to strengthen the mating bond. The female will warble noisily and flap her wings to communicate that she desires the male's gift.

, After the female has laid eggs, she will remain in the nest for up to two weeks. During this time, the male will bring food to her and her young.


If you see two robins in a nest with hatchlings and one flies away to obtain food, the one left in the nest is likely the female., It is very difficult to distinguish between male and female robins using plumage.However, there are some subtle differences in the breasts of older robins.


In male robins in their second year of life, the gray fringe around the red breast, continues to widen. The breast itself tends to be larger than that of females.While the fringe around the breast of the female robins does not widen significantly as they age, the female's red breast itself does continue to grow with age.
Knowing the robin's age is important when utilizing breast characteristics to determine the sex of European robins.

Look at your parrot's cage.,
Get the right amount of toys, depending on how big the cage is.,
Make sure that the toys you pick are safe parrot toys.",How to Choose Parrot Toys," Is it big, or is it small? Does it have enough room for enough toys for your parrot?


Make sure that the cage is big. Big cages should have enough room for toys.;
, A good way to find out how many toys would be perfect would be to use the following tips:


Get at least seven toys. Put them in the cage. Put the parrot in the cage. If you think the toys take up too much room, take away some of them.

Lots of toys that take up too much room is not good, but an inadequate number of toys isn't good either. Parrots are very smart, and need to keep themselves happy and playful. Thus, they need enough toys to play with, rather than few toys to play with. However, getting the parrot too many toys may not be a good idea.



, Unsafe toys are harmful for any kind of pet. Signs that they are not safe are:


Sharp pieces
Loose pieces
Pieces that are easy to swallow

Look for a key difference in bill size.,
Determine differences in overall size.,
Look for differences in color pattern.",How to Tell the Difference Between Downy and Hairy Woodpeckers1," This is the easiest way to tell the two species apart.


The Hairy Woodpecker's bill is long and chisel-like, and almost the same length as its head.
In contrast, the Downy's bill is short and dainty, roughly 1/3 the length of the bird's head.
If this is difficult to gauge, a good trick is to imagine turning each bird's bill around, so that it points toward the back of the bird's head. How far across the head does it appear to extend? If it is the length of the head, you are looking at a Hairy Woodpecker. ;
, The Downy Woodpecker is the smaller of the two, while the Hairy Woodpecker can be up to 50% larger. However, when viewing an individual bird, it can be difficult to judge this difference in size. Here are some ways to do this:


For comparison – the Downy is roughly the same size as a House Sparrow, while the Hairy is similar in size to a Robin. The male and female of each species are roughly the same size, so if you are looking at two woodpeckers of different sizes, the smaller is likely to be a Downy and the larger a Hairy. , Both birds are black and white but there are some key differences in the pattern of their feathers.



Tail feathers: Hairys typically have all-white outer tail feathers, especially in the Eastern US. Downys, however, have spotted black and white tail feathers. Shoulder fleck: The Downy has a barely-visible black fleck extending onto the white; the Hairy has a quite distinct ""comma-shaped"" black mark extending from the shoulder up to the breast. Red patch: In both species the males have a red patch on the head. On Hairy Woodpeckers this red patch is often split.White patch Downy Woodpeckers have a larger white patch on the sides of the neck. This is most obvious when viewing the back of the bird. "

Observe the tail feathers.,
Remember that ravens have shaggy looking feathers at their throats.,
Notice differences in the beaks.,
Listen to the vocalizations.,
Count how many of them there are together.",How to Tell the Difference Between Crows and Ravens,"


This is an American Crow
This is a Common Raven;
, The Common Raven is approximately 25 inches (63.5 cm) long, with a wingspan of 40 to 59 inches (101.6 to 149.9 cm). That is about twice the size of the average American Crow, or about the size of a red tailed hawk.

, Both crows and ravens have iridescent feathers, however crows may have a slight greenish tint to theirs, and a raven's will be more of a bluish shine.

, A crow's tail feathers are all the same length, so when the crow is in flight the tail will look squared off. A raven's tail has a longer middle feather, and it is more in the shape of a wedge.

, These are especially prominent when they are vocalizing.

, Where a crow's beak is fairly short and slightly curved along its entire length, a raven's beak is longer and straight until the tip where it curves downward.

, The American Crow makes the well known ""caw"" noise, which is repetitive. A raven's most commonly used vocalization is deeper and is more of a croaking sound.

, Crows are found in large colonies, while ravens are more solitary. You will probably only find one or two ravens together at any one point in time.

Listen to the songs.,
Watch your bird feeders.,
Identify the boreal chickadee.,
Recognize the chestnut-backed chickadee.,
Look for the mountain chickadee.,
Identify the Carolina chickadee.,
Recognize the black-capped chickadee.",How to Recognize the Chickadee," The chickadee is a very small bird. Larger birds are unlikely to be chickadees. It also has a specific body type to look for.The chickadee has a sphere-like appearance due to its short neck and large head.
A chickadee also has a short, thick bill and a long and narrow tail.;
, In general, chickadees will have black heads, or caps, with white cheeks. The back feathers will be some shade of gray. The wing feathers will also be gray, but with white edges., A chickadee's cap descends well below its eyes. It can be very difficult to see a chickadee's eyes, as they are often very small and obscured by the cap. If you can easily see an animal's eyes, it may not be a chickadee., Chickadees often forage for food. If you catch a bird foraging, it may be a chickadee. Chickadees often hop between twigs and grab food off the ground. They also may hang upside down on branches to grab food., Chickadees sing, like most birds. There are a variety of songs chickadees sing.Chickadees often sing ""chick-a-dee-dee-dee"" in a low, slow voice.
They may also whistle a two-noted ""fee-bee"" or three noted ""fee-bee-ee.""

, Chickadees are very social birds. They're likely to gather around bird feeders. If you see a bird near a feeder, it's likely it could be a chickadee. Watch for other signs of a chickadee, such as its appearance, to confirm., The boreal chickadee is generally found in very northern parts of the United States and Canada. If you don't live in very northern Michigan, Washington, Idaho, or Montana, you're unlikely to see this chickadee in the United States.The boreal chickadee has a dark pinkish brown cap that fades to gray. The cheeks are white and then also fade to gray behind the eye.
The underparts of the bird are generally olive gray, while flight and tail feathers are dark gray. Tail feathers have white fringes.

, Chestnut-backed chickadees are generally found in the Pacific Northwest. They have a white face and a dark brown crown. The underparts of the bird are dotted in a chestnut color, hence the name.The chestnut on the underparts of the bird are noticeable because they contrast greatly with the dark gray tail and flight feathers.
The flanks of the bird are a chestnut color, contrasting with the white belly.

, Mountain chickadees are generally found in the mountains or places with high elevations. They're unlikely to be found anywhere with an elevation below 3,000 feet (910 m).The mountain chickadee has a sooty black cap and also sooty black patches around the eyes.
Underparts of the bird are grayish brown. The flight and tail feathers are a slightly darker gray.

, The Carolina chickadee exists mostly in the Southern parts of the United States, usually in the woods or along the edges of streams. It has a sooty black cap, that extends towards the lower back, as well as white cheeks.The bird also has a black bib.
The upper parts of the bird are olive gray with darker tail feathers.

, The black-capped chickadee is the most common type, found in most part of the United States outside of the south. They are found in a great number of habitats.The bird has, as the name implies, a sooty black cap that extends down the back.
The underparts of the bird are olive gray.
The tail feathers are slightly darker with fringes of white on the edges.

Listen for differences in their calls.,
Listen for different drum sounds.,
Pay attention to different eating habits.,
Consider differences in location.",How to Tell the Difference Between Downy and Hairy Woodpeckers2," Both species have short, sharp calls. However, if you listen carefully, you can detect slight differences in the calls.


The Downy Woodpecker's pik call is a rapid string of high-pitched notes that descends in pitch toward the end. Their call typically lasts about two seconds.Hairy Woodpeckers however, make a similar short sharp note, described as more of a peek sound. It is slightly lower in pitch and does not descend at the end as the Downy's call does.Hairy Woodpeckers also have a rattling or whinnying call., The males and females of both species use their bills to drum on trees as a means of communication. However, the Downy's drum is slightly slower than that of a Hairy, about 17 beats per seconds as opposed to the Hairy's 25 beats per second. , Both species primarily eat insects, along with some fruit and seeds. But there are some differences in how the two species feed that may help you identify them.


Because of their smaller size, Downy Woodpeckers can eat foods that larger woodpeckers can't access, for example insects in the stems of larger weeds. Hairy Woodpeckers never feed on weeds.
Hairy woodpeckers like to drink the sweet sap of trees. They may even peck into sugar cane to drink the sugary juice within. , This can be tricky because both are found in woodlands and may often flock together. However, the Downy Woodpecker favors smaller branches while the Hairy spends more time on large branches or trunks. "

Use a field guide.,
Invest in a pair of binoculars.,
Set up an attractive feeder.,
Take photographs for comparison.,
Respect the birds.",How to Tell the Difference Between Downy and Hairy Woodpeckers3," Field guides provide information about the different species of birds you may be able to see in your region. There are many to choose from, and some are available online.However, some people prefer to purchase a hard copy of the field guide with illustrations or pictures to help you in your identification process.

, A good pair of binoculars with decent magnification (x7 or x8) can be a handy tool when trying to identify different birds. For example, it may be very difficult to spot the subtle differences in color pattern between the Downy and the Hairy Woodpecker without the use of binoculars.

, Purchase a wire or mesh feeder (to keep out the squirrels) and set it up with feed that both species of woodpecker enjoy.


Both Downy and Hairy Woodpeckers feed on suet, which is a great source of protein and fat for them. This is particularly necessary during the cold winter months.
Seeds, especially sunflower seeds, are also a popular choice.
Be aware that because of their diminutive stature Downy's will often wait until other birds are away from the feeder to use it. Hairy's can be more aggressive. , If you have time and a relatively high quality camera, taking photographs of the different birds allows you to keep a visual record and undertake a more detailed comparison. It also affords you a chance to examine the birds when they are still, unlike in the wild, where they are often in flight or moving.

, Woodpeckers are an essential part of the regional ecosystem, they help to control the insect population and make nest cavities that are used by other species of birds and mammals who can not excavate them on their own.You should take care not to disrupt the birds or their habitat.


The first principle of the American Birding Association is that bird-watchers should promote the welfare of birds and their environment, be mindful of this when you are trying to identify different bird species."

Do not give a nestling water.,
Identify the bird's species.,
Feed songbirds appropriately.,
Feed seed eaters the right food.,
Feed meat eaters the right food.,
Avoid mixing batches of food more than a day ahead of time.,
Notice if the baby is a nestling or a fledgling.,
Return a nestling to its nest.,
Make a makeshift nest if the nest has fallen.,
Wait at least a day.,
Call a licensed wildlife rehabilitator immediately.,

Clean up after the bird.",How to Make Baby Bird Rescue Food," Birds breathe through a hole in their tongue and can drown if you put water into their mouths.Birds get plenty of water through the appropriate food source for their species, so it is not necessary to supplement their diet with water. Doing so can be fatal.;
, Before you can feed a nestling, you need to know what kind of bird it is. Different types of birds eat different types of food. For example, some birds eat only seeds, while others eat only insects and worms. Other birds, like vultures, are meat-eaters. If you feed a seed-eater a diet of worms, he will die. It is very important to identify the species before attempting an emergency feeding.For help identifying your bird's species, visit http://www.babybirdid.com/, where you can view a gallery of images of common nestlings.
If you have a large social network on Facebook or Twitter, you can also try posting a picture of the baby bird and asking for help with an identification. When you get a response, be sure to do a Google image search to verify that the identification is correct.
Once you have identified the bird, you need to search the internet or a reliable reference book for information about that species' diet. For example, if you have found a baby chickadee, an internet search for ""what do chickadees eat"" or ""chickadee diet"" will tell you that they mostly eat insects but also like some seeds.

, Songbirds are the most typical kind of bird you'll encounter. Most songbird nestlings eat insects, but some, like house finches, don't.For insect eaters: chopped mealworms (available at pet stores) or insects like flies, crickets, grasshoppers, and moths.
You can supplement the insects with chopped, cooked, and cooled to room temperature hard-boiled eggs., Seed eaters tend to be the smaller birds (sparrows, chickadees, doves, etc).


Feed seed-eaters high protein dry infant cereal mixed with water (for example, Gerber brand baby oatmeal), wheat germ, corn or oatmeal that has been powdered in the blender.

, Meat-eating birds tend to be the biggest ones, birds of prey like falcons and so on. They will need to be fed even more frequently than the smaller birds and are more dangerous to handle, but they are also the ones you're least likely to encounter.


Feed them high protein dry kitten or dog food that has been soaked in water so that it is soft, or canned pureed meats prepared for infants such as chicken or beef.You can also feed them boiled chicken or live insects like flies and mealworms.

, Otherwise the food will go bad and will harm, or even kill the baby bird. Remember that caring for a baby bird requires a lot of work and energy and you'll be mixing a lot of batches of food.


Mix up the amount of bird food that you will need for one feeding at a time-- generally just a few teaspoons for a small bird.
Remember that most baby birds eat food that has been digested and regurgitated by their parents, so keep the consistency wet but not liquidy.

, Depending on its developmental stage, a baby bird may need your help or it may be practicing important life skills and your ""help"" would actually interfere with this natural process. A nestling is a pink, newborn bird who has not yet grown any flight feathers, while a fledgling is more like a toddler: fledglings have grown some of their adult feathers and are beginning to practice the skills needed for survival as an adult, including foraging for food and flying for short distances.If you see a nestling on the ground, it has probably fallen or been kicked out of its nest by its parents. You will need to place it back into its nest.A fledgling, on the other hand, may have flown to the ground and is probably practicing important skills like foraging for insects. You should not attempt an immediate rescue of a fledgling bird, but instead observe it from a distance (inside your house if possible) to see if the parents are nearby. In some cases, the fledgling will practice living on the ground, hopping around for days or even weeks! Keep children and pets away and let it be., When you find a baby bird on the ground, look up in trees or bushes directly around where it was found. It most likely fell or blew out of its nest. If you locate a nest, look inside for other baby birds of the same type to be sure that you've found the right nest.


You may be worried that the mother bird won't care for its baby if it has been handled by humans, but that is actually a myth. Most birds have a poor sense of smell, so they won't pay much attention to your smell.Put on gloves or use a tea towel or infant blanket to very gently pick up the baby bird. This protects the bird from your germs and also protects you from pecks or scratches as well as mites that live on wild birds.

, If the nest has fallen out of the tree and is nearby on the ground, you should gather as much of it as you can and place it into a plastic container that is about the same size of the original nest. If there is no nest material or very little, you can add shredded paper towels. You will need to secure this new nest into the tree.Drill a couple of holes in the bottom of the container for drainage, then nail the plastic container up in the closest tree. Very gently place the nestling inside the new makeshift nest (using gloves or a small blanket or towel to lift the bird).

, Birds come and go from their nests, and the parents may have seen you fussing around their baby and might be staying away out of fear you'll return. If you don't see a parent bird immediately that doesn't mean that the parent bird isn't coming back.If no parents have been observed after a day, it may have been abandoned and you will need to get it to the proper authorities to care for it.

, Nestlings require a very specific diet depending on their species, and most baby birds who die have been taken in by well-meaning people who try to feed them but effectively poison them instead by giving them the wrong diet. It is also illegal in the United States to attempt to raise a wild animal without a license.It's very important to contact someone who is trained to deal with a baby bird.If there is no rehabilitator close by (or if they are closed, for example on the weekend) and the parent birds have absolutely abandoned the baby, that is the only time you should attempt to feed and care for a nestling. Consider this: if you make a wrong guess at the species or dietary requirements of the bird, you may kill it. Only risk feeding it if it is definitely going to die without your intervention. Remember, birds can go 24 hours without eating, so avoid feeding it unless absolutely necessary.

, You can use a shoebox padded with paper towels or, if you tried using a plastic nest, you can repurpose it for a temporary home by placing the entire nest into the box. Make sure that the sides of the box are high enough that the bird cannot hop out (they can hop higher than you think, so overestimate to be safe!).


Keep the box inside your home where it is warm, out of direct sunlight and in a quiet area away from noisy children or pets.

, The most important thing you can do when caring for a baby bird is to keep it warm. As said before, a baby bird can go for 24 hours without food, but they desperately need warmth, especially if they've been injured or traumatized.One way to keep the bird warm is to place a heating pad set on low under one end of its box. Never place the bird directly on the heating pad as that can overheat it. Instead, wrap the heating pad in a shirt or cloth and keep it beneath the bird. You can also use a hot water bottle wrapped in a cloth and placed into the bird's box, but be sure that the bottle will not leak as this will get the bird wet and cause it to become chilled., Baby birds need to be fed at about 30 minute intervals from dawn to dusk-- and some require even more feeding, up to every ten minutes!You have to put the food into the bird’s mouth; it won’t eat it if it is just there in the temporary nest.


Don’t pry open the bird’s mouth. If it is hungry it will open its mouth for you.
Try to have only one person care for the bird and feed it as this will limit its contact with humans and help to feel safe.

, Once the bird has been taken by a rehabilitator or you've reintroduced it to the wild, you need to sanitize the area where it stayed (or better yet, throw the whole box away).


Wild birds have mites that can infest your home, and bird droppings can spread disease.Also be sure to wash your hands very thoroughly after handling the bird.

Buy a good up-to-date guidebook.,
Get a pair of lightweight binoculars.,
Start in your own backyard.,
Read the beginning of the book to learn the typical field markings that you must learn to identify and look for.,
Start with a bird you may already know, just for practice.,
Find the page with the known bird on it and read the description.,
Identify a bird you may not know for sure.,
Go out to a park and identify a new bird.,
Hold your binoculars on a new bird and look at it carefully.,
Find a general category in the book and page through to find a similar picture.",How to Take Your First Birding Outing," There are several classics, including the Peterson Field Guides or National Geographic. Start at your book store or nature center for those covering your area.;
, Heavy ones meant for sports won't work when you want to hold still and stare up for a long time.

, You don't need to go to any special place to practice the basic steps.

, These include colors of various parts, size, shape of tail, type of beak and feet, walking or flying patterns, and calls.

, You may know a robin or blue jay. Now learn how to find it in the book. The book is arranged by family of birds and you need to learn what each kind is- water bird, hunting bird, songbird, etc.

, Notice how it identifies the bird by its markings and then compare those to the bird in front of you. You already knew the robin has a red breast, but how does the entry describe it? Notice what it says about the beak, or tail.

, At this stage, try to find one in your backyard, so you don't need to use binoculars. Again first find the correct section of the book, then page through until you find a picture that looks like your bird. Read the description and compare with the bird. If it's wrong, try another picture.

, Once you practiced at home a few times, go and find a place to sit (picnic table, etc.). Sit quietly for up to 10 minutes and look for movement in the bushes or branches. Practice using your binoculars to locate the bird, focus on it, and move as it moves.

, Notice as much as you can as quickly as you can, before it disappears. Notice in this order: size, basic colors, shape of head and bill. If you have enough time, notice colors around the eye, colors on/under the wings and tail, color of breast.

, Read the description. Try to find the same bird again to confirm and check the details. Read nearby descriptions until you find a potential match. This is your probable bird.

Take the shot!",How to Photograph a Bird," Bird photography is hard work. You need to know what you are up for. Patience is the key, and an impatient person will not make a very good photographer. Also, make sure you can handle the disappointments, weather, and trips to places.;
, It must be of good quality. It should also have a fast shutter, because the birds can move at any split second. You should use the longest lens you have or can afford to get the bird larger in the photo. Also, if the birds won't come out when you are around, set the settings on your camera to trigger the shutter by remote control. Then you will be able to watch from farther away.

, Depending on what type of bird you choose, you will need to go to different areas to photograph it.

, Being passionate for birds just makes it easier to photograph them. You also need to respect them. Do not throw things at the birds if they fly away from you. This might make them never come back.

, If the birds don't notice you, you will be more apt to get a shot of them. You should also try making a hiding spot for yourself. This is called Bird-Blind Photography. Make a sort of barrier around yourself, with plants or whatever is handy, and set the camera up either inside it or outside. The birds won't care so much about the camera as they will about you.

, Or, go to a specific place where you see one bird go to over and over again. Different birds live in different places, so you should be prepared to travel to different places. Also, you might want to try going somewhere where there aren't many leaves in the trees. This will make it easier to photograph, but there may be fewer birds.

, Birds are very active feeding in early morning and late afternoon, so you might consider going around these times. That isn't the only times they are out, though. Birds can be feeding and active at any time of day.

, You should understand migration. Some birds migrate at different times of the year. If you are trying to photograph a specific bird, find out when it usually migrates.

, Once you arrive, find a place to stay, and plan on being there for a while.

, If you are using a remote controlled shutter, you might want to take more than one shot, to give you the best possible chances of having a perfect shot. If you are trying to get a close-up shot of one, wait for it to come over near you. Otherwise, take a picture at the appropriate time.

Gobble like a male turkey.,
Download a sound app.",How to Make Turkey Calls1," Many hunting supply stores sell turkey calls. These are small devices that will make the sound for you when you use them.


Some stores sell these devices for only a few dollars, although you could pay between $10 or closer to $100.
Some of the turkey calls perform a single call, such as gobbling, and other turkey calls offer a series of call choices.
Many of these turkey call devices are available for purchase online. They are usually small enough to fit inside your pocket.;
, Rhythm matters in turkey calling. You’ve got to get the cadence down or the turkey won’t come in.Don’t make the call too fast or too slow. In order to practice the cadence of the sound, listen to good turkey callers or to the sounds of live birds.
You could try recording your practice calls and then compare those to the sound of a live turkey to see if you’re making the call too loud or slow.
Not all turkeys sound the same. Some hens are high-pitched and some aren’t. Use different calls and change it up to increase your chances of calling in a turkey.

, Some people believe you should only make a call every hour when you’re doing “blind-calling” of turkeys from, say, a hill.


Turkeys make calls when they see other turkeys. If a turkey Is lonely, it will call long enough for other turkeys to hear.
These turkey calls may come in long strings. To increase your chances of drawing out a turkey, don’t be afraid to get aggressive and make more calls if you’ve gotten no response with the first one after 15 minutes.
Understand that turkeys make different calls for different reasons and some calls are more effective in certain seasons than others are.

, Male turkeys are called gobblers, and they make the most famous turkey call. It sounds somewhat like the crowing of a rooster.The sound is loud, shrill, descending and throaty and it lasts for about 1 second only. Usually male turkeys goggle from treetop roosts.
They do this because the sound carries better through the trees than it does on the ground. Male turkeys make this sound to attract females.
Turkeys also cackle when they fly down from roosts, and they give short, soft purring sounds as they move on foot. They also give long yelps to reassemble their flocks; young turkeys whistle three or four times so their fellow turkeys can find them when they are lost.

, Maybe you don’t have any luck trying to call turkeys with your own voice. These days, there’s plenty of technological help for that problem.


You can download a free sound app on iTunes that makes turkey calls. You can set the app to play a turkey call once or to play different calls in a loop.Listen to expert callers or actual birds on You Tube. This will help you emulate the sound of the call.
Many online hunting sites have audio sound files online that allow you to hear the different sounds turkeys make.

Use a turkey mouth call.,
Make a basic yelp.,
Press your tongue harder against the reed to create higher tones.,
Make a turkey cluck sound.,
Make a purr turkey call.",How to Make Turkey Calls2," It might take years to learn how to use a turkey call, so have patience and practice a lot.


Blow air across the latex reed to make the sound of a turkey. These turkey calls are a reed stretched across a horseshoe-shaped frame that is centered inside a plastic skirt.
Pick a single or double reed call for your first call as they are easier for beginners to use. Put the call into your mouth so the open end is facing out, and push it up to your mouth’s roof with your tongue.Make sure the seal is tight. Put your tongue lightly against the reed.Trim some of the tape so the call fits into your mouth if it’s too wide. Try not to bend the frame or you could knock the reeds loose and this can alter the sound. The manufacturers of turkey calls set the tension very carefully for sound quality.

, Hold the call with your tongue against the roof of your mouth to make this basic turkey call.


Turkeys give out a “tree yelp” when they want to reassure other turkeys roosted nearby, and a lost yelp when they want to reassemble after being scattered.
Exhale the letter “H” as you hold the call against your mouth’s roof. Force the air to go in between your tongue and the call. Some hunters will say a word when yelping to get the sound. Chick, chirp, chop and chalk are some words used.
Make sure air doesn’t escape over the call between the call and your mouth’s roof. That’s incorrect.

, Apply less pressure on the reed to lower the sound of the tones.Control the yelping sound with your tongue to place more or less pressure on the reed. Exaggerate the length of the high tone at first for about 2 seconds.
Then slightly open your mouth or remove your tongue’s pressure from the reed to make a lower tone. Once you’ve mastered that maneuver, speed it up. Blend together high and low tone to make the yelp.
The yelp should be a 5- to 15 note series made in a rhythmic manner. Vary the volume and skip beats. Gobblers and hens use this call. The hens use it to tell gobblers they want to mate. Use the yelp in spring and fall.

, This sound occurs when you say the word “putt” with your teeth clenched together as you exhale. Some hunters will say the words pock and puck instead as they make the call.A cluck call is about 2 or three notes. It’s used by turkeys to get the attention of other turkeys and to communicate with them. It’s a good call to use when you want to attract the attention of a spring gobbler. Turkeys gobble when they are in the woods and trying to attract female turkeys. They give out yelps when they are separated from other turkeys. They cackle as they fly down from a tree top, and they purr as they travel and feed.
A kee-kee run audio sound is another call popular by fall hunters who want to bring in a flock. Turkeys use this sound to regroup their flock.
Make 2-4 high tone calls followed by 2 or 3 yelps. Use this largely in fall turkey hunting. Say pee-pee-pee to kee kee, and use more tongue pressure on the reed. Rise the notes with lost urgency.

, The purr is a call that a turkey uses when it’s foraging in the fields or woods. You can attract a gobbler with a purr and then a cluck.


To make a purr sound, position your tongue slightly again the reed. Now exhale and flutter your lips rapidly to emulate the turkey’s purr.
Some hunters find this sound very difficult to make so they will practice it all season long. Gobblers will come looking for hens when they hear the purr sound.
To emulate the sound of a lonely bird, make a series of Cut sounds, which are used by hens who are looking to mate, especially in the spring. This call should be loud and aggressive. It should last between 5 to 15 seconds long.

Drape the diaphragm.",How to Make Turkey Calls3," It’s pretty easy to make a homemade turkey call out of a pill bottle. Any prescription bill bottle should work.First, draw a half circle on the pill bottle’s lid. Leave about an inch around the outer edge of plastic. Next, cut out the half circle. A razor blade should work to cut it out.Use a hack saw to cut off the pill bottle’s bottom. Sand off the rougher points with sandpaper. Be very careful whenever using cutting instruments.
Take a latex glove and cut one of the fingers off to use it as your reed. Slit it up the middle to the tip of the finger. Stretch the cut glove finger over the hole, and fasten it to the bottle with a rubber band.
Leave a gap between the bottom edge of the hole and the latex to make the turkey call. You can change the size of the gap to alter the sound. Cut off any excess latex. Press your bottom lip across the part of the bottle without latex. Chirp, purr or gobble into it.

, Turkey calls can also be made with cans. Take an empty tin can.


Cut down the side of the can and then around its bottom to create a single long metal strip.
Discard the can bottom or save it for other turkey calls. This metal strip will be the frame for your call. Lay the strip flat, and draw at least one frame on it.
The frame should be 2 inches long by 1 inch wide. Trace it on the metal. Cut out the inside of the frame. Cut along the outline.

, This is the musical instrument portion of the homemade call, which causes the reed to vibrate and make the sound.


Take a latex glove and draw a 2 inch by 1 inch rectangle on the glove. You could mark out more than one rectangle to make different calls. Take a razor knife, and cut out the rectangles. Cut through both glove layers.
Open your metal frame, and put your latex reeds in it by laying them in the frame.
Ensure they are all the way forward against the bend and close the frame tightly to hold the latex. Bend the top frame tab to lock the frame.

, Cut three pieces of 3 inch long waterproof tape. Layer them.


You will then have one piece of tape that is three layers thick. Take the piece you carved out of the frame’s interior, and lay it in the center of the tape.
Use a razor knife to trace around the cut out to cut a hole in the tape the size of the opening in your frame.
After you’ve cut the hole, lay the frame with the latex in it on the tape. Line it up so the frame’s opening is over the hole. Pull the latex tightly.

, Stick it to the tape around the frame. You want the reed to be tight but not overstretched.


Fold the tape over, and press it together. Make sure that it doesn't have gaps or the sound will be off.
Trace the basic shapes. After the turkey call is folded over, trace the basic call shape onto the tape.
It should match your mouth shape so you can seal the call against the roof of your mouth.

, This is probably one of the easiest calls that you can make at home. The key to this is to obtain very dry wood.Old furniture can provide a good source of wood, especially if it’s made of oak or mahogany.
You could also get some from a landfill or thrift store. Get a band saw to cut the wood with the grain. Cut it into strips that are ¼ inch thick.
Print out a homemade box call pattern sheet from the internet, and cut out the patterns.

, You should trace the patterns onto the blocks of wood and then cut them, following the pattern shapes.


It’s pretty easy to construct the box once you’ve cut the wood. You should have 6 pieces of wood when you are done using the box call pattern sheet.Shape the paddle’s bottom into a rounded bottom using a belt sander. Then, glue the ends and sides of the box together and put them into a box shape.
Assemble the paddle on the top of the call. Use a wood screw and a small spring to provide tension to the paddle.

, Find a good piece of slate. A slate tile or shingle are potential sources. Cut the slate with a diamond-tipped saw.


The slate section should measure about 8 inches (20.3 cm) by 12 inches (30.5 cm) and be 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) thick.
Grind the slate section. Rub on a section of sidewalk that you've doused with water.
Move the slate in circles until its fairly smooth. Rub the slate section with fine sandpaper until it's very smooth.

, The chamber should be fashioned out of a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. Cut 2 inches (5 cm) off a 3-inch (7.6 cm) diameter pipe.


Set the end of the sound chamber against the slate section. Trace the round outline onto the slate with a pencil.
Use tin snips to cut the slate until you have a round piece that fits over the end of the sound chamber.
Attach the round piece of slate to the end of the sound chamber. Use liquid ceramic glue or silicone glue.

, Make the handle from a 3/8 inch (1 cm) wood dowel. Cut an 8-inch (20.3cm) section, then whittle 1 end until it's sharp.


Shove the handle length-wise through the center of a dried, shelled corn cob. The cob should measure 6 inches (15 cm) in length.
Use wood glue if the handle is a bit loose within the corn cob. The corn cob is the striker.
Use the slate call to mimic wild turkey sounds. Hold the striker by the handle in 1 hand and the slate/sound chamber in your other hand.

, Perform this action with even circular motions.


Tune the slate turkey call. Do this until you're satisfied with the sound.
Trim the handle slightly, as that will impact the sound of the turkey call, and it's important to get it just right.
You could shorten or hollow out the top of the corn cob or shorten the sound chamber.

, Smooth the ends of a 3/4-inch (2 cm) PVC pipe coupler with sandpaper. Make a lip rest.


Use the end of the PVC coupler to trace a circle onto a margarine tub's plastic lid with a pencil. Cut out the plastic circle and then cut it in half to make 2 rests. You'll need just 1 lip rest for this project.
Glue the lip rest to one half of the end of the pipe coupler. Use a hot glue gun. Sandpaper any rough spots, if necessary.
Wrap the tube turkey call with black or camouflage tape. Cut a 2-inch by 2-inch (5 cm by 5cm) square from a latex glove to create a diaphragm.

, Drape it over the other half of the PVC end that the lip rest is attached to.


Hold the latex diaphragm in place with a rubber band. Press your lower lip against the diaphragm and your upper lip against the lip rest.
The correct position is similar to drinking from a bottle. Impersonate turkey calls by speaking into the tube turkey call. Your breath and jaw movements make the sounds that mimic turkey vocalizations.
For example, saying ""shuck"" into the tube call will sound like a wild turkey's yelp.

Feed the nestling until it becomes a fledgling.",How to Feed Wild Baby Birds," If you plan on touching the bird, use gloves. Gloves will protect you from the bird. Even young birds can use their beaks to peck you., If a baby bird has feathers, it's a fledgling. If it doesn't, it's a nestling., Fledglings have good reason to be outside the nest. If a bird is fully feathered, it's likely learning to fly. They are supposed to be out of the nest. The parents will still feed it even on the ground., Nestlings are more likely to need help. If you find a nestling, you can return it to its nest, which should be close by. If you can't find a nest, you may need to find it help.Try listening for the siblings. When the parents return with food, you should be able to find the nest fairly easily by following the sound of the nestlings begging to be fed.
To catch a nestling, approach the bird with one hand over the head and back and one hand under the belly and legs. Do not worry that the mother will reject the bird because you have handled her baby. She will readily accept it back into her nest.Warm the nestling by cradling it in your hands until the bird no longer feels cool to your touch., If you do find the nest and the other nestlings are dead, you can safely conclude that the nest has been abandoned, and you will have to take in the surviving nestling(s).

, If you can't decide whether you have a fledgling or a nestling, try letting the bird sit on your finger. If the bird can grip adequately, it's likely a fledgling., If you worry about leaving the bird in the nest alone, you can check to see if a parent returns by watching it for the next couple of hours. However, make sure you keep a safe distance, as the parents may not return if you are too close., The nest may have been destroyed by storms, a predator, or humans. If you can't find the nest, create your own. You can use a small plastic container. Line it with something soft, such as a washcloth or small towel or blanket.Place the nest in a shady spot near where you fond the bird. You can nail it to the tree. Set the bird in side, making sure to place its feet under its body., Always wash your hands after handling a bird. Birds can carry diseases, so it's best to thoroughly clean your hands when you're done., If the parents don't return to the nest within a couple of hours or if you're sure the parents are not alive anymore, you'll need to call for help for the bird., If the bird has trouble moving or flapping its wings, it's likely injured. Also, if the bird is shivering, it may be in trouble. An injured bird is also a reason to make a call., It's actually illegal to keep and raise a wild bird. You must have special permits from both the local and federal governments to raise wild animals., Wildlife rehabilitators have the skills and training to care for baby birds. You can find one on your local government's wildlife websites, or you can try calling a local veterinarian or animal shelter, as they may know rehabilitators in the area.Ask for advice on how to feed and water the baby and how to keep it warm. Be patient with your questions, and ask for additional advice by saying, ""Is there anything else that I should know (or be careful about)?""

, Remember that by keeping the bird, you are performing an illegal act. Also, you likely do not have the expertise to feed the bird properly, so it very well may die under your care. Also, caring for a baby bird is not easy, as it needs to be fed every 20 minutes or so. Finally, you are not equipped to teach the bird what its parents do, such as how to hunt for food or how to be on the lookout for predators.The bird also may become so accustomed to humans that it may come to harm because it doesn't know to fly from humans and may come to expect its food from humans at all times., You may be able to match the species by looking at an online field guide such as The Cornell Lab of Ornithology or the Audubon Society's Guide to North American Birds.Positive identification will be easier if you catch a glimpse of the parents. However, if the parents are still around, you should let them take care of the baby. They have strong instincts to care for their young and are well equipped to do so.

, What your baby bird will eat depends on what its parents eat. For instance, cardinals eat seeds,while crows eat everything from nuts and berries to insects and small rodents., If your bird is an omnivore, you can try dog or cat food.Many wild birds are omnivores, and when they are babies, they are primarily feed insects by their parents. That means that a diet rich in animal protein, such as dog or cat food, is appropriate for these birds.If you use dry food, soak it in water first. Leave it for an hour to soak. However, when you go to feed the baby, make sure it isn't dripping, as water can get in the bird's lungs, leading to death. The food should be spongy, not dripping.Make a small ball. Create a small ball of food, about the size of a pea. Drop the food in the baby's mouth. A Popsicle stick or a chopstick is handy for this process. You can also cut the end of a straw into a small scoop.The baby should readily accept and eat the food. For dry cat or dog food, if the kibbles are too big, make sure to break them up. Essentially, you want all the food to be about a pea size., If your bird eats seeds alone, use seed formula, which you can find at a pet store. Pet stores often carry seed formula for baby parrots.Use a syringe to push the food past the glottis.The glottis goes around the trachea. You'll see a small hole in the mouth or at the back of the throat where the trachea opens. You do not want to get food or water in the trachea. Therefore, make sure the tip of the syringe moves past the glottis., That is, the baby will actively eat food when it is hungry. If it doesn't seem enthusiastic, it is probably full., If the food is sufficiently soaked, the baby bird should not need any more water, at least as long as it is a nestling. Providing water can do more damage than good, as you can cause the bird to aspirate and die.If the bird seems dehydrated when you first take it in, you can use Gatorade or Lactated Ringers Solution. Place a drop on the birds beak using your finger so that the bird can suck the liquid in. Signs of dehydration include a dry mouth and reddish skin. Also, the skin on the back of the neck will not spring back immediately when pinched if the bird is dehydrated., Your baby bird needs constant food to keep its energy up.However, you do not need to wake up to feed it at night., To be able to release the bird, you want to make sure the bird does not imprint on you or connect with you. Limit your interactions with the bird, and do not treat it like a pet.In fact, it's almost impossible to raise a single baby without having it imprint on you, especially if it is less than 2 weeks old., At about 4 weeks old, the baby should be able to start learning to feed itself. However, it can take another month or so for that to happen. You should still hand feed during this time period, but leave a small bowl of food in the cage. At this point, you can provide a very shallow bowl of water, too.You will notice the baby become less interested in hand feeding over time., You may have to wait weeks for the bird to develop its wings, becoming a fledgling. The bird cannot survive until it grows wings and starts flying on its own. Only then can you try to release it in the wild.If you keep the bird as it grows into adulthood, you will need to move to an adult diet for the bird, which will be different from its previous diet.Additionally, once the baby bird is jumping up the side of the box, you can move it to a cage rather than a box."

, The feeder should be set up in a relatively shady place, with plenty of perches nearby. Make sure to account for your view when you chose a place for the feeder; it's a treat to watch these iridescent birds. Consider placing the feeder within view of a window. Because you'll need frequent access to it for cleaning and refilling, the location should be easily accessible, and not too tall for you to reach.

, Deck-type feeders will need to be secured to a flat, wooden surface with screws, whereas hanging feeders simply need their J-hook top hooked over a stable branch, or a hook on the eaves of your house.

Spend a little time observing the birds.,
Choose or make bird feeders.,
Set up the bird feeder together.,
Have the kids prepare the seed mixes for the bird feeder.,
Teach the children how to keep the bird feeder clean on a regular basis.",How to Introduce Your Kids to Feeding the Birds," Help the kids learn the names of the birds that stop by your wonderful garden so that they are aware of the birds that are around.


Consider visiting the library to borrow books on local birds. This will help your kids learn more about the birds' habits and eating preferences. You will probably learn a lot too.;
, You will need to decide whether you'll target all the birds or only some, as some birds will be ground feeders, some nectar feeders, and some will be happiest perching high. The time spent observing will help you to make the best choice.


If you have cats, it might not be wise to encourage ground feeding.






If the kids want to make their own, here are some ideas: How to make a cardboard bird feeder, How to make a bird feeder, and How to make a milk carton bird feeder.

, Get your kids to as much of the siting and preparing as possible. The basic rules are:


Site the bird feeder at least one metre from windows in the house or shed. This will help to prevent bird flight collisions.
Avoid hanging the feeder near shrubs, trees, walls, or low roofs that cats, possums, squirrels, or other seed eaters or hunters can leap from.

,


Mixed seed will attract a variety of birds.
Black oil sunflower seeds and suet make many birds happy.
Use your learning from the books to prepare any specialist food needs for the birds in your locale.

, Explain to them how important cleanliness is, just as it is for them to eat off clean plates, so too for the birds.


Scrub the feeder with a 1 part bleach to 9 parts water solution, with gloves on. Rinse thoroughly and air dry before adding seeds in again. Supervise children doing any cleaning with bleach, or do it with them watching until they're ready.
Encourage the kids to collect and dispose of any feed that falls out of the feeder. This will prevent fungal growth and removes an attractant for mice and rats.

Hang from the appropriate spot in the garden.",How to Make a Recycled Bird Feeder1," A 1 liter (0.3 US gal) bottle is a good height and weight for hanging. Wash it to remove all traces of the original drink and allow to dry thoroughly. You'll also need two wooden spoons or similar wooden items (dowels, spatulas, etc. will all suffice). These can be old, used ones, or new from the bargain store.;
, Use a marker to mark the spots after measuring:


Measure the first hole from the base of the bottle to about 4 inches/10cm up. Draw an asterisk measuring about 1/2 inch. Then turn the bottle around 90 degrees.
Measure the second hole from base about 2 inches/5cm from the bottom. Mark this spot with another 1/2 inch asterisk.
Draw a 1 inch/2.5cm circle just next to the asterisk on each side of the bottle.

, Cut the asterisks along the asterisk lines only, then cut out the circle rounds precisely.


Use a craft knife; this has greater precision than scissors and is easier to handle when cutting the bottle.

, Repeat in the opposite direction for the other wooden spoon. Both spoons should now sit snugly in the bottle. These form both perches for the birds and feeder holders for the seed.

, This provides the hanger for the bottle feeder. Thread either wire or twine through the eye and tie firmly. Ensure that you use enough to hang from somewhere such as a tree branch or a pole.

, Return the cap and screw it on tightly.

, This might be a tree branch, a washing line, a post or pole, or some other improvised item. Make any adjustments needed to ensure that it hangs in a balanced way and wiggle to allow a little of the seed to fall into the spoon holder. This should continue to fill on its own from the weight of the birds landing on the ""perches"".

Purchase a seed feeder.,
Purchase a nectar feed.,
Purchase the right feed.,
Provide fresh water for the birds.,
Provide peanuts for some birds.,
Provide suet to the birds.,
Provide fresh fruit for the birds.",How to Feed the Birds," Do some research to find out what types of birds live in your area. Also find out what type of seed to buy using the links below. Purchase a feeder to dispense the seed. (Again, do some research; there are hundreds of different types of feeders to choose from: platform feeders, tube feeders, etc.) Some of the more expensive feeders have ""baffles"" that prevent squirrels and other pests from eating from them. Many feeders are also made to dispense a certain seed, or for a certain species. For example, ""thistle socks"" are made to contain thistles only, and can only be used by goldfinches. Clean the feeders once a week with soap and water.;
, If you want to attract hummingbirds, you can set up a nectar feeder. ""Nectar"" is a solution with a sugar-water ratio of 1:4. Do not fill the feeders with too much nectar, and take care to clean your nectar feeder in the summer; sugar can ferment and kill the birds.

, Do some researching on the types of birds you have in your location and find out what they eat. Some birds eat seeds such as sunflower, some eat fruit such as berries whilst others eat types of bugs such as mealworms. You can get wild bird feed from a pet store which are suitable for most native birds.

, Most birds are attracted to the sound of water and it's always good to provide some water for the birds to drink on a hot day. You can buy a bird bath with a faucet or make your own dripping system. During winter you can purchase a heated bird bath if it gets quite cold.


To make a dripping system fill a shallow dish with water and punch a small hole in the bottom of a bucket, fill the bucket with water and hang it from a branch or a supporting structure. Fill a shallow dish with water. Punch a small hole in the bottom of a bucket. Fill the bucket with water, and hang from a branch or supporting structure. The water should drip and not pour into the shallow dish.

, Many birds, such as jays and nuthatches, enjoy peanuts. String the shells together. Don't offer peanuts in the spring and summer, as parents will offer these to baby birds, which will choke on them.

, Suet is a huge source of protein and fat, and is very helpful in the winter. You can buy it in slabs, or make your own. Nail or attach with mesh to the trunk of a tree. Don't offer suet in the summer, as it can go rancid.

, Fresh fruit, as well as jelly, is popular, and will attract orioles and robins, as well as other birds. Dispense jelly in a shallow container, slice oranges in half, and impale each half on a spike (nail, small tree branch, etc.). These can also attract wasps and ants; clean frequently.

Keep it fresh and varied.,
Use a suitable container.,
Provide a cuttlebone and a mineral block.,
Prevent obesity.,
Balance the food.,
Get him to eat.,
Watch for sickness.,
Change the water daily.",How to Feed Budgies," One good option to feed budgies is seeds. However, you shouldn't let your budgie fill up on seeds, as this can shorten a bird’s lifespan. This is because most seed mixes do not provide sufficient nutrients your bird needs and can cause cancer, obesity, and other health problems.


Seeds should only make up 1/6 of your budgie's diet.;
, One of the staples in a budgie's diet is pellets. You can buy pellets in your local pet food store that are suitable for budgies. The pellets are the best way for your budgie to have a nutritionally balanced diet because they contain tons of nutrients for the bird.When you buy the pellets, make sure they don't have any preservatives, added sugars, artificial colorings, or artificial flavors in them., Fruits and vegetables form a very important part of your budgie's diet. Dark green or yellow vegetables should be offered daily. Try fruits and vegetables such as apples, pumpkin, grapes, carrot, parsley, broccoli, mango, sweet potato, squash, and spinach. Feed the fruits and vegetables to your budgie raw, because cooking takes away vital nutrients.


They can be served in any way the budgie prefers, which may be chopped, shredded, diced, sliced, pureed, or whole. Try multiple ways until you find the way your budgie likes best.
Remove what your budgie doesn't eat after two hours, since cut, raw vegetables can go bad quickly.There are some fruits and vegetables that you should never feed your bird because they are toxic to him. This includes avocado, the pits and seeds of fruit (apple seeds contain cyanide and are especially toxic), chocolate, garlic, onion, mushrooms, uncooked beans, rhubarb, and the leaves and stems of tomatoes., Many owners and breeders feed a mixture of soaked grains, which is called ""soft food"", as an extra treat in the bird's diet. You can add any grains you want, including quinoa, brown rice, cracked wheat, or barley. You can also add organic natural honey, fruits, or vegetables to the grains to make it more interesting.


Pour the grains into a dish and soak them with water. After they have puffed up, drain the water and mix in whatever you want., Although this may sound unusual for a budgie, it adds a great source of protein for your budgie. It also adds a little variety to his diet and provides beneficial nutrients, which is always a good thing.


Make sure you limit these special treats, however. You should never feed it this more than ½ tsp at a time., Your budgie should have many different options to eat every day. As a general guideline, feed your budgie seeds and pellets every day. Fruits, vegetables, and soft foods should be fed to him every second day, or preferably every day. Egg or cheese should be feed to him once a week or once every other week.


In addition to keeping the options fresh, you should also change the food every day, keeping fresh food in his dish. Always remove the old food before adding new food. , Your budgie needs to be able to access his food whenever he needs to. A budgie can get sick if he goes without eating for 24 hours, so he needs to be able to access his food at all times. The container shouldn't be too deep so the budgie doesn't have to dig too deep to get to the food. It should also be in a place near his water so he can eat and drink together., Cuttlebones and mineral blocks are necessities for your budgie. They contain necessary minerals and nutrients that your bird might not be getting other places. The cuttlebone should be placed in the cage so the soft side faces the bird so he can scrape off the bone.


If either becomes soiled with dropping, is eaten away or gets wet, throw them away and provide fresh ones.These also provide bird enrichment activities. Budgies like to perch on them and sometimes tear them apart. Let him do whatever he wants with them, as long as they stay clean and dry. He'll know when he needs to use them, so don't worry if he doesn't touch it for awhile. His food may be providing him with enough nutrients for the time being., Your budgie needs ample cage space or room in your house to exercise. You should also pay attention to your bird's daily feeding habits to keep him from overeating. This can lead to obesity. An obese bird loses its streamlined appearance and can become lethargic and suffer health problems.


An experienced avian veterinarian can help you determine if your budgie is overweight and help you decide how to help him if he is. , Budgies have very delicate systems. Any changes to his food should be done gradually over a long period of time. If you want to change his seed blends, add a little more of the new blend in each day and take away a little more of the old blend until he has completely transitioned to the new food.


Your budgie's diet should be balanced over time, not all at once in one meal. Don't give him all of the different types of foods you feed him at once. Follow the general guidelines for feeding him and vary his food over time. Feeding him all at once can lead to overeating and make your bird unhappy or sick., Your budgie may not want to eat, which can be due to the presentation of foods or what you are feeding him. If he won't eat the fresh foods, chop up the veggies and fruits and put them in an empty feed cup. Hang the cup in his cage with a few leaves of leafy greens or another much-loved treat pegged above it.


Do this every day until your budgie is finally won over and he is eating all his different kinds of foods.

, You should watch the consistency of your budgie's stool. This can indicate if he is getting too many fresh foods. If his stool becomes loose and watery, decrease the amount of fresh foods for a day or two. He may be getting too much liquid from them, which causes these kinds of problems.


If the diarrhea persists, see your veterinarian to identify other causes., All birds need water all day long in a clean water container. To keep clean and fresh, replace the water dish every day with a fresh dish. Clean the dish with vinegar and water only. Never use soap or chemicals to clean it. The vinegar will help prevent any bacteria from building up in the dish.


Never put vitamins in the water because it could lead to infection or bacteria buildup, and your budgie may refuse to drink the water. The only things you should put in the water are medications, such as antibiotics, as instructed by your vet.

Identify whether the baby is an altricial or precocial bird.,
Identify whether the baby is a nestling or a fledgling.,
If possible, put the baby bird back in the nest.,
Make a substitute nest, if necessary.,
If you’re sure the baby bird has been abandoned, call a bird rehabilitation center.",How to Feed a Baby Bird1," The first thing you will need to do is identify whether this is an altricial bird or precocial bird. Altricial birds are those that are born with their eyes closed, without feathers and are completely dependent on their parents for food and heat. Most perching birds and song birds are altricial birds, for example; robins, blue jays and cardinals. Precocial birds are birds that are more developed upon being born, they hatch with their eyes open and have soft, downy feathers. They are capable of walking and immediately start following their mother around, pecking at food as they go. Examples of precocial birds include killdeer, ducks and geese.


Precocial birds are much easier to care for than altricial birds, but they are less likely to require help. Precocial birds usually make their nest at ground level, and so cannot fall out or be thrown from their nests. If you find a lost precocial chicks, make an effort to reunite it with its mother before taking it in.
Newly hatched altricial birds are completely helpless, and will therefore require assistance. It is common to encounter altricial birds in suburban areas who have fallen or been thrown from their nest. In some cases, you will be able to put the baby back in its nest, in others you will have to care for it yourself. It is also acceptable to leave the baby bird where it is and let nature take it’s course.;
, If you have encountered a baby perching or songbird who you suspect has fallen or been abandoned, you must first identify whether the baby is a nestling or a fledgling. Nestlings are baby birds who are too immature to leave the nest, as they have not fully developed their feathers and may not have opened their eyes. Fledglings are older baby birds who have developed the feathers and necessary strength to learn how to fly. They may leave the nest and they know how to perch and grip.


If the baby bird you have found is a nestling, it should not be out of the nest and something is definitely wrong. It may have fallen out of its nest or been pushed out by stronger siblings. An abandoned nestling has almost no chance of survival if left on its own.
If you have come across a fledgling however, you may want to take some time to assess the situation before you pursue any heroics. Though it may appear as if the bird has fallen or been abandoned, fluttering and chirping helplessly on the ground, it may just be learning to fly. If you observe the chick for long enough, you will probably see the parents coming back to feed it at regular intervals. If this is the case, you should definitely not intervene., If you are sure that the baby bird you have encountered is a nestling, and it is lying helpless on the ground, it may be possible to reintroduce the chick to its nest. First, see if you can locate the nest in a nearby tree or bush. It may be well hidden and possibly hard to reach. Next pick up the baby bird, cupping it in one hand and covering it with the other, until it becomes warm. Look it over for any injuries, then if it looks okay, gently place it back in the nest.


Do not worry about the parents rejecting the baby due to its “human” smell. This is an old wives' tale. Birds actually have a very poor sense of smell and identify their young mostly by sight and sound. In the majority of cases, they will accept the fallen chick back into their nest.
Once you have place the baby bird back in the nest, make a hasty retreat -- don’t hang around to make sure the parents return, you will only frighten them away. If you can, watch the nest from inside the house, using a pair of binoculars.
Be aware that, in many cases, placing the baby bird back in the nest will not ensure its survival. If it is the weakest chick in the nest, it is likely that it will be thrown from the nest again by the stronger chicks, as they vie for food and warmth.
If you see any dead chicks inside the nest, then the nest has been abandoned and it will be no use returning the fallen chick. In this situation, you will need to care for the chick, along with any of its surviving brothers and sisters, if you want to ensure their survival., Occasionally, entire nests may fall due to high winds, tree trimmers or predators. If this is the case, you may be able to save the nest (or make a new one) and replace the chicks. If the original nest is still intact, you can place it in a berry basket or butter tub (with punched holes for drainage) and use some wire to hang the nest from a tree branch. Try to place the nest in its previous location. If this is not possible, a nearby branch will do. Just make sure that the location is sheltered, away from direct sunlight.


Collect the fallen chicks and warm them up in your hands before placing them back in the nest. Leave the area, but try to watch the nest from afar. The parent birds may be suspicious of the new nest of first, but their instinct to care for their chicks should help them to overcome this.
If the original nest is completely destroyed, you can make a new one by lining a berry basket with paper towel. Even though the original nest may have been made from grass, you should not line your make-shift nest with grass, as it contains moisture which can chill the baby birds.

, It is important to ascertain that a baby bird has truly been abandoned before taking it in. The most common situations in which a baby bird or birds will need assistance are: when you find a fallen nestling but cannot locate or reach the nest; when the fallen nestling is injured, weak or soiled; or when you have been observing a substitute nest closely for over two hours and the parents have still not returned to feed their young.


The best thing to do in these situations is to call a bird rehabilitation center who can take the baby bird in. These centers have experience in caring for baby birds and will give them the best chance of survival.
If you do not know where to find a bird rehabilitation center, call a local veterinarian or game warden who can provide you with the information you need. In some cases, there may not be a bird or general wildlife center in your locality, but there may be an individual, licensed rehabilitator somewhere close by.
If none of the above options are feasible, or you are unable to transport the bird to the rehabilitation center, it may be necessary to care for the baby bird yourself. Bear in mind that this should be a last resort, as caring for and feeding a baby bird is extremely demanding and the bird’s chances of survival are low.
In addition, it is technically against the law to keep or care for a wild bird in captivity, unless you have the proper permits and licenses."

Use paint pens to add decorative designs to the bottle.,
Attach a hook to the top of the bottle.,
Hang from a suitable place in the garden.,
Tip birdseed into the recycled bottle feeder.",How to Make a Recycled Bird Feeder2," It must be wide and squat, to allow plenty of room for the birds to access. A large vegetable oil bottle or a large milk bottle would be good. Wash the bottle out thoroughly and allow to dry before proceeding.


Be sure to only use bottles that have held food in them. Do not use bottles that have had cleaning or garage products in them.

, Cut out the front, back and side panels from the bottle. Leave a good amount of edges on all corners to form the structural holders of the feeder and leave at least 2 inches/5cm of uncut base (namely, end the panel so as to leave the a good amount of the bottle's bottom intact). Think of this as cutting away ""windows"" from the bottle. Do not cut all of the panel out; leave a small part at the base for a ""perch""; you simply cut away most of the panel, then only cut slits down the sides of the base part of the panel, then bend it outwards to form the perch.


Use a craft knife to do the cutting.
You can vary what you cut away. If you'd rather that the birds had shelter from wind or breezes, you could cut out only a single panel, or only a front and back panel, while leaving the other panels intact. Since it's a plastic bottle, and these are in plentiful supply, you might like to experiment to discover what works best.

, Pierce a hole in the exact same place on the opposite side. Slide the wooden skewer through this. Pieces of fresh fruit can be added to this for birds to eat, with skewers replaced regularly to maintain hygiene.

, This step is optional but it's fun for the kids. Ensure the designs are dry before proceeding.

, Twist it into the bottle cap, then restore the cap to the bottle. Thread wire or twine through the eye and tie a firm knot.

, This might be a tree branch, a clothesline or similar object.

, Pull the skewer back on one side and thread the fruit pieces on, then push the skewer back into position. The feeder is now ready for the birds.

, Paint it all one color. Choose a natural color. Allow to dry completely.

, Glue the twigs to the sloped part of the carton; this will make a cute little roof. Allow to dry thoroughly.


Use twigs that are all of the same size; cut to size before gluing. The should have a little overhang to create the effect of the end of a roof, and eaves.

, Form flower shapes using buttons and glue here and there on the carton. This is optional but it does look pretty.

, This provides a perch for the bird to sit on as it feeds. You may need to add a dab of glue to keep it solidly in place; test by pushing down gently.

Take the cup and sauce outside.,
Fill the cup area with birdseed.",How to Make a Recycled Bird Feeder4," If you don't have any spare pieces at home, hunt for a cute set at a thrift or antique store. They don't need to be matching; they can be as eclectic as you like. The main thing is that you like how they look together.


Choose strong items. Check for cracks, hairline cracks and anything else that might signal weakness in the cup or saucer. They need to be strong, as they'll be hanging up and holding birdseed, along with birds.
You may wish to use a plate larger than a saucer, especially if you plan on feeding large birds or you're using a large jug. Use your eye to gauge good proportions.

, Allow to dry thoroughly.

, It must rest on one edge, with the wide mouth leaning towards the center of the saucer.

, Lay the cup over on its side (handle side facing upward) and press the edge of the base firmly into the glue on the saucer. Apply pressure for a few seconds, then let it dry of its own accord. Leave it for at least 24 hours, or longer if the glue product so advises.

, Carefully pick the cup up by its handle only. Both the cup and the saucer should lift up together. If they do, they're ready for the birds.


Test this over a very soft surface, such as your bed or a pillow; also, only do a very small lift at first. That way, if poorly attached, you can rescue the items and add more glue next time.

, Hang from a pre-arranged hook; you can either use a standalone hook, such as a shepherd's crook style hook or you can use a hanging hook, such as one hung from the porch roof beams.

, The birds will land on the free space on the plate and will peck at the seed inside of the cup. It will spill outward, creating a pleasant effect.

Spray a non-toxic sealant over the Slinky and loop.,
Hang the Slinky bird feeder up.",How to Make a Recycled Bird Feeder5," Do not join it up as a circle just yet though, as the Slinky needs to be added first.

, Now it's time to seal the wire loop at the top, leaving a long piece of wire to turn into a hook at the top. Wind the wire around the joined section several times, to ensure that it is held firmly in place. For the remaining long piece, twist into a hook shape for hanging.

, Take one end of the Slinky and free a length from it. Wind this around the join several times, to hold it firmly in place.

, As with the first join, pill a little length from the other end of the Slinky and wind this around the join. When hanging, the Slinky will now fall evenly around the wire loop, held firmly in place at the wire loop's join point.

, Peanuts are ideal for this design; simply stuff them in until the Slinky can hold no more.


If any parts of the Slinky bulge open too widely and let out too much food, use small gauge wire to attach the Slinky to the wire loop at even points, to prevent the Slinky shape from distorting.

, This is optional, especially if you can't be sure that the sealant is safe, but it will help the Slinky to cope with the elements.


Look for food-safe finishes (FDA approved).

, It's now ready for the birds to hang off it and pull the food out with their beaks.

Avoid overfeeding.,
Clean the dishes you use to feed your lorikeet.,
Store your lorikeet food properly.,
Avoid feeding them seeds.,
Keep your lorikeet away from dangerous plants.",How to Feed a Lory or Lorikeet," Nectar is the main source of food for lorikeets kept in captivity. Without nectar, your lorikeet will not thrive and could possibly die. To serve your lory nectar, simply follow the directions on the product you purchase. Some popular types of products include:

Liquid foods that don't require you to add water.
Dry formulas that must be mixed with water and frozen.;
, Fruits should be a major supplement to your lorikeet’s nectar diet. Serve fruit salad-type meals in a small serving dish in addition to a full serving of nectar. The process of providing your bird fruit should be an active one – try different fruits until you find ones they like. However, make sure they eat several types of fruit instead of just one.

You might find that they like overripe fruit instead of ripe fruit.
Cut fruit into small pieces – no bigger than a half to a quarter inch cube (6 mm to 12 mm).
Offer your bird apple cherries (without pits), pears, apricots, plums, figs, grapes, raspberries, grapefruit, and different types of melon., Serve sliced, shredded, or diced vegetables as a supplement to your lory’s overall diet. Vegetables should not constitute more than a fifth of your bird’s diet. However, vegetables can provide valuable vitamins and nutrients your bird does not get elsewhere.

Like with fruit, serve vegetables in very small pieces.
Consider providing your lory with bok choy, peas, asparagus, corn, cucumber, kale, broccoli, parsnip, or zucchini.
Avoid avocado., Fresh water should be served in a shallow water dish. You should change the water and wash the dish every day. In addition, depending on the size of the dish and your bird, monitor the dish to make sure there is enough water throughout the day., Because of the nature of the lory’s feeding habits, you should provide your bird with food at least twice a day. This will allow your bird to feed for a couple of hours at a time before you remove or replace their food. In addition, providing your bird with food throughout the day will mimic the lory’s foraging habits in the wild.Put food out fresh in the morning and in the late afternoon. In addition, if you can, provide your lorikeet fresh food in the middle of the day.

, Lories will thrive best with fresh food. Because of this, you should change their food every few hours. In addition, because lory food consists of fresh fruits, vegetables, and nectar, it could develop bacteria after a couple of hours. This could wind up making your bird sick. As a result, discard any uneaten lory food after three to four hours., Observe your bird’s eating habits. If you notice that there is a lot of food left after your bird has eaten, you should reduce the amount of food you provide to your bird. In addition, if you notice your bird growing larger, you should consult your vet about reducing the amount of food you provide your lory., Like with your own food, you should wash lory serving dishes after every use. This is because bacteria can quickly grow on uncooked fruits, vegetables, nectar, and pollen. If you don’t clean your serving dishes properly, your lory could become sick., Keep fruits and vegetables in a refrigerator if appropriate. If fruits or vegetables begin to spoil, discard them. In addition, keep nectar or pollen refrigerated or frozen as indicated by the directions on the product. Finally, pay attention to use-by dates, and discard any nectar or pollen products when they are no longer good., While some lorikeets may snack on different seeds from time-to-time, their gizzards are often not powerful enough to crush most seeds. As a result, lorikeets do not depend on seeds as a substantial part of their diet. If you feed them a lot of seeds, they will not be able to get enough nutrition to thrive.As an option, you can provide your lorikeet with soft seeds every so often.

, There are many plants that could hurt or kill your lorikeet. As a result, you need to be diligent about keeping dangerous plants out of your lorikeet’s habitat. Some dangerous plants include:Azalea
Buttercup
Cactus
Cedar
Clover
Mimosa

Recognize the complications.,
Find your cat’s motivator.,
Love your cat.,
Take your time with a kitten.,
Deal with older cats.,
Consider your pet’s prior experience.,
Pay attention to your cat's personality.",How to Discipline Cats1," Cats can be easy or difficult to train. Dogs are more eager to please their owners, which makes them generally easier to train than cats. However, cats can be trained as long as you understand how cats think and interact with their humans. Training a cat takes a lot of patience, especially since it is so hard to motivate him., Every cat has something that will make him learn to listen to you. This key to training is called your cat’s motivator. This generally means the tastiest treat that he absolutely loves and goes crazy over. For some cats, this can be flakes of tuna while for others, a tiny taste of cooked chicken will do the trick.


Whichever treat you use, have it on hand and ready to reward the moment your cat obeys your command.
Never strike a cat if he doesn’t do what you want him to do. He will end up resenting you for it and refuse to listen to you. , The first step to disciplining your cat is first to make him listen to you. This won’t happen unless you develop a warm, loving relationship with your cat. This cannot be stressed enough. It's important to set up a good rapport with your cat from the beginning of your relationship. This will ensure that he respects you, will want to please you, and will listen to your commands.


If you are just acquiring a cat, give him lots of attention. Spend time cuddling with him if he responds to that. If not, try to talk to him and pet him as much as you can, and give him treats once in a while. This may take a few days to a few weeks, depending on how long he takes to warm up to you and his new environment.

, Although it's important to discipline your cat as soon as any bad behavior starts, take the time to consider who you're dealing with. There are some cat specific factors that may affect how your pet reacts to your attempts at discipline. If you have a kitten, you should expect him to be very rambunctious, curious, and inexperienced. It may take longer for a kitten to learn right and wrong, so be patient as he figures it out.


On the other hand, having a kitten can be a benefit. If you're the only owner the kitty has ever had, then you can exert more influence over his actions., If you are just getting a new cat who is older, if you adopt an older cat, or if the cat you have had for a while and need to discipline is older, remember that an older cat may be set in his ways. He may be used to a certain form of discipline and you'll have to work harder to show the cat what is wrong and right.


However, older cats can be more mellow, understanding, and may not be as eager to misbehave., Before you discipline your cat, think about what kind of life your cat had before you got him. If your cat or kitten is coming from a breeder and is used to good treatment, being groomed, and being well-fed, then your cat should not act out from past trauma. If the cat was taken out of an abusive home or spent a long time in the pound, you may have to work a bit harder with your cat.


Remember that adopted or abused cats may be scared and suspicious of new environments and you, depending on his past experiences with other owners., The personalities of cats can be just as diverse and complicated as the personalities of their owners. Ask your self a few questions to understand your cat's personality. What kind of a cat do you have? Would you describe him as squirrelly, eager-to-please, lazy, or loving? Your cat's unique personality can help you decide how to react in certain circumstances.


Easily scared or frightened cats will take a more delicate touch when disciplining. You will need to first work on gaining his trust before attempting discipline.
An aggressive cat will need to be evaluated by an animal behaviorist so you don’t get hurt when attempting to discipline the cat."

Feed the baby bird every 15 to 20 minutes from sunrise to sunset.,
Know what to feed the baby bird.,
Begin to vary the bird's diet as it grows.,
Know which bird breeds require a special diet.,
Don't feed the baby bird bread or milk.,
Use the correct feeding technique.,
Avoid giving the baby bird water.",How to Feed a Baby Bird2," Baby birds have very demanding feeding schedules -- their parents make literally hundreds of feeding trips everyday. In order to replicate this rigorous feeding schedule yourself, you must feed the baby bird every 15 to 20 minutes from sunrise to sunset.


When the baby bird has opened it’s eyes and sprouted some feathers, you can wait 30 to 45 minutes between feedings. After that, you can gradually increase the amount of food per feeding and reduce the number of feeding times accordingly.
Once the baby bird is strong enough to leave the nest and begins hopping around the box, you can feed it about once an hour. You can gradually reduce this time to once every 2 to 3 hours and begin leaving bits of food in the box for the bird to pick at by itself.

, There are a number of differing opinions on the exact type of food a baby bird should be fed, however most experts agree that as long as the baby bird is getting the required nutrients, the exact food isn’t terribly important. Even though different breeds of adult birds follow very different diets -- some eating insects, some eating seeds and berries -- the majority of baby birds have very similar requirements and will need to be given food high in protein.


An excellent starter diet for a recently hatched altricial bird is one made up of 60% puppy or kitten kibble, 20% hard boiled eggs and 20% mealworms (which can be purchased online).The kibble should be moistened with water until it reaches a sponge-like consistency, though it should not be dripping water as the baby bird can drown in the excess fluid. The hard boiled eggs and meal worms should be chopped into pieces small enough for the baby bird to swallow.

, As the baby bird matures and starts hopping around, you can begin to vary its diet somewhat and start giving it the type of food it will eat as an adult.


Insect-eating birds will eat earthworms, grasshoppers and crickets that have been chopped up very small, along with any insects you collect at the bottom of a “bug zapper”.Fruit-eating birds will eat berries, grapes and raisins soaked in water.

, The exceptions to this diet outlined above include birds such as doves and pigeons, parrots, hummingbirds, fish-eating birds, birds of prey and any precocial chicks.


Doves, pigeons and parrot-like birds usually eat a what’s called “pigeon milk”, a substance regurgitated by the mother. To replicate this, you will need to feed these chicks a hand-feeding formula designed for parrots (available at pet supply stores) through a plastic syringe with the needle removed.
Although it's less likely that you'll encounter the other breeds of chicks, their requirements are as follows: Hummingbirds will need a specialized nectar formula, fish-eating birds will need chopped up minnows (available at fish bait stores), birds of prey will eat insects, rodents and smaller chicks, and baby precocial birds will do well on turkey or game bird starter., Many people make the mistake of feeding baby birds milk or bread. Unlike mammals, milk is not a natural part of a bird’s diet and they will be intolerant to it. Bread is full of empty calories and will not provide the baby bird with the nutrients it needs to survive. You should also make sure that any food you give the baby bird is served at room temperature.

, Baby birds need to be fed very carefully. The best instruments to use are a dull tweezers or a plastic forceps. If you don’t have access to either of these, a chopstick narrow enough to fit in the birds mouth will do. To feed, take a small amount of food between the tweezers or forceps or on the edge of the chopstick and drop it into the baby’s mouth.Don’t worry about the food going down the wrong way, as the bird’s glottis will shut automatically as it’s feeding.
If the baby’s mouth is not gaping, tap it’s beak lightly with the feeding instrument or rub the food around the edge of the beak. This signals to the bird that it’s time to feed. If the bird still won’t open its mouth, gently force it open.
Keep feeding until the bird is reluctant to open it’s beak or starts rejecting the food. It is important not to overfeed the chicks.

, Typically, baby birds should not be given water orally, as the fluid is likely to fill their lungs and cause them to drown. They should only be given water when they are old enough to hop around the box. At this point you can place shallow containers (such as jar lids) into the box, which the bird will drink from itself.


You can place a stone or a couple of marbles into the water container so the bird doesn’t stand in it.
If you believe that a baby bird is dehydrated, you will need to bring it to a vet or bird rehabilitator who can inject the bird with fluids.

Make the baby bird a temporary nest.,
Keep the baby bird warm.,
Create a low stress environment for the baby bird.,
Chart the bird’s growth.,
Let the bird learn to fly, then release it.",How to Feed a Baby Bird3," The best way to make a substitute nest for the baby bird is to get a covered cardboard box, such as a shoebox, which you’ll need to punch a number of holes in the bottom of. Place a small plastic or wooden bowl into the box and line it with undyed paper towel. This will make a nice, snuggly nest for the baby bird.


Never line the nest with stringy or shredded bedding as these can wrap around the baby’s wings and throat. You should also avoid using grass, leaves, moss or twigs as these can be damp and easily become mouldy.
You should change the chicks bedding whenever it becomes damp or soiled., If the chicks feel damp or chilled you will need to warm them up as soon as you place them in the box. You can do this in a number of ways. If you have a heating pad, you can set it to a low heat and place the box on top. Alternatively, you can fill a ziplock bag with warm water and place it in the box or hang a 40 watt bulb above the box.


It is very important to maintain the bird’s nest at a regular temperature, so it is probably best to keep a thermometer in the box. If the baby is less than a week old (eyes closed, no feathers) the temperature should be around 95 °F (35 °C). This can be reduced by 5 degrees with every passing week.
It is also important that you keep the box in an area away from direct sunlight and drafts. This is because newly hatched baby birds are very susceptible to chilling and overheating, as they have a large body surface relative to their weight and have not yet developed insulating feathers.

, Baby birds will not thrive unless they are kept in a calm, low-stress environment. When baby birds are stressed, their heart rate rises significantly, which is harmful to their health. As a result, the box should be kept in a quiet environment, inaccessible to pets and children. You should also avoid exposing the baby bird to the following:


Excessive or improper handling, loud noises, incorrect temperatures, overcrowding (if you have more than one chick), disorganized feeding schedules or incorrect food.
You should also try to observe and hold the bird at eye level, as birds do not like to be peered down on. Holding them at eye level makes you seem less predatory.

, You can monitor a baby bird’s progress by weighing it everyday to make sure it is gaining weight. You can use a diet or postage scale for this purpose. The bird’s weight should be increasing everyday and within 4 to 6 days it should have doubled its hatching weight. The bird should continue to rapidly gain weight over the course of its first two weeks.


To get an indication of whether the baby bird is growing normally for its breed, you will need to consult a growth chart.
If the bird is gaining weight very slowly, or not at all, it is a definite indication that something is wrong. In this situation, you should bring the bird to a vet or rehabilitation center immediately, or it is likely to die., Once your baby bird has become a fully developed fledgling, you will need to move it into a large cage or a screened porch where it can spread its wings and learn to fly. Don’t worry about it not knowing how -- a bird’s ability to fly is instinctive, and after a few failed attempts it should be doing just fine. It can take anywhere between 5 to 15 days.


Once it can fly easily and gain altitude, it is ready to be released outdoors. Take it to an area where you have noticed other birds of the same species and there is plenty of food ability and let it fly away.
If you are releasing the bird into your garden, you may leave its cage outside with the door wide open. Then the baby bird can decide for itself when it is ready to leave.
The less time a bird is kept in captivity, the better the chance of survival in the wild, so don’t put off the release date for any longer than strictly necessary."

Select a bottle or saucer-style feeder.,
Make your own hummingbird nectar.,
Fill it halfway full if this is your first feeder.,
Hang it in a shady area near a window.,
Change your nectar every couple of days, depending on the weather.,
Use an ant guard.,
Keep away the bees.,
Clean out the feeder regularly.,
Put more red around your feeder.,
Plant red, orange, and yellow flowers in your garden.,
Place several different feeders in different areas.,
Place a perch on your feeder.",How to Feed Hummingbirds," You want to choose a style that can be disassembled for easy cleaning and one that will hold two to three days' worth of nectar, or about 6 to 12 ounces. In general, the saucer-styles drip less, create less mess, and attract fewer bugs.


Or you could make your own.
Whichever style you choose, just make sure it's red (most are). Red naturally attracts hummingbirds.;
, While you could buy store-bought hummingbird nectar, it's ridiculously easy to make your own and much cheaper – it's just sugar water. And you can make it in bulk if your little birdies go through quite a lot – it'll keep for around a week.Most experts suggest a ratio of 1 part sugar to 4 parts water. You simply bring it to a boil and let the sugar dissolve (see the linked wikiHow guide in the bolded step). However, some sources do suggest adding just a bit more sugar during colder months to give the birds more energy. But not too much – too much more and it gets syrupy and spoils quickly.Do not use anything besides plain sugar (can be toxic for the birds) and do not use red food coloring., If your yard is a first-time hummingbird stop, just start with filling your feeder halfway. Why? Sugar water can spoil and you'll need to change it in a few days anyway. Filling it halfway full creates waste (you could've stored it instead of throwing it down the drain, too).


Once the birds start coming, you'll get a good idea of how much they're eating, how often you need to fill it, and how full you should fill it when you do.
If it's always hot where you live, you may want to fill it halfway full at all times. Hot weather leads to faster spoiling rates.

, Sugar water goes bad quickly in the sunlight, so hang your feeder under a tree in some shade if at all possible. What's more, this is respite for the birds – give them a cool, relaxing spot to take a drink and they'll surely come back.


Late spring is the general time hummingbirds start migrating and you'll see them through your area. That being said, some experts suggest setting out your feeder a couple of weeks early for the first-arrivers. Aim to set your feeder out sometime around late March., Once you fill your feeder, keep an eye on it. You'll obviously need to refill it if it's empty, but you'll also need to change out the nectar if it gets cloudy, has black spots, or white strings. These three are all signs that it's gone bad, and your birds will not come back to a feeder that isn't safe or tasty. When will it go bad? That depends on the weather:


Temperature: 71-75 (21.5-24°C); change every 6 days
Temperature: 76-80 (24-26.5°C); change every 5 days
Temperature: 81-84 (26.5-29°C); change every 4 days
Temperature: 85-88 (29-31°C); change every 3 days
Temperature: 89-92 (31-33°C); change every 2 days
Temperature: 93+ (33°C+); change daily

, Hummingbirds will not come to a feeder that is covered in ants or that has dead ants swimming in the saucer. To prevent ants from spoiling all your efforts, use an ant guard – it's a little tray that's full of water (a moat, really) that you attract the the cord on top of your feeder. The ants can't pass the water without drowning.


Some feeders come with this while others do not. In certain home and gardening stores (or online) you can purchase an ant guard individually.
Some people suggest putting putting petroleum jelly on top of the feeder to create a sticky goo the ants get through. This may work, but in hot weather, you run the risk of the jelly melting and getting into the birds' food., Bees are another unwanted animal that you'll have to keep away from your feeder – they'll even be territorial with the birds. They're harder to get away than ants. In general, there are three things you can do:


Keep the feeder clean at all times. Residue from splashing and dripping will attract the bees.
Place a saucer of sugar water (a 1:1 ratio, much stronger) elsewhere in your yard.
Buy a feeder that has tubes. Only the hummingbirds will be able to get into the tubes to the sugar water and the bees won't sense the delicacy.

, In general, you want to clean out your feeder every time you go to refill it (hence why an easy-to-clean feeder is important). Use a scrub brush and mild soap and water and just take a minute to get it fresh. And get the soap off too – you don't want soap ruining the birds' dinner.


This is especially important if the sugar water has gone bad – again, if there are white strings, black spots, or if it's cloudy. If you don't clean it well, your next batch will spoil faster.

, Hummingbirds love, love, love the color red. You might say it even hypnotizes them a bit. If you're not getting any birds in your area, put more red up in your garden. Tie a ribbon around your feeder or even put red tape near the area. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be red.


Red paint and even red nail polish to touch up certain pieces in your garden can go a long ways, too.

, Another way to get hummingbirds to your garden is to plant a garden full of brightly-colored flowers. The more eye-catching your garden, the better. Here are some flowers you can plant:Geraniums
Fuchsia
Trumpet vines
Columbine
Petunias

, Hummingbirds tend to be very territorial. If you only have one feeder, you may find that one alpha hummingbird drives away the smaller birds from the nectar. To get around this, invest in a few different feeders and put them in different areas of your yard.


If they're out of sight, that's even better. Have one in your front and back yards if possible, or at least in faraway trees.

, If you're looking for a rare sight, buy a perch for your feeder or construct one. You'll see your speedy little birds actually stop for a rest – a gem of a sight.


If you can't find a feeder with a perch, try making your own. Get your camera ready!

Hang your bird feeder from a pole or post.,
Buy a baffle from a yard supply store.,
Make your own baffle.",How to Deter Squirrels from Bird Feeders1," Try to make sure the post is away from areas the squirrels could access it from above, like long tree branches or fence edges. Give a clearance of about 8-10 feet from these things.The baffle will go on the bottom half of the post, to keep squirrels from accessing the feeders from the ground. So, making sure they don’t have access from the top is important if you want the baffle to work.
Bowl-shaped baffles can go on top of the feeder pole to keep out squirrels, but these baffles don’t do so well keeping out other critters, like raccoons. If raccoons aren’t a problem where you live, then a bowl-shaped baffle will probably work fine.;
, You can purchase pre-made baffles from hardware or yard supply stores, and even some of the big box department stores. You can also buy them online.


Make sure you buy the type of baffle you want—a cone or dome-shaped baffle to go over top of the feeder, or a cylindrical baffle to attach below the feeder on the post.

, With stovepipe, a stovepipe cap, metal screws, and a hose clamp, you can make your own cylindrical baffle for your feeder pole. Simply drill a hole big enough for the feeder pole in the stovepipe end cap, screw the end cap into the stovepipe to secure it, slide the stovepipe onto the pole and clip the hose clamp below it. Let the stovepipe rest on the clamp.You’ll need a drill to make your own baffle, so if you don’t have any power tools, your best option is to buy a pre-made baffle.

Provide outlets for his needs.,
Reward good behavior.,
Play with your cat.",How to Discipline Cats2," To keep a cat from getting into trouble, provide your cat with means and ways to express his natural cat behavior. Cats love to run, bite, scratch, and explore by nature, so it's important to give your cat friendly options to play with so he has an outlet for his needs. This can also prevent many disciplinary issues that will arise because he will be more content overall. There are many ways you can help your cat express his inner feline needs.


Provide a scratching post for your cat. Make sure to have one or multiple scratching posts around the house so your cat can scratch those. This will prevent him from scratching your furniture, the walls, or other objects he shouldn't.
Have toys for your cat to chew and bite. Chew toys, little balls, and stuffed mice can help your cat use his inner instincts without biting or harming you in the process. This can also deter him from eating other objects that you don't want him to chew on.
Create a kitty space or playground inn your house that he can use all day long. Cats love to jump, climb, and explore, so get a cat jungle gym or establish a corner of your house that is cat friendly so he can run around without ruining your property.

, It's important to let your cat know when he does something good. This will help him learn that this behavior should be repeated. Good behaviors can range from using the litter box properly, eating and drinking his food appropriately, using his scratching post instead of the furniture, and playing with his toys instead of your belongings. It's also important to be consistent. Reward your kitty for positive behavior as often as you can so he knows he's on the right track. Treats are common ways to reward your cat. Don't overdo it, however, because it can cause your cat to gain weight.


You can also reward your cat by giving him attention. Speaking to your cat in a soothing voice, petting him, or letting him cuddle with you can help let him know that you appreciate what he's doing.

, A way to help your cat act appropriately and also as a way to reward him is to play with him. When both of you are around the house, bring out an interactive cat toy that he needs you to play with. For example, many cats love dangling toys, such as sticks with feathers or shiny objects at the bottom. Take some time to play with the dangling toy whenever you can. Your cat will get some great exercise and will feel loved.


An option for the lazier owner is the laser pointer. Some cats go absolutely crazy for the laser pointer and you can move it all over one room from the comforts of your own couch. Some people protest that the laser pointer is cruel because the cat never gets to catch the red dot, while others would argue that it's more about the chase.

Use a special tone of voice.,
Remove your cat from the situation.,
Use the water aversion method.,
Set booby-traps.,
Be firm and consistent.",How to Discipline Cats3," There are times when your cat will behave in a way that needs disciplining. Just as it's crucial to let your cat know he's doing something right, it's equally important to show him what not to do. It's important to be consistent, so your cat recognizes his actions as bad behavior every time. Use a special tone of voice when your cat acts badly. There's no need to shout or yell because this may scare your cat too much. Instead, establish a harsh tone that lets your cat know he has done you wrong. He'll recognize it every time he acts badly.


For effect, add his name to your complaint, such as saying ""Bad Spike!"" in a particularly harsh, even tone. This will help your cat recognize that he has erred, the downside of this method however, is that your cat may associate his name with bad behaviour. , There are two ways that you can remove your cat from a situation where he is misbehaving. You can isolate your kitty. If your cat is prone to eating your dinner, for example, you can exile him to your bedroom during dinner time. Though his meowing by the door may break your heart, it'll teach him not to repeat his mistakes.


You can also remove him from the room after grabbing scruff of his neck. If your cat is being feisty with you and biting or scratching, you can grab him by the scruff of the neck and say “no.” If he keeps being bad, pick him up and take him to a different room, still saying no.
Never pick a cat up by the scruff. It may hurt your cat and he may be able to hurt you by scratching you. Be aware that cat bites can quickly turn into a dangerous infection., To get your cat to stop doing a particular action, use a well-timed squirt of water from a water bottle to deter unwanted behaviors. This can include behaviors like jumping on counters or biting plant leaves. This should be done stealthily so the cat does not know that the squirt came from you. Try squirting the cat when he isn't looking at you or his back is turned from you. Otherwise, the cat will associate you with the water and be wary or fearful of you after an ill-timed squirt.


Some people think aversion therapy does not work on cats, but it can be effective, depending on your cat., You can set traps for your cat to prevent him from indulging in bad behavior. For example, if your cat is prone to attacking your toilet paper roll, place an empty water bottle on top of the roll, so it will fall and scare him if he tries to play with the roll. If your cat is prone to jumping on the kitchen table, set up double-sided tape or tinfoil over the surface, so he associates it with an unpleasant sensation. These physical scares may give him the discipline he needs.There are even scat mats which can be purchased, which send a gentle electrical tingle through the cat’s feet when they are stepped on.

, No matter what punishment you give your cat, it's important to be firm. Though you may have the cutest cat in the world, it's important to show him that you're serious about his bad behavior. You also need to be consistent. Each time the cat does something that is not acceptable, you need to quickly react so he associated the bad behavior with the punishment. If you leave the punishment for later, he won't know why he is getting punished and may become afraid of you.

It's best to use a clicker specifically designed for training. If you don't have one, though, make a distinct clicking noise with your mouth, or you can use a pen that makes a clicking sound.
If your cat is deaf, you can use a pen light to achieve the same results.;
, In order for the training to work, you need to give your cat a reward. A common reward is a special treat of some sort (e.g., tuna or deli turkey), and it should be something that can be given instantly to reward behavior. If the treat is food, it should be cut up into pea-sized chunks.Some cats might respond well to affection or a toy.

, Use a stick-like object, such as a pen or a spoon. This item should be easily recognizable and used only for training. Your cat will eventually follow this object as a target, so you don't want your cat jumping up to the dinner table to follow her training spoon.


You can make a target stick by putting a Ping-Pong ball on the end of a pencil or chopstick.Don't use the treat as the target. This will teach your cat to do tricks only when there is a treat involved. Eventually you'll want to be able to get your cats to do tricks without treats (though you should still reward with treats sporadically).

, Set aside about 5 minutes for each training session, and hold these sessions a few times a day. Wait until your cat is active and hungry (it should be at least 20-30 minutes until mealtime). He will be more interested in the treat and will respond better to the training.

, Start your training in a location that will be quiet and without distractions.If you have other pets around, try putting them outside or in a separate room while you work on training your cat.

, Get down at your cat’s level to engage with him while you start the process of clicker training him. This will make it easier for you to respond immediately to your cat’s correct behavior by clicking and giving him a treat.

, Toss over a treat for your cat while making the clicking noise at the same time. This will begin an association in the cat’s mind that a clicking sound will mean a treat will appear.Don't click at any other time. You want the cat to associate the click with the treat, so don’t click while the cat is eating, looking at you, or walking away. Only click when you give the treat.

, Wait until your cat is finished eating the treat and looks at you before you start again. Make the clicking sound and toss over a treat again. Let your cat finish the treat before starting again. Try this process several times. Stop after 5 minutes and give your cat a break.


If the cat completely loses interest, the reward isn't strong enough. Find a better reward.

, Continue to associate the clicking sound with the reward, but use your cat’s attention to the treat to start building some stronger associations. The cat will still want the treat but will have to work harder for it (here, your cat will just take a few steps, but soon, your cat will need to perform for the treat).

, Don't talk to the cat or use any kind of verbal cues during this first stage. You want the clicker noise to be the clearest signal here.


The click noise is also much easier for an animal to identify than a verbal cue, such as saying, “Good kitty.” Your timing might not be as exact, and the cat might pick up on your tone differently every time. A click is quick and consistent.

, In the beginning, every time you start a new training session, reinforce the click/treat relationship by clicking the clicker and giving your cat a treat. This will remind your cat of this association.

, Bring your target item over to your cat. Be prepared to click as soon as the cat makes any movement towards the target or shows interest in it. He might look at it, lean toward it, approach it, or sniff it, for example. Click at the same time as his sniff or other movement, and give him a treat.


Hide the target in between each click, so that your cat only sees it when you’re ready to reward it appropriately.
The click lets the cat know the exact moment at which it did something right. In this case, the correct action is moving toward the target. Using the clicker as a signal for the reward will make sure your cat doesn’t get confused. If you toss the cat a treat when he looks at the target, he will immediately get distracted and focus on the treat. Instead, the clicker tells the cat that the treat is coming, and the cat has a little more time to figure out what it did to get the treat.

, Once he’s finished his treat, bring up the target again and click when he makes any movement towards it. Immediately give him a treat. He will start to associate the target with the treat, and will try different movements to get that treat.If the cat is only looking at the target, move the target closer to its face. Most cats will lean in to sniff it. As soon as the cat does this, click and then reward.

, After the cat has associated a click (and treat) with the target, push him a little to perform more. Wait for the cat to brush his face on the target, for example, before clicking and giving him the treat., Now you can start to move the target so that your cat will also move. Encourage your cat to take a step toward the target. Once the cat is reliably looking at target every time you introduce it, try to get the cat to take a step in its direction. As soon as it takes that step, click and reward.Try moving the target over to the side. When your cat follows the target, click and give a reward. Taking an incremental approach will be productive, because cats won’t complete the entire action you want the first time. Give rewards when your cat makes partial movements in the right direction. As you keep training, you reward him for getting closer and closer to the complete action.

, Try 5 minute sessions at most. If you notice your cat losing interest and starting to clean himself after 10-15 clicks, end the training session. Eventually you'll probably be able to get your cat to walk across the room to the target.

, While the clicker noise is good for letting the cat know what it's doing right, verbal cues can be used once the cat has already learned a few tricks, to help it understand which trick you want it to do. The verbal cue must be distinct and clear. It should be a word you won't use with other pets, or a word that is used too much in everyday conversation.


Choose a logical word to make your cat do something. You might use “Jump!” for when your cat jumps onto something. You might use “Come!” for when your cat walks toward you.

, Sit on the floor and hold out the target. If your cat will respond to the target by walking toward it, try holding it in front of you and say, “Come!” at the same time. When your cat moves towards the target (and you), click and give a reward.


Try this several times in different locations in your house. Make sure you click and reward each time.If your cat is just not getting it, or if he seems confused, revert back to your previous training. End the session on a good note and try again later.
Remember to only try these sessions for about 5 minutes at a time.

, Hold a treat above his head in your closed hand. As he sees it, move your hand back further. Most cats will naturally sit down so their head can still follow the treat. As soon as your cat sits down (or even as he starts to sit down), click the clicker, say “Sit,” and give him the treat.Repeat this several times a day.

, The verbal cue signals that when your cat performs a particular behavior, he will receive a reward. If your cat does this something on his own, just don't reward him. Don't click and don't give a treat. At this stage of the training, ignore any behavior that he does without a verbal cue. This is so your cat will associate the verbal cue with the click and reward., As you continue to train your cat, he will learn more commands and will recognize different verbal cues for different tricks. At some point, you'll find you don't need the clicker or the treats anymore.

Avoid using feed that attracts squirrels.,
Use a bird seed mix that contains white proso millet seed.,
Give the squirrels their own feed and feeding area.",How to Deter Squirrels from Bird Feeders2," Safflower seeds and thistle seeds, for example, will attract all different kinds of birds, while squirrels are not interested in them. Squirrels love feed such as cracked corn, nuts, and sunflower seeds, so keep these out of your feeders to help deter the squirrels.Try to avoid using capsaicin, or hot pepper additive, in your bird seed. It has been known to irritate squirrels’ digestive systems to the point of being painful and harmful, so it isn’t as humane of an option as others.

, If there is enough of this kind of seed in the mix, it will deter the squirrels, as they aren’t fans of it. It helps attract species of birds like house finches, as well as mourning doves.Changing what you’re feeding the birds is a great way to keep the squirrels out without doing harm to one species or the other.

, Since they’re relatively territorial, the squirrels will likely mark the new feeding spot as theirs, and begin to feed there exclusively. This might not be the most ideal solution as you will still have squirrels in the yard, but they might leave the bird feeder alone.If you have a front and a back yard, put one feeder in each yard. This will keep the birds and squirrels more separate.

"
"
Try hanging candy canes from your bird feeder.,
Avoid catching or trapping the squirrels.,
Avoid using anything to make your feeder pole more slick.,
Use a feeder that doesn’t allow squirrels to feed.",How to Deter Squirrels from Bird Feeders3," The peppermint doesn’t bother the birds, so they will keep coming. The squirrels, on the other hand, will be confused by the smell and sight of the candy, so they’ll lose interest in the feed and leave.Make sure you use full size candy canes, and don’t crush them into small pieces. You don’t want to risk giving the birds—or any other critters—anything they might choke on.

, By trapping and moving them to a different place, your problem won’t be solved. All this will do is cause squirrels to take up residence in a new place, while other squirrels still bother your feeder.You also run the risk of injuring the squirrels, or even other animals, by setting out traps for them.

, Things like oil or gel to keep squirrels from being able to climb the feeder pole are dangerous for the birds you are trying to attract and feed. A little bit of gel or anything with petroleum in it on a bird’s feathers can actually cause the bird to die.Using a baffle is a much safer and humane way to keep squirrels from climbing up your feeder pole.

, Some feeders are made specifically to keep squirrels out. They usually rely on the principle that squirrels weigh more than birds, and won’t be able to perch on the feeder.You can also put a mesh cage around the feeder. Birds can still get the seed out but the squirrels won’t be able to reach it.

Understand the most common behavioral problems in cats.,
Bring your cat to the vet for a checkup to rule out any medical issues.,
Recognize any environmental causes for your cat’s bad behavior.,
Avoid physically or verbally punishing your cat.,
Use remote correction.,
Ignore your cat when he acts out during a play session.,
Practice good litter box hygiene.,
Provide scratching posts and daily play sessions.,
Use cat pheromones to reduce stress in the home.",How to Train a Cat to Stop Doing Almost Anything," Though every cat is unique and may have specific issues or specific bad behaviors, most cats act out in seven ways:Avoiding the litter box or refusing to use the litter box.
Marking furniture and other objects with their urine.
Scratching furniture and other objects in your home. Your cat may also scratch you or others when play fighting.
Acting aggressive towards other people or towards their owner.
Acting aggressive towards other cats in the home.
Displaying stress or anxiety.
Acting fearful of objects or people.;
, Sometimes cats will respond act out or display behavioral issues because they are struggling with a medical issue. For example, your cat may refuse to use his litter box due to a urinary tract infection, or he may act aggressive towards you because he is experiencing physical pain that is not immediately apparent to you. Some cats become fearful of people or objects due to vision issues and over groom themselves due to hyperthyroidism.Taking your cat to the vet for a checkup will help identify any medical problems that could be causing your cat’s bad behavior and treat it promptly so it does not get worse. If your vet gives your cat a clean bill of health, you can focus on issues in your cat’s environment that may be causing his bad behavior.

, Once your cat is cleared of any medical issues, you can consider why your cat might be displaying one or several of these bad behaviors. Look at his environment for any triggers of bad behavior, including:A dirty or poorly kept litter box, which can lead to litter box avoidance.
Another cat who is bullying your cat in the home, leading to litter box avoidance and aggression.
A new cat in the home, which can cause your cat to urine mark. A new dog in the home can also cause your cat to act fearful or aggressive.
A lack of scratching posts, which can lead to your cat scratching furniture and other objects in the home.

, Physically or verbally reprimanding your cat is one of the least successful ways to correct your cat’s bad behavior. In fact, hitting your cat or yelling at him can lead your cat to act more fearful around you, be less willing to play with other people, and display more aggressive scratching and biting. Your cat will likely continue to act out when you are out of sight as he knows he can perform the behavior without punishment if you cannot see him.Physical or verbal punishment are generally ineffective, short term solutions to your cat’s issues and will not stop your cat from acting out. Instead, it will create a more stressful environment for you and for your cat. Though it can be hard not to yell or hit your cat when they do something bad, like urine mark your furniture or go to the bathroom on the carpet instead of the litter box, it’s important that you take a deep breath as an owner and try to use a more effective correcting technique.

, This technique connects an unpleasant texture, smell, taste, or sound with a certain bad behavior to deter your cat from doing them. You can use home supplies to do remote correction, for example:Texture: You can put sticky paper, aluminum foil, or heavy plastic carpet runners on areas that you would like your cat to avoid. Cats generally dislike walking on any of these textures.
Smell: You can use smells cats tend to dislike in areas you do not want your cat to access. For example, placing cloth or cotton balls soaked in citronella, perfume, air freshener, citrus, aloe, eucalyptus oil, and oil of wintergreen on objects or surfaces.
Taste: You can rub certain foods on surfaces that your cat likes to chew on or scratch, such as bitter apple, citrus products, hot sauces, cayenne pepper, or aloe gel. Over time, your cat will associate the bad taste with the object or surface and avoid it.
Sound: Using noises that startle your cat can deter him from doing a behavior or going on a surface. This could be blowing a whistle, ringing a bell, or shaking a can with some coins inside. Try to use the sound, instead of your voice, to startle him just as he is about to do something you consider bad behavior and he will come to associate the behavior with a negative sound.

, If you notice your cat engaging in rough or aggressive play during a play session, you can try to correct this behavior by withdrawing your attentions from him.Do this by walking to another room and closing the door. Wait until he calms down before you touch him or address him. This will show him that his bad behavior is upsetting during playtime, and discourage him from acting out again.

, If your cat is displaying litter box avoidance, it’s important that you practice good litter box hygiene to encourage him to use the litter box. This means scooping and changing the litter every day, cleaning the litter box once a week, and making sure the litter box is appealing to your cat. Most cats do not like litter boxes with hoods or liner, as it can be uncomfortable for them, so avoid using a litter box with a hood or a liner.If there are multiple cats in your household, there should be a litter box for each cat, plus an extra litter box. Try to spread out the litter boxes so each cat has enough room and privacy to do their business. Look for a quiet area in the home where your cat can still look around and see if anyone is coming up behind her.
Make sure the litter box is big enough for your cat to sit in comfortably and have one to two inches of litter in the box. Cats dislike litter boxes that are too deep with litter.

, Most cats act out due to boredom or under stimulation, so it is important that you commit to daily play sessions with your cat. Use a toy, or several toys, when playing with your cat to deter him from playing rough with your hands or arms. Focus his attention on the toys during the play sessions and switch up the toys each week so he does not get bored.Scratching posts are also good for deterring your cat from scratching furniture or other fabric objects. Place scratching posts in communal areas of your home or your cat’s favorite spots.

, If your cat is urine marking or urine spraying, it can help to use a synthetic cat pheromone in the home. It can reduce stress and prevent your cat from urine marking if he is feeling anxious or fearful.This pheromone is usually delivered through a diffuser or a spray and can be found at your local pet store.

Take your cat’s measurements.,
Choose a harness.,
Choose a leash.,
Put your cat in its harness for short periods of time.,
Attach the leash.,
Practice walking with the harness and leash.,
Start slowly.,
Help your cat venture outdoors.,
Take your cat out regularly.",How to Leash Train a Cat," In order to go walking outdoors with you, your cat will need a well-fitted harness--never use a leash and collar.If you’re walking your cat with a collar and the cat bolts--which cats are very likely to do--the collar can damage the cat’s windpipe, voice box, and ability to swallow. A harness will distribute the force of restraint between the cat’s shoulders, chest, and belly, making it less likely your cat will get injured.


To get your cat’s harness measurements, measure around the girth around your cat’s chest, just behind the front legs and note it down. Bring the measurement with you when you go to buy the harness.;
, Most cat harnesses are made with adjustable straps designed to fit either kittens or adult cats and are made of either nylon or neoprene. Some harnesses may come in sub-sizes based on your cat’s specific measurements.


The harness should be fitted to your cat’s body and should neither squeeze or cut into your cat or hang loosely off its body. If it’s fitted properly, you should just be able to fit two fingers under the harness when you put it on your cat.
Never use a harness as a restraint for car rides--cat harnesses aren’t designed to protect cats in the event of a car accident.

, Cats have different leash needs than dogs, so choose an appropriate leash carefully.


Some manufacturers make lighter-weight leashes designed specifically for cats, as cats are generally lighter and less forceful than dogs.
Bungee leashes are ideal for cats because they provide enough stretch to let your cat safely wander a bit.
Avoid using retractable leashes (commonly sold for dogs) with a cat, as the leash is ill-suited to and can injure a cat.

, Before you’ll be able to take your cat outside, you’ll first need to get it accustomed to wearing its harness.


Start by putting your cat in its harness for short periods of time every day for several days. Initially, put the harness on for just a few minutes, then increase the length of time each day for several days.Give your cat treats and lots of praise while putting on the harness and while your cat walks around wearing the harness.You want your cat to eventually feel comfortable moving around the house in its harness, ideally to the point that it doesn’t pay any mind to the harness., Once your cat has become comfortable with its harness, begin attaching the leash to the harness.


At first, allow the leash to trail behind your cat. Encourage the cat to walk around with the leash attached by offering treats and lots of praise.

, Once your cat has become comfortable having the leash trail behind it, pick up the leash and again encourage your cat to walk around--this time with you holding the leash.


Offer your cat its favorite treats and lots of praise as it begins to walk around. Try not to yank or drag the cat along as you go--let the cat move about of its own volition.

, Don’t force your cat to go outdoors. The prospect of going outside can be quite intimidating to some cats, so if your cat is reluctant to follow you out, don’t insist.If your cat is unsure about going out, just leave the door open so it can get its bearings and take its time. If your cat doesn’t want to venture out, try again another day and be patient--it may take time.

, Once your cat is ready to make its way outside, follow behind and offer encouragement with treats and praise.Keep the trip short--about five minutes. Any longer and your cat may become overwhelmed and be less willing to go outside again in the future.Wait for a dry day to go outside. If it’s raining or has recently rained, many of the normal scents your cat would use to navigate will have been washed away and your cat may have difficulty getting its bearings.

, Gradually increase the length of time you allow your cat to stay outside and make outside trips part of your cat’s regular routine.


As your cat becomes more comfortable outside, allow it to wander farther from you if it chooses. Follow at the distance that the leash allows.

Change routines slowly.,
Observe your cat’s behavior.,
Avoid too many changes in routine.,
Use a gradual approach with new cats.,
Let your cat get accustomed to a new baby on their own time.,
Transition your outdoor cat to the indoors.,
Recognize that shifts in routine can damage your cat’s health.",How to Change Your Cat's Routine1," Instead of expecting your cat to adjust quickly to new circumstances, it is best to find ways of slowing down the changes in routine. For instance, if you want your cat to get used to a new cat food, you should gradually add a bit more of the new cat food into the old cat food every day. For any new routine, you should make slight, gradual adjustments instead of abrupt changes.If you are starting a new mealtime, change their current mealtime by fifteen minutes every few days until you get to the new mealtime.
If you want your cat to sleep at night, it is important to change their exercise routine during the day. Start playing with them for gradually longer periods during the day. Start with a new play period of ten minutes and gradually build it up until they are getting at least one hour of playtime during the day.;
, See how your cat responds to changes in their routine such as a new playtime, new diet or new people in the house. If they seem anxious or stressed out, try to comfort them and determine why they are having trouble. Consider any changes in their routine or the household routine, as well as how you could make those changes easier on your cat., Cats love the security of a daily routine, so it is best to avoid changing their routine too frequently. It is also best not to change too many things at once.If you have to move to a new city, for instance, avoid changing their diet at the same time.
If you are trying to get them to sleep at night, avoid changing their diet at the same time as their sleep routine.

, If you have a new cat in your home, keep them separate from your old cat for the first day or two. Swap bedding or toys between your cats so they can get to know one another through smell. Once they have smelled one another, you can introduce them directly. Let them sniff each other out in a common and neutral area of the house, such as a living room., Your cat may take some time to get used to the new baby. You can make the change easier by introducing your cat to the smell of the baby with some clothing or a baby blanket, prior to bringing the baby home from the hospital. You can also try pheromone scent products to calm your cat. Eventually, your cat will get used to the new family member., If you need to change your outdoor cat's routines to fit with a new indoor environment, you need to consider potty training as well as playtime. If your cat was potty trained but is used to going to the bathroom outdoors, you could place the kitty litter beside the door. When they want to go outside to go to the bathroom, they will use the kitty litter instead. You should also make a stimulating indoor environment, including interactive toys and perches where your cat can watch the backyard environment.When you leave the house, make sure your cat is a good distance from the doorways since they will want to escape.
If your cat was not potty trained, you will need to start from scratch.

, Cats thrive on routine and typically do not respond very well when it changes, especially if the changes are abrupt. There is some evidence that too frequent changes in routine can negatively impact the health of cats."

Learn the benefits of calling your cat.,
Select a reward.,
Decide what verbal cue you will use to call your cat.,
Choose when you are going to call your cat.,
Call your cat.,
Increase the challenge of calling your cat.",How to Call a Cat," There are several benefits to having your cat come to you when you call her. For example, you can call her when it’s playtime or mealtime.You can also call your cat if you are unable to locate her in your home.In addition, when your cat knows how to come to you when you call her, you will have the reassurance that she is safely accounted for if you have to leave the house.If your cat is indoor/outdoor, it will be helpful to call her to come back inside.Calling your cat is also beneficial when it is time to leave the house for her veterinary appointment.Your cat may not view a trip to the veterinarian as a pleasant experience, so you may need to allow some extra time to get her come to you when it’s time to leave for her appointment.
Because cats are naturally intelligent, teaching your cat to come to you when she is called is a great mental exercise for her.;
, Although positive reinforcement (verbal praise, petting) is an important component of successful training, the key to training your cat to respond to your call is an enticing reward.The most enticing reward for her will probably be food that she thinks is delicious, such as tuna, shredded chicken, or sardines.You can also purchase cat treats at your local pet store.Keep multiple treats on hand. When you reward her, you can vary which food you reward her with so that she does not come to expect the same reward each time.Catnip is not a good reward. Your cat’s desire for catnip would likely diminish if she receives it more than once a week, so it would be best to select a food treat that will consistently entice her.Whichever food reward you choose, use it only when you call her. It is preferable for your cat to associate that tasty reward with responding to your call and no other commands or verbal cues.Playtime can also be an enticing reward., You can use any verbal cue that you would like.One common verbal cue that cat owners will use is “Here, kitty kitty.” You can also use the words “come” or “treats.”The verbal cue should not be something that you already use, such as her name.You can also use various tones of voice. Cats typically respond to a high-pitched tone of voice, since their prey usually makes high-pitched sounds in the wild.If you are not the only person in the house who would be calling your cat, make sure that everyone uses the same verbal cue and tone to call her.If your cat is deaf or hard of hearing, you will need to use some different methods to get her attention, such as visual cues– flicking a light on and off or using a laser pointer (available at your local pet store). Deaf or hearing-impaired cats also respond to vibrations in the floor, so you can thump or stomp of the floor to call your cat., A convenient time to practice calling your cat is around feeding time. Your cat will likely already be hungry, which may make the training process easier and faster.In addition, she will already be used to going to the kitchen (or wherever you keep her food bowl), so you will not be calling her to a room that is unfamiliar to her when you begin training her.


Another benefit to calling her at her regular feeding time is that she will already know what time to get her food.This will make the initial training easier because you will not be doing something that is completely unfamiliar to her.
If you choose to reward with her extra play, then you can practice calling her when it’s getting close to her scheduled playtime.If the kitchen and her play areas have a lot of distractions, consider calling your cat in a quiet room that doesn’t have any distractions that could keep her from coming to you., When you are in the room where you want her to come to you, say your verbal cue in a high-pitched voice. If you are calling her when it’s time for her to eat, make sure that you say the verbal cue before you open a can of food or rip open a bag of food. You want to ensure that your cat comes because she heard your verbal cue, not because of the noises of food preparation.Reward her immediately when she comes to you, whether that is with the tasty treat or extra playtime.Extra positive reinforcement through petting and verbal praise will also be helpful.
Even if you are calling her at mealtime, it is still important to give her the tasty treat as a reward, rather than just feeding her the regular food.
If you are calling her around playtime, say the verbal cue without shaking a toy that makes noise.
It may take her a week or so before she starts to consistently come to you when you call her., Once your cat consistently comes to her play or feeding areas when you call her, take the difficulty up a notch. For example, if someone else lives with you, you can practice calling her back and forth between you and other person. For this challenge, each person should reward her when she correctly responds to the call.If your cat is indoor/outdoor, you can also practice calling her back inside when she is outside.This would be more practical when she is a relatively close distance to the house where she could hear you.
Practice calling her from each of the rooms in your house. Eventually, she will learn how to come to you from wherever she is in your house."

Differentiate between a stray cat and a feral cat.,
Take safety precautions.,
Begin befriending the cat.,
Offer the cat food.,
Continue putting little bits of tuna closer and closer to you.,
Show the cat some affection.",How to Befriend a Wild Cat or Kitten1," A stray cat is someone’s former cat that no longer has a home; a feral cat was born in the wild and is a cat that is wary of humans and generally isn't adoptable due to not being adapted to humans.You may have success at befriending a stray cat; a feral cat probably not although it may become acclimated to your presence.
Whether you have a stray or a feral cat around your home, capturing (or trapping) the cat and bringing it to the veterinarian for vaccinations and to be spayed or neutered is an excellent civic duty. Feral cats that are “fixed” can be released back where you found them.You’ll have the satisfaction of knowing they won’t be able to reproduce and contribute to the feral cat population.;
, Wild cats can be unpredictable so you will need to practice some safety precautions as you are trying to befriend it. Cat bites usually become infected, some very seriously, so you will need to wear long sleeves and pants when trying to befriend the cat.


Another concern is rabies in a cat of unknown vaccination status. Use caution and common sense. If the cat starts to hiss or growl, looks sick (runny nose or eyes, scabs, sneezes/coughs, breathes heavily), or acts bizarrely don’t try to befriend it. Call animal control and retreat to your home.

, If the cat appears healthy and isn’t acting defensive and mean towards you, you can try befriending it. Find a place where the cat usually stays, and wait nearby until the cat reaches its spot.


Sit down or lie down, if you can, or at least crouch. The cat will find you much less intimidating that way. Stay there for a while. Teach the cat you won't hurt it.
This should be a fair distance away, 10 feet or so, so you don’t intimidate the cat.

, Try leaving out some smelly cat food (wet) or even a can of tuna to attract the cat while you are waiting for it to arrive. You want to get the cat to associate you with something good, namely a free lunch.


You only need to leave out smelly food the first day. After this leave out a little dry kibble to keep the cat coming back for more.

, Each day the cat comes to eat, move your spot another foot closer. If you hold the cat food in your hand for a while, your scent will be on it, too. This won't discourage the cat from eating it, but it may cause the cat to associate you with food, which is good in general. Put out your hand to let the cat sniff it.


If the cat starts hissing, or its ears go back, etc., you're too close. Pull your hand back slightly and slowly.

, Eventually the cat should get close to you then put out your hand let the cat sniff your hand. Continue feeding the cat, and sitting nearby quietly, and eventually you should earn its trust to the point it will come up to you for food and gentle pats. Don't expect this to happen right away. Don't expect them to even eat any of the tuna right away.

Be gentle when grooming the cat.,
Consider bathing your cat regularly.,
Trim the cat's nails.,
Inspect and clean the cat's ears.,
Give the cat proper dental care.",How to Care for a Devon Rex1," The Devon rex has delicate fur that needs to be treated gently when grooming. Whether using a metal comb made specifically for grooming cats or a soft brush, you need to be gentle on the cat's coat and skin. The cat's fur can be damaged and break if you are rough when brushing or combing it.If you are taking your Devon rex to a groomer, make sure that they know to treat your cat delicately. Groomers that have not worked on this type of cat before may not know.;
, The Devon rex has a thin coat that allows the cat's skin to get greasy, especially in folds of skin. If your cat is getting greasy, give it a bath. Fill your bathtub with a few inches of warm water, place the cat in it, and clean the cat with a mild soap made for cats. This should only need to be done every few weeks.After the bath, the cat can simply be towel dried and then allowed to finish drying on its own.

, Like with all cats, it's important to trim the Devon rex's nails on a regular basis. You can use a pair of pet nail trimmers or human nail trimmers. Hold the cat's paw in one hand and the clippers in your other. Make sure to only trim the very tip of the nail so that you can avoid cutting the quick, the vein inside the nail.The more often you trim your cat's nails, the more comfortable with the procedure the cat will get. You will have to trim very little nail each time.
Keep styptic powder on hand in case you cut the quick. If you cut the quick, place a little pressure on the tip of the nail and place a small amount of styptic powder on the tip. Once the bleeding has stopped, clean the area with mild soap meant for cats. Cleaning the area will assure that no infection sets in., The big ears of the Devon rex give the cat a wonderful look, but they can attract dirt and debris. Look in the ears weekly and make sure they are clean and debris free. If the ears need cleaning, use a cotton cloth and a product made specifically for cleaning cats' ears to clean them.If you use a product that is made to clean cat's ears, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging. Each product is different and you don't want to damage the cat's ears due to misuse.
Never place anything inside of your cat’s ear canal. Only clean the outside of your cat’s ears.

, You should begin brushing your cat's teeth when it is young so that it gets used to the process and doesn't fight it. Use a pet toothbrush and a veterinary toothpaste and brush its teeth at least once a week.Do not use toothpaste made for humans. It includes chemicals that are not good for pets and its taste is not appealing to them either.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Brush your cat’s teeth.,
Look for signs of skin problems.,
Change your cat’s litter box regularly.,
Brush your cat’s fur.,
Clean your cat’s ears.",How to Care for a British Shorthair Cat1," When you first obtain your British Shorthair cat, check its health and medical records. Take it to the vet so that you can determine when your cat can be spayed or neutered, and set up a schedule with the vet so that your cat receives regular checkups (at least twice annually).Reputable breeders should have administered vaccinations and worm medications already, but your cat will still need regular checkups. Plus, your Shorthair will need to get neutered or spayed as soon as possible.;
, British Shorthair cats are at special risk for gingivitis, so brush your cat’s teeth daily using a specially formulated feline toothpaste.To get your cat acclimated to getting to its teeth brushed, let it lick something tasty off the brush – a snack or some chicken broth, for instance. Once you’ve familiarized your cat with the feel of the brush, have it sit somewhere comfortable. Add toothpaste to the brush, then part your cat’s lips and scrub its teeth gently in an up-and-down motion using the brush.Talk to your cat throughout the process to help it stay at ease.
You may wish to use a finger brush – a small plastic gadget that fits snugly over your fingertip. Finger brushes have very short bristles appropriate for a cat’s teeth.
Like human toothpastes, cat toothpastes are available in a variety of flavors like malt, tuna, and so on. Find a flavor that your cat enjoys to make the process more pleasant.

, If you see your cat excessively licking, chewing, or biting its skin, something might be wrong. Check the cat’s skin for redness, wounds, and irritation. These symptoms and behaviors could be caused by any number of conditions, including fleas, infections, or allergies. Consult your vet for more information and provide them with as much information as possible regarding when your cat’s skin problems first developed and what sort of behaviors the cat is engaged in.If your cat’s chewing or scratching goes on for long enough, you might also notice bald patches where the skin is irritated.

, British Shorthair cats need their litterbox emptied of feces daily. The litter should be removed and replaced at least once every week, and in some cases as often as two days. Check the litter box often for clumping litter, foul smells, and wetness. These are all signs it is time to change the litter.Place the litter box in a place where your cat can get some privacy and feel secure. For instance, place it in an out-of-the way part of the house. Don’t place it in a noisy part of the house (like near the furnace or dryer) and don’t place it anywhere near their food or water.
If you have a multistory home, place a litterbox on each level.
Don’t add too much litter. Most cats do not like litterboxes that are filled more than two inches deep.

, Despite the British Shorthair cat’s short coat, they must be combed regularly (at least once per week) to limit shedding. If you notice tangles or mats in the cat’s fur, comb them out as soon as possible. Use a stiff-bristled comb or brush to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils.Brush your British Shorthair cat more often when it sheds in the spring and fall.
Brush your cat more often when it gets older and can no longer engage in self-grooming with the same level of consistency and enthusiasm that it used to., Cats rarely need their ears cleaned, but you should check them once a week anyhow. If you see waxy buildup, ask your vet for a special product to wipe out your cat’s ears. Do not attempt to clean its ears with a cotton swab or other product designed for humans, as doing so risks hurting your cat."

Use interactive toys if you are away during the day.,
Let your cat outdoors during the day.,
Install a bird feeder.,
Feed your cat after playtime.,
Don’t let your cat sleep in your bedroom.,
Avoid responding to your cat during the night.",How to Change Your Cat's Routine2," Make some time at lunch or right after work to play with your cat. Throw a toy mouse for your cat or give your cat a ball of string to chase. Your cat will get tired out and will be more likely to sleep during the night., Cat towers with scratch surfaces and hanging balls to hit, mice and other toy animals for your cat to hunt and scratching pad toys are all good options. There are also circuit games where your cat gets to hunt a ball through a maze.Interactive cat toys range in price from $6 to $60.
Consider finding a toy that requires minimum work on your part, so that your cat can play alone during the day.

, If you live in the country and it is safe, you can let your cat outdoors during the day. Your cat will be able to climb trees, hunt and explore. After all of the daytime activity, your cat will be more likely to sleep at night.Allowing your cat outdoors always carries some risk. Other animals, parasites, and the elements all pose dangers to your cat. Consider this carefully before choosing to let your cat outdoors unsupervised.If you decide to let your cat outdoors, be sure your cat is spayed or neutered and up to date on vaccinations, flea and tick control, and heartworm prevention.

, Watching birds is a fun routine for cats, especially if you need to keep them indoors. If you live in an area that accommodates a bird feeder, consider installing it in a location where your cat will be able to see it. Your cat will enjoy the activity and it will keep them occupied while you are busy with other things., Offer a high protein meal to your cat after your post-work playtime session. The combination of exercise and food will prepare your cat for nighttime rest.Look into high protein food. High protein diets are generally healthier for cats.Try searching for high-protein options at your local pet store.

, It is important to set boundaries early in the life of your cat, so that they know not to disturb you during the night. If your cat is disturbing you at night, consider closing the door to prevent them from accessing your room and waking you., If your cat starts scratching at your bedroom door, try to ignore it. You should avoid giving in and playing with your cat, which will set up a positive feedback cycle, encouraging your cat to wake you up at night. Try to simply ignore your cat or put them in a different part of the house where they can’t disturb you as easily.You should also avoid negatively responding to your cat with anger or physical violence. In fact, any reaction to your cat may encourage them to continue the behavior. Simply ignore them when you can.

Make gradual changes to your cat’s diet.,
Serve the new food in the old bowl.,
Add delicious toppings to the new diet.,
Create a peaceful and secure eating area.,
Avoid feeding your cat the same food all the time.",How to Change Your Cat's Routine3," If you need to get your cat on a prescribed diet, you should gradually wean them onto the new food. Serve them a combination of the new and the old diet in their usual portion size. Decrease the amount of the old food in their serving by one tablespoon per day.Eventually, you will be ready to shift them entirely onto the new food.If you accustom your cat to a varied diet early in life, it will be easier to shift them onto a new or prescribed diet.

, Place the new food in the bowl they know, alongside some of the old food in another familiar bowl alongside it. You can also mix the two together in one familiar bowl. If your cat does not touch the new food, put the bowl in the fridge and try again at the next mealtime. Continue trying until they start eating the new food.Do not keep canned cat food in the fridge for more than five days.

, You could try adding a bit of canned salmon or other favorite foods to your cat's new diet. They will focus on the flavors from their favorite dishes and gradually become accustomed to the new food., If you have recently moved or need to change the location of your cat’s eating area for another reason, you should find a peaceful location. The eating area should be a good distance away from the kitty litter, since cats do not like to eat close to where they do their business. It should also be in a secure location, away from noisy areas of the house.If you own multiple cats, you should give each cat their own food bowl. If possible, feed them in different areas where they cannot see one another. This will reduce the stress of mealtime.
Some cats like their water in a different location from their food.

, You can make future dietary changes easier by varying your cat’s diet once in a while. Instead of always feeding them wet food, give them dry food once in a while. If you typically buy the same brand, try a different brand periodically. When the time comes for a prescribed dietary change, your cat will be more likely to accept it."

Help find the cat's owner.,
Get the cat checked out by a veterinarian.,
Find a home for the cat or kitten.",How to Befriend a Wild Cat or Kitten2," Ask around your neighborhood to see if anyone has lost their cat. Cats that get outside can get lost or roam around. Make some calls to local veterinary clinics and pet stores to see if anyone is missing a cat; taking a photo with your phone and making up fliers or posting to social media sites can also help reunite a stray cat with its owners.


If the cat is feral instead of stray, it will not have an owner to be returned to.

, Once you are able to approach the cat and pet it, make an appointment with your veterinarian to have the cat examined and neutered or spayed. If funds are tight, call your local humane society to see if there are any funds available to assist with these costs.


The cat will have a tiny bit of blood drawn to test for the feline leukemia virus. If the results are positive your veterinarian will discuss options with you, which include isolating the cat from other cats for its life or euthanasia. If it is negative, a fecal sample will be looked at to determine if the cat has intestinal parasites and it will be given the appropriate medication.
In addition, the veterinarian will check for fleas and ticks and treat if needed. Vaccines (rabies, distemper, and possibly feline leukemia) will be given and its sterilization operation will be performed. A microchip may also be placed under the skin if so desired. This is highly recommended.

, Now you will have a healthy pet to take home after its operation and vaccinations. Your hard work will pay off knowing you have saved another cat from a harsh life on the street. Either adopt the cat yourself or find another loving home for it to go to.

Feed the Devon rex high-quality food.,
Make sure the cat has water.,
Get the cat veterinary care.,
Have the cat spayed or neutered.",How to Care for a Devon Rex2," All cats are carnivores, meaning that they should only eat animal tissues. This means that any food you buy them should consist of predominately meat. Look at the packaging of potential cat foods and make sure that the first few ingredients are some sort of meat or meat byproducts.


Follow the directions on the packaging for meal size and frequency. This is usually based on your cat's size and age. If you are not sure that the portion size and frequency suggested is right for your cat, discuss it with your veterinarian.
If you are unsure about choosing a type and brand of food, consult with your veterinarian. They should have recommendations for your particular cat.

, Cats need constant access to water in order to stay properly hydrated. Make sure that their water is clean and cool. Be sure to change it daily so that it is fresh.


If your cat is interested in running water, consider getting it its own drinking fountain. There are a variety of cat drinking fountains available that recirculate water constantly, attracting your cat to come and drink, and maybe to play around in the water a little bit., A Devon rex needs to get both annual veterinary care and veterinary care if it is sick or injured. Your cat should have an annual exam every year to assess its overall health and to give it preventative veterinary care, such as administering vaccines.


Make sure that your cat is assessed for common genetic illnesses that occur in Devon rex cats. These include hereditary baldness, heart disease, malassezia dermatitis (a yeast infection in the ears or on the skin), hip dysplasia, urticaria pigmentosa (a skin infection that causes sores on the skin), and Devon rex myopathy, which causes the cat to become very weak and tired., All cats should be spayed or neutered. This usually occurs when the cat is between three and six months old. Spaying and neutering helps to limit pet populations in general, but it can also help the health and happiness of your cat.Male cats that are desexed don't spray and they are protected from the chance of testicular or prostate cancer.
Female cats that are fixed have a lower chance of uterine infections and mammary cancer later in life.

If the cat refuses to use its litter box, try getting different litter or a different box.

, The Devon rex is a very social cat that loves to spend time with its family members. It is likely to curl up on your lap, sit with you at meal time, or follow you around while you do chores. Be sure to take some time to focus on your cat every day, playing with it or just petting it while its curled up on your lap.Because of this social nature, they do not do well when left alone.

, Devon rex cats are social creatures that need lots of attention and interaction. One way to give them this interaction is to bring them into homes with multiple pets. This breed of cat tends to get along with a wide variety of animals, including other types of cats and dogs, but they do particularly love to pile up with other Devon rex cats.If you are planning on adopting one Devon rex, you may want to consider adopting two, so that they can be lifelong companions.

, The Devon rex is an active and energetic cat that needs lots of stimulation. This can come from other animals or humans, but it can also come partially from playing with toys. Give it a variety of toys, including strings that you can wave around. Also consider getting the cat climbing towers or perches for it to climb up to.For a cat, the Devon rex is particularly good at learning to fetch or play hide and seek. Try throwing a cat ball to it and see if you can train it to bring it back to you.

Feed your cat age-appropriate food.,
Choose a high-quality cat food.,
Choose a cat food your cat enjoys.,
Change your cat’s water daily.,
Do not administer supplements to your cat.,
Do not overfeed your cat.",How to Care for a British Shorthair Cat2," When your British Shorthair cat is a kitten, it should be fed specially formulated kitten food. After it is about one year old, you can switch to feeding your cat regular cat food., Like all cats, British short hair cats require a balanced diet with the correct proportions of vitamins and minerals. Check the ingredients and nutrition facts label to ensure that the cat food you’re providing your cat is healthy. A healthy cat food will have meat, meat byproducts, or seafood listed among its first few ingredients, since these ingredients contain the amino acids and fatty acids that your cat needs.The healthier foods won’t have byproducts listed as the first ingredient.
Cat foods that are formulated with a healthy balance will bear the logo of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) or another reputable body.

, Like people, different cats have different flavor preferences. Some will like dry food, though most prefer semi-moist or wet food. Cat foods of any consistency are available in different flavors like salmon or chicken. Buy a few different types of cat food and observe your cat’s eating habits to identify which cat food it prefers., Cats use water to stay hydrated, eliminate waste, and digest their food. Each day, empty your cat’s water bowl and refill it with clean, cool water.The best type of water (and food) bowls will be of ceramic or glass. Lightweight tin and plastic dishes are more prone to spillage.

, Unless otherwise directed by your vet, do not add mineral or vitamin supplements to your cat’s food. Doing so could cause health complications later., Since British Shorthair cats are relatively lazy, obesity is a serious health risk.To keep them healthy, feed them a volume of food that allows them to maintain a stable, healthy weight. The mature British Shorthair cat will weigh between nine and 18 pounds.Obese cats could suffer osteoarthritis, diabetes, and urinary problems.If your cat gets fat, reduce the portions you feed it and/or switch to a low-calorie food until its weight is back to normal. Thereafter, give your cat more exercise and fewer calories than it had previously so it can maintain its healthy weight.

Toss a ball for your cat.,
Use a laser pointer.,
Leave a large paper bag lying about if you can supervise.,
Provide climbing structures.,
Take your cat swimming.",How to Care for a British Shorthair Cat3," Teaser toys resemble small fishing poles, with a ball or fuzzy bit attached to a string which dangle from the end of a long stick. You can use these toys to engage your cat by holding the dangling object over or near its head, then swinging it back and forth. You’re your cat goes to swat at or intercept the object, yank it back at once. Repeat several times to keep your cat’s reflexes and coordination sharp., British Shorthair cats love to chase small moving objects. Toss a small ping pong ball or crumpled ball of paper across the room for them to chase. When your cat recovers it, toss it again., Your British Shorthair cat will have lots of fun chasing a laser pointer around. Point the laser pointer at a spot on the floor. When your cat goes to “catch” the laser point, move it to another spot, then another, and so on. This game provides your cat with great fun.Keep in mind, though, that using a laser is controversial because the cat doesn’t get the satisfaction of actually catching prey.

, Your British Shorthair cat will have great fun exploring the empty space inside a large paper bag. And when it tires of exploration, your cat will have even more fun ripping the bag apart with its claws.Before leaving your bag out, cut off any handles it might have to avoid a choking hazard.
Don’t leave out bags of any sort - paper or plastic - for your cat to tear up if you can't supervise the play.

, You can easily get a climbable cat house (conveniently padded on all sides with carpet) from your local pet store. Your cat will enjoy the opportunity to move about the multiple levels of the cat house. Any kind of multilevel climbable structure that encourages your cat to jump climb can help it get needed exercise., Special hydrotherapy centers intended for cats and dogs to swim could help your British Shorthair cat get fit, especially if it needs to lose weight.

Learn about pedigreed cats.,
Learn about random bred cats.,
Consider the cat's coat length, pattern, and color.,
Look at the cat’s face and eyes.,
Think about the cat’s personality.,Talk to a vet about your cat, they can help you determine a rough translation of what breed your cat is.",How to Identify Cats1," Pedigreed cats are bred by cat breeders and the cats have to meet certain breed standards according to the cat association with which they are registered. The breed standard defines the appearance of an ideal specimen of that particular breed, and usually describes size, body type, and head type. It also defines the facial features including the shape of the muzzle, the placement of the eyes and nose, ear size and type, eye shape and color. Other factors may include the tail length and type, coat length, texture, color, and pattern(s), and sometimes even personality.


There are over 100 breeds of pedigreed cat worldwide, and that's not accounting for the coat and color variations within the breeds, or emerging new breeds.
A pedigreed cat has papers that trace its family tree back four or five (or more) generations, depending on the association, and tend to produce offspring that meet the standard.;
, Random bred cats are usually of unknown parentage and vary a great deal in size, body style, head type, ear and eye variation, tail length and type, coat length and density, colors and patterns, and personality.If a cat doesn't come with papers from the association or associations with which it was registered when born or purchased, it is not a pedigreed cat. This can be confusing since at times pedigreed cats are referred to as ""purebreds."" This is a misleading term since a pedigreed cat is no more ""pure"" than the scruffiest alley cat.

, A cat’s main identifiers are the length, pattern and/or color of its coat. Therefore, it is important to study and describe the coat of the cat that you want to identify. For example, is it short and gray or long and two-toned?


Knowing whether the cat that you want to identify is longhair or shorthair can help you to narrow down your choices as you try to identify the cat. Most cats tend to be divided into longhairs and shorthairs, although some breeds have both hair lengths. Sometimes you will also see mention of medium length hair.

, Some breed types have very specific facial identifiers that may help you to identify a cat’s breed. For example, does the cat have a short snout? Blue eyes? Long ears? A pointed or long looking face? Or some other distinct features? Observe and make notes about these features to help you identify the breed.

, Some cats have distinct personalities that may help you to determine the breed as well. For example, is the cat shy? Loving? Energetic? Talkative? Or something else? Consider the cat’s personality and use this information to narrow the field even further.

The origins of the breed are unknown, but it is believed they originated in the Archangel Islands in North Russia. The weather there is extremely harsh in winter, which is why the Russian Blue developed such a thick, plush coat for insulation.


The breed started spreading to other parts of the world in the second half of the 19th century, and reached the US in the early 20th century.;
, Russian Blues are around 10 inches in height to the shoulder. Their average weight is 12 lbs, although some individuals will be bigger or smaller than this, depending on their lifestyle, feeding habits, and how active they are.


They have an average lifespan of 10 -15 years., Russian Blues give an overall impression of being a long, slender, elegant cat. They have a long graceful neck when stretched out, but the deep plush coat can disguise this and make the neck appear shorter.


The body is lean with fine bones and generally with defined, lean muscles., Russian Blues have a distinctive green eye color. This trait starts to develop from 4 months of age and manifests as a rim of green around the outside of the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. All kittens are born with blue eyes, but the color changes to the final adult shade once they get older., Russian Blues have a characteristic wedge-shaped or triangular face, which is often described as cobra like with seven distinct planes. Typical cats, in contrast, tend to have a rounder, more apple like skull. This sets Russian Blues apart., The most striking and unique thing about a Russian Blue is the coat for which it is named. It appears silvery grey, though blue is a traditional description for this color. It should be dense, thick, plush, and double layered.


If you look carefully at individual hairs, you will find a grey shaft tipped with lighter grey or silver at the tip.The nose of the Russian Blues will be black and the paw pads will be mauve.

, Russian Blues tend to be shy with strangers, but affectionate once they get to know their owners. They are gentle and playful, which makes them very suitable for first time cat owners. One of their particular quirks is that the Russian Blues likes to play fetch, which is most unusual amongst cat breeds and more usually associated with their canine friends.


Russian Blues have a reputation for having a quiet voice, unlike some of the other breeds with an oriental appearance and pointed face, such as the Siamese or Havanese. These breeds can be extremely vocal and screechy.
They are great observers and love to actively watch what's going on around them, without necessarily joining in. Like many cats, they are lovers of peace and will prefer to retire to a quieter spot while noisy activities such as vacuuming take place., Cats are not recognized to have a distinct breed unless they have the pedigree to prove it. You can not claim that a pretty blue cat is Russian Blue if you don't have the papers to prove it. If there are no paper, that cat is actually considered a Domestic Shorthair, which is the official term for no-breed felines.This doesn't make that cat any less worthy of a good home, of course, but it is definitely not considered a Russian Blue if you ask show judges or breeders., True Russian Blues are in fact rather rare, and often very expensive. The average reservation fee alone for one in Europe from a decent cattery is around 1000 euros as of 2012. The average cost of Russian Blue kittens in the US is between $400 and $600. Most so-called ""Russian Blues"" at shelters are in fact just Domestic Shorthairs, as cats of such an expense would not be abandoned.Breeders are also very strict about their standards and often refuse to sell Russian Blues to families that cannot commit to the cat.
All pet-quality Russian Blues are sold spayed or neutered to prevent them from reproducing and stop non-breeders flooding the market with Russian Blue kittens, which would make them less exclusive.

Lure cats in with catnip.",How to Build a Cat House1," Outdoor cats need shelter from wind, rain, and cold. Use sturdy building materials or repurpose an existing container. Try these:


Plastic storage tub from a hardware store (about 35 gallons / 132 L)(Easiest option)
Old doghouse from a friend or neighbor
Plywood or lumber (one 4 x 8 ft sheet, or assorted scrap);
, A cat's body heat can only warm up a small space.There's no magic size to aim for, but the largest shelters top out at about 26"" tall x 26"" x 32"" (66 x 66 x 81 cm).If you're using an existing container significantly larger than this, saw it apart or divide it using plywood.



These dog house instructions will work for cats as well, with the modifications described below. Use these if you're building the house from lumber or plywood.

, A removable roof lets you easily change dirty bedding and check on an injured animal if it wanders in. If you're building the house yourself, attach the roof to the walls using a hinge.


If you're using a plastic storage tub, use the lid as a roof. Once complete, you can weigh down the roof using rocks or other heavy objects.

, The shelter must be raised if you expect snowdrifts or floods in your area. 18 inches (46 cm) is enough for most areas, but 12"" (30 cm) or less will work in areas with less severe weather. There are several solutions possible:


Keep the shelter on a covered, raised patio.
Stack the shelter on stacks of scrap lumber, concrete blocks, or other objects. The stack must be completely flat and sturdy. Surround it with heavy objects if necessary to prevent collapse.
Keep it on a sturdy plywood sheet, raised off the ground by four 2x4s (38 x 89mm) legs attached with coated deck screws., Cats prefer shelters with two entrances, so they can escape from predators sniffing in one.Cut two 6 x 6"" (15 x 15 cm) doorways on different sides.If using plastic, cover the sharp edges with duct tape.


If the house is not raised, start cutting the doorway about 2"" (5 cm) above the ground to prevent flooding from rain.
If the house is raised, cut the entrance on a side with a ledge in front of it (from the plywood or stacked objects) so the cat can jump up to it. Cut the exit somewhere with no ledge beneath it, so predators can't easily access it.
For added warmth, staple or glue canvas drop cloth over the interior of each doorway.

, The plastic storage tub is already waterproof, letting you skip this step. If you are using plywood or lumber, or a doghouse, sand and paint it to protect it from rain.


For serious protection and further insulation, cover the roof with roofing material.

, A lumber cat house may be warm enough without this step, but any other material requires insulation. Line each wall by gluing on 1"" (2.5 cm) thick foam insulation board from a home improvement store. Leave a 3"" (7.5 cm) gap at the top of the walls. rest an additional piece of foam on top of the walls, to insulate the roof.


In areas with severe winter, consider using Mylar instead, which will reflect the cat's body heat.You may line the floor with Mylar as well.
Cut the foam with a utility knife.

, Put in plenty of straw, without blocking the doorways, for cats to burrow in for additional warmth. If you don't have straw, use pillowcases loosely stuffed with packing peanuts or shredded newspaper.Do not use hay, which absorbs moisture and can cause allergies.Do not use blankets, towels, or loose newspaper. These can absorb body heat and chill the cat.Some cats will eat packing peanuts, which can cause intestinal blockage.Double-bag them with pillowcases to minimize this risk.

, You can keep food inside the shelter, but water should be left outside to avoid spilling. Keep the water dish nearby.


In temperatures below freezing, use an electrically heated water dish. If you can't afford one, use a ceramic or thick plastic dish and surround it with styrofoam.

, Invite feral cats into the shelter with a small amount of catnip just inside the entrance.

If you're trying to decide on a cat for a pet, consider a non-pedigreed. There are always plenty of them needing homes and unless you're dead set on a particular pedigree for a very good reason, give a home to an intelligent, often healthier, random bred. In general, random bred cats tend to have fewer genetic health problems."

Consider a DNA test.,
Chose your site carefully.,
Collect a sample.",How to Identify a Russian Blue2," If you are not sure about your animal's heritage and you don't have papers, consider getting a DNA test. All animals have specific DNA, which provides codes for their parentage. The DNA is equivalent to a fingerprint that points to the genetic origins of the breed. These tests, which are the same technology that criminal and law enforcement agencies use, is now available for pets.


The tests look for genetic marker material that indicate the breed of the parents. Reputable sites compare this with data held by the International Society of Animal Genetics, for the best possible accuracy., A good indicator that the site is reputable is if it is run by veterinarians. The sites will typically offer genetic testing for health conditions and hereditary illnesses. Often these sites often have parentage tests that are to the same high standard.


You can also purchase tests on Amazon or online, but check out the seller carefully before purchasing. You want to make sure you are not wasting your money and that you will get correct results., The procedure to collect the sample from you cat is simple. The genetic test kit contains two brushes. Place one brush in the cat's cheek and swirl it around for five seconds. Remove the brush from the mouth and hold it in the air to dry for 15 seconds. Next, replace it in the packaging. Repeat with the second brush on the opposite cheek.


This should be done away from eating or drinking, so make sure the cat hasn't eaten for at least 15 minutes before taking the test.Send the test off to the lab. Once the lab has received the sample, which is usually via the mail, an average time to get the results is four to five days, either by email or letter."

Find several cardboard boxes.,
Cut a couple doors.,
Tape on additional boxes.,
Make it cozy and fun.,
Keep food, water, and litter outside the house.",How to Build a Cat House2," For an indoor play house, a cardboard or Styrofoam box makes an especially easy house. You can build your own from corrugated cardboard, poster board, or any other lightweight material, but an existing box will be much sturdier. If the box is smaller than 2 x 3 feet (60 x 90 cm), you'll need multiple boxes to make the house big enough.


Cats may chew the cardboard or Styrofoam, so don't use anything you want to reuse.

, Use a utility knife to cut through one of the cardboard boxes. Each doorway should be 6 inches (15 cm) high to fit the cat comfortably.


Cut a couple small windows or viewing strips if you want to watch the cat while it plays inside.
Glue rags or spare fabric over the doors and windows so you can give your cat some alone time.

, Add a couple rooms to your cat's home with the additional boxes. To make a second story, cut a 6"" (15 cm) hole in the ceiling and tape another box upside-down over it. There should be enough of a floor left for the cat to walk on.


Use packing tape, duct tape, or another sturdy tape.

, Add a small blanket or a cat bed inside. A scratching post or rough towel gives your cat something to scratch. And of course, what cat doesn't like a cat toy?


If you have a multistory cat house, put an extra-fun toy on the highest level, so the cat has fun working out how to reach it.

, Keeping them in the house usually leads to a mess, which might even collapse the cardboard. You can move them nearby, but show your cat their new location to make sure he doesn't return to his old bathroom spot.

Consult your vet.,
Brush it every two or three days.,
Look for signs of skin problems.,
Check its ears.,
Observe its teeth and gums.,
Keep its litter box clean.",How to Care for a Cymric Cat1," Make sure to take your Cymric to the veterinarian at least once a year for a routine check up. Your veterinarian will also be able to advise you about its specific nutritional, grooming, and health needs.Make sure your cat is up-to-date with routine vaccinations and shots.;
, Because of the Cymric’s long, double coat, you will need to brush it often. Use a wire-slicker brush to comb its hair. Additionally, use a comb that has both wide and narrow teeth to brush its undercoat.Make sure to brush its whole body, including its abdomen, legs, and neck.
During the shedding seasons (spring and fall months), brush it more often, for example, every other day.

, Do this while brushing your cat. Run your hands over your cat's fur and feel for bumps, lumps, and swelling. Also look for skin discoloration. Other signs and symptoms of skin problems are:Constant licking, chewing, or scratching of the skin, especially around the neck and head.
Scabs, rashes, or scaly patches on the paws and face.
Redness or inflammation.
Dry, flakey irritated skin.
Hair loss, bald patches, or hairballs.
The presence of blood or pus.

, Check its ears once a week for debris, wax, or an infection. Check the outer part of the ear for bald spots, and make sure the inner surface is light pink and clean. Check its inner ear by gently folding back the ear to look into the ear canal. A healthy inner ear will have minimal ear wax, a healthy pink color, and have no debris or odor.Always wipe away dirt and debris gently. Never stick an object into your cat's ears to clean them.
Reward your cat with a treat and praise for letting you check its ears.
If you notice blood, swelling, a large amount of wax, or smell an odor, then take your cat to the vet. It may have an ear infection.

, Do this by gently pushing back its lips while it is facing you. Healthy teeth look intact (not broken or loose) and clean, i.e., free of brownish tartar. Healthy gums look firm and pink (not white or red), and should have no signs of swelling. Take your cat to the vet immediately if you see:A dark red line running along the gum, or red and swollen gums.
Ulcers on your cat's gums or tongue.
Loose teeth and/or having difficulty chewing food.
Excessive drooling or pawing at the mouth.
Chew toys and treats are a great way to keep your cat's teeth and gums healthy.
Only use specially formulated cat toothpastes to brush your cat's teeth. Never use human toothpaste.

, Check its litter box daily to make sure it is clean and fresh. You may need to check it twice, once in the morning and once in the evening. Remove all waste from the litter box and re-fill it with fresh, clean litter.Try to wash the litter box at least once every 10 to 15 days. Dump out the contents and clean it with mild soap and hot water. Do not use cleaning products that contain scents (especially lemon), deodorants, and ammonia.

Play with the cat regularly.,
Create climbing spaces and hiding spots for the cat.,
Keep the cat’s litter box clean.,
Encourage the cat to stay indoors.,
Schedule regular visits to the vet.",How to Care for a Balinese1," Balinese cats are very social and outgoing. They tend to enjoy playing with their owners and with children at home. Get your cat toys and play with it on a regular basis. You can play games like fetch or hide and seek. Playing with the cat will allow you to bond with it and shower it with attention.You can also put the toys all over the cat’s area so it can play with it on its own, or buy some electronic or interactive toys to help maintain your cat's attention when you can't play.;
, Like most cats, Balinese cats enjoy climbing to high spots and curling up in hiding spots. Set up climbing spaces like shelving units or book cases that are easy for your cat to access. Buy a climbing post and set it up in a common area for your cat to use. Hiding spots like cardboard boxes, closets, and even drawers are popular with cats.You should also create high resting spots for your cat in your home. This could be the tops of cupboards and high shelves as well as the back of couches or empty windowsills.
Many Balinese also enjoy plush hiding boxes as small spaces to curl up get away.

, Balinese cats appreciate a clean spot to do their business. Make sure you empty and refresh the cat’s litter box on a regular basis. Replace the litter in the box if you notice it has a strong smell. Keeping the litter box clean will encourage your cat to use it on a regular basis., Balinese cats often prefer to remain indoors. Keeping the cat indoors will reduce its risk of illness and disease. It will also prevent someone from taking your cat, as Balinese cats are considered a prized breed.Make sure you keep all doors and windows closed in your home to keep the cat inside.

, As part of good care for your Balinese, bring it to the vet on a regular basis. Schedule regular visits to the vet for checkups. Bringing the cat to the vet at least twice a year, not just in the event of an emergency, will ensure it is not at risk of illness or a serious health issue.Balinese cats are known to be relatively healthy cats. However, they are prone to health issues like weak hind legs and obstructions in their nasal cavity. If you notice either of these issues in your cat, bring the cat to your vet right away.

Find a cardboard box large enough to fit your cat.,
Lay the box down on its side.,
Consider painting the box or covering it with fabric.,
Place a towel or a fleece blanket inside the box.,
Consider draping a curtain over the front opening of the box.,
Place the cat condo in a place your cat will notice.",How to Build a Cat Condo1," If there is a large cardboard box that your cat already likes to sleep in, consider using that.;
, If the box has a top part that folds down, cut it off using a box cutter. You can also fold the flaps inward and secure them with glue.

, You can paint the box using spray paint or acrylic paint. You can also cover it with glue and fabric.


Apply acrylic paint using a wide paint brush or a foam brush. To reduce brushstrokes, apply the paint in thin layers. Let each layer dry before applying another one.
If you are spray painting the box, go outside or work in a well-ventilated area. Be sure to cover your work surface with lots of newspaper.
To cover your box with fabric: Cut five pieces of fabric. Each one needs to be large enough to cover each side of the box. Cover the box with glue, and press the fabric down onto it. Work on one side at a time.

, You can cut it down to fit inside the box, or just fold it. This will make the box more comfortable for your cat.

, Cats love dark, private places. Cut a piece of fabric that is the same with as your box, and about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) taller. Draw a ½ inch wide line of fabric glue along the top edge, closest to the opening. Press the edge of the curtain down into the glue.


Consider gluing a ½ to 1 inch wide ribbon all the way around the edge of the box opening. This will not only hide the top edge of the curtain, but also give the box some contrast.

, To encourage your cat to use the box, scatter some cat treats or catnip inside the box.

, In order to ensure that your cat can come and go with ease, position your cat flap 10–15 centimeter (3.9–5.9 in) / 4 - 6"" from the floor. This is the average belly height of a cat.


Mark this height with a pencil in two places, so as to ensure a straight line.

, As is most commonly the case, you may choose to fit your cat flap in the middle of the door. If this is so, use the tape measure to mark the centre of the door and make a mark at this point. Using a ruler, draw a straight horizontal line that crosses the centre point that you marked.

, Cat flaps come with a paper template that shows you where you need to drill.


Position the bottom of the template on the pencil that you drew earlier. Make sure that the centre point on the template is in line with the centre point that you drew on the door. Use masking tape to stick the template in position.

, You will need to use a flat bit that is slightly wider than the blade of your jigsaw. Your instructions may suggest the necessary width. Before using your drill, remember your drill safety - see ""Tips"" below.

, Drill a hole in each corner of the template. The position of these holes will be clearly indicated. Once drilled, these holes will allow you to cut out the shape of the cat flap with the jigsaw.


Remove the template and blow out any sawdust.

, Using your ruler and pencil, draw four lines which connect the holes and outline the cat flap opening.

, For steady sawing, first make sure the door is closed. Before you pick up the jigsaw, remember that using any saw has its risks, so observe ""Saw Safety"" in ""Tips"" below. Now use the jigsaw to cut along your pencil outline, moving from one hole to the next.

, After you have turned your jigsaw off, push out the wood to reveal the hole.


You will need to smooth down the inside edges with a piece of sandpaper. Remove any excess sawdust and keep sanding until you are happy with the finish.

, Place the front of the cat flap over the hole and check that the flap moves in and out with ease.

, With the front of the cat flap in position make a mark through each of the screw holes located in the four corners of the cat flap.

, To drill the pilot holes, select a bit that is slightly narrower than the screws and insert it into the drill. Remember your drill safety.

, Drill on each of the four pencil marks until you reach the other side of the door.

, It's now time to fix the two sides of the cat flap together. Hold the front of the cat flap in position and gently ease the four screws into their holes.


Open the door. Pick up the back of the cat flap and place it over the protruding screws.
Position yourself with an arm either side of the door so you can attach the nuts to the screws. Carefully place a nut onto a screw. This will be fiddly. Hold the nut secure in one hand and with your other hand, use a screwdriver to tighten the screws. When the nut is as tight as you can make it, repeat this process with the other three screws.

, Test the cat flap to make sure it works. Show your cat and begin encouraging him to use it!

Feed it age-appropriate food.,
Choose a high-quality, brand name cat food.,
Feed your cat an appropriate amount of food.,
Provide fresh, clean water.",How to Care for a Cymric Cat2," If your cat is a kitten, then you will need to feed it kitten food. After one year of age, you may feed it regular cat food., When purchasing the food, make sure the first two or three ingredients listed are a named meat like beef and chicken. Also make sure that the cat food contains taurine, an essential amino acid cats need to maintain their heart and eye health.Feed your cat both dry and canned food.

, How much you feed your cat depends on age, activity level, and health. Therefore, make sure to take your cat to the vet so they can assess it and determine the best possible diet for it.Do not overfill your cat’s food bowl. This can cause overeating and may lead to obesity.
Treats should only make up 5 to 10 percent of your cat’s diet.

, Change out your cat’s water at least once a day, if not twice. Also, rinse out its water bowl and make sure it is clean before refilling it with fresh water."

Supply it with a variety of toys.,
Teach it tricks.,
Provide it with high places to perch on.,
Expose it to a variety of situations.,
Provide attention and affection.",How to Care for a Cymric Cat3," Cymrics are playful cats that love engaging toys. Therefore, entertain your cat with ping-pong balls, food puzzles, and cardboard boxes to jump in. Food puzzles are a great choice because they provide the mental stimulation that a Cymric cat needs.Make sure the toys you purchase are safe and cat-friendly.

, Cymrics love to play fetch; this is a personality trait that they are known for. You can also teach it other tricks like sit, come, shake and spin. However, only teach your cat one trick at a time in 10 to 15 minute sessions.When teaching your Cymric tricks, make sure to use reward-based techniques like treats and praise. Never use negative punishment to train your cat.

, The Cymric’s well-developed hindquarters make jumping one of its favorite things to do. Therefore, purchase cat trees and posts for your Cymric cat to jump and perch on.Cat trees and posts will also deter your Cymric cat from jumping on higher, more dangerous pieces of furniture in and around your house.

, By character, Cymrics are children-friendly and animal-friendly (including dogs) cats. Therefore, starting at a young age, expose your Cymric cat to other adults, cats, children, and puppies.If you do not have children, a puppy, or another cat, then invite friends who do over to play with your cat.

, Cymrics are very loyal, people-oriented cats that love to spend quality time with their owners. Therefore, make sure to provide your cat with attention and affection daily. Do this by playing with it, teaching it tricks, or brushing and petting it for 30 minutes at least once or twice a day."

Think about your cats' needs.,
Decide where to build the enclosure.,
Buy a ready frame of some sort, like a small greenhouse.,
Remember to cover the roof of the enclosure.",How to Build an Outside Enclosure for Cats1," Larger cats tend to need more activity and space than smaller cats, and the characteristics of your cat also determine a lot. If you have a larger number of cats that you're building the enclosure for, it's recommended to build it so that every cat has an individual space; mix shady and secure places with large branches, or even small trees for watching birds.


If you have large cats like Maine Coons, Norwegian Forest Cats, Savannahs, etc. or energetic cats like Ocicat, many levels to jump on and branches to climb isn't a bad idea. In that case you probably have already thought about building a larger enclosure than you would for a not-so-energetic cat. You can add levels and branches to an enclosure for calmer cats as well, but you won't need to set up as many.
Do remember that a cat with a thick coat won't probably be that active in hot summer days and probably prefers to lay down under a shadow. You might also want to place a litter box inside of your enclosure to make the cleaning easier.
Remember to provide a clean water source for your cats! If there's a lot of insects and bugs going around, check the water often. Cool, clean water is extra-important if the cats are outside during a hot day and have thick fur.
You could put furniture, or shelves in the area for your cat to climb on. If it's something as fancy as a couch, make sure it's old and you don't mind the cat(s) using it as a scratching post.

, Choose a plot that will give plenty of space for your cat. Choose an area outside that is preferably already closed off by the building, with no shrubs/trees in the way. Decide whether you want cats to have access through a window. Ensure that there is a mixture of soil, grass, concrete etc for the enclosure. This way, if it's hot, they can lie in the grass for example, the soil they can use as a litter box.


The amount of the cats affects the space needed, and if you have cats that don't get along that well but will be spending time in the same enclosure, it's always a good idea to add some extra room.
Cats like to be up high and perch so they can have a view. A polycarbonate roof is useful for an enclosed run as it gives in light and lets cats observe birds flying (with a wire mesh ceiling to stop them escaping out.)

, In this case, you'll have to remove some of the wall panels to let the air flow in and out so that your cats won't be boiled inside on hot summer days. You can replace the walls easily with some chicken wire. You can also bend little bit of the chicken wire inwards and attach it to the ground so that digging-addicted cats won't get through. (Or small, cat-eating carnivores like foxes etc. won't get to your cats, if you live a little closer to the wild.)


You can also build the frame yourself. This requires some craftsmanship but it's not overly hard either. Building the frame yourself also lets you to customize the enclosure to fit the surroundings and to be exactly what you want. Wood is a good material for the frame.
You can use any material you wish, but keep in mind that they have to have what it takes to keep the cats inside and the enclosure standing even in bad weather. You can use chicken wire in this type of enclosure as well, but you'll have to buy a larger amount, depending on the size of your new enclosure.

, Chicken wire, plastic panels, something, because cats know how to jump--and with small cats or kittens, you never know what's lurking in the sky looking for an easy meal.


If you cover the roof with chicken wire, remember to create some place where the cats will be able to stay dry in case of rain or other bad weather, if they're going to be spending a lot of time in enclosure.
If you cover it with something that the rain can't get through, make sure that the surface is not completely horizontal so that water etc. can fall off of it so that it doesn't destroy the material. You might also want to consider the amount of wind in the region where you live in: it wouldn't be nice to wake up and see that your nice see-through plastic-panel roof is all over the yard due to some windy storm.

Evaluate your reasons for getting a collar.,
Pick a safe collar.,
Look for a functional design.,
See it in person.,
Try it on.,
Get tags, too.,
Start loose and tighten.,
Distract your cat after fitting.,
Check the collar regularly.",How to Buy a Collar for Your Cat," The type of collar you buy will depend greatly on why you want it. Are you looking to provide ID for your cat in case it gets lost? Do you want to start walking your indoor cat on a leash? Make sure you understand all your reasons for wanting a collar before you purchase.If you are looking for a place to hang ID tags, a standard collar should suffice.
Alternatively, for permanent identification, you may opt to have your cat microchipped. A vet can insert a microchip the size of a grain of rice in between your cat’s shoulders. The chip can be read by a scanner to bring up more detailed ownership information than a tag can provide.
If you want to start walking your cat, you should consider purchasing a harness instead of a standard collar, as these are more secure and often more comfortable for cats.
If you are looking for a flea collar, it is best to consult your vet prior to purchase. Flea collars can be especially irritating to cats, and your vet can help you find a collar with the proper dosage of the proper treatment for your particular feline.;
, Look for an adjustable collar or harness that is made from a strong webbing, has double stitching throughout, and has a breakaway safety clasp. Opt for d-rings in place of keyring-style split rings for securing tags.Collars with elastic inserts can stretch and may cause injury to your cat if they become stuck on their paws or legs.
Collars that do not feature break-away safety clasps can increase the risk of choking if your cat gets caught on something.
Take a look at the edges of the collar before purchasing. They should be rounded or folded over, rather than sharp. Sharp edges can dig into the skin and cause injury or discomfort.

, A collar is, in part, an accessory that allows you to show off your style or your cat’s personality. More than that, though, a bright color with a bell on it can make your cat more noticeable if it happens to get out or wander too far from home.Opt for colors that will be highly visible against your cat’s fur. A safety yellow or orange color, for example, might not stand out if your cat has a blonde or orange coat. A vibrant blue or green would provide better contrast.
Consider purchasing a collar with a bell, or a separate bell attachment for the collar, especially if you let your cat outdoors. The noise provided by the bell makes them more noticeable and easier to track, and may scare away other animals.
Look for bells that do not have tapering grooves. This helps your cat avoid getting their claws stuck in their collar.

, Before you purchase a collar, it is best if you can see the collar in person. While there are many high-quality collars available through online retailers, the easiest way to get a sense of the strength, shape, and function of the collar is to inspect it yourself.Check at local pet stores or specialty cat retail stores to find a collar for your cat. Many pet stores have a wide selection of collars with one that is likely to fit your needs.
If you do purchase through an online retailer, try to find one that offers free returns and exchanges if the collar does not fit correctly or is not up to your standards.

, Many pet stores and specialty cat retail stores allow cats in the shops. If possible, bring your cat in and have them try on the collar to make sure it is appropriate for their size and does not cause them any great pain or discomfort.


Cats who have never worn a collar before might find a foreign object around their neck to be awkward or uncomfortable.
Look for signs of pain and distress, such as shallow breathing, increased heart rate, wide eyes, and increased biting or scratching as a sign the collar is causing true pain., Purchase tags for your cat’s collar at the same time you purchase the collar, itself. Many pet stores have machines that will automatically engrave tags for you. At the very least, the tag should include the cat’s name, a mobile phone number where you can always be reached, and the city in which you live.Pets are often found near the same neighborhood where they escaped. If you are comfortable with it and the tag has room, you may also want to include your address.
You may also include vaccination tags on your cat’s collar. Rabies tags can help identify your pet and your contact information should your cat get out.

, When fitting your collar to your cat, adjust the collar so that you know it will be loose. Secure it around your cat’s neck and tighten until you can fit two fingers side-by-side underneath the collar.Collars need to have some extra space to avoid getting caught or choking, but should still be secure enough to keep your cat from slipping out.

, A cat that has never worn a collar before may express some level of displeasure with the new object around their neck, even when fit properly. Help distract your cat by putting on the collar right before mealtime or playtime so that their focus can immediately turn elsewhere.You may want to distract your cat regularly with a training treat, a toy, or other means of play for the first few days while your cat adjusts to the collar.

, Collar fit should be checked every couple weeks or any time you notice the collar looking loose or your cat expressing discomfort over the fit. Check the fit regularly to make sure the collar is secure and comfortable.Fits can change for a number of reasons, including weight gain or loss, your kitten growing, or the collar getting stuck on something that pulls.

Give the cat dry and wet food.,
Maintain a regular feeding schedule.,
Give the cat healthy treats.",How to Care for a Balinese2," Balinese cats do well with high protein food, as they have natural hunting instincts and need protein to maintain their energy. Dry cat food is a good option as it is hard and crunchy, which is good for your cat’s dental health. But Balinese cats can be at risk for dehydration if they are just on dry food. You may want to include some wet food in its diet so it gets enough fluids.Look for cat food that is organic and contains mostly protein, such as chicken, beef, or pork. Make sure there are no additives or preservatives in the food.
Your cat may have a preference for a certain type of food and a certain brand. Give it options to see what it likes best.
In addition to wet food, you may encourage your cat to stay hydrated by having water bowls in different areas around the house.

, Stick to a regular feeding schedule, where you feed the cat two times a day. Put out its food at the same time in the morning and at night so it gets into a routine. Try giving the cat one dry food meal in the morning and one wet food meal at night, as this can help make it easier for the cat to digest its food.Give the cat controlled portions at each meal. Speak to your vet about the right food portions for your Balinese based on its age and size.
Like many cat breeds, Balinese cats are at risk of obesity if they are overfeed. Sticking to a regular feeding schedule can help to prevent obesity in your cat and ensure it maintains a healthy weight.

, Catnip is a great, healthy treat for cats. You can buy dried or fresh catnip at your local pet store. You can also grow your own catnip at home that you can then snip off and give to your cat as a treat.


Healthy dried treats made with protein like chicken or beef are also good for cats. You can find dried cat treats at your local pet store or online. Only give the cat one to two treats a day. Give it a small amount at a time so it is not at risk of obesity.Do not give cats people food as a treat, as many people foods are unsafe for cats to eat. Instead, trying growing pet grass, a type of wheat grass. Your cat may find it fun to play with and chew on.

Use a stainless steel comb to brush the cat from head to tail once or twice a week. Doing this will remove any dead hair and keep its coat looking healthy.Balinese cats do well with weekly brushing. They do not have an undercoat, which means they are less prone to matting.
Balinese cats rarely need to be bathed, unless they have come in contact with something smelly, such as a skunk.

, Balinese cats are prone to periodontal disease. To prevent this issue, make sure you brush its teeth once a day. Use toothpaste made for cats and a clean toothbrush. If you cannot brush its teeth once a day, weekly brushing will work as well.You can buy cat-friendly toothpaste at your local pet store or online. Do not use human toothpaste on your cat's teeth.

, As part of a weekly grooming session, make sure you clean the cat’s ears. Wipe them out with a cotton ball or a soft cloth using a cleaner meant specifically for feline ears, available at most pet stores. Do not use cotton swabs, as they can damage your cat’s ears.You should also use a damp cloth to wipe any discharge that appears in the corners of its eyes. Use a separate part of the cloth for each eye so you do not risk spreading an infection from eye to eye.

, Use a cat-friendly nail trimmer to do this. Placing a towel or cloth over your cat's head can make trimming their nails easier. Trim your cat’s nails once a week or whenever they seem to be getting long. Keeping your cat’s nails trimmed will prevent scratching on the surface of your floors and your furniture.Trimming your cat’s nails can also prevent the spread of bacteria under your cat’s nails and ensure its nails stay clean.
If possible, start trimming your cat's nails while they are still a kitten. This will help your cat get used to the process and make grooming easier and more comfortable for you and your cat as it ages.

Most stores toss them out once they unpack their products.

, It must be large enough for your cat to craw through. Use your cat's whiskers as a guideline for the width. Cats will not go through anything they can't get their whiskers through.The doorway can be any shape you want, but make sure that it is as close to the bottom edge as possible. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Set circle and paw print shaped doors about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) up from the bottom edge. Use a plate to trace the circle or paw pad. Use a small cup to trace the ""fingers"" of the paw.
Set arched, square, and triangular doors right against the bottom edge.

, If your box came flat or unfolded, slide a self-heating cutting mat inside box before you start cutting.Be sure to erase any remaining pencil marks after you cut the doorway out.

, If your box came flat or unfolded, put it together first. Glue the bottom flaps shut using tacky glue, wood glue, or white glue.

, Make it smaller than the doorway, and set it fight in the middle of the box side. You can make it any shape you want, but it might look better if it matches the doorway. Use a pencil to draw the shape, and a box cutter to cut it out. Carefully erase any pencil marks that are left over after you cut the window out.


If your second box came flat/unfolded, slip a self-healing cutting mat inside before cutting it.

, Do not secure the top part just yet. Once again, if your second box came flat or unfolded, put it together first. Glue the flaps shut like you did with the first box. You are leaving the second box open so that you can add a crawl hole into the floor later.

, Use a wide paintbrush or a foam brush to apply the glue to the top of the first box, and the bottom of the second box. Press both boxes together. The window and doorway can be facing the same direction, or they can be facing in different directions.

, Place a plate down in the corner of the box, about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) away from both edges. Draw around the plate using a marker, and lift the plate away.

, You may need to cut around the hole a few times in order to get through all of the cardboard layers. The hole needs to be large enough for your cat to crawl through. If the hole is too small, make it larger.

, Glue the top flaps shut using tacky glue, wood glue, or white glue.

, You can paint both boxes the same color, or contrasting colors. If you want, you can even paint the inside rim of the windows and doorways a contrasting color. This will help them stand out more. You can use spray paint or acrylic paint.


If you are using spray paint, be sure to cover your work space with newspaper. Paint outside or in a well-ventilated area.
If you are using acrylic paint, apply the paint using a wide paintbrush or a foam brush. To get a smooth finish, apply several thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat.

, You can cut the blanket or towel down to fit inside your box, or you can fold it. You put it inside either floor of your cat condo, or even both floors. Do not glue the blanket or towel down; you want to be able to take it out so that you can wash it from time to time.


If you are putting a blanket or towel on the second floor, make sure that you are not covering up the crawl hole.

, To entice your cat to use it, scatter some cat treats or catnip in both boxes.

Find two coffee tables.,
Consider painting the coffee tables.,
Place the square table on top of the rectangular table and secure it with wood glue or metal brackets.,
Wrap sisal rope around two legs of the square table.,
Consider covering top of the square table with carpet.,
Set the cat condo down where your cat will see it.",How to Build a Cat Condo3," One needs to be cube-shaped while the other needs to be rectangular. Both need to be about the same width. It is fine if the rectangular table is a few inches/centimeters wider, however. The rectangular coffee table will make the bottom of the condo, and the cube-shaped one will make the top.The cube-shaped coffee table should not have a shelf between the legs. It is fine if the rectangular one has a shelf, however.

, If the color does not appeal to you, you can always paint the tables. The quickest way to do this would be with spray paint, but you can use acrylic paint and a wide paint brush as well. You can paint both tables the same color. You can also paint them using contrasting colors instead.


You will be gluing rope to some of the table legs in a later step. You might want to leave those legs unpainted.
If you will be gluing some carpet down to the top of the square table (or the shelf on the rectangular table), leave that part unpainted.

, Position the square table at one of the narrow ends of the rectangular table. The other half of the rectangular table should be bare. This will create a shelf for the cat to sit on. If you left some of the legs unpainted, those legs should be facing the longer/bare part of the rectangular table.


If you are using wood glue: paint the bottom of the square table's legs with a thick layer of wood glue. Place the table down on top of the rectangular table and let the glue dry.
If you are using metal brackets: Take four L-shaped metal brackets, and screw them to the inside of each of the square table's legs. Set the table down on top of the rectangular table. Screw the brackets to the top of the rectangular table.

, Make sure that the legs you are wrapping are facing the shelf/bare part of the rectangular table. Scuff the entire leg up with rough sandpaper, then paint the first few inches/centimeters of the leg with wood glue. Wrap the rope around the leg until you cover the glue. Paint the leg with a few more inches/centimeters of glue, and wrap more rope around it. Keep painting glue and wrapping rope until you cover the entire leg. Repeat this step for the other leg.


Consider wrapping some of the legs on the rectangular table as well. You can wrap whatever legs you want. They don't have to be right next to each other, like with the square table.
These rope-wrapped legs will act as scratching posts for your cat, and save your furniture.

, This will make it more comfortable for your cat. Measure the top of your square table and buy some carpet according to those measurements. Scuff the top with rough sandpaper, and paint the entire surface with wood glue. Paint the back of the carpet with wood glue, then press the carpet down onto the table top.


If your rectangular table has a shelf, consider cover that with carpet as well.
You can use any color of carpet you like. It can match the table color, or contrast it. For example, if your table is white, consider blue or teal for the carpet.

, Give your cat some time to get used to the condo. You can also encourage your cat to use it by leaving some cat treats or catnip on it.

Get four cube-shaped boxes, each one 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) smaller than the last one.,
Cut doorways and windows into the sides of the boxes using a saw.,
Cut a crawl hole into the top corner of the three largest boxes.,
Paint outside and inside of the boxes.,
Stack the boxes and secure them with wood glue.,
Consider glue carpet down onto the boxes.,
Place the cat condo in a place your cat will frequent.",How to Build a Cat Condo4," The largest box needs to have a top and bottom, but the smaller boxes only need a top. They don't need a bottom as they will be stacked on top of each other. The smallest box needs to be large enough for your cat to curl up inside.


For a standard-sized cat, start with18 inches (45.72 centimeters) as your largest box. The other three boxes are as follows: 16 inches (40.64 centimeters), 14 inches (35.56 centimeters), and 12 inches (30.48 centimeters). If you have a large cat, such as a Maine Coon, you will need bigger boxes.
The boxes can be made out of wood or cardboard. Wooden boxes, however, will be more durable.
You can buy the boxes, or build them yourself using cheap wood or particle board. Use nails or wood glue to put the boxes together.

, Each box needs to have at least one doorway. Use the width of your cat's whiskers as a guideline for cutting the doors. Cats will not crawl through anything that is narrower than their whiskers.


You can make the windows and doors any shape you want, but circles and paw prints are the most popular.
If you are adding windows, make them smaller than the doorways.

, Use a small plate to trace the hole, and a saw to cut it out. Make sure that the hole fits inside the smaller box on top of it. Also, make sure that the craw holes are not in the same spot; you want them to be staggered.


Keep in mind that you will be stacking these boxes. You don't want the holes to be peeking out from under the upper box.

, You can paint them using acrylic paint or spray paint. If you are using spray paint, wood outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. If you are using acrylic paint, apply the paint using a paintbrush or a foam brush. Apply the acrylic paint using many, thin layers rather than one thick layer. This will prevent any brush strokes.


You can paint the boxes all the same color, or contrasting colors.
You can paint the inside of the boxes the same color as the outside. You can also paint the inside a different color.
Consider painting the inside rims of the doors and windows using a contrasting color. This will help them stand out more.

, Place the largest box down on the floor. Cover the bottom edges of the second largest box with wood glue. Place the box down on top of the largest box, making sure that one of the corners and two of the sides are aligned. You will end up with a thick ledge around the smaller box. Repeat this process of the other boxes. Make sure that all of the boxes are aligned on the same corner.


Make sure that the doorways are facing the ledges.

, This can make your cat condo cozier and more comfy for your cat. You can glue carpet down to just the inside floor of each box, or just the ledges. You can also glue carpet down to both the inside floor and the ledges. #* Consider gluing carpet down to the top of the smallest box. Your cat will likely perch on top of this box at some point. You might as well make it a comfortable perch., To encourage your cat to use the condo, scatter some catnip or cat treats inside it.

Familiarize yourself with sewing.,
Measure your cat's height from the top of his back to where you want the bottom of the cloak to be.,
Measure your cat's length from the chest to back by the tail.,
Measure all the way around the cat's neck.,
Using the piece of paper with the measurements as a ""list"", go shopping and buy all the necessities.,
From the measurement around the cat's neck, draw a circle on paper to represent the neck.,
Cut out the bottom right quarter of the circle (mentioned above) like in a pie diagram.,
Lay out the fabric folded in half horizontally.,
Cut around the paper (on the fabric) as if it were a pattern.,
Using a sewing machine, sew seams 1/4"" (0.63cm) on the main piece of fabric.,
Clip the safety pin onto the edge of the elastic and thread this through the space in-between the seam of the neck.

,
Secure the outfit onto your cat and tie the elastic together.",How to Sew a Cloak for Your Cat," This is important, as to sew this cloak correctly, you'll need how to do basic sewing.;
, Double this and add 1/2"" to the height for sewing seams and the width of the cat's back. Write down the outcome as ""length"" on a piece of paper.

, Double this and add 1/2"" (1.27cm) to the length for sewing seams. Write down the new measurement on the same sheet of paper as ""width"".

, Add 2"" (5cm) to the measurement. Whatever the measurement outcome is, that's how much elastic you'll need. You'll also need to write the measurement down to avoid forgetting it. You'll also need to allow enough additional elastic to make ties for the elastic, so it's better to get too much than too little. If you have a piece exactly that size, stitch non-elastic grosgrain ribbon or seam binding ties to the ends.

, Double check the list before you leave the store to ensure all of the supplies.


The height x length is the amount of fabric you'll need.

, It's better for the coat to be a bit loose than too small.

, You'll need this in the upcoming step.

, If it's wrinkled, then iron it. Pin the 1/4 of a circle onto the top left corner.

, Try to make is as smooth a quarter circle as ever.

, When you reach the neck area, do a 1/2"" (1.27cm) seam and don't sew directly next to the edge of the fold; instead try to sew next to the edge, but not too close or the stitching will come out. If you use a zigzag stitch, you can go right to the edge and the width of the stitch inwards - this is very secure and prevents unraveling.

,, Enjoy!

Buy six boxes of wire storage cubes (four cubes per box).,
Choose an access point.,
Design the enclosure.,
Tap the panels and connectors into place.",How to Build an Outside Enclosure for Cats2," You can get storage cubes via Amazon for about $30 per box. The number you need depends on how large you want to build your enclosure. You will also need a few bags of zip ties (about 200-300) and a rubber mallet.;
, First, you’ll want to think about how your cats will access the enclosure. If necessary, put a panel with a cat door on one end of your enclosure. You’ll want to install the pet door on the door or window that cats will use to access their kitty playpen. If you live in a mild climate, you can cut a cat door into a screen door and cover it with a cloth flap.

, The panels are 14 inches square. You don’t want to build any section more than four panels high. Most sections should be no more than two panels high for cats.


Decide whether you want a long run or an enclosure. If you choose a run, build it two panels high.
Don’t install a bottom. Cats won’t enjoy placing their feet between the wire grates. So, either leave the bottom off altogether and let them run on the grass/concrete or install a wooden or plastic bottom.

, Once you’ve loosely constructed your enclosure, tap the panels and the connector tabs with your mallet to square up each section.

Dig holes for posts.,
Nail 2x4 planks between the posts for support.,
Build a standard-height doorway with 2x4s.,
After the poles are in and your door is placed, go ahead and lay out the mesh around it.,
Build or purchase a large doghouse for the cats and their litter, water, and shelter in the event that you are away from home when bad weather hits.

,
Consider building a ramp/tunnel to an open window or pet door from inside the enclosure.",How to Build an Outside Enclosure for Cats3," Place a vertical 4x4x6-foot post every five feet for the entire perimeter of the structure. (t is good to make the holes at least a foot deep to make the enclosure sturdy.


It is key that you pick a spot that does not get too mushy when it rains, for that will move the poles and make the enclosure look less neat.

, Cut and fit 2x4s, toenailed between the upright studs, about 2 inches from the highest ground point inside the enclosure, ensuring that this base is level and even all the way around. Then, cut and fit 2x4s, toenailed between the upright studs, one half inch from the top of the lowest upright stud inside the enclosure, ensuring that this ceiling perimeter is level and even all the way around.


If your enclosure is wider than 10 feet, create a center line of upright studs to build support across the ceiling.
If your enclosure is less than 10 feet wide, purchase 2x6x12-foot beams and toenail them across (on their sides) into the upright beams and upper ceiling perimeter lumber, every 3 feet.

, Buy or build a door--or cut out a weather-treated 3/4-in sheet of plywood--and attach it with the shed hinges. Use a metal handle and sliding latch for the door.

, Using a nail gun or staple gun, fasten and overlap sheets of chicken wire onto the outside of the entire structure, including the door and the floor/ground. It is key to do this more than once going up the posts, making sure it is tall enough for your cat to not climb up. You should also make sure there are no gaps on the bottom for the cat to crawl out of. This prevents invasion by outside cats, dogs, and other animals.


Use heavy duty staples to attach the mesh to the posts securely. Consider zip-tying the layers together so that there is no way for the mesh to become uneven in the seam; this could allow the cat to jump out.
Be sure to use gloves to avoid cutting yourself on the chicken wire.
You can use any material you wish for the walls, but keep in mind that they must have what it takes to keep the cats inside and the enclosure standing, even in bad weather.

,, Be sure to line the opening with chicken wire. Consider installing an area of waterproofed flooring for the cats, especially if you include a weather-covered area for a litter box.


Any flooring will require occasional hosing and thorough cleaning, as cats interpret the outdoors as their free litter box.

Acquire the materials.,
First, measure the dimensions of the large storage bin.,
Next, cut a door out with your box cutter or exacto blade.,
Finally, put the top on for the big bin and tape it in place so that it does not come off.",How to Build an Outside Enclosure for Cats4," You are going to need a large plastic storage bin, a slightly smaller storage bin, insulation foam, an exacto blade or box cutter, hay or dry grass, tape, a towel (one that you have never used and will never use), and finally, a t-shirt or sweater.


You can find insulation foam at most home-and-garden hardware stores.
You can source hay from farms or feed-supply stores. You may also consider saving and drying grass clippings from your lawn.

, Cut your insulation foam, according to your measurements. Next, fit the foam on the walls of the bin. Then, place a folded t shirt or sweater on the bottom of the bin; you might need more than one shirt or sweater depending on how big your bin is. Then, put your folded blanket or towel on the bottom of the smaller bin.


After you do all this, fill the bottom with hay or dry grass for extra comfort. Then, put the top for the little bin on.

, You can trace it with a marker to make the cut more neat. Be sure to do this to both bins as neat as you can.


If you wish, you can cut a piece of fabric or washcloth and tape it over the doorway, so that it opens and closes.

, To let light inside, you can cut little openings on the top on the sides of the walls near the lid. Be careful not to make them too big!


Write who the bin belongs to and your address (esp. if it is in your backyard or front yard and could get lost). You also probably want to put something heavy atop it so that it isn't blown away by harsh winds.

Measure the width of the shelf board.,
Attach the wood supports.,
Attach the shelf board.,
Finished.",How to Build a Cat Shelf That Fits over a Windowsill2," Use this measurement to measure out two wood supports that will sit at a diagonal angle from the wall to the shelf board.


Cut the wood supports at diagonals each end, one for the wall and one for the shelf.






If preferred, cut a single but much wider wood support that will only be attached to the middle of the windowsill shelf.







, Screw the wood supports to the wall.

, Rest the shelf board on the windowsill and on the wood supports. Nail, screw or glue in place.

, Press on it gently to check that it's firmly in place before kitty uses it. Then encourage him to give it a trial run. A few treats left on the windowsill can help to tempt your cat into place.

"
"
Hold the first bracket against the wall under the windowsill.,
Drill the holes over the marks.,
Insert a wall plug.

,
Hold the bracket over the drilled holes, in position.,
Place the shelf board on the bracket and hold it across to the other side.,
Add the second bracket as for the first bracket.

,
Attach the shelf board to the brackets.,
Polish or varnish the wood if desired.",How to Build a Cat Shelf That Fits over a Windowsill3," Mark its drilling holes with a pencil. The bracket should be flush under the windowsill so that the shelf board will sit out evenly from the windowsill. Check that this will be the case by holding the shelf board and bracket in place. Make adjustments as required.


If the shelf board isn't high enough, you'll need to either find a new shelf board or add an additional board layer (glue it to the first board). If there is only a slight dip between the sill and the shelf board, this is probably going to be fine and your cat won't be bothered.






Check that no matter how the shelf board is placed, you can still open and shut the window.







, Drill far enough to allow the screws to penetrate into the wall firmly.


Be sure to check for electrical wiring and plumbing before drilling. Being under a window, it's probably going to be okay but always check to be safe.






Use a masonry drill bit.







,, Attach the screws and screw them in firmly.

, Place a spirit level on top to check it is sitting level. Make marks on the wall for the second bracket.

,, Screw the board to the brackets from the underside.

, The shelf is now ready for kitty to laze about on, watching the world pass by.

Gather your supplies.,
Cut your paper in a triangular shape.,
Curl your paper.,
Glue the paper into a cone.,
Trim the base of your cone.,
String elastic thread through the hat to tie the hat in place.",How to Make a Cone Hat for a Cat1," To start, you will need the proper supplies to make a hat for your cat. You can get most supplies at a local craft store, although you may have some of them lying around your house. You will need the following:A pen or pencil
A ruler
Scissors
A glue stick
Plain or patterned paper - the type of paper is up to you, but sturdier craft paper you find at a craft store may be the most moldable. You can also try construction paper. Avoid flimsy papers, like tissue paper or wrapping paper.;
, Start at the corner of the paper, as you'll be using the corner as the sides of your triangle. You will be cutting out a triangle with two sides of three inches, so your paper should be at least a 3 inch by 3 inch square. Take your ruler and measure three inches on each sides of the corner. You will want two out of three of the triangle's sides to be three inches long.The third side of your triangle should not be a straight line. You want to cut it into a curved shape, like a side of a circle.
Your curve does not need to be perfect. You will be trimming down the curve later after assembling the hat.

, Hold the bottom of the paper with one hand. With your other hand, take your pen. Place the pen towards the bottom of the paper, where your other hand is holding the paper.Place your thumb on top of the piece of paper, and press the pen into the paper with your other fingers.
Run the pen swiftly across the paper, with your thumb firmly pressing the pen and paper together. Use enough force to create a curl, but not so much force that you inadvertently damage the paper.
When you're done, the triangle should already be forming a cone-like shape.

, Dab some glue along either edge of the paper that is slightly rolled into a cone shape. Press the two edges together to create a cone. You should now have what looks like a small birthday hat.You can secure the cone together with paper clips while waiting for the glue to dry.
Be sure to leave a small opening on the top of the cone. Later, when you embellish the cone by adding ruffles or a puff at the top of the cone, you will need a small hole.

, Use your scissors to trim around the base of your hat. You want to trim to the point you can set the hat down on a table and it will stand more or less flat. This makes the hat more comfortable for your cat.Do not worry if the hat does not lie perfectly flat. As long as it does not lean too far in one direction, it should be okay to place on your cat's head.

, Use a hole puncher to punch two holes on either side of the hat. Take some elastic thread, which you can buy at a craft store, and tie one piece of thread in either hole. When you put your hat on your cat, you can tie these two threads together to secure the hat in place.Make sure your threads are long enough. It's a good idea to use slightly more thread than you think you need. That way, the threads will not be too tight when you put the hat on your cat. If you have too much thread, you can always trim it down later.
If you can't find elastic thread, ribbon or regular string can work in a pinch. However, elastic string works best as it will cling to your cat's face, keeping the hat on his head.

"
"
Add some fringes to the top of the cone hat.,
Place a puff ball on top of the hat.,
Write on the hat.",How to Make a Cone Hat for a Cat2," A plain cone hat is a little boring. You can add some curly fringes stemming from the top of the hat with some construction paper. Take some colorful construction paper and cut out a 3 inch by 2 inch rectangle. Make a series of small cuts running across one of the longer sides of the rectangle. When you're cutting, stop about half an inch from the other side of the rectangle.Curl all the small fringes of construction paper with your pen or pencil.
Roll the rectangle up as tight as you can. You should now have a piece that looks something like an umbrella, but with curly fringes on top. You should be able to fit the non-fringed end of the rectangle into the small hole on top of your cat's hat.
Use some glue to hold the rectangle in place. You should now have a hat for your cat with fun fringes coming off the top.

, If fringes seem a little too flashy, you can simply add a puff ball to the top of your cat's hat. You can add a puff ball in any color you want and secure it to the hat with a little glue.You can buy puff balls at a craft store. They come in a variety of sizes and colors. You can even get sparkly or glittery puff balls.
Make sure you wait for the glue to dry completely before putting the hat on your cat. Cats may be eager to play with puff balls that fall off the hat.

, It can be fun to use a marker or pen to write on your cat's hat. If you're struggling to write on the cone itself, you can write something on a small piece of construction paper, cut it out, and glue it to the hat.You can write whatever you want on the hat. If it's your cat's birthday, something like, ""Birthday Boy!"" can be fun.
If it's New Years, try writing the year on the hat. This can be a fun, cute New Years Eve costume for your cat.

"
"
Check for possible hazards.,
Do not leave your cat alone with the hat in place.,
Avoid forcing your cat to wear the hat.",How to Make a Cone Hat for a Cat3," You do not want your cat to end up swallowing a part of the hat and becoming sick. Do not use any small parts on your hat. Your cat may break these parts off, chew on them, and potentially swallow a hazardous item.When decorating the hat, go for bigger items. A puff ball is big enough to be safely placed on a hat, as it probably will not pose a choking hazard. Something like googly eyes, however, may be tempting for your cat to chew and swallow.
Read product labels. Do not use anything on your hat that has warnings about being toxic to children or pets.

, This is especially important if you put thread on the hat to hold it in place. Threads could get twisted on other objects in your home, trapping and potentially choking your cat.Watch your cat closely when he is wearing the hat. Do not let him out of your site as long as the hat is on. Do not let him crawl under a bed or in a drawer when he's wearing the hat.
Do not leave your home when your cat is still wearing his hat. Remove the hat before going out.

, Costumes can be fun, but most pets are happiest without clothing of any kind. If your cat is resistant to wearing the hat, do not force it. You want your cat to live in a stress free home, and forcing costumes can cause anxiety.If your cat squirms or cries when you put the hat on, stop and let your cat go. It's best not to force your cat to wear a costume against his will.
You should also not force your cat to wear the hat if it restricts his vision or movement.

Determine if the baby bird needs your help.,
Do not hand raise a baby bird.,
Contact a veterinarian or wildlife rehabilitation center.,
Transport the baby bird.",How to Identify Baby Birds," A baby bird is classified as either a nestling or fledgling, depending on its age. A nestling is a very young baby bird that doesn’t have much feathering.A fledgling is older than a nestling and has more feathers, but does not yet know how to use his wing feathers to fly.Nestlings should not be out of their nests, since they are unable to fly or grip a perch.Nestlings are altricial, meaning they are completely dependent on their parents and must stay in the nest.Song birds and perching birds are born as altricial chicks.Fledglings tend to look a little scruffy overall.;
, If the baby bird is a fledgling, it will probably be prancing or scurrying about on the ground, since it hasn’t learned how to use its muscles and feathers to fly.Chances are that the fledgling fell out of its nest—fledglings can become impatient with getting out the nest, but end up falling out rather than gracefully flying out.


Although nestlings cannot move around on the ground, they will stretch their mouths wide open to ask for food, and will even chirp if you don’t give them any!, Before trying to identify the species of the baby bird, you should move it out of harm’s way, especially if it is a nestling. If you can locate the nest from which the nestling fell, gently pick the nestling up (bare hands or with a towel) and place it back in the nest.If you cannot find the nest, you can make one.


To make your own nest, line a shoebox or woven basket with hay or dry leaves. Place the makeshift nest off the ground with the baby bird inside of it and wait for about an hour for the parents to return.If the parents do not return, you will need to start making plans to take the baby bird to a wildlife rehabilitation center.It is only a myth that handling a baby bird will cause it to be rejected by its parents.If the nestling feels cold to the touch, warm it in your hands before returning it to the nest (or your makeshift nest). A parent returning to the nest may push out a cold nestling to prevent the other eggs or nestlings from becoming cold., Although out of the nest, a fledgling does not need to return to its nest. Since fledglings are able to use their feet to grip, hold out your index finger like a perch and use a bird treat to encourage the fledgling to perch on your finger. Once the fledgling is on your finger, gently place it on some shrubbery or a tree branch.If the fledgling does not want to perch on your finger, try gently wrapping it in a towel to pick it up and place it on higher ground.
If you try to place the fledgling back in its nest, it will likely fall out of the nest again.The fledgling needs to be above the ground to protect it from predators.

, It is often difficult to determine the species of a baby bird. Baby birds typically do not resemble their adult counterparts, particularly in terms of feather color and length. In addition, a baby bird’s feather color and lengths can change in a matter of days, making identification even more difficult.Despite the challenges, do your best to identify the species. When you contact a wildlife rehabilitation center, you can provide them with this information so the staff will have a good idea of what type of baby bird you will be bringing them.
If you need to care for the baby bird before transferring care over to a wildlife rehabilitation center, you can provide the bird with general support regardless of its species. For example, you can keep it warm by placing it in a tissue-filled shoebox (make sure to cut holes in the lid) and setting a heating pad set on ‘low’ underneath the box.You could also feed it.

, Often, a baby’s bird bill will be large and out of proportion to the size of its head. This is because the baby bird's head has not yet fully formed. Essentially, the head will have to catch up to the size of the bill., A baby bird’s feathers are typically stubby, fluffy, and not very well organized. Sometimes, the feather coloring will resemble that of an adult of the same species, especially for the wing and tail feathers. Most times, though, the coloring will be very drab to conceal the baby bird from predators., With so many species of birds, there are many variations on physical characteristics. Some other physical features to look for include eye size, the presence of a hooked beak, and spiked feathers on the head.Be mindful that telltale physical features of a particular species may not be easily noticeable on a baby bird.


The orientation of the toes (how many face forward and how many face backward) can also help you identify the species., Take a few pictures of the baby bird and spend some time researching online databases to see if you can identify the species. There are many helpful online resources, such as http://www.2ndchance.info/babybirdphotos.htm, that contain numerous pictures of baby birds. Another website, http://www.babybirdid.com/, features a short quiz that will give you potential species based on how you answer the questions.

, If you were able to locate the nestling’s or fledgling’s original nest, you could use the nest’s characteristics to determine the baby bird’s species. For example, sparrows will make their nests close to the ground and wrens will build their nests in bushes or shrubs with dense foliage. Also, owls and wrens will make their nests in cavities of old trees.You can also look at how the nest is made. For example, American robins will have cup-shaped nests, Barn swallows will make their nests out of mud, and hummingbirds will make their nests out of lichens and spiderwebs.There are many types of nests, so do not become discouraged if you cannot identify the baby bird’s species according to its nest. A wildlife rehabilitation expert can help you.

, More times than not, it is best to leave a baby bird alone.Even if you do not see its parents around, chances are that the parents are not far off and will return to the nest (or ground) to feed it. However, if you see evidence of physical trauma (e.g., broken beak, missing or injured feet, puncture wounds), you should transport the baby bird to a veterinarian or wildlife rehabilitation center.The baby bird will also need your help if it is sick (e.g., cold to the touch, weak).
For a nestling, you may need to take the baby bird for further care if the parents have not returned in an hour. Keep in mind, though, that the parents may not approach the nest if you are too close. Stay at least 100 feet (about 30 meters) from the nest., This cannot be emphasized enough! Unless you are a licensed wildlife rehabilitator, it is illegal to hand raise wild animals in captivity. In addition to being unlawful, hand raising a wild baby bird is extremely time intensive—nestlings need to be fed every 15 to 20 minutes.Even with the best of intentions, it is unlikely that you will do a better job of raising a baby bird than its parents or a wildlife rehabilitator.

, If you choose to take the baby bird to a veterinarian, find one that specializes in birds and wildlife. If you do not know the wildlife veterinarians in your area, your local zoo or ASPCA can give you recommendations.Search for the nearest wildlife rehabilitation center, both within the United States and internationally, by using a directory, such as the one at http://wildliferehabinfo.org/.

, To transport the baby bird safely, gently place it in either a cardboard box or shoebox with holes cut out for adequate ventilation. Place a towel in the box’s bottom so the baby bird does not slide around in the box. To minimize the chances of you getting injured while picking up the baby bird, wrap it up completely in a towel (including the head and feet).You could also line the bottom of the box with paper towels.Handle the baby bird as little as possible before transporting it to minimize its stress."

Keep chicks warm.,
Build a large pen.,
Provide a wooden shelter similar to a small shed or barn.,
Do not let your peacocks roam free.,
Never overcrowd your peacocks.",How to Care for Peacocks1," Keep chicks in a heated area for the first 4 to 6 weeks of their lives. It's generally a good idea to start out with a temperature of about 95˚F and decrease the temperature by about 5˚/week. However, this can vary greatly depending on the time of year and your geographic location.


Keep an eye on your chick's body language to recognize the best temperature. When chicks are cold, they will huddle together. When they're hot, they'll try to get as far away from the heat source as possible. The best temperature will be when the chicks can move freely without exhibiting either of these behaviors.;
, This is necessary if you want to keep your peacock from flying away. It should be at least 8 feet (2.4 m) tall, or taller, to ensure that your peacocks are able to fly and/or fan their tails freely. Chicken wire is fine for both the walls and the roof. The roof should also arch or come to a point in places where it will be higher than the rest.


Make sure that, if you are getting a male, the pen is wide and long enough for him to display his feathers fully when he struts. Not doing so will result in broken feathers or other injuries.

, Make it inside or connected to the main coup for your birds to roost and/or nest in. You may want to put a warming light in this area and bed it with straw. Provide lofts for the peacocks to stand on and regular perches. Be sure to check the entire pen for places where raccoons, foxes, or other small pests can get in.


If you have a pest problem, consider placing a radio near the peacock's pen. Keep it on at all times. Predators and pests are less likely to make themselves known if they hear human voices.

, Although peacocks raised from chicks will rarely stray far from where hatched, they do have a tendency to turn semi-wild if left to their own devices. Be sure to keep them in an enclosed area if you have strict property lines or are afraid of losing your peafowl.

, Not only does this lead to an uncomfortable and unhappy life for your peafowl, but it can cause severe disease outbreaks, making it a poor economic decision for you. You should have about 80 square feet of space per bird.

Find a large cage.,
Provide perches.,
Place a nest box in the cage.,
Maintain a comfortable environment.",How to Care for Mynah Birds1," Your mynah bird’s cage should provide easy access for cleaning as well as plenty of room for your bird. The typical dimensions of a mynah bird cage are 3-4 feet wide (90-100cm) by 2 feet tall (60cm) by 2 feet deep (60cm). Because they are such a rarity, it can be hard to find an affordable cage that is specifically made for mynah birds. Most large cages are built for parrots that require less room..


If you are in a pinch, you can put together two parrot cages.;
, Because they enjoy hopping around, place a variety of wooden or plastic perches in your mynah bird’s cage. The diameters of the perches should be about one inch (2.5cm). These will help prevent foot injuries and the development of arthritis.Avoid rope perches because the bird’s toenails can get caught in them.

, Because mynah birds take multiple short naps during the day, you will want to install a dark place for them to sleep. The best option is a next box. Simply buy a nest box at a pet store and place it inside the bird’s cage. You can also build your own nest box out of a soft wood or cardboard. However, a cardboard nest box will need to be replaced regularly.Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines when installing the nest box.

, Find a comfortable place in your home that is near sunlight but not directly in it. Mynah birds also enjoy room temperature (76 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) but can acclimate to slightly colder temperatures. If your bird does not have any exposure to sunlight, you may need to install a light fixture.

Provide food and water dishes.,
Feed the chicks.,
Begin to wean your chicks from the crumble.,
Give your peacocks occasional treats.",How to Care for Peacocks2," Using hanging food dishes (hanging from the ceiling by chains) tends to keep mice from getting into the food. Keep the water elevated or protected in some way as well so that you do not get droppings in it. Alternatively, use a 3 or 4 gallon (11.4 or 15.1 L) bucket for water.

, Peacock chicks should get a high protein diet for their first 3 months of life. Look for a Game Bird feed crumble of about 25 to 30% protein. As they get older, begin to wean them off the crumble; too much protein in a grown peacock can cause serious leg deformities.

, After three months, the chicks should be weaned to either Game bird feed or Game bird pellets (Note that pellets are best for birds in cages with wire bottoms). This can generally be done using a 6 week transition schedule, but you should pay close attention to the response of your chicks. If they stop eating the feed, continue feeding them what they will eat and try again another day. The six week program is as follows:Week 1: 3 parts crumble to 1 part adult food.

Week 2: 2.5 parts crumble to 1 part adult food

Week 3: 2 parts crumble to 1 part adult food

Week 4:1.5 parts crumble to 1 part adult food

Week 5:1 part crumble to 1 part adult food

Week 6: .5 part crumble to 1 part adult food

Week 7: All adult food.

, While too many treats can cause health problems, giving your peacocks a little something special now and then can be helpful in keeping them from straying or to help them swallow medicine. To treat your peacock, consider giving him fruits, vegetables, bread, unsweetened cereals, dog food, or cat food. Do not give them small bones, as they may choke.

Keep the peacocks healthy.,
De-worm your peacocks.,
Keep an eye out for external parasites.,
Watch for protozoan diseases.",How to Care for Peacocks3," Health checks are very good (with testing as appropriate), when you acquire your new peacock, and each year thereafter, to check for and prevent common illnesses.

, Caged peacocks should be wormed at least every other month (more often if needed). Free range peacocks should be wormed at least once every three months. There are a variety of products that can be used for worming. However, most of them are intended for dogs, cats, chickens, turkeys, or cows. Here are some that you can also use for your peacocks:



Piperazine. This is a general wormer that comes in liquid or pill. The liquid can be put in the water and used to de-worm a bunch of younger birds at once. The pill must be force fed to the peacock.

IVOMEC. IVOMEC is another very effective, general use wormer. However, it is not effective against capillaria worms. If you choose to use IVOMEC, it is recommended that you alternate between IVOMEC and Panacur (Panacur is especially effective against capillaria worms). Note that these two should never be given at the same time. Alternate which one you use each time you de-worm.

Ivermectin Cattle wormer. This is commonly used to worm breeding stock. It can be hidden in a treat and given to the peacock or force fed.

, In addition to worms and internal parasites, external parasites such as lice can cause problems with your flock.



Lice. These insects live their entire lives on the host, feeding on skin, scales, and feather debris. If lice are found on your birds, all birds in your flock should be treated with a safe pesticide.

Mites. These bugs are more resistant to pesticides than lice. If you find mites, you must treat your birds every 10 days for 4 to 5 weeks. Then, it is recommended to treat your flock monthly until you are sure the mites have disappeared.

Chiggers. Chiggers feed on thighs, breasts, wings, and the vent, resulting in red scabby patches on your birds. To treat, you must treat the entire pen/area inhabited by the bird.

, Protozoa are single-celled organisms that can cause infection and other illness in a variety of animals. Some important ones to watch out for with your peacocks are:



Coccidiosis. This is generally just found in birds 3 to 12 weeks old. It is not contagious. The most prominent symptom is black, watery stool. To mitigate, treat with a coccidiostat or a sulfa drug added to the feed. It is a good idea to add preventative medication to your peafowls' food while they are of a susceptible age.

Histomoniasis. Chicks between 5 and 14 weeks old are most likely be affected by this. Symptoms include watery yellowish stools, drowsiness, and weakness. It is contagious. To treat, use Metronidazole or copper sulfate to treat.

Leucocytozoonosis. This protozoan attacks the white blood cells of the bird. Symptoms include severe anemia, fever, weakness, loss of appetite, and difficulty walking. It is generally transmitted by black flies and biting midges, which both breed in fast-flowing streams. It is recommended to keep your birds indoors during the active season of these insects. If you do have a problem, treatment will call for a sulfa drug or clopidol.

Pigeon Malaria. Here, it is the red blood cells of the bird that are attacked. Symptoms include weakness, loss of appetite, and eventually death. Like Leucocytozoonosis, Pigeon Malaria is transmitted by biting midges. To prevent this disease, be sure to keep insect levels under control and give your birds a low level of antimalarial medication of Clopidol if you are worried about them getting affected.

"
Provide a healthy diet.,
Exercise your bird.,
Allow the bird to groom.,
Provide playthings.",How to Care for Mynah Birds2," Mynah birds are omnivorous and, in the wild, eat a variety of fruits, nuts, insects and small animals. In captivity, you may find that it is expensive and difficult to provide your bird with a regular supply of these foods. Instead, you will likely want to feed your animal a steady diet of pellets designed specifically for mynah birds. Also, because mynah birds do not bite and chew their food, it is important that the food is presented in bite-sized pieces.Because mynah birds suffer from hemochromatosis, or an inability to store iron, you should feed them low iron (150 parts per million) mynah bird pellets. These pellets should be roughly 60% of your bird’s diet.
Unless you are breeding birds, insects should not be more than 5% of your bird’s diet.
If your mynah bird’s diet is less than 60% pellets, you may want to consider various supplements., If your mynah bird has been socialized since birth, you can let it out of its cage to fly around your home. However, before you let your bird out of its cage, make sure that you have closed all of the windows and doors, turned off any fans, covered any water, and ensured that there are not any predators around, such as house cats. Also, remember that mynah birds are not a hands-on bird and will not perch on your hand like a parrot.You may want to clip your birds wings. Without a clipping, mynah birds can lose their balance and have a difficult time landing. This can result in injury or death.

, Mynah birds are fastidious creatures and bathe multiple times a day. The easiest way to meet their bathing needs is to place a shallow dish of water in your bird’s habitat. Make sure to change the dish water on a regular basis, as the bird’s droppings will likely fall in it throughout the day.Because of their sensitivity to chemicals and pathogens, be sure to fill your bird’s bowl with distilled water and avoid using tap water.

, Purchase toys and other playful things for your bird. Mirrors, bells, bottle caps, and other small items can serve as toys for your mynah bird. These products will help keep your bird happy and engaged.Avoid rope toys because they can get caught in your bird’s tongue or toenails.

Buy a baby mynah bird.,
Place the cage in a busy place.,
Teach your mynah specific words.,
Condition your bird to different things.",How to Care for Mynah Birds3," The easiest way to socialize a mynah bird is to buy it as a chick. Ideally, this means purchasing a 6-8 week old bird. Mynah birds begin speaking at three to four months and tend to quit learning new words once they reach two years of age. Unless you are okay with the words that they have already learned, you may want to consider a baby mynah bird.Begin speaking to the young bird as soon as you bring it home. Initially, give it simple words like “hello” or “hi.”

, Because mynah birds are extremely social and tend to enjoy human interaction, they can be easily socialized. The best way to do this is to put them in a place where they can talk to multiple people and develop their language skills. They may also form a strong bond with the person who cleans their cage and feeds them.Mynahs also have good memories and remember mistreatment. They will hold grudges and dislike people who resemble the person who mistreated them.

, In order to train it, simply pick a short word or phrase and say it every time you see your bird. Unfortunately, you only have about a year and a half to teach them those words. Although mynah’s can learn new words until about the age of two, your mynah is the most impressionable between the ages of three and nine months.Mynah birds are capable of learning over 100 words.
If you live with other people, encourage them to also say the words you want around the mynah bird.

, Because they are the most impressionable when they are young, you should socialize your bird to new people and things when it is a baby. In the first few months to a year, expose your young bird to new people and things (cats and dogs, household appliances), as well as travel with it. This will make it a calmer, better adjusted, and more social pet.This will also make it less likely to be frightened and, therefore, healthier.

How to attract hummingbirds.,
Provide adequate shelter.,
Ensure that the hummingbirds get both nectar and insects.,
Give hummingbirds a place to perch.,
Ensure sufficient sunlight in your garden.,
Expect one regular hummingbird to your garden.,
Check the area to make sure the parents are not foraging food for themselves or the babies.,
Look for signs that the birds are in distress (parents, or babies), or any other bizarre behaviour (such as, avoiding the nest, not eating, or a bird or egg goes missing).,
If the eggs or babies have been abandoned, carefully extract the birds from their environment.,
Contact your nearest Animal Rescue, or Bird Rescue and give them your situation.,
Check the scene to make sure there are no dangerous predators about.,
Place the bird on a soft material (cloth preferably), and put it into a dark box, but make sure that oxygen is plentiful.,
Contact your nearest Animal Rescue, or Bird Rescue and give them your situation.",How to Care for Hummingbirds," Hummingbirds are energetic, territorial birds. They are among the easiest birds to attract to your home. To encourage hummingbirds to visit your home, they need sunlight and shade, perching areas, nectar and insects. Native plants and shrubbery are a key to attracting hummingbirds, so learn which plants to add to your garden.;
, Native plants which hummingbirds appreciate in the wild are most appealing and offer sanctuaries. Certain businesses can landscape your garden with native plants and shrubbery, but they aren't cheap. Hummingbirds need shelter to look for predators or potential mates. Native plants provide shelter as well as their own nectar sources, reducing the cost of buying nectar.

, Nectar plants and insects are hummingbirds' favorite food sources. Contrary to the popular belief that hummingbirds live on nectar, hummingbirds need nutrient-packed insects and spiders to fuel themselves. Providing native plants will provide native insects and arachnids as well as nectar. You can decide which kinds of plants hummingbirds like by observing them in the wild or in your garden. Sometimes just providing an insect populated plant will be enough to attract hummingbirds. Perhaps they may enjoy the nectar of the exotic plant that you bought more than the native plant.

, Perching areas are important. Native plants can easily provide a perch which hummingbirds are accustomed to using in their natural habitat. They can preen, scout, and impress on their perches.

, Sunlight is a major factor in attracting hummingbirds. Hummingbirds have tiny, colored reflectors on the barbules of selected feathers, which produce a dazzling color when reflecting sunlight. A dark feeding area may be rejected, as there is no sunlight to reflect off a hummingbird's feathers, rendering it difficult for the males to find a mate. Bright areas allow hummingbirds to show off their dazzling colors, giving them better opportunities to impress mates.

, Most likely, you will have only one resident hummingbird because hummingbirds are extremely territorial, and will not allow others into their feeding grounds. Don't be discouraged if they do not discover your backyard right away.

, If you have suspect the parents have abandoned their babies or eggs, watch the nest from a safe distance, so as to not discourage the parents from returning, for about 30 minutes or more. Hummingbirds have a very high metabolism, so they must eat consistently to fuel their bodies, especially when incubating the eggs. They may be foraging more often when babies are present. One of the worst mistakes anyone makes is to directly pick up the birds, eggs, or to detach the nest, to ""help"" these abandoned creatures.

, Such signs can be key to figuring out what's wrong. A distressed parent may be mourning over the loss of a baby or egg, or may spot a predator. If the hummingbirds are not eating, there could be a simple fever, or mites could be plaguing the nest. Avoiding the nest can be interpreted as signaling that a predator is near. The hummingbirds may feel threatened.

, Depending on the birds' age, it may be suitable to put them in a soft cloth in a box (as dark reduces stress). Most likely, the birds will be too young, and you will have to delicately remove the nest from its placing, and put the nest in a dark, room-temperature box (some people go over the top trying to keep the birds warm, or cool and end up killing the birds). If you have enough training, ""nuking"" the nest rids it of mites, but do not attempt this unless experienced. Eggs should also be kept in the nest, but hummingbird eggs are unbelievably fragile, so don't directly manhandle them. Birds should also be handled with extreme care.

, Explain what you have done for the birds or eggs, and depending on preferences, you may have to drive to the Rescue. Drive carefully, because smashing the eggs or killing the birds would not be a great way to end this.

, Approach the bird slowly, so as to not distress it any more (it is possible for a bird to die from stress). Gently pick the bird up. These birds are so fragile that picking them up as you would a ball would crush it, or rupture an air sac. Place the bird on your hand, to make sure it is not injured more. Do not attempt to wash the bird; the air sacs will rupture if not treated correctly.

, If the bird enters a state of torpor, quickly make sugar water, and attempt to feed it with an eye dropper.


Sugar water is one cup sugar for every four cups water.

, Tell them what you have done, to alert them of what they must do. Depending on preferences, you may have to drive the bird to the Rescue, so drive carefully.

Choose a location.,
Decide if you want to bury the bird in a container.,
Protect the grave.,
Consider a grave marker.,
Think about planting something on the grave.,
Hold a ceremony to say farewell.,
Avoid touching the bird with your bare hands.,
Clean up afterwards.,
Consider whether the bird should be tested.",How to Bury a Dead Bird," In most cases, you can bury a bird on your own property with few restrictions. Because laws vary from place to place, it's always a good idea to call your municipality to find out if they have any laws regarding the burial of animals.Avoid burying a bird or any other animal in a vegetable garden.In some areas, there may be restrictions against burying animals if your ground water level is too high. Check with your local department of environmental conservation to find out.If you have cats or dogs, you may want to choose an area that they do not have access to in order to prevent them from digging the bird up.;
, You do not need to bury the bird in any kind of container unless you want to. If you choose to use a container, be sure that it is not made of potentially toxic materials.Pet coffins are used mostly for sentimental reasons, so it's up to you if you would like to use one.Do not bury anything made of plastic. If you transported the bird to the burial site in a plastic bag, do not bury the bag with the bird. Gently empty the bird into the hole by holding the corners of the bag, seal it and then dispose of the bag in your normal trash., It's generally a good idea to dig a hole at least two feet deep for a grave. The deeper your hole, the lower the chances will be that a scavenger will come along and dig the bird up. Once you have placed the bird inside the grave, cover it with the dirt that you removed when digging the hole. You may also want to consider covering the area with stones or paving blocks to protect it from scavengers.

, If you want to, you can mark your bird's grave with some kind of marker or memento. This can be as simple or as elaborate as you choose.


You can mark the spot with a simple stone so everyone knows where it is.
If you want a more elaborate marker, you could create a personalized headstone. Consider making one out of wood and using paint or a marker to include a personalized message.
You could also consider purchasing a kit that is typically used to make a concrete stepping stone. This will allow you to decorate your stone and write your pet's name if you wish.
You could also place a statue of a bird on the grave as a memorial.

, If you don't want to use a grave marker, but you would like to mark the grave and pay respects to the bird, consider planting a beautiful plant on the grave.


Be sure to choose a plant that tolerates the amount of sun in the area.
Plant a perennial if you want the plant to keep coming back year after year.
Don't forget to take good care of the plant so it flourishes.

, If you are saying goodbye to a pet, it may help you feel more at peace if you hold a small funeral. The style of the ceremony is completely up to you.


You may want to let each member of the family say something about the bird.
If you would like, you can say a little prayer or sing a song for the bird.
You can also observe a few moments of silence to honor your feathered friend.

, Whether you are burying a pet bird or a wild bird, you should avoid touching it with your bare hands. It may have died of a disease that you could transmit by touching it, so be very cautious. Wear disposable gloves if possible. Throw them away as soon as you are finished handling the bird.
If you can't wear disposable gloves, wear washable gloves or use a disposable pieces of flexible plastic, such as a plastic bag, to protect your hand.

, After you have handled the bird, it's important to wash your hands thoroughly in order to prevent spreading any germs that you may have picked up from the bird.Be sure to disinfect any surfaces in your home that the bird touched as well.
If the bird touched any of your clothing, wash them in the washing machine in warm water right away.

, Most of the time, it is fine to bury a wild bird on your property without reporting it, but in some cases, municipalities ask residents to report dead birds, especially during times of epidemic. If you are unsure whether any such rules apply in your area, contact your local department of public health.If you notice large numbers of dead birds, this is definitely worth reporting.

Join NAFA.",How to Become a Falconer," As with hunting, the laws surrounding the sport of falconry can vary greatly from one jurisdiction to the next. Before you consider becoming a falconer, get in touch with your local wildlife agency to ensure that falconry is legal in your area and that you'll be able to meet the requirements for practicing the sport.


A complete list of wildlife agencies for the U.S. and Canada is available at the website for the North American Falconers Association (NAFA).

Note: the rest of the instructions in this guide are intended only as general guidelines. Always defer to the advice of qualified wildlife experts.;
, The decision to become a falconer is one that will affect the way you spend your time for many years. Some things to keep in mind while making your decision include:


The training process to become a falconer is a very long one. As noted above, an apprenticeship alone generally lasts at least two years, while seven years or more may be required to reach master status.A raptor requires near-constant care with no days off or holidays. This usually amounts to about half an hour each day, every day, though on hunting days this can easily be four to five hours.If you can't care for your raptor personally (such as, for instance, if you go on a vacation), it will be your responsibility to arrange for its care in your absence.
A healthy raptor can live into its twenties, though many falconers eventually return raptors that they catch into the wild., Simply put, falconry isn't for everyone. While it can be an immensely rewarding, enriching experience, being a falconer involves doing things that some people may find objectionable or unpalatable. These include:


Killing animals. Most falconers use their raptors for hunting animals in some way. This aspect of the sport that requires an honest self-assessment: Are you comfortable killing wild animals? Are you emotionally prepared to see a predator capture and kill prey? Are you willing to put wounded animals out of their misery?

If you're not sure, strongly consider first trying out more traditional forms of hunting, which are often have lower barriers to entry for beginners.


Confining your raptor to a mews. Raptors are usually housed in an enclosure called a mews. Raptors are almost always happy and comfortable in a well-maintained mews, but some people dislike seeing animals housed in captivity. Note that most environmental surveys agree that falconry has limited impact on wild raptor populations.Cleaning and caring for your raptor. Raptors are reasonably clean animals, but being a falconer still requires getting messy sometimes. For instance, you'll need to occasionally clean your raptor's mews, which can accumulate waste, bones, and so on over time.

, It is hard to pinpoint an exact cost for becoming a falconer — experiences can vary greatly. However, it's safe to say that falconry is not a low-cost sport by any means. You should expect to spend at least several thousand dollars on your raptor over the course of its life. To be a falconer, you must be prepared to take financial responsibility for your raptor. Things that you will need to be prepared to pay for include:


Food for your raptor
Veterinary costs
Travel to meetings, hunting locations, and visits with other falconers
Licensing/permit fees
Shelter and equipment for your raptor — depending on local laws, this may also include an inspection fee
Books and reference materials

, To be a falconer, you must have hunting land on which to exercise your bird and practice your sport. This can't be just any land — in fact, nearly all urban and suburban land will be unsuitable for falconry. This land must have the appropriate type and quantity of game available for hunting.


Falcons require large open expanses of land on which to hunt high overhead while hawks and small accipiters can hunt in smaller fields and farms.
Land with roads, power lines, urban life, barbed wire fences or where gun hunting is permitted may be unsuitable because of potential threats to the health of the raptor or falconer.
Even if you do not personally have the land required, some farmers will permit you to use their land at no cost. Note that it is customary to offer farmers something small in return, like throwing them a yearly party to show your appreciation.
If you have friends who own large tracts of rural land, note that you may still need written permission in order to use their land.

, Still not sure whether you want to become a falconer? One of the best ways to determine if you have the motivation and drive to become a falconer is to learn as much as you can about the sport. Having the passion to learn about falconry from books, videos, experts, and other resources can indicate that you have the passion and dedication necessary for becoming a falconer.


A list of reading material recommended by the NAFA is available here.

A Bond With the Wild, a collection of essays assembled by NAFA, is a great resource for beginners to start to get a sense of what falconry is ""all about.""
You may also want to try talking to falconers via online forums and discussion boards. With over 20,000 members, the International Falconry Forum is a great place for old pros and novices alike to discuss the joys of the sport.

, Becoming a falconer isn't as simple as going out into the wild and catching a bird. Raptors are protected by state/provincial, federal/national and international law and you will need the appropriate permits and licenses before getting a hawk or practicing falconry. Contact your local wildlife agency as early as possible so that you will have plenty of time to complete all of the necessary requirements to legally practice falconry.


These permits can take quite a long time to be approved, so it is important to plan ahead. In fact, most falconry resources agree that it is best to apply for these permits a year in advance of the hunting season in which you wish to begin falconry.
Note that, in addition to a falconry permit, you may also need an ordinary hunting license, which can require you to take hunter education courses.
At this point, you will probably also want to schedule the test you'll need to take to obtain your permit. See below for more information.
Once again, here is a list of relevant wildlife agencies in the U.S. and Canada courtesy of NAFA.

, While you're waiting for your government paperwork to be processed, get in touch with the nearest falconry organization to start the process of becoming an apprentice. Not all states, provinces, or regions will have these sorts of clubs or organizations, but many do.



Here is a list of falconry club affiliates courtesy of NAFA.
Consider attending meetings at falconry clubs even if you aren't fully certified to practice the sport yet. This is a great way of meeting people, learning about the sport, and creating relationships which can later transition into sponsorships.

, Falconers progress through three levels of proficiency as they train: Apprentice, General Falconer, and Master Falconer.As an apprentice you are required to have a sponsor for at least two years. Sponsors can be either General or Master falconers. Different falconry clubs and individuals may have different requirements of their potential apprentices — some sponsors might even require an aspiring falconer to train with them for a year before they will consider sponsorship.


You sponsor is one of the most important connections you will have as a falconer-in-training. This person will help you learn, guide you, and give you advice over several years. Choose someone that you enjoy spending time with and that whose expertise you respect.
It is much, much easier to get an experienced falconer to agree to become your sponsor if you have a personal connection with this person and this person believes you to have a competent understanding of the sport. You'll probably want to start attending falconry meetings and browsing the reading material described above so that, over time, you'll pick up the concepts and terminology of falconry.

, In almost all jurisdictions, a written examination administered by your local wildlife agency must be passed before you obtain your license or permit. This examination will test your knowledge of birds of prey, raptor biology, bird health care, laws pertaining to falconry, and so on.


Generally, you will want to schedule your test well in advance (even as early as the very first time you contact your state/provincial wildlife department.) These agencies will usually require a fee for the examination and may only offer the test at certain times throughout the year, depending on your particular state/province.
Some example tests from Utah can be found at this website. Though the answers are not given, you can take the test and return it by email to see how you well you have done.

Note that some states/provinces require you to have found a sponsor before taking this examination, while others do not have this as a prerequisite. Ask your local wildlife agency to find out specific requirements.

, As noted above, raptors used for falconry are housed in structures called mews. Before you try to get a bird, make sure you have proper facilities to house it. Under the guidance of your sponsor (and while keeping local laws and regulations in mind), construct facilities to house your bird. These facilities will usually have to be inspected by your local wildlife agency before you can legally keep a raptor in them.


In general, facilities can be made out of wood or fiberglass and cannot have chicken wire on the roofs. Natural flooring, pea gravel, concrete or wood shavings can be used for the floor. There must be perches with at least one by a window. One bird will require a space of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m) high; this will have to be doubled with a wall in between for two birds.Many jurisdictions require an attached weathering yard where birds can be tethered with a leash.

These facility requirements can differ by region so, as always, contact your state/provincial wildlife agency for specific details.


You will also need a bath container and a reliable scale to monitor the health of your bird., Falconry requires specialized equipment to manage your bird. Required equipment can vary by bird species, individual and local laws and regulations, so check with your local falconry club to make your checklist. Making this equipment is often cheaper than buying it, and, if you're seriously dedicated to falconry, this can be a valuable skill to have. However, your equipment will almost always need to be inspected for quality at the same time as your facilities are inspected, so only attempt to make your equipment if you are an experienced craftsmen.


In most cases, you will need an anklet (leash to attach to the bird’s leg), an identification band, a button (braided end of a leash, also called a knurl), a creance (long line for training the bird), a gauntlet (left hand gloves worn by falconer), a hood, jesses (leather strips to which the lease will be attached), the leash, a lure (for training) and telemetry (for locating the bird when it goes out of sight)., Many sponsors will require apprentices to trap their first bird themselves. In the United States, apprentices are only allowed to catch an immature passage Red-tailed hawk or an American kestrel of any age (except in Alaska, where they may also catch Goshawks.) Although most jurisdictions will allow you to catch your bird at any time of the year, most falconry resources will recommend catching it in the fall and early winter, as this will generally give young birds enough time to become competent hunters while still remaining mentally malleable enough to tame. Note that falconry birds cannot be purchased for apprentices in the U.S.


Trapping a raptor is a topic that is too complex to explore in detail in this article. For a great first-time guide, try the trapping article at The Modern Apprentice website.
Make sure to get the go-ahead from your sponsor before attempting to trap your first bird. You'll also want to make sure that all of your applications and application fees been processed and that you've received all proper documentation before attempting to acquire your first bird., After catching your bird, most wildlife jurisdictions will require you to tag it in case it flies away and is found by someone else. Depending on your location, there may be additional paperwork you need to fill out in order to register your bird — as always, consult with your local wildlife agency for more information.


In the United States, you have 10 days to submit this paperwork after catching your bird.

, Now that you have captured your first bird, you are officially a falconer. Follow your sponsor's instructions carefully and be patient — it will usually take about six weeks to train your bird for hunting. See the linked article for more information.


In addition, the 1997 issue of Hawk Chalk (the official newsletter magazine of NAFA) has a great article on using a technique called Operant Conditioning to train raptors.You can find it here.

, As you move through the ranks of falconry, you'll enjoy greater freedom and privileges than you did as an apprentice. See below for a brief run-down of each classification as specified for Washington State (most jurisdictions will be similar):Apprentice Falconer

Only allowed to have one bird at a time
May take only an American Kestrel or Red-tailed hawk from the wild (Goshawks allowed in Alaska).
Expected to train extensively with sponsor.



General Falconer

May have up to three wild-caught birds at once.
Additional variety of birds available for capture (see state bill WAC 232-30-152 for more information.)
May sponsor an apprentice after two years at the General level.



Master Falconer

Must demonstrate ""at least five years experience as a General Falconer and show expertise in successful hunting and care of their birds, and experience with more than one species of raptor.""
May have up to five wild-caught birds at once.
May have an unlimited number of captive-bred birds for falconry purposes.



, Most falconers join NAFA, the North American Falconers Association, as apprentices. Membership in NAFA carries many perks, including access to falconry-related news, training resources, discussion groups, and much more. NAFA requires all applicants to fill out a simple application form (available for online submission and printing here). Membership dues must be paid when submitting your application and once per year after that — North American Membership dues are $45.00 per year, while Foreign Membership dues are $65.00 per year.


In addition, you will also want to plan on joining your state or province's falconry association (where applicable.) For example, falconers in Washington State should join the Washington Falconers Association.

These birds are ideal for people who don’t want to tame their birds and take them out of their cage to handle them. They prefer to remain in their cages and sing., Canaries are an easier breed of bird to keep as a pet than breeds such as a parrot or cockatiel. Canaries don’t like to be handled, and they don’t require exercise or daily human interaction. Canaries prefer to stay in their cage, flying around and amusing themselves.The ease of care for canaries make them good pet birds for families with children or elderly people.

, Canaries are most widely known for their beautiful songs, but only the males sing. They don’t squawk or scream like other breeds, but they also sing often through the daylight hours. You can’t train a canary to stop singing, so only buy this breed if you are okay with having a canary’s song in your home.The most common breeds known for their beautiful singing are the Waterslager, the German Roller, the Russian Singer, the Spanish Timbrado, and the American Singer., You can buy your canary from a local breeder, a pet store, or a bird show. Reputable breeders may be the best way to guarantee you are not going to get a bird from a bird mill. You also may choose to adopt a bird who has been abandoned and needs a home.Contact local vets and animal shelters to find out where you can adopt or purchase canaries in your area. You can also check online using pet finder websites.

It is very important to learn as much as you can about the species of birds that interest you, well before deciding which bird you will choose. The bird must match your lifestyle, interests and ability to take good care of it for the time it lives (which can a very long time for some birds). You must be willing to interact with the bird and provide daily interaction, as well as supervising time outside of the cage, where possible.


Don't buy a bird on impulse. You need the time to research the bird's needs and longevity before bringing one home. Check out books on birds or read online articles on bird species and specific bird requirements, to learn more about the different types of bird species.;
, Parrots, cockatiels and cockatoos, or parakeets tend to be some of the most popular types of birds owned as pets. Other good pet species include: Canaries, finches, lovebirds, doves and pigeons. The more exotic or less common the bird type, the more consideration you need to give as to whether it is one you can provide appropriate care for.

, Some birds, such as parrots, live long lives, so this should be a consideration when purchasing a parrot. Arrangements may have to be made to care for parrot after the owner dies; in some cases, you might consider taking on the responsibility of caring for a bird in such a predicament rather than getting a young one.

, Some birds will be able to share housing, while others might not get along; indeed, ""cage mate trauma"" is commonplace and can depend on such issues as personalities, size differences, gender and species.Although it will depend on the species, you might be able to house two boys or two girls or a boy and girl. If they fight, you'll need to separate them. Do plenty of research beforehand and ask questions of the breeder or retailer; you could even talk to bird keepers at your local zoo or wildlife refuge for advice.


There are often special methods needed for introducing a new bird to a cage with an existing bird. Talk to a veterinarian or bird expert for advice.

, The cage required will vary by type of bird; as such, be guided by the species you're choosing. That said, some fairly standard requirements include:


The cage size should be sufficient for the bird to stretch its wings from side to side. For some birds, being able to fly short distances within the cage may be an important part of ensuring it has a healthy living space. At a minimum, large birds should only be housed in a cage that is one and a half times the height of the bird's wingspan (depth, width and height).The cage bars should not be too small; the bird's talons might get caught on or in them if the bar wires or lengths are too small. Equally, the bars should not be so large that the head of the bird could get trapped or the bird could squeeze through and escape.
The bigger the space in the cage, the better. Although bird cages that are bigger tend to be harder to clean and are more expensive, if you are not in the house often and/or don't have time to take the bird out for exercise, space in their cage is critical. Small cages tend to lead to behavior problems., A simple rectangle cage is always the best. Circle cages are bad for the bird. There is hardly any space for the bird, and no corners to feel safe in. Moreover, the circle tends to cause the bird to twist its head; the bird can go insane from the constant turning and turning.


Never buy guillotine-styled doors, since they are easier to escape and dangerous if the bird attempts to escape and gets its head caught under the door.

, Never house more than one bird in a small cage. Birds need space to retreat, forage, fly and be apart from other birds, so the more birds being kept, the larger the cage must be. Aviaries (large cages that are akin to small sheds) are more appropriate for keeping several birds at the same time.


If keeping different species of birds, you'll need to be sure that they're compatible when placed together.

, The placement of the cage will be dependent on the climate you live in. If you have severe winters, with temperatures below zero, snow, etc., it is not appropriate to keep the birds outdoors during winter. If you live in a more temperate to warm climate, outdoor aviaries might be more appropriate than an indoor cage. Again, you'll need to research the needs of the individual birds, the temperature requirements and assess these needs against the typical climate in your area.


In some cases, a combination of an indoor/outdoor cage arrangement might provide the optimal housing arrangements for your birds. This could vary between seasons or weather patterns, or it could be a day and night arrangement.
Birds in hanging cages can often be transported outdoors to hang under a porch or similar place for daytime fresh air. Always remember to bring the bird back in before cool evening breezes and night air arrive.
See the ""Bird hygiene and health"" section below for signs of overheating or chilling in birds.
Location of the bird's cage will also be affected by the bird's personality. While a very social bird might love being the center of attention and seeing constant human traffic, a more nervous bird might be happier kept somewhere quieter and away from hustle and bustle (but still being able to interact with the family).
Avoid placing a cage in front of a window permanently. The bird will be on the constant lookout for ""enemies"", which can cause it to feel nervous.Putting a cage against a wall can give the bird a break from worrying about predators.

, This makes cleaning much easier, and the papers can be disposed of with ease, then fresh ones placed straight down for the next day's use. Keep a supply handy from your junk mail and newspaper reads.

, This should be a hard-sided carrier, such as a cat cage or a cage recommended by the breeder or store. Secure it well in the car, so that it will not move about during the journey home. A towel can be thrown over the cage to provide privacy but be sure there is adequate air flow for the bird to keep cool and breathe well.

, This also applies when moving the cage to another part of the house if it's still relatively young. Allowing for a settling-in time will help the bird grow accustomed to its environment in its own way, without feeling threatened by looming humans. However, be sure to leave it adequate food and water.

, Some birds thrive on specific types of food only, while other birds may be able to have a more generalized diet. Since precise dietary requirements are dependent on the species, you are advised to do careful reading on this topic in relation to the bird species you're choosing. Some general feeding observations include:


Ensure that you have correct feed for the species of bird. You must find the correct food for your bird, as some birds are picky, while others have very strict dietary requirements. Usually the bag/can of food will have a label telling you which bird it is for. If you don't know what the best food choices are, ask the breeder, the retailer or leave a question on a specialized forum of people who care for this species of bird.
You may need to put a bit of grit (sand or small rocks) in a bowl; some passerine birds need this to assist crushing seeds in the crop (chest area). However, not all birds need this grit, and if they eat too much, it can create a blockage.Finches and canaries tend to find a little grit necessary, but don't give it to budgies, cockatiels or parrots.Millet is a treat; never feed too much of it to birds. It is best used as a treat during training.
Bird pellets, crumbles or nuggets can be a good way of ensuring adequate nutrition for your bird; since these tend to combine all manner of needed seeds, vegetables, fruits and grains, there is less likelihood of the bird being picky and favoring only one food, thus the bird is more likely to eat a nutritionally balanced diet.Give your feathered friends the same kinds of fresh and healthy fruit and vegetables you enjoy, minus the dressings. This adds greens and variety to their diet. A mixture or variety of foods is both healthy and fun for birds.
Feed new seed daily; always empty out the eaten shells the same day too, as this keeps the seed fresh and clean.
If the bird you have requires nectar, this is a highly specialized diet and you must learn as much as possible about it before obtaining the bird.

, There are some foods that are not suitable for many species of birds. For example, don't feed the bird any alcohol, chocolate or avocado. Each of these contain chemical components that can be toxic for the bird., There should be a water dish provided; fill this daily with average temperature water. The water feeder should be checked daily to ensure that it is working properly and you must be absolutely sure that the bird knows how to use it. Change water daily to ensure that it is always fresh.


Have fresh dripping water if possible; it prevents fecal matter from ending up in the drinking tray.
Dehydration can occur very quickly in birds, within 1 to 2 days without access to water., Water and food cups should be located up high out of the way of any branches above them since birds often drop feces into their food, which isn't sanitary.

, This could be when you eat, or maybe earlier. However, choose a time and try to stick to it, so that the bird knows when to expect its food. If you want to stick to the natural feeding time of birds, feed approximately half an hour after sunrise and just before sunset.During the day, small fruit and vegetable snacks can be left in the cage.


Once again, know your bird. Smaller birds with a higher metabolism may need to be fed more often.

, You can make the eating experience more enjoyable for your bird by making eating time an interactive time too. For example, encourage your bird to eat a piece of food at a time, straight from your hand. Or, encourage your talking bird sing and talk for its food.

, Birds are smart and they need to do enriching things to keep themselves occupied and to stay mentally stimulated.

, Make sure they are bird-safe and that toes or beaks cannot get caught in any parts of the toys.


Items that are are not safe on toys used for birds include: Frayed ropes (could entangle bird feet and beaks); wire (might impale the bird); ""jingle-bell"" type bells (the bird's feet might get stuck in the small cracks).

, Change it up a bit! Birds can get bored with the same toys, day in and day out. Just like us, they enjoy variety and new things. By buying new toys, you increase their enjoyment and reduce the chances of feather plucking and other boredom-stimulated behaviors.


Aim to have differently shaped and textured perches for the bird's feet. Include some wooden perches, and some natural tree branches for variety. This helps ""file"" the bird's beak and nails, so there is less work for you. Just be sure to scrub natural wood thoroughly before use, and do not use any cleaning products because many of these contain ingredients can be toxic to birds.

, This will fulfill the bird's need to move about in search of food. You can also weave food into the bars of the cage, hide food inside a toy or an enrichment device and hang food from the top or sides of the cage. All of these will help to satisfy the bird's foraging instinct and is a form of mental stimulation.

, Regularly hold and pet the bird. The more often this is done, the more excited the bird will be to see you and will likely greet you with whistles, chirps and bird talk. It also makes it easier to get your bird for health checks and for it to be reassured by your presence.

, Daily exercise is recommended for all birds that are tame and can be handled safely. If you have a finch or other bird that is not meant to be handled, this is not an issue. But if you have a bird that you wish to handle, is living in a small cage, or just needs more exercise, be sure to include exercise for the bird on a regular basis. Just remember not to do this in a dangerous room, such as the kitchen, where a hot pot could be on.


Birds don't enjoy being cooped up all day. If you can release the bird from its cage regularly, it will be all the happier for this. This is an absolute must if you want to have a healthy relationship with your bird; birds can suffer a lot being trapped in cages all of the time, considering birds normally fly great distances in their natural environment.

, If your bird gets lots of attention, he or she will be happier as a whole and may even prove more loving and caring as a pet than without the attention. In some cases, a good level of attention can reduce shyness in some species of birds, as familiarity breeds reassurance.


Talk to your bird as it rides around the house with you. This is especially important during the first couple of years together. Birds are fast learners and will surprise you with their range of sound effects. For example, some birds will perfectly mimic the sound of water going down the drain while you wash the dishes, perhaps even mimicking the sound of you rubbing a cleaning rag over the stove, table and counter tops. Some birds can imitate the sound of appliances, such as an electric mixer, when it sees you take it out to make cakes or a smoothie.
Play music together. For example, your bird might learn to sing sweetly when you play the piano or other instrument. What a genius your bird is!

, Birds do not need to be cleaned as often as a dog; most likely the bird will clean itself in its water bowl, provided the bowl is large enough for it to use as a bath. Also, birds bathe to keep cool in warmer weather, so be sure to provide water for washing in when the temperature is on the warmer side.In hot weather, put the bird outside, either in its cage or on a perch (only have it out of its cage if its wings are clipped, so that it can't fly away). Squirt the bird with water from a spray bottle. Birds love the cooling sensation.
If it's cold outside, you can buy a perch that mounts to your shower wall by suction cups and give the bird a shower indoors. Many birds absolutely love this!
Provide a cuttlefish for the bird to scrape its beak against and sharpen.

, A clean cage reduces the changes for bacterial, fungal or viral infections from occurring in your bird. Regular removal of bird droppings is very important for maintaining good bird health. Moreover, a bird living in a clean environment tends to be a more active and happy bird than one living in filth. If this is something you're not prepared to deal with on a daily basis, then a bird is not the right pet for you.


Change the bedding regularly.
Remove droppings from perches/toys.
Remove uneaten food that has been sitting around on the base of the cage.
If your bird is molting (this is common with parrots, for example), there will be a need to vacuum up the molted feathers daily; this tends to occur when there is a warmer spell, or when the temperature goes over 10ºF.Only clean with basic, non-toxic cleaning supplies. Birds are easily poisoned, so find out if a product is safe for birds before using it.

, In some birds, such as parrots, this is essential to prevent serious or fatal flight accidents in the indoor or caged environment.Talk to your veterinarian about this requirement for your bird and find someone qualified to do it, should it need doing. Trimming is aimed at restricting, not preventing flight, and only the primary flight feathers are the subject of a trimming, so the trimmer must know what to do.Toenails may also need trimming, especially on larger adult birds. Usually toenails are not trimmed on baby or small birds, as they need them to stay on the perches, but adult parrots, for example, should be trimmed. Ask your veterinarian to explain how to do this safely, as if you don't know, you can damage the bird and cause bleeding.

, Most birds exhibit similar symptoms for being overheated or too cold and you must attend to fixing either situation as quickly as possible, or there is a risk of the bird dying. The things to watch for include:


An overheated bird: The feet will feel hot to touch, the bird may be panting (a rapid breathing rate), fluttering from the throat, red nares (nasal openings) and hot breath. All of these signs signal an emergency situation and you must contact the vet immediately.A freezing bird: The bird will hunch in, using its feathers to covers its feet and it will fluff out its feathers.Check for drafts, move the bird away from a cold room or area, and place the bird in a warmer spot. Windows can be a source of cold air during the winter months.

, Get your bird checked upon purchase and then regularly afterwards (at least once a year, or as advised by your veterinarian). Should the bird fall ill, this vet will be your first port of call for the best of care.


Do not wait when a bird gets sick. Birds can get even sicker very quickly; the sooner that the vet can see the bird, the better.

, In this way, you can teach it to come out of its cage and be sensible. This will give it much more freedom to enjoy flying around than remaining cooped up inside of its cage all day long. Training is a form of interaction and it plays a vital role in curbing abnormal behaviors.Without training, birds can end up biting, screaming, feather plucking and forming phobias.Hence, this is a very important part of keeping the bird happy and well-adjusted.
If the bird is very well trained, then you might even be able to take it into your backyard or someplace else which is outdoors, to give the bird a breath of fresh air, and so that it can get to know the place better. You'll need to be absolutely certain it is willing to return to you though.
Never train a bird to perch on your shoulder.This gives it easy access to pecking your eyes and face. Given the bird is at your height, it will be much harder to control.

, Ensure that the room the bird is contained in is safe. This includes closing blinds, rolling up cords, closing toilet seats, ensuring that hot radiators are turned off and checking that open fire places are closed off. (This also goes for simply allowing the bird to fly around in an enclosed space.)


Most birds need outside-of-cage time. This time must always be supervised and the space must always be safe.

, Even then, birds have different personalities, so don't expect it to talk or get used to you quickly. It will learn in its own time. Be ready for a sometimes moody and sometimes fun bird; the bird doesn't see its mood changes as abnormal, but it helps for you to accept that just as with humans, the bird's level of interest in being responsive and interactive varies over time.

, After you've fully trained them both, allow them to interact.

, Find ways to attract birds to the garden, including:


Growing the appropriate food or shelter shrubs and trees in your garden. Ensure there is plenty of shrubbery in your garden. Birds find insects on plants along with shelter and nesting locations. But don't plant too much - some plain grassland can help birds find worms and provides a bit of refreshing open space.
Keeping a water pond outside your house or on your balcony for birds to drink water from. Keep a small pot or bowl of water out on the windowsill or porch ledges. These water sources will ensure that the birds have easy access to water.
Providing a source of food, such as birdseed containers or hangers. Use seed varieties suited to the local birds.
Placing a hummingbird nectar feeder out to attract hummingbirds.
Laying out different foods, as different birds warm to different things. Find out which local birds frequent your area and focus on putting out the foods they are known to prefer.
Keeping your pets away from all the areas that the birds frequent.

, Even if you haven't provided nesting spaces, and birds are nesting in your yard, you can still be helpful by monitoring their progress and helping if needed. Some things you might like to do help wild birds breed in your yard include:


Put out nest boxes when it's nesting season, in appropriate and safe places.
If you find a bird's nest, make sure it is secure, especially if a wind/rainstorm is approaching. If the weather is bad or is going to be bad, it might be a good idea to take the nest down carefully and put in a small box and place it back securely in the same spot it was made. In rough weather, birds' nests can easily fall; if this does happen, it will often kill all the babies.

, This will depend on the bird's age and health:


If you find a baby bird, put it back in the nest if your children removed it.
If the baby bird has feathers all over its body, except under its wing, put it near some bushes or other covered area, close to where you found it. Be careful not to put it close to a red ant hill or your neighbor's cat.
If the bird is has few or no feathers, try to find the nest to put it back.
If you cannot find a nest, call your local wildlife rescue. Many birds are protected species and you require a license to care for them. For example all but three species in Texas are protected. They may instruct you to feed it wet dog food for a day or two until they can pick it up. Beyond that, pet food stores have formulas for baby birds.
Many birds put food in the infant's mouth; pigeons are an exception, in that the infants take food out of the parent's mouth. If a baby pigeon is being difficult to feed, find a syringe large enough for the baby to put its beak in after you cut off the front of it. Look online for a home made formula for pigeons; their dietary needs are slightly different.
A bird that falls off its perch may have a condition called rickets, due a lack in dietary needs. The wildlife group, internet or a bird breeder may have suggestions.

, If the bird appears to be alive, bring the bird to your house, and place the bird in a container (such as a shoebox, or something similar). Keep the lid off, as you don't want to suffocate the bird. Don't worry about the bird flying away; it is probably in shock and won't move for a while. As a precaution, if the bird does move, close the windows and doors in the room that the bird is in. Call the local animal shelter or humane society, as they probably know how to take care of birds. If you can, take the bird to the shelter/humane society, and they will deal with the rest. If they cannot take care of the bird, keep it around for a few hours and see if it starts responding to you and flying around. If that happens, it has probably recovered and you should let it out into the wild again. The following articles may be of some assistance:


Make baby bird rescue food
Care for an injured wild bird that cannot fly
Care for a baby bird fallen out of a nest
Care for a bird that has hit a window

Rescue a songbird, hawk or owl.


If the bird dies in the hours that you keep it, tough luck; you can't really do much. Take the dead bird outside and leave it somewhere secluded. Don't bury it unless you are sure that it is legal to do so where you live.

Decide between a yellow or red canary.,
Determine how old you want your canary to be.,
Determine if you want a male or female.,
Get a written guarantee if you buy a male.,
Look into which breeds are available in your area.,
Ask to see the canaries in a listening room.",How to Choose a Canary2," There are two types of canaries, those with yellow or white bases or those with a red base. Red birds can also be shades of orange. Yellow is the most common color, and the most prized have no other colors at all.White birds have shades of yellow on some of their feathers and tails. One type of white has no yellow at all.
Some canaries have brown and black pigments on yellow, white, or red bases.

, Most canaries have a lifespan of ten years. You may want to buy a younger bird so you can enjoy them for most of their life. However, you may want to buy or adopt an older bird who needs a good home, even if it is seven or eight years. Ask how old the bird is so you can decide if the age is right for you.Make sure the bird is old enough to determine gender. All young birds sing, so it’s easy to mix up a male and a female.

, One of the things you should consider when buying a canary is whether you want a male or female. Males are the only canaries that can sing, but they need to be the only bird in the cage. They will fight with other males, and may even fight the females.Females are very social and can be put together with other females.

, Sometimes, people will buy a male canary and find out later it is actually a female. Male canaries cost more than females, so you don’t want to get the wrong animal. If you are buying from a store, ask for a written guarantee that your bird is male.Ask about any return policies.
Your bird should start singing within two weeks. If it doesn’t, return it or ask for a refund for the difference.

, There are a lot of breeds of canaries. You are more than likely limited to which breeds are available in your area. Find a breeder if possible to figure out what breeds are available. You can find breeders through veterinarians, local bird clubs, or online.If you have to buy from a pet shop, look the canary over closely before purchasing.

, If you are choosing a canary because of their singing, you should hear it sing before choosing it. You can ask a pet store if you can take the canaries into a room without other birds so you can listen to them. If you contact a breeder, request to see only the birds you can buy.Separating the canaries from other birds gives you a chance to hear their singing voices without interference.

Choose a bird that is lively.,
Look for healthy plumage.,
Look for signs of physical problems.,
Examine the cage.",How to Choose a Canary3," When you choose a canary, you want to make sure it is lively and active. This indicates a healthy bird. It should be moving around, standing straight, and talking. Healthy birds will also be alert., The plumage of the canary you choose needs to be smooth and shiny. The feathers should not have any problems, like broken shafts or bald spots. The bird should be well-groomed and neat., Your bird should look healthy. The eyes should be bright and clear, with no signs of swelling or discharge. There should also be no nasal discharge. Take the bird in your hand and feel the chest. If you can feel the bone there, the bird might be too skinny.Bring the bird close to your ear and listen. Any clicking or wheezing in the respiration or breathing may point to disease.
If you have experience handling canaries, then gently catch it in your hands so you can inspect it. If you don't know how to catch it, ask the breeder or pet store worker to catch it or take it out of its cage so you can inspect it closely while they hold it.

, Look at the cage your potential canary is in. A clean cage is a sign of a healthy bird. Look at the droppings for signs of problems. Watery droppings or red in the droppings indicate potential problems.A crowded cage may also indicate an unhealthy bird. The bird should have plenty of room to perch.

Check to see if your property allows pets, including birds.,
Take good care of your birds.,
Set your prices appropriately.,
Advertise your birds.,
Keep your birds in such a way, that potential customers can easily examine them.,
Be as accommodating as possible.",How to Attract People to Buy Your Birds," If you don't own your home or business property, ask your landlord if you can have a bird sale. Make sure that whoever is buying your birds considers whether they can have them in their home, too.;
, Nobody ever opts to purchase an unhealthy bird as it's unappealing and will cost them a lot of time and money to get it back to health. If you have an unwell bird, raise it back to health yourself before you put it up for sale. What tasks you need to perform daily to gain some healthy birds are listed below.


Sustain your bird with a healthy diet. Birds generally live on a diet of aviary feed, seeds or pellets which contains nutrition for your birds to thrive. Be sure to choose a high-quality feed, don't get anything that looks dodgy. You can supplement your birds with fruits and vegetables but some vegetables might be bad to your birds such as hot peppers or avocados - don't take the risk, search up food that shouldn't be fed to birds.
Give your bird a fresh supply of water along with their meal. Make sure the water is fresh, clean and cool. You should top up their water supply daily and clean the container weekly.

Interact with your birds. Tame, friendly birds are in higher demand rather than skittish ones. Keep your birds happy and stimulated by providing a spacious cage with toys and mind games. If you want to take it to another level, train your bird (especially if it's a parrot).
Make sure every bird is healthy. Look out for any strange differences in appearance or behavior, and consider having them checked over by a vet. They should be active and flying. Make sure they have all the basic needs of care to make sure they are extra healthy at the time of sale.

, Look at current prices in pet stores and online/classified listings to find out what that type of bird generally sells for. Remember that many people prefer to adopt animals from shelters, and that laws pertaining to the sale and ownership of particular birds vary from area to area.Investigate any local restrictions and expectations before setting a price for sale.


Small aviary birds usually don't go for too much. Try to compete with nearby pet stores because if the birds in the pet store were cheaper than yours, people will opt to go there instead. Canaries usually go for $5-$20, finches go for about $40 and budgies go for $30. Try choosing cheap prices whilst creating profit for yourself.

, If you're going to look for buyers, you need to first let others know that you are out there. There are many ways to advertise, mainly through social media, websites, flyers or even local billboards. Here's a few ways and how;

Social media. Facebook is the best way to gain customers easy and fast. Create an account and seek a group that specialises in selling animals. Put in the price, a picture and description of your birds. You'll also want to state that you're a reliable breeder.
Websites such as Craigslist and Gumtree. Reach out to websites that let you sell animals on them, this is another fast way to get customers. Provide a title, picture, description and a way for viewers to contact you (email and phone).
Flyers. Create a professional flyer that states what birds you are selling, a description of them and you as a breeder, a picture and a way to contact you. You can hang flyers on poles and billboards or simply post them to mailboxes.

, If you're making an actual business of selling birds, you'll likely want to set up permanent housing and display areas for all of them so that potential buyers can browse and choose between them. If you're just selling one pet, setting up a long-term display area is less important.

, Do your best to answer all questions your potential customers have about the birds. This will help them feel at ease purchasing from you. Provide with an honest yet positive description about your bird. If the buyer is interested and ready to make a purchase make sure to state any warnings about the bird such as whether it bites, etc.


Your description can include whether your bird is tame, any tricks it has learned, it's good with children, doesn't fly off, what food it enjoys, etc. But what you will need to warn to any potential buyers, is whether the bird bites, claws, flies away, is noisy, etc.

Cut the other wing.,
Cut according to the bird's weight and strength.,
Check your bird's feathers monthly, clipping when necessary.,
Check in with your veterinarian.",How to Clip a Parrot's Wings," There are strong arguments on either side — both for and against clipping. Those who caution against it say that birds were meant to fly and we should not interfere with a parrot’s natural inclinations. Clipping the parrot's wings deprives them of this basic freedom.Consider other options first.


If you are planning to show your bird, it should never be clipped.;
, Parrots respond very well to clicker training, and you can train your parrot to return to you when called. You can also use clicker training to modify unwanted behaviors, which can help your parrot stay happy and safe.If you are not willing to do the work to train a parrot, then you may want to reconsider if getting a bird is right for you.

, There are some dangers to letting your bird fly free in your home. They can potentially damage their feathers, knock things over, and consume things that they should not. Many household items can be dangerous to parrots, including toilets and other standing water, lightbulbs and stoves that get hot, ceiling fans, cords to blinds, and windows and mirrors.Ask yourself why you want a bird if you don't want it to fly or don't feel that your home is a safe environment. Consider that a different pet may be more appropriate.

, Parrots are quick and can take advantage of any open door or window to get out. Once outside, it may be difficult to get bird back if you have not trained them. With clipped wings, the chance of escape is reduced. And if your bird does get out, it’s much easier to get them back., Bird wings should not be clipped until the bird can fly. Clipping too early can stunt the regular growth of the feathers., If you’ve never done it before, it’s advisable to have your vet do it the first time. That way you can see how it works and then decide if you want to continue to do it at home., Find an assistant, a towel suitable for the size of the bird, a sharp pair of scissors, and styptic powder, available at pet stores. Styptic powder is essential if you end up cutting too much and your parrot bleeds.If you don't want to clip your parrot's wings yourself, ask the assistant to clip them., Drape the towel over both of your hands. Stay relaxed and face your bird. Gently wrap the towel around it if possible. If not, toss the towel over the bird and gently but firmly place your index finger on the top of its head and your other fingers around the sides of its lower beak. This will prevent biting and allow you and your assistant to arrange the towel safely. Make sure the feet are secured inside the towel to prevent scratching.Birds are very sensitive to stress, and it is possible that the bird may have a heart attack when forcibly restrained.

, Pull a wing out of the towel restraint and find the primary flight feathers. These will be the last ten and longest feathers on the wing. Talk to your vet before you cut the first time — different birds (depending on size) might need different feathers cut., Leave a few centimeters between the cut end of the feather and the smaller feathers above. You may be tempted to leave the outer one or two alone for appearance's sake, but this is unadvised as this may be enough to give your bird the lift it needs to fly., These feathers are new and just starting to grow out, still endowed with a waxy sheath and plenty of blood supply for growth. You should be able to see the blood in the feather tube. Generally if you accidentally cut one of these, the blood will clot on its own. However, if you end up re-injuring one of these, the blood probably won't clot. If you are inexperienced, you should keep Kwik Stop or another styptic powder handy to immediately stop the bleeding. Birds have very little blood, so stopping a bleed quickly is important.

, Do it in the same way you did the first wing. Cutting less off both sides is much better than cutting one wing (making the bird list to one side and unable to fly)., A good wing trim will allow your bird to exercise the pectorals, or wing-flapping muscles, and will give it some coasting ability. Your bird shouldn't fall like a rock when it tries to fly, since landing on its chest can kill a heavier bird. Always trim less rather than more until you see how your bird adjusts. Heavier parrots like African Greys should be clipped less severely, while most cockatoos should be clipped more., Also decide on a day to be ""Clipping Day,"" and mark it on your calendar each month. This should be the day you inspect the parrot’s feathers — they might not be long enough to clip. Then you would mark another date in the future to see (one week, two weeks ahead) if the parrot’s feathers are long enough., Make sure that you are doing the trim as you are supposed to. Your vet will be able to give you suggestions if he or she believes you haven’t mastered trimming your parrot’s wings.

Consider your experience with parrots.,
Plan for the size of the parrot.,
Plan to accommodate the lifespan of a parrot.,
Decide if you want a more or less vocal bird.,
Decide how much time you have to commit to a parrot.,
Appraise the size of your budget.,
Accommodate other pets that you already own.,
Choose an individual parrot.,
Ask the pet-store owner about the individual birds.,
Prepare for your parrot’s diet.,
Purchase an appropriate cage for your parrot.,
Hang the cage in your apartment or house.",How to Choose a Parrot," Certain breeds are more challenging to own, and better left to experienced bird owners. Parrots such as budgies and cockatiels are best for beginners; Cockatoos, Amazons, and Macaws are better for advanced parrot owners.If you’re just interested in parrots but not ready to own one, consider fostering for a rescue group before purchasing a parrot, as they can live for sixty or more years.;
, You should also consider how comfortable you are with large parrots; some people are intimidated by Conures (which can reach 2 feet), and others can handle any Macaw (which can surpass 3 feet).Try going to a bird store or rescue to handle parrots of different species and judge how comfortable you are with various birds.
If you’re looking for a smaller breed, a parakeet or cockatiel may be more appropriate.
Larger parrots can also make more noise; if you live in a small apartment, a large Cockatoo is hardly going to make your neighbors—or landlord—happy.
Additionally, consider how a large bird will affect your life: is your roommate or girlfriend going to be happy with sharing you with a loud, protective parrot?

, Although there are exceptions, larger parrots generally live longer than smaller parrots.Smaller parrots are better choices for beginning parrot owners, while larger parrots are usually more demanding and better for experienced parrot owners.


Amazons may live up to 50 years, while Cockatoos and Macaws can live to be 80. On the other end of the spectrum, the average lifespan of a Budgie is 8 years, and parakeets live from 12-18 years., Parrots can wisely vary in their vocal range; some are quite loud, while others squawk less.Smaller, quieter birds—such as parakeets or cockatiels—are more suited to living in a smaller apartment., Large parrots are more social birds and only appropriate if you’re prepared to commit a large amount of time to your parrot (at least 60 minutes a day).If you’d prefer to just watch your parrot and dedicate a smaller amount of time to caring for it, a better fit would be a pair of budgies or Lovebirds.
Ask yourself: Are you or another family member home most of the time, or is your family constantly on the go? If you work full time and are seldom home, a parrot isn’t an appropriate pet.

, Parrots are expensive pets. Large parrots especially are expensive to buy, and more often than not even more expensive to care for. Just like you would with a dog, you have to take your parrot to a vet every year for a “bird wellness check.” Decide on how much you’re prepared to spend on the parrot, and then consider which parrots would fit your budget.


You’ll also have to spend more on a cage the larger the parrot is, and it can be more expensive to hire a business or person to care for a large parrot while you’re traveling.

, Although parrots make excellent pets on their own, they do not always get along with other pets. Large parrots such as Macaws can be territorial and defensive, and may attack smaller pets.


Large parrots such as Macaws and Amazons—and even smaller parrots like Conures—are a big time commitment.
Parrots generally do not socialize well with cats.
If you bring home a young parrot and another pet (e.g. a dog) at roughly the same time, the two pets will grow up together. This will increase their likelihood of getting along socially, as the two pets will be very comfortable around each other.In addition to social factors, time is an issue. Parrots need frequent socialization and maintenance, and are time-intensive pets. If you already own several other pets, a parrot may be too much of a time commitment.

, Like buying any other type of pet, there is no objective ruling on which individual parrot (e.g. one out of fifteen cockatoos) will make the best pet.Rather, see which individual bird interests you the most. When selecting your pet, you should:


Make sure you understand the adult behavior of the breed you’re looking at. Some cute, quiet juvenile parrots may grow up into loud, abrasive parrots.Spend time—about 30 minutes—watching the birds. See which birds seem more social, active, and engaged. Consider choosing one of these, as these birds will make more fun, interesting pets.
Decide which bird appeals most to you, by looking at its plumage and watching its behavior. Choose a parrot that you find visually appealing and whose personality you will enjoy living with for years., The owner will have spent substantial time with the birds in the store, and should be able to give you advice about which bird(s) will make good pets. It’s especially important to talk to the owner if you are a first-time parrot owner.


The location of a pet store itself may influence the type of parrot that you purchase. If you live in a large metropolitan area, you can likely find any breed you like—otherwise, you will be limited by local availability.
Ask the owner if any of the parrots have been showing signs of lethargy or illness. Do not choose one of these birds as a pet.

, You should feed your parrot once a day, and provide parrot pellets or “parrot mix,” available from your local pet shop.Since parrots are tropical birds, you should also provide a selection of fruits and vegetables each day.


A poor or inadequate diet is a common cause for illness in parrots. By making sure your parrot receives the nutrition it needs, you’ll keep it in good health and save on future vet bills.Parrots can eat nearly all foods that are commonly consumed by humans, including:Cooked meat and fish.
Peanuts and cheese.
Do not give your bird chocolate or avocado; both are poisonous to them.

, The cage is a major purchase (in both expense and importance) and should be planned ahead of time. Buy your parrot as spacious of a cage as possible, and remember that a simpler cage will be easier to clean.Cover the bottom of the cage with shredded newspaper—this is easily replaceable, cheap, and can be changed frequently., The location of the parrot cage is important. Do not place it near doors, as the bird may escape. Also avoid housing your parrot cage in the kitchen; cooking fumes can be fatal to your parrot.Although you will need to take your parrot out of its cage to socialize it, do not leave the bird unattended out of the cage. Parrots have powerful beaks, and can destroy furniture, drapes, etc."
"
Prepare with the right supplies.,
Provide enrichment and toys.,
Feed appropriately.,
Let them sleep.,
Clean cages daily.,
Provide the right diet.,
Provide care and mental stimulation.,
Know how to care for their health and grooming needs.",How to Care for an Eclectus Parrot," Eclectus parrots require many items for their husbandry.


These include a large cage preferable larger than 1.5m x 1.5m x 1.5m. The cage should have strong metal bars not able to be bent by hand. It is recommended the cage has a seed catch tray as parrots are very very messy. The cage should be large enough that the bird wing tip to wing tip can stretch out. It should have corners, not be round.
Inside the cage, use perches more than 4cm in diameter. The perches should be made of safe native plants not straight plywood.The base should allow feces to fall through and be regularly cleaned.;
, The cage should be filled with activities for the parrot to do while you are not with them or they are locked in the cage. Toys specifically made for parrots are best but you can also make some easy DIY ones, as long as they do not have anything that can be swallowed or the parrot could become caught in.


Rope toys are dangerous, as the fibres may be ingested, resulting in crop impaction which can kill parrots. Sticking to native string ropes like hemp is a safer option.
Metal toys need to be inspected for any peeling or rusting to prevent heavy metal poisoning (the cage should be checked, too). Plastic toys are better for ease of cleaning but make sure they are not brittle or have broken edges.

, For feeding Eclectus parrots, something which is durable and easily cleaned is best. A perspex box is a new option on the market allowing the bird to sit inside and eat its food without making a mess. These less mess options are best for reducing the prevalence of rodents and other pests.


Alternatively, stainless bowls are a great option for ease of cleaning. The screw on sides are the best for Eclectus as they are highly intelligent and will tip over bowls that hang on the side of the cage. The bowls must always remain in the holders, apart from during cleaning, as they can be dangerous to Eclectus.
Another food delivery option is to hide food in cardboard boxes, toilet paper (check for any harmful chemicals first), or paper. It is great enrichment as well as encouraging foraging behaviour, which the parrots would do naturally in the wild for many hours.

, Eclectus parrots require about 10 hours sleep a night. Keeping sleep patterns regular and not keeping them awake can prevent them from becoming hormonal.


Birds breed when the daylight hours are longer, so if you keep your parrot awake for longer, he/she will believe it is breeding season resulting in issues such as aggression, regurgitation and mating like rituals which should be avoided.
A cover over the cage, such as a blanket, can be used, but a room with curtains drawn preventing light is better to prevent harmful pathogen growth.
A night cage especially for sleeping is used by some owners; these simulate the bird going to its resting place, as it would in the wild, which is different from its day cage.
The sleep cage is normally smaller than the day cage, with only enough room to move around stretch wings prune etc. Some toys and water should still be available. Noise also in that area should be kept to a minimum.

, Remove the floor covering and clean the bowls to prevent growth of harmful pathogens.


Parrots love to throw food to the floor of the cage, which if soiled with feces buildup, will increase the risk of pathogens such as intestinal worms.
The floor of the cage can be lined with paper, such as newspaper or plain paper, for ease of cleaning. Things such as artificial turf or other artificial substances should be avoided.
Paper-based kitty litter may also be used, but avoid not paper alternatives as these can cause impaction.
Harmful chemicals such as cleaning chemicals can kill parrots, so bird safe alternatives should be used. These are normally purchased from pet stores.
Bowls with fresh fruit and vegetables should be removed and cleaned optimally twice daily, as fresh produce attracts flies and will possibly grow harmful microbes if left too long.

, Eclectus diet is one of the most challenging part of owning this parrot, they require large amounts of fresh produce which can be very costly. It is important to consider not only the cost but your own willingness to buy fresh produce and prepare the meals daily if not twice daily for your bird before owning an eclectus parrot.


Eclectus are rare in that they have a really long digestive tract so they are better at absorbing nutrients than most other parrots. This means artificial vitamins and minerals can easily overdose a parrot such as those in some pellet brands and supplements.
80% of an Eclectus diet should be fresh food; this includes fruit, vegetables, sprouts, beans for example. The other 20% should be made up of a pellet or seed mix, as well as nuts occasionally.
The fruit and vegetables given to an eclectus should have the following base ingredients (always used): Peas, carrot, corn, apple, aloe vera, broccoli, chilli, papaya, paw paw, pumpkin and seeds, passionfruit, kiwi, pear and banana. From this list, normally five or six base ingredients are chosen. Seasonal variability means that certain fruits or veggies will not be available but it is easy to choose one in season.
Berries are a huge hit with Eclectus and have important vitamins and minerals. Strawberry and raspberries are some of the favourites but there are other good choices, too.It is important that if not intending on breeding your parrot fruits are kept at a reasonable level as high sugar fruits spark hormonal changes. In breeding season, more sugary fruits should be made available, too.
Dark green leafy vegetables are also a great addition; for example, kale, spinach, zucchini, bok choy etc. are excellent
Pomegranate is another favourite, full of nutrients.
Protein should be given in moderation; beans and legumes are a great source of protein. Cooked eggs with shell occasionally are also a good source of protein.
Vitamin A and D supplements are advisable if your parrot is housed indoors and not on a pelleted diet.
Sprout seeds are a great addition to the diet with seeds; these include chia seeds, mung bean, oats, spelt, millet, pumpkin seed, sesame, quinoa, peas, sunflower, for example.
Flaxseed meal or hemp seed meal are great for essential fatty acids not found in pellets or cooked food. Sprinkle lightly on fruit and veggie mix.
Beans and grains should be soaked and cooked
Sweet potato and yams should also be cooked to unlock nutrients.
 Plain organic yogurt can be given, wild salmon can be given occasionally.
Seed mixes without sunflower seeds are a good treat snack (1 teaspoon max). Nuts such as almonds are a good addition to diet.
Pellets such as Roudybush and Vetafarm are good diets for eclectus, give sparingly and avoid coloured pellets and those with artificial flavours.
Safe microgreens, edible flowers, herbs and weeds are also a great addition to the diet.Adding apple cider vinegar (organic) to the food has unproven scientific ""benefits"" but it is useful in deterring fresh produce consuming bugs by lowering the pH.
Researching native foods of eclectus is also a great way to find good additions to the diet.

, Eclectus parrots need a large portion of your time devoted to them. They need to exercise not only their body but their minds. They should be playing out of the cage at least 4hours a day.


Interaction with your parrot is a must; it can be watching TV or even playing games with your parrot.
Training such as clicker training is excellent for settling in a new parrot and helping them learn acceptable behaviour.
Play stands are excellent allow the bird to have a perch with treats and activities while being able to stretch fly around and not be confined to his/her cage.
Good careful handling with respect and being gentle is the best way to build a trusting relationship.
Time and patience may be needed to deal with biting or aggression, but almost all issues should be resolvable with the right care and attention.
It is important to note here that a parrot, especially an eclectus, is not like a puppy. They do not come prepackaged to love and trust you, some do but most do not. They need to build trust with you, and new people.
Eclectus will be noisy and they will bite. Sometimes they may cause you to bleed but returning the bird to its cage, or ignoring is the best reaction as negative reactions or even reactions will result in the bird repeating or exaggerating the behaviour.

,


Have regular visits to an avian vet minimum yearly visits. Know where your closest one is before purchasing your bird.
Eclectus parrot should not need their wings clipped there are other alternatives such as harnesses, not allowing them to free flight in the house unattended or teaching basic recall before allowing them to fly around.
Eclectus parrots get very sharp claws these should be clipped by someone who is trained as within the nail their is blood vessels which if cut will bleed (birds have delayed blood clotting so it can even be fatal).
Eclectus should be allowed to bathe (most prefer a spray shower) daily or at least every second day.

Invest in a parrotlet training program.",How to Care for a Pacific Parrotlet," Pacific parrotlets are very active and need plenty of room to fly around. A cage measuring 18” x 18” x 18” is the minimum for one bird. For more than one, you'll need to get even larger cages (28” x 24” x 36” for two birds). The cage should have around 3/8-1/2 inch bar space (the spaces between the bars), so that the parrotlet can’t get out unattended., You’ll want to make sure one side is against the wall, though, so the parrotlet can retreat away from a busy room when it wants. You’ll want to keep in mind the following when placing the cage:Don’t put the cage in the kitchen as cooking fumes and smoke are deadly for parrotlets.
Make sure the cage isn’t in direct sunlight.
Make sure the room temperature is no more than 80 degrees.

, Aviaries can be much larger cages, and will provide your parrotlets with even more room than the ordinary cage. Some are even 5-6 feet wide!They are great, especially if you plan on keeping more than one bird. However, only one pair should be kept in a single cage or aviary., To avoid problems and sores on the feet of your parrotlets, provide them with at least three or four different kinds and sizes of perches. You may have the traditional swinging perch, and then a branch-type perch, and a rope perch. There are all kinds of perches out there, you may have to try out several to see you’re your bird prefers. Keep in mind that variety is best for parrotlets., You’ll want a variety of toys, including shreddable toys, hard toys with bells (like those designed for cockatiels), and bird kabobs. Finding the right toys for your bird may require some trial and error, but nearly all parrotlets love toys they can tear apart. Make sure you provide a variety, and switch out the toys to keep the parrotlets entertained.Avoid toys with hazards such as movable parts, wire, and string., The liners should be replaced daily, and food and water dishes should be washed thoroughly daily. The cage should be cleaned thoroughly (wiping down cage bars, cleaning perches and toys, and any other accessories, etc.) at least once a month. Sometimes you'll need to clean the cage more often than that, depending on whether you have multiple birds and the habits of your particular bird. When using cleaning supplies, make sure to move the parrotlet first, as the fumes can be dangerous to the bird., This can include carrots, peas, broccoli, and squash, among others. You don’t need to cook the vegetables, but if you use frozen, just make sure they’re thawed properly. Remove any leftovers after about a day.Safe veggies include: asparagus, all bean varieties, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, corn on the cob, cucumbers, peeled kiwi, pea pods, red leaf lettuce, cooked sweet potatoes, and zucchini.
Vegetables to avoid include spinach and other vegetables with Oxalic acid (such as beets and peppers), avocados, and onions., This can include grapes, apples, and berries. Just as with the vegetables, if the fruits aren’t eaten within a day, you’ll want to remove them from the cage. You might want to cut up fruit for your parrotlet, so they can handle it better.Safe fruits include: apples without core, bananas, blueberries, cantaloupe, pitted cherries, grapes, guava, mango, nectarines, oranges, papaya, pitted peaches, pears without the core, plums, pomegranates, prunes, raisins, raspberries, and strawberries.
Fruits to avoid include: grapefruit, starfruit, and tomatoes

, This should be pellet-based rather than seed-based. You can even buy food mixes that are specifically formulated for parrotlets.No matter how high quality the food, it is really important not to rely on seeds as the primary food for your parrotlet. Fruits and vegetables are necessary, so don’t skip on the variety the parrotlets need for a healthy diet.Your parrotlet's diet should consist of about half formulated food such as pellets and half other foods such as fruits, seeds, and vegetables., These include chocolate, fried foods, avocado, and sugar. Chocolate and coffee are detrimental to a bird’s health because of the caffeine and other toxic ingredients.Other foods to avoid include the following:Raw peanuts
Cooking oils
Herbs and spices
Aloe Vera
Alcohol

, You’ll want something sturdy that the parrotlets won’t easily break with their beaks (thick glass is good). Parrotlets are often used to food at the bottom of the cage, so avoid the type that attaches to the cage.Make sure the it doesn’t have a cover or hood, as many parrotlets won’t put their head in that kind of dish., However, as many parrots self-regulate, you can keep more food than that in there, especially of the pellet variety. You'll want to clean out excess perishable food at least once a day., You'll want to refresh the water once or twice a day. You might even want to use bottled--but not distilled--water, as some birds like the taste. A water bottle is preferable to a dish, as birds tend to develop more infections when they use a water dish, even if it's regularly cleaned., Sometimes these symptoms can be easily missed, so it is necessary to monitor your bird’s health closely. Often, when birds die suddenly, it’s because the owner thought the bird looked fine, when the bird may have been sick for a while. You’ll want to watch for the following symptoms:Broken or chewed feathers
Changes in eating habits
Sores (on feet, for example)
Lameness
Flaky beak or skin
Swelling or redness around eyes.
Feather loss around eyes.
Wheezing
Leaning to one side

, While many of the signs listed above do not warrant emergency care, there are some symptoms that do require immediate care. With parrotlets it can be essential to see an emergency vet quickly if your parrotlet has any of the following symptoms:Significant changes in bowel movements
Significant changes in eating habits (Excessive or decreased)
Behavior or personality changes
Being too quiet
Significant changes in breathing (rasping, couching, wheezing, etc.)
Injury
Significant change in weight
Significant swelling
Nasal, mouth, or eye discharge
Vomiting

, This should be at least once yearly. Once the parrotlet reaches 10 years it might be good to start having checkups twice a year. You should also take your parrotlet to the vet anytime there are significant changes in behavior., This will help the parrot keep from getting territorial and nippy. You want the parrotlet to feel like part of the flock, so make sure to interact with the bird frequently. This is the basis of being able to train the bird. If you can't handle the bird, you will have trouble training it., Parrots actually give their young names--or unique chirp sequences--in the wild, and so you should be able to name your parrot with repetition.You can start with being affectionate with the bird and assigning a phrase to that behavior such as ""I love you."" Once the bird has made the connection between the word and phrase, you can connect its name by saying, ""I love you, Polly."" The bird will soon learn its name as the name gets attached to more commands., Pick a treat that you rarely give them but know they love.Nuts and seeds are good training treats, as they’re small, yummy for the parrotlet, and not very messy. Be careful not to use a reward immediately after an unwanted behavior, as you might accidentally reinforce that behavior., A clicker is often used in dog training, and can also be effective in parrotlet training, as it allows you to identify quickly the exact moment the parrotlet does what you want. To get the parrotlet to associate the click with treats, you’ll want to start with simply clicking and treating, until the parrotlet comes to expect treats with each click., Once you’ve identified a specific behavior with a click and a treat, you’ll want to label the behavior with a word or phrase. Pick short words and phrases for best results, such as “sit” or “touch.” Make sure you practice doing this, until the bird connects the behavior with the word. Then you say the word and wait for bird to do the behavior before treating., You’ll need to watch your bird for signs of a pattern in their behavior. Then you’ll need to label the behavior with a phrase such as “good potty” so the parrot starts to associate the behavior with a word or phrase. And you’ll need to reward the bird initially whenever the bird defecates, so they’ll start to be able to control their bowel movements. Once they’ve got this down, you’ll want to give the command on specific occasions or in specific areas, and then reward them for doing as you’ve asked. Finally, you’ll introduce “no” for when you don’t want them to defecate. You may even need to hold their tail down so they get the idea., If you’re struggling with training, or you have a bird that’s too nippy, you may want to invest in a training program. You’ll want to make sure the program has good ratings on the Better Business Bureau website. You may want to check with your vet and see if they have any recommendations for specific trainers or training tips."

Housing your parrot.,
Include some toys.,
Provide the right food.,
Take your bird to the vet.,
Spend time with your parrot.",How to Care for a Senegal Parrot1," Senegal parrots need roomy cages. The minimum size is 20 inches (50.8 cm) long by 20 inches (50.8 cm) deep by 28 inches (71.12 cm) high (for one parrot), but bigger is always better. Due to their clever dispositions, pick a escape-proof one (though some Senegal parrot owners may realize ""escape-proof"" isn't necessarily true)., Parrot toys are very necessary. Get lots of them, including puzzle toys and disposable/destroyable toys. Finally, you'll want to add some other essentials, such as food and water containers (preferably stainless steel), a seed guard, and wooden and rope perches., High-quality pellets should make up about 70% of your Senegal's diet. Healthy veggies--like kale, broccoli, parsley, and hot/sweet peppers--should make up about 20% more. Special treats--like fruits, nuts, and small amounts of dairy--should make up no more than ten percent. Never feed your Senegal junk food, chocolate, or avocado., Parrots have a natural tendency to hide any pain or sickness as long as they can. To help catch any problems early on, it is crucial to bring your Senegal in for an annual check-up. The vet can also trim your Senegal's nails and wings.Your vet is likely to suggest doing expensive (but potentially) life-saving blood tests at your regular check-up.
Trimming your Senegal's nails is necessary, and trimming their wings is mandatory for the safety of you and your Senegal.

, Senegal parrots need a lot of attention. If you own a single Senegal parrot, they will need 1-3 hours of your attention each day. This time should spend out of the cage.If you have two parrots, they can keep each other company and you may not need to pay as much attention to them.
Never force your parrot out of the cage when it doesn't want to go.

Own your feelings and behaviors.",How to Deal With Your Mom When You Are Mad," Sometimes the worst thing you can do is blurt out the first thing that comes to mind when you’re upset; it will most likely be ill-thought out or hurtful to both your mom and you in the long run. Instead, take a minute (or as much time as you need!) to understand your anger. Try saying:


“Mom, I’m feeling really frustrated and need a little bit to think about all of this.”
“I’m kind of upset right now, but I’d like to keep talking about this later.”;
, When you are mad, it is very important to try to cool down a bit before confronting your mom. When you feel yourself getting really angry, try one of these ways to calm down:Calm yourself by repeating soothing things to yourself, such as “You are okay, just calm down” or “Take it easy, everything will be okay.”
Leave the situation and go for a walk or a run. Exercising will help relieve some of the intensity of your anger, and the time away will give you time to think.
Try slowly counting to 10 before you speak (or a higher number if you need more time!).
Focus on slowing your breathing. Take slow, deep breaths through your nose, and then slowly exhale out your mouth. Repeat this until you feel your heart slowing and your anger subsiding.

, Once the immediate, fiery anger has subsided a bit, determine the outcome you want (to get the car keys, to be allowed to go to the party, more allowance, etc.) and consider ways to discuss this with your mom in a calm way.Keep in mind compromising goes a long way! For example, if your mom won’t let you borrow the car, try saying, “I understand that you don’t want me to take the car, but what if I put $20 worth of gas in it before giving it back?” and see what she says.


Try to find a middle ground with her, and be prepared to make a sacrifice to reach a compromise.
Try offering to do extra chores around the house, like doing the dishes or cleaning your room.
Show your mom you are really trying by doing things without being asked, like helping set the table for dinner or practicing your instrument.

, When talking with your mom (or anyone for that matter), it is okay to disagree with someone as long as you avoid being disrespectful or aggressive. In order to have a constructive conversation, be sure to:


Use “I” statements to discuss your feelings and thoughts from your perspective, which is less argumentative and can help steer the conversation with your mom in a positive direction.For example, try saying “I feel a lot of pressure to do all of these chores when I still have so much homework left” instead of, “You make me do so much housework that I have no time for myself!”
Avoid putting down her beliefs or ideas. You don’t have to agree on everything, but saying things like “That’s a stupid idea!” is counterproductive.
Focus on the present, and don’t dredge up all past grievances. It will confuse your point of view and quickly escalate the conversation into an argument.Be respectful and avoid sarcasm at all costs; it is the fastest way to derail a positive conversation.Instead of responding, “Yeah, I’ll get right on that Mom” try saying, “I know you want me to do that right now, but would it be all right if I did that after I finish this assignment?”
Don’t play your parents off of one another. This will only cause the situation to escalate, and even more feelings could get hurt.

, Even though it’s hard to believe that your mom could be right, it is still important to hear her point of view. She could have reasons that you haven’t considered! Regardless, you should respect her by hearing her out, just as you want her to respect you and hear your side.Try restating and summarizing after you hear her side.For example, you could say something like, ""Mom, let me see if I understand you correctly. It sounds like you're saying I can't have the car on weeknights because of school, but you are okay with me using it on Saturday night if I put gas in it. Is that right?""
This has two benefits: it shows you were listening to your mom, and it allows her to clarify anything that may have been misunderstood.

, You might not get your way this time, but that doesn’t mean that you haven’t successfully dealt with being mad at your mom. Ultimately, she is the authority figure, and you must mind what she says. But know that your calm, rational discussion with her will make her respect you more, which will undoubtedly benefit you in future disagreements., After you and your mom have had a chance to say your peace and you have expressed your opinions effectively and appropriately, you must move on in one of the following ways:


If you are unable to come to an agreement, then agree to disagree. Because you need two people to argue, if you see that the conversation between you and your mom isn’t going anywhere, disengage from the argument and move on. Try saying, “Mom, I feel like we are talking in circles now, and I think we should table this conversation for the time being.”If you do come to an agreement, acknowledge the accomplishment! Be sure to apologize if you need to, and be humble when saying “I forgive you” to any apologies from your mother, but after that a simple, “I really liked how we handled that. Thanks, Mom” will go really far moving forward., Anger is a normal emotion and a common reaction to things that upset us. It is important to realize that expressing anger can be a good thing, and that avoiding anger entirely can actually lead to larger, more harmful blowups with your mom later., Being mad at your mother is often a way to cover up your real feelings or a way to express that you have needs that aren’t being met.As you feel anger growing inside of you, take a minute and ask yourself, “What is this feeling really about?” Some common underlying feelings are:


Vulnerability
Embarrassment
Fear
Insecurity

, When dealing with your mom, it is important to know what triggers you to feel mad so that you can not only avoid these situations with her, but also so that you are prepared to deal with being angry in a healthy way if the situation is unavoidable.Some common triggers include:


Invasion of space or privacy
Discussing grades or school responsibilities
Privileges being revoked
Asking about relationships with friends or significant others
Arguments over chores

, If you tend to get mad at your mom due to certain words or circumstances, your anger is most likely situational; try avoiding these types of situations and talk to her about how certain words trigger you. However, if your anger is extreme in nature and occurs often or with minimal provocation, your anger might be chronic; consider reaching out to an outside party, like a therapist, for help with these more complex feelings., The more often you address issues as they come with your mom in a clear, levelheaded way, the more likely she is to recognize that you are growing up, and thus she can trust you and your decisions and opinions more. Set ground rules and build trust and security with your mom, and you will be mad at her (and vice versa!) much less moving forward., In addition to healthy discussions with your mom as situations arise, it is also important to prevent anger from building up inside of you. Some common outlets include:Listening to music
Exercising
Writing down your feelings and thoughts
Deep breathing
Talking with a trustworthy friend

, It is easy to feel like your mom doesn’t understand you or to blame her and others for all of your problems, but these are very counterproductive reactions. Rather than asking why this is happening to you, take responsibility for your own feelings and your own part in a situation. If you don’t, you will continue to make the same decisions and have the same fights with your mom.

Having a suicidal parent is stressful enough without adding any additional burden of responsibility. Help to the extent that you can, but recognize your limits. You can aid in recovery, but it is not your responsibility to heal your parent of his mental struggles; that is the role of a therapist or counselor.


Children tend to blame themselves for a parent's mental health. They often feel if they were just more obedient, or sensitive, or mature, (or otherwise more perfect) that they could somehow make the parent all better.
If you find yourself overwhelmed, take a less active role. Do not feel ashamed at needing to take care of yourself as well.;
, Although this may seem obvious, it's important to show concern by asking questions if your parent talks about suicide. You won't cause additional harm by asking caring questions.


Many people who are suicidal will come up with a specific plan. Knowing how, when, and where he plans to do it will give you key information that you can pass on to your professional mental health provider.

, Isolation is tempting for people who are feeling suicidal, but this can make the situation worse. Support your parent to the best of your ability by helping out around the house, cooking meals, cleaning, and being a supportive presence. Beyond that, ensure that there is adequate social and professional support.


Does your parent have caring friends he can talk to? Other family members? A spouse?
Does your parent have a supportive community, such as church or another social group?
If all else fails, there are crisis hotlines your parent can call to have someone to talk to. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number is 1 (800) 273-8255. This service is freely available 24/7 and is confidential.

, Whether the cause of feeling suicidal is mental illness or something else, entering therapy can provide the kind of relationship and safe space necessary for your parent to process those problematic feelings.


Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an evidence-based treatment that can help your parent examine and change core beliefs/thoughts that may lead to suicidal emotions.
Interpersonal therapy is an evidence-based treatment that can assist in coping with personal relationships and help to assess and work on personality issues, reducing the desire to escape by committing suicide.
Tell your parent about therapeutic alliance, or the importance of a good patient-therapist fit. Research shows that ""fit"" is one of the most important aspects of patient recovery. Encourage him to look for the right therapist, even if that means ""shopping around.""

, Prescription medications exist for many of the primary causes of suicide, such as depression and mood disorders. Have him ask his healthcare professional about medication options.


Antidepressants can help with depression, although there may also be danger of increasing suicidal thoughts, so be sure to have your parent discuss this decision with a medical professional.
Make sure your parent is following doctor's orders with regard to any medications he is already prescribed. Quitting psychiatric medication is a delicate process that should be coordinated with a healthcare professional. Being inconsistent in taking medication or trying to stop cold turkey can cause problems such as anxiety, irritability, fatigue, headaches, nausea, and dizziness.

, Call emergency services, your mental healthcare professional, or tell someone close by (such as a family member or adult friend) if you think that your parent is in immediate danger from a suicidal impulse.


Wherever possible, remove dangerous objects from the house. If one of your parents owns a gun, talk to an adult (aunt, uncle, other parent) about making sure it's safe from being easily accessed by the suicidal parent.

, Dealing with a suicidal parent can be mentally exhausting and emotionally stressful. A complex series of emotions can be the result. In order to understand what you're feeling and find ways to cope, look for these common reactions:


Shock. A suicidal parent can come as a strong surprise. Nobody expects things to get this bad, especially with the person who is supposed to be taking care of you.
Anger. Parents are your caregivers, so it may seem unfair for you to have to deal with all this emotional stress. It's normal to feel angry.
Guilt. You may blame yourself for what is happening simply because you are close to your parent and the real causes may be less visible.
Confusion. You may not know how to respond, so you may fall into a state of confusion over what's going on and how to cope with the situation.

, Self-blame is a normal reaction to a parent being suicidal, but it actually stems from misunderstandings about the complexity of suicidal emotions.


The desire to commit suicide results from a number of different factors, as this guide discussed in the previous section. You are not the cause. In fact, it's unlikely that there is one singular reason for the way your parent is feeling. Suicide is not a simple, rational choice.

, There are things you can do to help yourself and your parent, but this doesn't mean that you have ultimate control over what happens and what has happened in the past.


The unfortunate reality is that sometimes suicide happens even when the family and extended support network has done its best to be supportive and provide a caring environment. This doesn't mean you shouldn't try, because those efforts can make all the difference, but the point is that some things exist outside of our control. Do everything you can, but with the recognition that you can't do everything.

, Therapy is not just for your parent with suicidal thoughts. A suicidal parent is an extremely taxing burden, so don't feel bad if you need outside help.


Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help you come to terms with the emotions and thoughts that can arise as a reaction to your situation.
Search for a therapist near you: click here.

Be sure to find a therapist you can trust and confide in. If you don't find that person on the first try, don't settle! Therapeutic alliance is one of the most important factors for successful therapy.

, Thinking and worrying obsessively about your parent won't help them or you. Develop effective coping strategies to stay healthy and keep yourself from falling into the same problems as your parent. Although most of the research in this area discusses grief after an actual loss, some of it applies to the potential of loss as well:


Grief and worry are not enough, it takes continued activity to process these difficult emotions and keep your life positive. Sports, other hobbies, and spending time with friends can act as a vaccine against despair in this situation.

, In addition to professional help and maintaining an active lifestyle, don't forget to keep in touch with your own friends and other family members! Social support is essential for your ability to cope with the high emotional demands of a suicidal parent.

, If you are worried that your parent may be considering suicide, look for these outward signs and risk factors so that you can catch the problem before it's too late:


Past suicidal attempts. This is one of the biggest risk factors for actual suicide.
Outbursts of rage. Although this can signal other things as well, it's a common indication of suicidal intent.
Increased risk-taking behavior, such as drinking and driving. A parent who feels suicidal may start to care less about personal safety.

, Behavior isn't the only indication of being suicidal; you can read the signs in what he talks about as well.


Talk of suicidal intent. Your parent may explicitly state how he feels.
Self-hatred. This is a strong ingredient of suicidal thinking.
Being a burden. As many suicidal parents feel guilty, it's likely he will feel like he is burdening those in close proximity, including you.

, Despite what some people may think, suicide is not as much of a choice as it is a combination of natural forces and factors. Some of these forces are:


Mental illness. 90% or more of people who commit suicide had a mental illness at the time of their death. The most common illnesses are depression and other mood disorders, substance abuse disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders such as bi-polar and borderline.
Serious medical issues. Cancer, HIV, and other illnesses can cause people to experience hopelessness and other desperate emotions which sometimes result in suicide.
Biological factors. Research shows that people who commit suicide often have differences in brain structure, especially the areas of the brain related to mood, thinking, and stress response.
Environmental stress. Things like prolonged bullying have been linked to an increased risk for suicide.

, Suicide is often thought of as a solution to a problem. A suicidal parent is trying to escape from a variety of problems and painful realities.


Believing that the people in their life are better off without them.
Failure to live up to personal standards. Many people who want to commit suicide are wrestling with unrealistically high standards for themselves and their lives.
Self-blame. These people blame themselves for not measuring up to the tasks of life, unrealistic or not.
High awareness of failure, so that they are constantly and painfully aware of how much they're failing to match their ideal self.
Anxiety and pain result from these issues. The state of mind that sometimes ends in suicide is extremely painful and hard to bear.
""Cognitive deconstruction,"" which refers to how people think about their lives as a simple, unchanging experience of sadness and pain.
Finally, disinhibition, or the final step that comes about when a person thinks that a drastic measure such as suicide is necessary to overcome their current predicament.

This in itself that may lead them to figure it out. This can also be a way to get them more comfortable with the idea of you hanging out with girls (if that is not something you have done much before) or having a girlfriend. You can say something like this:


“My friend Jessica and I are going to the movies tonight…”
“Oh, Jessica’s giving me a ride to the party. You know, she's Hugo's sister and plays field hockey.”
“Jessica just gave me this new book. She’s always right about my taste. I totally love it so far.”
This is best done earlier in the relationship. Mentioning later that you have been dating a girl for a few months--and they have never even heard her name--that will tend to be more surprising and possibly upsetting.
You may have been doing this all along and not realize it.;
, It is best to find an appropriate moment to tell your parents about your girlfriend in order to maximize your chance of getting get the most positive reaction. What this would be will depend on a lot of things, including your parent(s), your culture, what is going on in your family, and and so on.


Try to find a time when they are both free and relatively unstressed. However, with some parents that may be easier said than done.
You can decide whether you want to tell them both together, or if you should tell one parent who may have a better reaction first. If you think they will both have a similar reaction, then telling them at the same time may be easier.
Try not to worry too much about getting things ""exactly right"". There may not (and probably will not) be a perfect time to announce your newly found status as a boyfriend. Go for a time and place that seems reasonable.
It is your parent's responsibility to handle your news, not yours. Having your first girlfriend is a rite of passage as much as needing your first shave or getting a driver's license. These are things you are supposed to do, and if your parents do not handle it well, that is not your fault. It is their duty to receive the news and deal with it as a parent of a teenager or young adult. You dohave a duty to consider their feelings and communicate with them respectfully as a young person, but if you do that...you have done your part.

, If you really want to have the best possible conversation about your girlfriend, then you can’t go around spending all of your time with her and neglecting your studies, your chores, or your time with your family. Instead, you want to continue doing all of the things you excel at well, so your parents can’t say, “So that’s why you’ve been slacking off…” when you tell them you have a girlfriend.


You don’t want them to think your girlfriend is a negative influence on you before they meet her. In fact, if you’re doing even better in school than ever before, then this can make them think she’s having a positive impact on your life.
Of course, it can be hard to focus on anything but your girlfriend, especially if you’ve never dated anyone before and are head over heels. Just remind yourself that it’s important to maintain a healthy balance in your life; your relationship will be all the better for it. If you want to be around your girlfriend 24/7, that may be a bit of too much, too soon.

, This is certainly a possibility, especially if you’ve been friends with the girl for a while, or if you’ve brought her up so many times in conversation that it’s impossible for your parents not to wonder what’s really going on. You should actually take comfort in this fact, if this is the case; this will make telling them your big news so much easier!


If your parents have asked if you have a girlfriend, have given you a knowing smile when you mentioned your girlfriend’s name, or have even spoken about their dating experiences when they were your age, then there’s a good chance that they already do know the score.

, If you’re feeling uncertain about what to say to your parents, then your girlfriend may have some great advice to give you. She can support you and encourage you that the conversation won’t be as terrible or painful as you think, and she may even give you some pointers about how to tell them. In fact, she might have even told her own parents already and can assure you that everything will be just fine.


Plus, your girlfriend probably wants your parents to know the truth so you don’t have to keep sneaking around anymore. She’ll help you feel better about your plan.

, One way to make good things happen is to envision success before the big day. Though it sounds corny, it can help you to close your eyes, imagine yourself telling your parents that you have a girlfriend, and then having them have a positive, or at least not a negative, reaction. This can help you feel more relaxed and confident as you make your plans to have your big talk.


Also, keep in mind that, if you told your parents you had something important to tell them or wanted to have a talk with them, they may be imagining something far worse than you having a girlfriend! Chances are that they will walk away feeling relieved.

, If you can possibly tell your parents the news without your grandmother or pesky older sister in the room, then that may give you the best outcome. Your parents may have enough to deal with without your grandmother shaking her head or your sister saying “I knew it!” in the background. If you’ve scheduled a time and place to meet, then try to make it so that no other family members will be home at that time.


If you do have a sibling who is always around, be kind and respectful and tell him or her to give you some privacy when you do talk to your parents. If you explain the situation, then your sibling will understand; just try not to tell your sibling the news (if you haven’t already) before you tell your parents, or he or she may spill the beans.

, When you tell your parents your news, you should treat them with kindness and respect. Though it’s perfectly natural for you to have a girlfriend, remember that it may take them a little while to get used to this idea and to see that their little boy is growing up so fast. You don’t want to drop the news on them in an uncaring or flippant way, making it sound like it’s no big deal. Though you don’t have to give them your news in the most dramatic fashion ever, you should be kind and sensitive when you do tell them.


Put away your phone, make eye contact, turn your body toward them, and give them the love and attention that they deserve.
Use courteous language, such as “I thought you should know,” or “I know this may be difficult for you, at first…” to show that you’ve really thought this through and care about their reactions.

, You don’t need to give them a big and elaborate speech about how you’ve wanted a girlfriend for so long or list the twenty best qualities of your girlfriend after you’ve told them the news. Just tell them that you have a girlfriend, mention one or two nice things about her, and tell them that it’s important for them to know because you want them to be a part of your life.


If they’ve met the girl or have heard of her, then you can say something like, “You both know I’ve been spending a lot of time with Jessica recently. Well, the truth is that we started dating—she’s my girlfriend. She’s really funny and smart and you guys will love her once you spend some time with her. I’m really excited to be dating her and I want you both to know.”
If they’ve never heard of your girlfriend or met her, then you can say something like, “I want you both to be a part of my life and to know what’s going on with me. There’s something new and exciting that’s been happening, which is that I have an amazing new girlfriend. Her name is Jessica and we met on the Student Council. She’s really sweet and smart and I know you’ll like her once you get to know her.”

, Once you tell your parents the news, it’s likely that they’ll want to follow up. Make sure you’ve planned your big talk so that you leave some time to chat with your parents after you give them the news. They may want to know things like where you met your girlfriend, how long you’ve been dating, or what she’s like; this is perfectly natural and you should be patient with them instead of dismissive.


They may also not have anything to say right away because they’ll be processing what you’ve told them. You should still stay with them and wait for them to talk to you a bit more instead of ending the conversation.
It’s likely that your parents will feel a bit left out, and telling them more about your new relationship will make them feel closer to you, even if it’s a bit uncomfortable or embarrassing for you.

, Of course, it’s understandable that this news will be important for your parents, even if they accept it completely. They’re used to seeing you as their little boy, even if you’re a grown teenager, and it may be hard for them to think of you forming romantic relationships with girls. However, this is an inevitable part of life, and even if it’s a challenge for them, at first, they’ll have to get used to the idea of you dating once they have some time.


You can’t help the fact that you’re growing older and developing an interest in the opposite sex. You can’t let your guilt about your parents seeing you in a new light keep you from exploring new and exciting relationships.

, If your parents are really struggling to wrap their minds around this or if you’re just sitting there in awkward silence, then one thing you can do is ask them if they remember what it was like to be your age. If they look back to their teenage years, or even their preteen years, if that’s the case, then they’ll likely remember also having an interest in members of the opposite sex, and maybe even having a girlfriend or boyfriend or two. This can help them soften toward the situation and see it as a natural process.


If they say that they weren’t interested in dating at your age, then they may be bluffing; even so, you can casually mention that a few of your friends are also dating without making it seem like you would do something just to copy your friends.

, Once you’ve told your parents the news, your reaction will vary a bit depending on what they say to you. Still, though, there are some things you can do to make them feel like they’re more a part of the process than just outsiders in your life. You can do this by casually asking them for some dating advice to make it seem like you still do care about their opinions. You don’t have to ask them anything too serious, of course, but as they get more comfortable with the idea of you having a girlfriend, here are some things you can ask about:


What to get her for her birthday
How to ask her to the school dance
What to do on a date with her
How to tell her a piece of important news

, Another way to massage the situation is to show your parents what an awesome girlfriend you do have; after all, you’re dating her for a reason, aren’t you? If you want them to be more accepting of the situation but don’t feel like they’re really ready to meet her, then you can start by telling them a few things about her that will make them more open to the idea of you dating her. Here are some things you can mention:


Her positive personal traits
Her successes in school
What sports or extra-curriculars she participates in
The the things she cares about
A bit about her family or background

, Another way you can make your parents get more used to the idea of you having a girlfriend is to show them that being with her is actually making you a better person. While saying, “She’s been such a positive influence on me, Mom!” may make it too obvious, there are ways that you can get this point across and show them that you and your girlfriend are a great match for each other. Here are some things you can do:


Tell them about how you and your girlfriend are studying together
Tell them about new things your girlfriend introduced you to, such as new movies, books, articles, or ideas
Talk about ways that your girlfriend has encouraged you to pursue your goals, such as telling you to run for school president
Talk about how your girlfriend supports you, from going to your soccer games to baking you cookies the night before a big test
Work on being a kinder, more caring person around them—they’ll be sure to see that your girlfriend is having a positive impact on your behavior

, If your parents aren’t too happy about the idea of you having a girlfriend, whether it’s because they think you’re too young, that you’re neglecting your studies, or if they’re more conservative and have an idea of the type of person you should be dating, then you have to give them time. You have to understand that, even if having a girlfriend seems perfectly natural to you, your parents may need a bit more time to get used to this idea; don’t force too much on them at once and give them some space as they get used to the idea of you with your significant other.


If they’re less-than-thrilled at the idea of you having a girlfriend, then you should wait a bit before you bring her around or introduce her to them. Then again, you shouldn’t wait forever; once they meet her, in fact, a lot of their fears may disappear.
Of course, if your parents are purposefully keeping you from seeing your girlfriend, then you need to have a talk about why this is not acceptable.

, If your parents are accepting or at least tolerant of the fact that you do have a girlfriend, then you may want to make things easier for everybody by introducing your girlfriend to them. You don’t need to invite her over for dinner or do anything formal at first; just have her come over to say hello to your parents before you head out together, or have her quickly meet them after school when they pick you up to test the waters a bit.


Once your parents see that your girlfriend is a normal preteen or teenager just like you are, they will be closer to coming to terms with the situation, or even to being happy about it. Your parents may even be excited for you to explore this part of your life, however nervous about it they may be.

Try to resolve the issue with your sister.,
Seek a compromise.,
Walk away from the situation, if needed.,
Ask your parents to get involved.",How to Deal With a Big Annoying Sister (for Teenagers)1," Even when you and your sister have set strict boundaries, you both will test each other’s baseline limits from time to time. When this happens, try your best to resolve the conflict before either of you reaches your breaking point.


Let your sister know what the problem is, using “I statements.” For example, “I feel belittled when you talk to me like a little kid” or “I feel angry when you choose not to respect my clothing.”
Avoid the word “but.” This negates everything you’ve said before. For example, instead of saying “I see where you are coming from but I think you’re wrong” try “We can’t seem to agree on this.”;
, If you can't resolve the issue, try to reach a compromise. Offer to change one thing about your behavior and urge her to do the same. Over time, these small concessions will have a big impact on your relationship.


For example, you could offer to knock every time you want to enter her room and she could offer to say ""Hi"" to you at school.

, If the conflict escalates out of control, remove yourself from the situation. This is a great way to control your anger. Walk away from your big sister and cool off. When both of you are calm, you can try talking again.

, If you’ve failed to resolve the issue on your own, ask your parents to step in as mediators. Once you’ve both shared your side of the story, let them help the two of you reach an agreement.


Take responsibility for your role in the conflict. This will show your parents that you are mature.

Make a habit of chatting with your parent regularly.,
Share stories about your own life.,
Ask your parent questions about their past.,
Define your reasons for asking about your parent’s previous marriage.,
Lead into the conversation by talking about a more general topic.,
Listen without judging.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Ask for advice.,
Keep the lines of communication open.",How to Ask About a Parent's Previous Marriage," Tell your parent about interesting things that happen to you, and ask them how their day is going. You don’t have to talk about big, important topics. Little conversations, like telling a funny story or discussing what to have for dinner, can also help you keep the channels of communication open.If you don’t currently talk to your parent much, establishing this habit will probably take time. Be patient and persistent, and don’t try to force a connection too soon – let it happen naturally.
If you and your parent aren’t very talkative, or if you don’t live together, try establishing a connection by texting or emailing them more frequently.;
, Talk with your parent about things that happen to you at school, at work, or with friends. Sharing personal anecdotes will help your parent feel like they know you well, and it will make them more comfortable telling stories about their own life.Whether you’re a teenager living at home or an adult who moved out years ago, volunteering information about your life will help your parent feel like you care about staying in touch. This will make them more likely to return the gesture.

, Show your parent that you want to get to know them better by asking questions about where they grew up, their own parents, and other pieces of their history. Many kids show little interest in learning about their parents’ youth, so your mother or father will be flattered, and they may be more inclined to talk about their previous marriage too.For instance, you might want to ask your parent about what life was like when they were your age, how they got along with older family members you never knew, or what childhood events they remember most fondly. This can all set the stage for more intimate questions later on.

, Ask yourself what you hope to gain from this conversation. Also, clarify what you want to know. It will be easier to have a productive conversation if you plan out your questions ahead of time, so write down your thoughts.For instance, you might want to ask why your parent got married to their previous spouse, or how that marriage changed their life. Understanding your own motives fully will help you know which questions to ask and how to guide the conversation.
Find a good time and place to talk. Talk to your parent when both of you are relaxed and in a good frame of mind. Choose a quiet, private place to chat. Avoid talking to your parent when they’re stressed, unhappy, or busy with something else.For instance, you might decide to have the conversation during a quiet afternoon at home, or over lunch at your parent’s favorite restaurant.

, Approach the topic of your parent’s previous marriage by talking about something like marriage or families in general first. This will warm both of you up to the topic, and when you bring up the subject of your parent’s own marriage, the transition will seem less abrupt.For instance, after bringing up the topic of marriage, you could say something like, “What was your experience the first time you were married?”

, Depending on how they feel about their previous spouse, your parent’s earlier marriage might be a sensitive topic. Listen to them with empathy, and avoid saying anything critical or judgmental about their relationship or divorce.Avoid interrupting your parent as they talk, and ask thoughtful questions to ensure you understand their point of view.
Don't be surprised if you have a lot of different feelings come up as you learn things about your parent's past. It is common to get stuck seeing your parents as only ""mom"" or ""dad.""

, Your parent may feel uncomfortable discussing their past, or may wonder what your motives are. You can reduce tension and prevent them from becoming offended by modifying your language. ""I"" statements are designed to let you take responsibility for your feelings or concerns without making your parent feel at fault.


For example, your parent may be worried that you will chastise them about getting a divorce. You can minimize the fault-finding by saying something like, ""It's hard for me to picture you having a life before this. I want to know you better--that's why I'm asking."" This will go over much better than, ""Wow, I can't believe you hid this from me!"" which sounds accusatory., When put on front-street about their past, some parents may shut down. One good way to encourage your parent to open up more is to ask for advice based on their own experience. Most parents are happy to share their hard-won wisdom, especially if their kids take the initiative in asking them to.If you ask for advice, don’t dismiss what your parent says. Listen with an open mind and thank them for sharing their thoughts, regardless of whether you agree or not.
You could say, ""I really appreciate you talking to me about this. I want to learn more about you, and also want to learn from your experience.""

, There's a chance your parent may refuse to discuss their previous marriage with you at first. They may have unresolved feelings about the relationship such as sadness or resentment. Rather than taking this refusal personally, encourage them that you are willing to talk if they ever change their minds.


You might say, ""I guess I caught you by surprise when I brought this up. I understand if you feel uncomfortable talking about it. Like I said, I just want to learn about your earlier life. I'm here if you ever feel ready to discuss this.""

Take it easy on yourself.",How to Deal With a Pregnant Mother1," Whether you are angry, scared, upset, anxious, jealous, or even just completely excited, there is nothing wrong with what you are feeling. Change, whether you consider it to be good or bad, is very stressful, and you can feel lots of different things at lots of different times--or all at the same time!


Pregnancy and the birth of a child can be some of the most stressful times in a person’s life.Your life is in transition right now, and transitions are not always easy.;
, Find a close friend or an adult you trust to talk about what you are feeling. A supportive person will listen without judgment and will not tell you to feel a certain way.

, Maybe you are stressed about taking on extra responsibilities in the house, or sick of always hearing about the new baby. Let her know what is bothering you in a respectful way.


Instead of saying, “You always talk about the baby! You don’t care about my life!” try saying, “Sometimes I feel like all you talk about is the baby coming. I’d like to talk about my life with you, too. I miss talking to you.”
Instead of saying, “You make me do everything around here!” try saying, “I know you’re tired and there’s a lot to do right now, but I am feeling overwhelmed by everything you are asking of me. Can we come up with a list of ways I can help you out and stick to those?”

, Keeping a journal during this time can help you work through some difficult emotions. This is also a good option if there is not someone available to talk to., Being pregnant isn’t easy.

Learn to spot perfectionist expectations.,
Talk to your parents.,
Try to determine their motives.,
Devise a solution together.,
Tune out criticism.,
Focus on your own needs and desires.,
Consider talking to a therapist.",How to Cope with Perfectionist Parents1," Take some time to learn about perfectionist tendencies. Perfectionists often equate mistakes to failure, and set high personal standards. A perfectionist parent may also:Set high expectations for their children
Frequently criticize others' actions
Doubt in others' ability to accomplish tasks
Emphasize organization and order;
, Let your parents know how their unrealistic expectations make you feel. They may not know how their behavior is affecting you.Be as tactful as you can, especially if you think your parents aren’t intentionally making you feel bad.
For instance, say something like, “Dad, it really means a lot to me that you always come to watch me play soccer, but when you compare me to my teammates, I have a hard time enjoying the game.”

, If you can spot the underlying reason behind your parent's perfectionist tendencies, this may help you better cope. Plus, bringing awareness to what they are doing just may help them decrease the behaviors.You might ask your parents, ""Can you explain to me why you hold me to such high standards? Where do these beliefs come from?""
If you don't think your parents will be open to this type of dialogue, it may be practical to talk to other family members or try to understand your parents' upbringing.

, If your parents are willing to work with you, you can think of potential solutions together. For instance, you might set stronger boundaries with your parents or enforce consequences when their perfectionism interferes with your life. You might also ask them how you can help them decrease these undesirable behaviors.For example, your dad doesn't approve of your boyfriend so he constantly tries to scare him away and sabotage the relationship. You might say, ""Dad, I know you want the best for me, but I love Damien. I think he's a good choice for me. If you can't respect my dating decisions, I will have to stop coming around so much.""

, Instead of taking your parents’ criticism to heart, look for ways to let it roll off you. Remind yourself that your parents’ standards aren’t reasonable. If they frequently criticize everyone, not just you, keep in mind that their behavior is a long-established habit.A mantra can be helpful when you’re learning to tune out criticism.
For instance, try telling yourself, “This is only my mother’s perfectionism talking.”

, If you’re in the habit of ignoring your own wishes, start paying attention to what you want. Live according to your own values and goals instead of endlessly chasing your parents’ approval.For instance, if you are in school, take classes and participate in extracurricular activities that reflect your interests.
Putting your own needs first might take some practice if you’re in the habit of trying to please others. Remember, though, that you are the one who has to live your life – not your parents.

, Children of perfectionists are especially vulnerable to developing anxiety disorders and depression. If your mood has taken a turn for the worse, or if you’re struggling to cope with the pressure of your parents’ expectations, make an appointment with a mental health professional.If you are a student, you can probably talk to a school counselor for free.

Examine your own behavior.,
Control your reactions.,
Be honest with your sister.,
Control your interactions.",How to Deal With a Big Annoying Sister (for Teenagers)2," Before you address your big sister’s annoying habits and mean words, take time to review your own actions. Whether you would like to admit it or not, you may not be completely blameless. Your sister may have started the fight, but your response might have prolonged the fight. Consider the following:


Did you do or say anything to provoke your sister?
Did you react out of anger?
Were your actions and words intentional or unintentional?, While it is tempting to “get even” with your sister, this often makes the situation worse. Instead of hurling insults back at your sister, put an end to the incident with a sincere response. If she continues to bother you, get up and walk away instead of resorting to physical violence.


Don’t let her words affect you. For example, you could say “Maggie, what a funny story. I’d forgotten about that. Thanks for sharing.”
Being the “bigger” person is always the best option. It will keep you out of trouble., When your sister hurts your feelings, don't react in anger. Instead, let her know how her actions hurt you. This is a great way to start a serious conversation with your sister about your relationship.


For example, you could say “Maggie, please don’t tease me in front of my friends. It really hurts me and makes me uncomfortable.”

, No matter how hard they try, some siblings just can’t get along. If this describes you and your big sister, limit the amount of time you spend together. Not only with this reduce the number of fights you have, but the distance might make you two appreciate each other more.


Spend your free time in separate parts of the house.
If you share a bathroom, pack your items into a tote and get ready in a different room.
If you share a bedroom, ask your parents if you can sleep somewhere else."
"
Identify your limits.,
Share your limits with your sister.,
Respect your sister’s limits.",How to Deal With a Big Annoying Sister (for Teenagers)3," Look back over the conflicts you’ve had with your sister. Identify the source of the issue and take time to think about how these conflicts could have been avoided altogether. Try to pinpoint the times that she has pushed you over the edge and consider how you could you have prevented the fight from escalating to that point. This information will help you identify your limits—the baseline and peak of your tolerance for your sister.


Instead of manipulating you into doing something, you would like her to ask you for help or a favor.
For example, when she starts to yell at you, will you walk away from the conversation? Or, if she bullies you, will you tell your parents?, If you feel comfortable approaching your big sister, you may find it helpful to talk to her about your boundaries. Make sure she understands that you are setting these boundaries because you want to have a healthy relationship with her. After you share your limits with her, ask if she can respect your boundaries.


For example, you could say, ""Linda, I want to establish some boundaries with you. I will not tolerate you bullying me any more. When this happens, I will let mom and dad or another adult know right away.""

, Like you, your big sister will also have boundaries. Ask her if there is anything you can do to avoid conflict in the future. Remember, if you expect her to respect your boundaries, you must respect hers.For example, you could say, ""Linda, do you have any boundaries for our relationship?""

Be aware that your mom is exhausted.,
Don’t take her mood swings personally.,
Get some ginger ale ready.",How to Deal With a Pregnant Mother2," Try to be understanding that her body is working hard to adjust to the demands of pregnancy. She might need to miss some of your activities to rest. , Moodiness is common throughout pregnancy, but particularly in the first trimester. Combine this with exhaustion, and sometimes it might seem like all she does is snap at you. Be patient with her, but do not be afraid to talk to her if she has hurt your feelings. , The first three months of pregnancy can be a rough time as your mom’s body adjusts to being pregnant. The changes in hormones can make her sick to her stomach.


Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is called morning sickness. While morning sickness frequently happens in the morning, every woman is different. She may also throw up in the evening or be nauseated all day long.You can help your mom feel better by finding food and drinks that settle her stomach. Ginger ale, saltine crackers, pretzels, and peppermint tea are some suggestions, but ask your mom what works for her!"
"
Try to enjoy the second trimester.,
Find her favorite foods.,
Do something special with your mom.",How to Deal With a Pregnant Mother3," Things may feel more “normal” during these three months, as your mom may find her energy level increasing and morning sickness dissipating. You will also notice her starting to look pregnant. If you are interested, there are lots of way to be a part of this time.


Feel the baby kick. Most women start to feel the baby kick around 16 weeks of pregnancy.You might be able to feel the baby kicking from the outside when your mom is around 20 weeks pregnant.Ask her to tell you when it is kicking and if it’s okay to touch her belly.
Go to an ultrasound appointment. Your mom will likely have an ultrasound/sonogram when she is around 20 weeks pregnant. An ultrasound technician will take pictures of your sibling for you to see. If she wants to, she will likely be able to find out the sex of the baby at this appointment. You will learn if you are having a brother or a sister!

, It’s true, pregnant women have very strong cravings for certain foods! Maybe you can find her favorite ice cream, bring home dinner from her favorite Chinese place, or make her the sandwich she wants while she is resting on the couch. You will make her day!

, Because this is generally the “easiest” trimester, your mom will have more energy and not be so uncomfortable yet. Plan an outing to a favorite restaurant or activity. Take some time to bond with her now, because it will be hard for her to find the time for a while after the baby is born.

"
"
Let her rest.,
Get everything ready.,
Know your mom isn’t crazy.",How to Deal With a Pregnant Mother4," The exhaustion that your mom had at the beginning of pregnancy has probably come back. Unfortunately, insomnia is common at this stage, and so is discomfort due to the baby’s size, so it will likely be hard for her to get good sleep.Give her permission to take a nap if needed.


Mood swings and just general grumpiness have probably come back.She is uncomfortable and not sleeping well. Do your best to remind yourself (and her) that this is temporary.

, Have you noticed how much stuff babies need? You can help make things a little easier on your mom by offering to help her prepare for your little brother or sister’s arrival. There is a lot to be done. Here are some ways you can help:


Help prepare the nursery. This could be anything from painting the room, putting together a piece of furniture, or washing and putting away baby clothes.
Throw a baby shower. Help plan a party for her family and friends to celebrate this exciting time.
Help her pack her hospital bag.

, Before the baby’s birth, you may notice your mom bustling about, getting the house perfectly clean, cooking meals for after the baby comes, or tackling a big project. This burst of energy is called nesting. It’s very common for a pregnant mom to want everything to be just perfect for the baby’s arrival.Be patient with her, and try to find some humor in it.

Find out the hospital’s visiting hours.,
Get ready for a tired mom.,
Understand that you will not be the center of attention.,
Be an awesome older sibling.",How to Deal With a Pregnant Mother5," Your mom may stay at the hospital for a few days with the baby. Find some time to visit and meet your new sibling!

, They call it “labor” for a reason: having a baby is hard work! If you visit your mom after she has the baby, she will probably look pretty exhausted.


When your mom and the new baby come home from the hospital, she will spend a lot of time resting. She will be tired, because new babies are up a lot during the night.
If you can, offer to watch the baby so she can take a nap.

, Your mom will spend a lot of time taking care of the baby and bonding with him. You may feel like you are not important to your mom. Ask your mom to set aside some time for just the two of you each day. Be willing to be flexible, however. New babies are not good with schedules!
Your family may have lots of visitors to welcome the new baby. The new baby may get a lot of attention, and a lot of presents. It is normal to feel jealous. Let your family know if you feel left out.

, Nothing makes a parent happier than seeing a special bond form between siblings. (It’s normal if this takes a while, though.) Hold, play with, and talk to the baby. You may even want to welcome the baby with a special gift!

Avoid taking your parents’ perfectionism personally.,
Make a list of your positive qualities.,
Take pride in your accomplishments.,
Spend time with positive people.,
Avoid comparisons.",How to Cope with Perfectionist Parents2," Your parents’ perfectionism says more about their personal issues than it does about you. Maybe their parents were overly critical of them, too, or maybe they don’t know how to tell you they care about you in a healthy way.Learn to give yourself praise rather than relying on other's approval. Practice giving yourself a compliment after each time you feel put down by your parent's remarks.

, Take five or ten minutes to write down everything you like about yourself. Include personality traits, skills, and habits that you’re proud of. Save your list, and glance at it when you’re feeling down about yourself.If you have a poor self-image, ask a trusted friend to help you come up with a list of your best traits.

, You don’t need your parents’ permission to be proud of the things you’ve achieved so far. Think back on your successes, big and small, and congratulate yourself.Your accomplishments don’t have to be perfect or life-changing to be worthy of pride. For instance, starting a successful business is an impressive achievement, but so is studying hard to bring your history grade from a D up to a B.

, The people you surround yourself with have a big impact on how you see yourself. If you feel stressed or anxious around your parents, seek out people who are supportive and accepting of you instead.For instance, you could spend more time with your friends and their parents.

, A competitive mindset makes you see yourself, as well as everyone else, in a negative light. If you’re in the habit of comparing yourself to other people, stop. Focus on appreciating people’s positive qualities without putting yourself down in the process."
"
Allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment.,
Keep an eye on your self-talk.,
Remember that mistakes are necessary.,
Focus on improvement, not perfection.,
Be mindful about how you raise your own kids.",How to Cope with Perfectionist Parents3," Don’t repress or deny your feelings, especially negative ones like anger and sadness. Instead, find healthy ways to express yourself and release your emotions. Try meditating, writing in a journal, or venting to a friend.Many perfectionist parents discourage their kids from expressing their feelings. This habit can carry over into adulthood and cause emotional problems later in life.

, If your parents often speak critically to you, you might be in the habit of talking to yourself the same way. Notice whether your inner dialogue is positive or negative. If your inner voice is often critical or disparaging, practice talking to yourself more kindly.For instance, instead of telling yourself, “I can’t learn math,” say something like, “I’m going to have to work extra hard to learn this, but I’ve learned hard things before.”

, Don’t let fear of making mistakes hold you back from trying new things. It’s impossible to learn and improve yourself without having a few stumbles along the way.Making mistakes is normal, and everyone does it. Reasonable people probably won’t hold your mistakes against you.
Instead of trying to avoid mistakes, learn how to recover from them gracefully. If you accidentally hurt someone else, apologize and do your best to make it right. If you embarrass yourself, laugh it off and move on.

, Try to make every day a little better than yesterday was. When you make a mistake, focus on learning from it, so you’ll be less likely to repeat it.To avoid striving for the impossible goal of perfection, make a list of concrete actions you can take to improve yourself every day.
For instance, if you want to develop better money habits, you could create a budget, start cooking more meals at home, and visit the library instead of the bookstore.

, Bad habits like perfectionism can easily get passed down through the generations. If you have children of your own, encourage them to do their best, but be careful not to put too much pressure on them.For instance, instead of saying to your child ""I'm really disappointed you didn't earn straight A's this semester,"" you might say something with less pressure like ""I'm satisfied with your grades as long as you can honestly say you gave it your very best.""

Ask them nicely to respect your space and privacy, just as you respect theirs. Do this without pleading, whining, getting upset or acting victimized. Be firm, to the point and respectful throughout the entire conversation.You can say things like, ""I don't feel like I have any personal space or privacy in my bedroom. Can we talk about that? It's upsetting me.""
Or you could try to put a knocking policy into place. Start the conversation with something like, ""I want to start a new rule in the house about knocking before entering. Can we have a family meeting about that?""
You could also say, ""I respect your privacy and knock on your door. I want you to do the same thing for me."";
, A simple sheet of paper will suffice as a door sign. Keep your message simple and write it legibly. “Please knock before entering” and “Please don’t enter without my permission” would both work great.


If it’s a younger sibling you’re having trouble with, be sure to post the sign at eye level for them.
If the sibling is too young to read, draw a picture of a person knocking on a door.
You could also hang a dry-erase marker board on your door so that you can change the message sometimes and even address specific family members in the message.

, Sometimes being polite just won't work, especially on younger siblings. If you've already spoken to your family about respecting your privacy with no results, raise your voice at them the next time it happens. There is no reason to get violent or be mean, but it's okay to raise your voice to show that you're angry.


Avoid saying things in the heat of the moment that you'll regret later.
Be perfectly honest about why you're angry. Say things like, ""We talked about this, why won't you listen to me?"" and ""I am really upset with you right now.""
Sometimes yelling a good old-fashioned ""Get out!"" and pointing at the door can be effective, especially with a much younger sibling. Keep in mind that this might hurt their feelings, though.
If someone barges in while you're in your room, stand up immediately to confront them. Walk toward them to keep them from coming in any further and assertively ask them to leave.

, When you're dealing with an intrusive sibling who won't listen and it's becoming a real problem, go to your parents privately to ask for their assistance. Explain in a calm way that you're really upset about this, and that you deserve privacy. Ask them to intervene on your behalf.


Make it clear to your sibling that when they barge in your room, you are going to go tell your parents immediately. You could give them a warning and say, ""The next time this happens, you're going to get in trouble with mom and dad.""
As soon as they come in say, ""I'm going to tell mom and dad about this right now.""
Get up immediately and go get one or both of your parents. Confront your sibling in front of your parents and ask them to back you up.
Once you've got your parents there, say something along the lines of, ""This can't happen anymore. I deserve personal space and I want us to resolve this issue right now.""

Keep calm.,
Don’t lash out or get angry.,
Ignore them.,
Get out of the situation.",How to Tolerate an Annoying Brother1," The first thing you need to do when you are starting to get annoyed is to simply keep your cool. If you find a way to stay calm you will be better equipped to handle the annoyance rather than losing your cool and making the situation worse. Staying calm can sometimes actually influence your brother’s behavior and may cause him to stop what he is doing.Take some deep breaths. Count to ten. Think of something you enjoy. All of these can help you stay calm.
If he start tapping you on the shoulder, don’t immediately smack at him. Take a second to think before you act.
Keep your voice to a normal talking level rather than yelling.;
, Anger is like an infection and it will spread through you, increase, and can ruin your whole day. Telling yourself in the moment of annoyance that you are not going to get angry can have a huge impact on your overall attitude. Plus, if you do react in anger you might make things worse. You may end up causing physical violence or hurting your brother’s feelings in a way that will have lasting effects.Getting angry in this situation also means that you have given your brother power over your emotions which you don’t want to do. Getting angry could show them that you are weaker than he is and especially for younger brothers this might not be the outcome you want. If their goal was to make you angry, you have shown them that whatever they are doing works.

, This one may be really hard to actually do, but it can be effective. If the person is specifically trying to annoy you, then they want to get a reaction from you. If you can stay calm and completely ignore them, it just might make them give up what they are doing. You may have to maintain this posture of ignoring longer than you want to, but making your point could be worth it. Ignore them by not talking and not even looking at them.This can also be a good time to put headphones in your ears if they keep talking and you can’t ignore it anymore. Headphones will ideally block the sound of their voice making it easier to ignore them.
Maybe your brother is repeating everything you say. Two options that might work are to keep talking as if it doesn’t bother you or stop talking completely. If you keep talking, he might actually get tired of having to repeat you. If you stop talking, he can’t repeat anything you say.

, Sometimes you can’t ignore what your brother is doing, but you can go somewhere else in the house, or go outside, or actually leave the place entirely. When ignoring is not an option, or you try it and it doesn’t work, the best thing to do is simply walk away from him. This is a physical way to avoid potential conflict.If he follows you to where you went, you can try once more to go to another spot. If he continues following you, other techniques are called for.
Depending on the situation and what your brother is doing, you might be able to go sit in the room your parents are in. You don't even have to say anything, but it might be enough to make him stop doing what he was doing.

Look at the wardrobe.,
Watch for small physical differences.,
Learn to associate a twin's name with a certain characteristic.,
Pay attention to slight differences in style.",How to Tell a Set of Identical Twins Apart1," While identical twins look alike, they often have different tastes. This can result in a different wardrobe. Consider wardrobe options when trying to identify twins.


Pay attention to color. Twins do not always like the same colors. Rose may love the color yellow, while Grace finds it appalling. Therefore, if you see a twin in a yellow shirt, you can probably assume it's Rose.Twins may also dress differently. One twin may enjoy dressing up, while another prefers slightly more casual attire.
One twin may also prefer a certain style of clothing. One twin may be known for a fondness of sundresses or cardigans, for example, while another can usually be seen in a particular style of jeans.;
, Identical twins are never completely identical. There are always small physical differences that you can use to tell one twin from another. Look for things like birthmarks, freckles, moles, and other distinguishing features. These can be used to tell twins apart.If you're just meeting a set of twins, ask a mutual friend about physical differences. Minor differences are hard to notice at first. Someone who's known the twins for awhile may be aware of a birthmark, mole, or freckle you can use to distinguish between them.

, If you've found any distinguishing characteristics between twins, try to associate these differences with a twin's name. This can help you quickly tell the twins apart without having to scramble to think.One twin may have curly hair, for example, while the other has straight hair. Try to repeat to yourself, ""Addison, curly, Molly, straight, Addison, curly, Molly straight."" This will help solidify the connection. The next time you see one of the twins, you'll be able to quickly differentiate based on hair type.

, Beyond wardrobe, there may be other slight differences in style you can use to tell twins apart. Things like makeup, jewelry, and accessories are helpful tools.


One twin may be known for having a fondness for a certain type of accessory. For example, one twin may have a fondness for hats. A twin may also like a certain brand of clothing. For example, a twin may be known to shop at Abercrombie and Finch a lot.
If the twins in question wear makeup, they may wear slightly different shades. One twin's makeup may usually be more dramatic, while another's is more toned down. One twin may prefer pink lipstick, while the other prefers red.

Understand your older brother.,
Pick your battles.,
Get interested in things your older brother likes to do.,
Try a new activity with your brother.,
Don't be jealous of other people's sibling relationships.,
Ignore your older brother.",How to Stop Your Older Brother from Annoying You1," Adding a new member to any family causes change. Before you came along, your older brother probably got more attention than he gets now from your parents.


Whether or not you think it’s fair, your older brother is competing with you. For example, maybe he was the one in the family who was good at soccer; maybe he was very proud of this. If you start playing soccer and do well, your brother may resent your success and feel like his own identity is being threatened. Your brother might feel jealous of you, because he may feel that you’re the favorite of your parents. Simply understanding these things about your brother will allow you to take a walk in his shoes and be able to talk to him more easily.;
, Maybe your older brother bothers you so much that you want to pull your hair out. Maybe he’s a good older brother overall, but does a couple of annoying things here and there.If your brother’s only occasionally annoying, there’s no shame in letting those minor annoyances slide.


Sometimes it’s best to let the small things go.
Realize that arguing over the small things can be even more exhausting than what’s actually annoying you in the first place. Think about all the things you can expend energy on that you enjoy.

, Your brother is likely annoying you either because he wants attention from you, or he wants you to stop getting attention from your parents or others.


To redirect your older brother’s energy, try to focus positive attention towards him by showing interest in the things he likes to do.
This tactic may backfire if your brother thinks you’re trying to “steal his thunder” by sharing in his interests. But, for example, if both you and your brother like the same video game, you may have fun playing that game together.

, If you and your brother don’t have much in common, trying something new together may bring you guys closer.


Think about something you want to try but haven’t yet tried with anybody. Maybe trying such an activity with your brother will make it “your thing”.

, You may think your friend's older brother is the coolest guy alive. You may wonder why your friend's older brother seems to be supportive and fun in a way your older brother never is. Well, stop wondering.


Envying other people's sibling relationships is a waste of your energy and does nothing to improve your relationship with your brother.
Keep in mind that you don't know everything about your friend's relationship with their older brother. It's possible that their older brother can be just as annoying as yours. , Your brother may be uninterested in hanging out with you. He may just want to pester you. If that’s the case, he’ll find that not getting a reaction out of you gets really boring really fast.


If you have a history of always reacting, ignoring him might not work the first time. He will likely be persistent, thinking that he can get a reaction out of you eventually.
It will take a lot of willpower, but if you keep ignoring him for long enough, he will likely lose interest and move on to a different activity.
Alternatively, ignoring your brother's annoying behavior might cause him to ""snap out of it"" and start treating you kindly again.

Avoid keeping things the whole family uses in your room.,
Do your own chores.,
Show mutual respect.If you want your wishes to be respected, you have to show that same respect toward your family members.",How to Keep Annoying Family Members out of Your Room2," For example, if you've got the only game console or tablet in the house, do not keep them in your room. If you do, your family members will come in to retrieve them.


Keep things that everyone uses in a common room of the house, such as the living room, game room or basement.
If necessary, create a schedule of use and give everyone an equal allotment of time to use the item.

, This is a respectful thing to do, and if you take care of all of your own chores, no one has any reason to come into your room without your permission. Make your bed every day, pick up your clothes and launder them yourself, keep your room clean and return any dirty dishes to the kitchen without being asked.


Be sure to let your family members know that you've already taken care of the chores in your room. That way they can't say they came in to check.
Bring a parent in your room to inspect your handiwork, if necessary.
If you don’t take care of these things yourself, family members (especially your parents) will be forced to come in and take care of these things themselves.

, Never barge into their rooms unannounced. Always knock on their bedroom doors and wait until they ask you to come in before opening their door.


Even if your family members haven’t started respecting your privacy yet, start respecting theirs.
Set an example by treating everyone in the house the exact same way that you want to be treated.

Get a lock for your bedroom door.,
Barricade your door.,
Use a doorstop to hold the door closed.Doorstops are wedge-shaped tools that can be used to hold a door open or closed.",How to Keep Annoying Family Members out of Your Room3," There are several ways to approach this. The easiest way is to get a portable door lock that can be easily installed and removed by you (no tools required). Addalock is one of the most famous brands.You could also get a brand new door knob that locks with a key at a hardware store and install it yourself (or ask a family member to help).


Another option is to get a chain lock at a hardware store and install that yourself (or ask for help).
If your parents are reluctant to allow you to lock your door, explain to them exactly why you feel that your privacy is being violated.

, If you’re in your room and you want privacy, barricade your door by wedging a chair under the door knob or pushing a piece of furniture in front of it. This is only helpful if you’re actually in your room when someone tries to barge in, but it will prevent them from being able to do it.


Make sure that you can quickly and easily remove whatever you’re barricading your door with, if necessary, in the event of an emergency.

, Block family members from opening the door by shoving a doorstop under your door when you're in your bedroom. If you don't have a doorstop, you can easily improvise one. Use anything that will fit tightly in the space between the bottom of your door and the floor.


The more things you wedge tightly under the door, the stronger the barricade is, so if you're concerned it won't hold, use multiple items.
Grab a pair of old sneakers and shove the toe end of both of them under your door. Space them out a little for a stronger hold.
Shove a big fluffy towel under your door. Really cram it under there so that it will hold, or use multiple towels.

Work on a project together.Sometimes siblings just want a little attention from you.,
Make a ""date"" to watch a movie together in another room.,
Play games or hang out with them in their room.",How to Keep Annoying Family Members out of Your Room4," Come up with a project that you can work on together outside of your bedroom. If you're dealing with a very small sibling, come up with a fun art project you can work on together.


If it's someone a little older, ask for their help on something, like going shopping with you to get a parent a birthday gift or even making something creative together as the gift.
Giving a family member a little attention outside of your bedroom will hopefully make them less inclined to barge in your room constantly for attention.

, Show them that you want to hang out with them, just not in your bedroom. Let them pick out the movie, pop some popcorn and spend a little quality time together.


Be sure that you do this outside of your bedroom. You need to get them in the habit of hanging out with you elsewhere.

, Pull out some board games or just hang out with them in their bedroom to reinforce the idea that hanging out with you does not mean barging into your room.


Before you go into their bedroom, knock and wait to be let in.
Hopefully this will set an example of the kind of behavior you want from them.

Ask if they are being annoying on purpose.,
Say something kind to your brother.,
Laugh at the annoying thing.,
Give them something to do.",How to Tolerate an Annoying Brother2," Sometimes brothers do things on purpose to annoy you, but maybe the thing they are doing is not meant to be annoying. If they seem to be doing something on their own, without regard to you, it can be beneficial to simply ask them if they are intending to be annoying. You can tell them the thing annoys you and respectfully ask them if they will stop.For example, your brother might start tapping his foot and you can hear it across the room. It’s likely that even though it annoyed you, he was doing it without thinking. This can be a time to ask if he is doing it on purpose.
You can say, “It’s kind of annoying me that you are doing (fill in the blank). Are you doing on purpose?” If they say no, you can politely ask them to stop. “Would you please stop then because it’s making it hard for me to concentrate.”

, This can be a good avoidance technique because it will bring positivity to an otherwise negative situation. Tell your brother something that you really like or appreciate about them. This will also serve to throw him off and confuse him which could distract him from the annoying behavior.


You can say, “I love you,” tell him he is really cool, or say how much fun you have with him. Tell him he is a great brother. You can also repeat this to him multiple times which could actually annoy him and get him to leave you alone.

, Since sometimes your brother is seeking your attention, you may be able to get them to stop by giving them your attention by laughing at the annoying behavior. This is potentially risky because it might only spur them on more, but it can act to diffuse the tension as well. You may even change your own attitude about it if you fake laughter at first because you might end up laughing for real.Maybe your brother starts making a seal noise and he just won’t stop. He probably knows it’s annoying and he may be doing it on purpose. If you laugh and compliment how accurate his sound is, that may be enough to get him to stop.

, Your brother might be annoying you simply because he is bored and doesn’t know what else to do. You can work with this. Give him a specific task to do or give him an idea of something fun.You might have a chore that you don’t want to do and you could convince him you can’t do it. Tell him you really need his help to do the thing you can’t do. Or just give him an idea like tell him to go ride his bike or read a book. He may just not have thought of something fun.
You could even trick him by saying, “Man, I really wish I could go play with our racetrack right now but I have to finish what I am doing.” If you are lucky, this will make him want to go do that thing and he’ll leave you alone.

Learn to not be annoyed by consistent actions.,
Let each instance of annoyance go.,
Set up boundaries and make deals.,
See the annoyance as training for life.",How to Tolerate an Annoying Brother3," The thing your brother is doing that annoys you may be some type of long term practice or habit that he has. If this is the case, and if he shows no signs of stopping, you need to find a way to accept the behavior and learn to not be annoyed with it. If it goes on long enough and you get used to ignoring it, it may not even annoy you any more. This is a place of peace and calm that you can try to get to.For example, you might have a younger brother who always takes you CDs, books, clothes, or anything else and you can’t get him to stop. Start to consider that the reason he does this is that he likes the stuff you like and wants to be like you. Maybe you can even lend him stuff sometimes so he won’t have to take it.
Maybe he clears his throat a lot, and it gets on your nerves. If you try to remember that he is only doing it out of necessity, you might not find it so annoying.

, If your brother is annoying on a regular basis, each separate time can start to build up and make things worse each time. If you remember every time he annoyed you and you hold onto it, those memories will fuel your annoyance later on. Learn to let each separate annoying action go and forget about it. This will help you avoid a build up effect over time.At the end of each day, write down what your brother did that was annoying and throw the paper away. By specifically naming it, making physical evidence of it, and then dropping it in the trash, you may be able to forget about it.
Don’t mention the annoying things your brother did two weeks ago. It may give him the idea to do it again or it may just make you mad all over again even if he doesn’t repeat it.

, If you make some rules and agreements between the two of you, you can avoid some annoying situations in the future. Think about the things that are consistently annoying and come up with ways to avoid those. If you can make these rules and stick to them, you will make progress.For example, if you know that your brother always annoys you when you are working on homework, set up a rule that he has to leave you alone during homework time, but you will play with him right after you do your homework.
Make a deal that you will not go in each other’s room or touch the other’s stuff without asking.
If there are specific things that your brother does that annoy you, see if you can convince him not to do that thing around you. You can negotiate by offering to stop a behavior of yours when you are around him.

, You will always encounter people who annoy you, and having siblings can help you learn early in life how to deal with the annoyance. Changing the way that you think of the annoying behavior can be helpful. Consider your brother as a training course in anger management, tolerance, and patience. It is a hard attitude to adopt, but if you can do it, you will be less annoyed in the moment and you’ll be developing a valuable skill for the future.If you have a brother that talks non-stop, remember that you will encounter people like that your whole life. You can begin practicing methods of listening better or find ways to make them stop talking.
Maybe your brother asks you the same question over and over again even when you have already answered him. People often have a hard time hearing or paying attention, so you may have to repeat yourself a lot later in life anyway. Learn to do it patiently even when you are annoyed.

Get out of the house more.,
Lock your bedroom door.,
Wear headphones or earplugs.,
Reduce stress through deep breathing exercises.",How to Ignore Your Sister or Brother2," If you're trying to study or work, bring your laptop or books with you to a public place. Many people go to libraries, cafes, and parks when they need to focus. If you have a car, simply driving to a parking lot or a garage can be the escape you need. If you're avoiding your sibling for other reasons, try going for walks or hanging out with friends more often. Try your best to make yourself busy outside of your home., If you have your own bedroom, locking the door is the best way to ensure your privacy, if you're allowed to. This will cut down on any unwanted intrusions into your space. This is especially important if your sibling has a bad habit of not knocking or is too young to realize that it's the polite thing to do.

, This is your best option if you share a room or will be with your sibling on a long car ride. If you use headphones, just be careful not to raise the volume too loud or you may damage your ears.Active noise-cancelling headphones can block out noise without the need for high volumes.

, Deep breathing exercises work to relax you and may be a great help if you find yourself getting angry or annoyed at your sibling. Inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to five. Exhale slowly through your nose. Repeat this until you're calm enough that your sibling no longer bothers you."

Unfollow your sibling on social media.,
Avoid answering the phone.,
Keep text messages brief.",How to Ignore Your Sister or Brother3," If you're trying to focus, stay away from social media altogether. If you are temporarily ignoring your sibling, most websites, including facebook, let you keep people's posts off of your feed without needing to unfriend them. Unfriending on social media can cause drama that strains relationships in real life. Leave that as a last resort for long-term or permanent issues., If you see your sibling's phone number pop up when your cell phone rings, let it go to voicemail. Avoid hitting the ""Silence"" button, as in many cases the caller will know you did so. If your sibling leaves a message, be sure to listen as soon as possible in case of an emergency.

, Unless your sibling has seriously wronged you, don't ignore text messages completely. However, you don't have to reply to them immediately. Make your own messages short and to the point.

Assess personality.,
Pay attention to speaking style.,
Look at habits and mannerisms.,
Ask politely when in doubt.",How to Tell a Set of Identical Twins Apart2," Identical twins often have different personalities. If you've known a pair of twins for awhile, you may be able to tell them apart based on personality. For example, Alice may be very shy and withdrawn, while Sophie is a social butterfly. If you see one of the twins out walking, and she smiles and yells, ""Hi!"", you're likely dealing with Sophie.

, Twins may have a different speaking style. You can use this as a means to identify twins. Returning to the above example, as Sophie is more social, she may use common slang and colloquial terms in conversation. As Alice is more withdrawn, and spends a lot of time at home, she may have not picked up on as much slang. She may be unlikely to use certain terms and phrases in conversation, sticking to more formal sentences.

, Twins may also have slightly different mannerisms and habits, which you may pick up on if you've spent a lot of time with the twins. One twin may have a habit of twirling his hair, for example, while another may bite his fingernails. One twin may gesticulate more when he or she talks, while another may be more reserved in conversation.

, It's okay to ask politely. While twins may sometimes get slightly annoyed, many identical twins understand others have trouble differentiating between them. If you're really in doubt, politely say something like, ""I'm sorry, but are you Mason or Todd?"" Thank the twin for answering, and let him or her know you'll try to do better in the future."

Color coordinate your twins.,
Paint a single toenail of one twin.,
Use a ""scrunchie"" or bracelet.,
Get to know each baby's personality.",How to Tell a Set of Identical Twins Apart3," If you're a parent of twin babies, it can get hard to tell your twins apart. It may be a good idea to color coordinate. Always dress twins in certain colors. For example, Maria is always dressed in yellow, red, or green. Lucy is always dressed in purple, pink, or blue.You can also try picking different designs. Maria is usually in stripes, while Lucy is in polka dots.
It's a good idea to let daycare workers and babysitters know how your twins are color coordinated. If one twin is on a certain medication, it's important that a caretaker know which twin is which.

, Many parents find it helpful to paint a single toenail on one twin. This way, you'll know which twin is which. If you get confused, check the toes. You'll know you're changing Zachary's diaper if a single toenail is painted green., You can purchase an elastic scrunchie or some type of small bracelet. Before leaving the hospital, put the scrunchie around one baby's wrist or ankle. This can help you remember which baby is which throughout the day., After awhile, you probably will not need physical reminders to tell your twins apart. As babies get older, they begin to develop distinct personalities. Zack may be more quiet, and less likely to cry at night, while Jake tends to be fussier and pickier. As your twins personalities emerge, you'll get to know them as individuals. This will make it easier to differentiate between them."

Speak honestly and openly to your brother.,
Stop annoying your brother.,
Tell a parent or guardian.",How to Stop Your Older Brother from Annoying You2," Though you may not have considered it, there is a chance that your older brother doesn’t realize that he is annoying you.He may think he is being funny, and doesn’t realize how frustrated you are. Rather than assuming that your brother knows how you feel, speak to him directly and openly share your observations, feelings, and wants so that he has a complete understanding of his effect on you. When communicating, it’s important not to blame your brother or assign him negative motivations.
For example, don’t say, “You’re happy when I’m miserable! That’s why you’re annoying me!” Rather, say something like, “I don’t like when you throw my games across the room, and I really want you to respect me and my things just like I respect yours.”
It’s important that you are calm when communicating.

, It's rare for one person to be 100% at fault in a dispute. Often, both people share some of the responsibility.Playing the blame game with your brother will only result in the problem lasting longer than it has to. If you know there are some things you do to annoy your older brother, stop first and he will likely return the favor.
If your brother started the problems, you may feel that it’s not fair for you to stop first. Maybe you think because he’s older, he should be the mature one and stop the annoying behavior before you do. Rather than focusing on what is “fair,” focus on what will get you the result you want.

, Your parents or guardian likely want you and your sibling to get along. Telling an authority figure of the problems between you and your brother will allow the the authority figure to start a productive conversation between you and your sibling. You’re likely to get better at handling difficult situations with the help of your parents. Going to your parents, however, should not be your first move. It's a valuable skill to learn how to get along with your brother without your parents' involvement.

Go to another room.,
Hang out with your friends.,
Join an after-school activity.,
Develop new interests.",How to Stop Your Older Brother from Annoying You3," Having private space will allow you to feel empowered, which, in turn, translates to a greater ability to express yourself. This feeling of empowerment will be especially beneficial when dealing with a difficult sibling.


Consider asking your parents for your own room, as this will give both you and your brother ownership of your own separate spaces, and decrease the amount of time you get in each other’s way.
If you have to share a bedroom with your older brother, take advantage of the common areas of your home, such as the living room or kitchen.
Enjoy the control you have over private spaces such as your own dresser or your own book shelf. , It's natural for siblings to grow tired of each other. Hanging out with your friends will not only allow you to have some time away from all the annoyance your brother is creating at home, but will lift your spirits.


Your friends are bound to have similar experiences as you, and connecting with them will show that you’re not alone in your struggles. You may also get some fresh ideas about how to solve the problem with your brother.
Do your friends also annoy you? If so, consider what it is about their behavior that may be similar to your older brother’s.
Look inside yourself to see if there’s anything you might be doing to cause annoying behavior in other people.

, Your parents may not be around very much to referee behavior between you and your older sibling. Joining an after-school activity will not only allow you to have fun doing activities you enjoy, but will also reduce stress at home for you, your siblings and your parents. Just because your brother is older doesn’t mean you can’t lead by example. Seeing you join an activity may increase your brother’s interest in pursuing activities of his own, leaving you both happier and more likely to get along at home.

, If your brother plays basketball, consider trying an unrelated activity like, say, drawing or volunteering at the library. By exploring new interests, you can create your own path rather than feeling the need to compare yourself to your brother.


Think of what type of person you are and what type of person you want to be. Are you a creative person who likes to think about why things are the way they are? Consider a hobby in the arts. Are you more scientifically inclined? Talk to your science teacher about ideas for ways to conduct experiments out of school.

Try not to argue.,
Keep your cool.,
If you do have to argue, just stick to a few main things:


Always make eye contact when talking to the parent, showing that everything you're saying is 100% true.,
Seek a truce.,
Remember that you are older and you do have the right to be firm with younger siblings at times!,
Don't let siblings into your room.,
If you share a room, claim your side of the room or your space.,
Ask siblings to get out of your room with an aura of authority.",How to Survive Being an Older Sibling," That may seem practically impossible, but it saves lots of time and energy. If you do have to fight, look at the fourth step.;
, Younger siblings have many ways to annoy you. It seems as if it's just an unusual talent. Pretend like they aren't there and continue doing whatever you're doing. They'll feel like they're talking to a wall and stop.


If you're doing homework, take extreme measures and either tell your mom or look at them straight in the eye and say, ""Stop. I'm doing homework, I need to concentrate, please.""

,
Tell them everything. Don't skip out on any details: the thing you think isn't very important can be a complete game changer.
Don't let your mom/dad/grandpa/alien mother-in-law/etc. fall for the ""Sweet Look"" (big eyes, whimpering, and a little curled lip to get what they want). Sure, it helps when wanting to go to the ice cream store, but not during an argument. Keep your straight face and pretend like the look isn't happening. If your mother falls for it, don't talk back. If she really starts to scream at you, say, ""I'm telling the truth. I didn't hit her, kick her, or give her that bruise. She got that yesterday when she was running on the playground.""
Don't let your sister/brother get away with lying. The number one outcome of this is: ""Was that true?"" You need to say: ""No."" If it is true, don't lie. It will get you in even more trouble.

, Sure, you don't have to be best friends with your sibling. But try to make peace!

, They don't have the power to tell you, ""You're going to take me to the shop"" or ""Get me my book. Now."" They cannot boss you around all the time, but that doesn't mean you can always tell them what to do either! Respect has to be on both sides.

, They can destroy your belongings, get in the reach of personal business (like a diary, phone, school project) or important papers, or trash your room. If possible, put up a padlock. If not, talk to your parents and let them know that you want your room to be just that: yours.

, If they say no, then put belongings where they can't get to them.

, When they first get in your room ask them to ""please get out"". When they come in for a second time say ""I am going to ask you nicely one more time, please get out"". When they come back a third time, it is to mess with you because they know that you are not going to ask them nicely. So just simply ignore them and they will get bored and leave.

Have energy boosting foods.,
Consume coffee throughout the day.,
Take a 10 to 30 minute nap.",How to Get Through the Day on Less Than Four Hours of Sleep1," Get your body moving by doing at least two to three wake up exercises. Go for a short run, walk, jog, or do basic stretching moves. Exercising will raise your core body temperature and release hormones and endorphins in your body, which will boost your energy.Do an upper-body fan stretch. Lie on your back with your arms outstretched at your sides and your palms facing up. Bring your knees up to your chest and roll to the your right side. Your knees should be stacked on top of each other and your hips should be stacked.
Turn your head to the left. Try to keep both shoulders touching the floor. Sweep your left palm in a 180-degree arc over your chest to touch your right palm. Let your head follow your arm. Then slowly reverse the movement.
Repeat this stretch 10 times, then switch sides and repeat it on the other side.
Do gentle crunches. Lie face up and bend your knees. Keep your feet planted on the floor. Press your palms on the floor, near your hips. Squeeze your abs and lift both of your shoulder blades off the floor.
Hold the crunch for a full breath and then lower. Repeat this movement 10 to 15 times. Be sure to take a full breath as you hold each crunch.
Do basic squats. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your toes facing forward. Extend your arms in front of you, with your palms facing each other. Keep your weight in your heels as you sit back and down, as if sitting in a chair.
Make sure your knees do not extend beyond your toes. Hold the squat for a full breath and then return to standing. Repeat this movement for 5 to 10 breaths.;
, At the end of your normal shower, do a quick wake up trick. Switch the tap to very cold water for 30 seconds, then very hot water for 30 seconds, and then very cold water for 30 seconds. This 90 second change to your shower can help you feel refreshed and energized for the day., Stay away from heavy carbohydrates like pasta or bread, as these take time for your body to digest and can trigger sleepiness. You should also avoid foods high in artificial sugar, like candy, cakes, or soft drinks, as these can lead to a spike in your blood sugar, followed by a sugar crash and a dip in your energy. Instead, go for foods that will raise your blood sugar and give you energy to get through your day.A handful of raw almonds are a good pick-me-up snack, full of Vitamin E and Magnesium. They also contain lots of protein to give you energy throughout the day.
A bowl of Greek yogurt is packed with protein, but has less lactose and carbohydrates than regular yogurt. It will keep you full, without slowing you down or making you more tired.
Popcorn is a good snack in the office that is a good source of carbohydrates and is low in calories, especially when it is not smothered in butter.
Go for a salad full of leafy greens, like spinach or kale, to boost your iron levels. This will make you more alert and improve your concentration levels.

, Drinking a cup of coffee can help to combat fatigue and make you feel more alert.Try drinking a cup of coffee once every four hours to help you stay awake.

, Find a quiet space and take a power nap, no longer than 30 minutes. This will prevent you from developing sleep inertia, which is when you feel groggy and disoriented after a nap that goes on for longer than 30 minutes.Naps under 30 minutes will also not interfere with your sleep schedule, allowing you to get a good sleep at night.


Set an alarm for 30 minutes so your nap doesn’t turn into a 1 hour snooze.

Go for the latest pop tune or an electro-dance mix to keep your toes tapping and your mind alert. Look for upbeat mixes online, some of which last for hours, and turn them up in your headphones., Protein stimulates a neurotransmitter in your brain called orexin. Orexin regulates arousal, wakefulness, and appetite in your body. Having protein snacks throughout the day will stimulate your brain and keep your body up and alert.Go for healthy protein snacks like a handful of almonds, peanuts, or cashews. Rice crackers, cheese, and sliced turkey and ham is also a more filling protein snack.
Fruit high in fiber, like apples, and natural sugars, like oranges, are also good snacks to keep you awake and alert.

, Light will keep your melatonin levels down, which causes sleepiness, and keep your eyes open despite your lack of sleep. Try to balance a bright overhead light with a low light at your desk., Doing light exercise every 30 minutes will keep your body and mind active, especially if you have been sitting at a desk in front of a computer. Walk to a park nearby or do a few laps around the block. More vigorous exercise like a quick run or sprint can also keep your hormone levels up and ensures you don't fall asleep during the day."

Reorganize your schedule, if possible.,
Delegate your tasks for the day.,
Take a break from your normal routine.,
Engage your peers during meetings or in classes.",How to Get Through the Day on Less Than Four Hours of Sleep3," Rather than try to tackle all of your tasks for the day at once, adjust your schedule so your more important appointments are at the start of your day. If you are sleep deprived, you will likely try to maintain a higher level of energy in the morning and feel burned out by the end of the day. Create a schedule where you prioritize the important tasks first, while you still have energy.If you cannot reorganize your schedule, plan on a nap break or a caffeine break between meetings or tasks so you can stay awake and alert.

, If you have other co-workers or peers who can sympathize with your lack of sleep, try to delegate some of your responsibilities for the day. Explain your situation and promise an IOU in exchange for help on a project or task. This will allow you to manage any stress or anxiety due to lack of sleep, and focus on only one or two tasks for the day., In an energy slump, it may help to switch to an activity that you enjoy doing or feel relaxed doing. Going through the motions of your day will likely make you more tired and drowsy. Instead, go for a quick walk outside or have a coffee break with a coworker. Jolting your brain out of your normal routine will keep you alert and ready to tackle the rest of your day., If you feel you are in danger of falling asleep during a meeting or during a class, push yourself to work the room. Ask questions of your peers or your clients, raise your hand during class, and try to stay engaged in the conversation. Getting involved in the discussion will help you stay alert, and force your brain to stay focused.As well, if you were planning to present a 50 slide Powerpoint presentation at a meeting, try to engage your co-workers in conversation during the presentation.

Make your bedroom ""sleep friendly"".",How to Know if You Have Insomnia," Everyone has different routines that they follow at night before they go to bed and attempt to fall asleep, but most people are asleep within 30 minutes from when their head hits the pillow and they turn off the lights. The hallmark symptom of insomnia is difficulty initiating sleep — it typically takes much longer than 30 minutes and sometimes up to four hours.Lots of tossing and turning in bed is typical with insomnia, as are feelings of anxiety and frustration about not falling asleep (which makes the situation worse). For some people, the anxiety comes as a result of not being able to fall asleep, not the other way around. It usually comes as a worry of how the person will be able to function the next day with little or no sleep.
Everyone has experienced an occasional night of insomnia due to stress or illness, but doctors consider insomnia chronic if it happens at least three nights per week for three months or longer.;
, The vast majority of people need between 7-9 hours of continuous sleep per night in order to be healthy and function properly during the day.Some people may need a little more (10 hours) and the rare person can get by with less without experiencing any negative health repercussions. Determine how many hours you're getting throughout your work week. Despite wanting to get more, people with insomnia usually end up with 6 or fewer hours of sleep on multiple nights throughout their work week.If your busy work schedule only allows you 6 or fewer hours of sleep regularly, then that's not considered insomnia — that's sleep deprivation due to lifestyle choices. Insomnia infers a difficulty falling asleep and getting quality sleep despite the intention to do so.
Lack of sleep during the week cannot be ""made up"" during the weekends by over-sleeping. People require certain amounts of sleep every 24-hour cycle and if you don't meet your requirements then there's always immediate physiological / emotional repercussions.

, Another hallmark sign of insomnia is frequently waking up and getting out of bed during the late night and wee hours of the morning.Most healthy people do not get up at all during the night, although someone with insomnia often does so multiple times. The reasons for getting out of bed include frustration from not falling asleep, physical discomfort, hunger and/or having to go to the bathroom. So remember that getting up frequently is not part of good sleep hygiene.


Due to various diseases, side effects from prescription medications and problems with bladder control, insomnia is much more common among the elderly than it is compared to young and middle-aged Americans.
More than a 25% of all Americans experience transient insomnia on a yearly basis and nearly 10% develop chronic insomnia., Although many people expect to feel tired or fatigued in the morning while they wait to get some coffee in them, that should not be a normal consequence if you're getting a good quality and quantity of sleep. Instead, not feeling well rested after a night's sleep and experiencing daytime tiredness or fatigue is a direct sign of sleep deprivation, which may be a result of insomnia if you also have the above-mentioned symptoms.People with insomnia often describe their sleeps as ""unrefreshing"" which is medically referred to as non-restorative sleep. As such, insomniacs often feel more tired upon waking than when they went to bed the night before.
Drinking beverages with caffeine in the morning (coffee, black tea, hot chocolate, colas, energy drinks) can help mask the effects of sleep deprivation and insomnia short-term, but the physiological and psychological effects will eventually catch up to you.
In addition to tiredness and fatigue, other physical effects associated with insomnia include reduced coordination, slower reflexes, less strength, tension headaches and muscle / joint pains.

, A chronic lack of sleep not only negatively impacts your immune system function and leads to physical effects, but it also impacts your moods and emotions.Irritability, depression, anxiety, poor memory, inability to concentrate, reduced attention span, less patience and a ""short fuse"" (quick to anger) are all associated with sleep deprivation from insomnia.Chronic insomnia sufferers also tend to be more impulsive or aggressive.


Sometimes a psychological condition, such as depression or anxiety disorder, is the cause of insomnia instead of a consequence. If so, speak to your doctor, or get a psychologist. They will probably be able to spot the problem. It is possible to get prescribed sleeping pills but in most cases, especially for teens and children, anti-depressants or some other medication will be prescribed. The only time it will be is if you have several symptoms related to these mental illnesses. Insomnia is often linked to illnesses like depression.
It's easy to see how insomnia can quickly become a positive feedback loop and perpetuate itself because it causes symptoms that can further disrupt sleep. As such, a big risk factor for chronic insomnia is having episodes of transient (short-term) insomnia.

, Stressful life events such as unemployment, divorce, serious illnesses or the passing of a loved one creates anxiety and can cause your mind to race at night, which prevents it from entering into an altered state of consciousness referred to as sleep.Thus, try to deal with your stressors by making positive changes and train yourself to leave worrisome thoughts about your job or lack of money out of the bedroom. In short, make your bedroom a refuge from stress.


Stress triggers the release of hormones that prepares you for a ""fight or flight"" response, which is the opposite of what's needed to fall asleep.
Avoid reading the newspaper, watching the news, dealing with bills or talking about relationship issues just prior to going to bed. All these increase stress levels and can negatively impact sleep.
Adopt more calming bedtime habits such as reading books, listening to soothing music and/or taking warm Epsom salt baths. You can also try a relaxation or guided imagery CD/program that is meant for helping with sleep.

, Maintaining regular work and meal-time schedules allows you to establish a consistent sleeping routine, which promotes better sleep and reduces the risk of developing insomnia.Furthermore, keep your bedtime and wake-up times consistent, even on the weekends. Avoid regularly taking daytime naps, although if you feel a nap is absolutely necessary, keep it to under an hour and start before 3:00 pm.Shift-work that starts very early in the morning or late-night shifts invariably upset your natural circadian rhythm, which can easily trigger insomnia. These undesirable shifts may pay more, but consider the potential cost to your health.
The human body, as well as the vast majority of mammals, is geared to awaking at sunrise and sleeping shortly after sunset. Modern life makes this difficult to follow, but keep it in mind when making your schedules.

, A common cause of both transient and chronic insomnia is consuming sleep-disrupting compounds too close to bedtime. Caffeine, alcohol and nicotine are well-established as being able to disrupt sleep and their effects can last eight hours or more.As such, avoid caffeine products anytime after lunch, alcohol within six hours of bedtime, and nicotine (tobacco) within a few hours of heading to bed. Caffeine increases the activity of neurons in your brain, which causes more thoughts to pop into your head. Drinking alcohol (ethanol) often makes people drowsy because it acts as a nervous system depressant, but it actually triggers restless sleep and frequent awakenings.


The main sources of caffeine include coffee, black tea, hot chocolate, most soda pop (especially colas) and virtually all energy drinks. Remember that even caffeine-free energy drinks contain other sleep-disrupting stimulants such as guarana, cola nut and/or ginseng.
Particularly sugary, spicy or acidic food should be avoided just prior to bedtime as they can disrupt sleep, but some foods that contain the amino acid tryptophan can help promote better sleeps (such as poultry, lamb, pumpkin seeds and bananas).

, To help prevent both transient and chronic insomnia, make your bedroom or sleeping area as calming and soothing as you can.Make it as dark as possible by closing the blinds or curtains and turning off all light emitting electronic. Your brain releases sleep hormones (such as melatonin) in response to darkness. Make your bedroom as quiet as possible by closing all windows and turning off your radio, MP3 player, TV and computer. Make sure the room's temperature is comfortable (cooler is better) because that also helps trigger sleep. Lastly, limit all potentially disruptive activities while in bed, such as playing with electronic gadgets, video games or pets.


As a helpful guideline, only use your bed for sleeping and sexual activity (which can promote sleep). Avoid using it to work, eat or entertainment yourself.
To drown out bothersome street or household noises, consider playing the sounds of nature in your room (rain, wind, birds or chimes).

, Being overtired can trigger sleepwalking. The average adult needs at least eight hours of sleep per night. Children may require as much as 14 hours, depending upon their age. You can reduce fatigue by:Taking short naps throughout the day
Going to bed earlier
Sticking to a regular schedule so your body will be prepared to sleep and wake at the correct times
Reducing your caffeine intake. Coffee is a stimulant and may make it harder to fall asleep.

Taking a warm bath or shower
Reading a book or listening to music
Keeping the room cool

Stress is frequently linked to sleepwalking.Find an exercise regimen that works for you. Your body releases endorphins which will help you relax and feel good. The relaxation will be most effective if you do something you enjoy. Try jogging, fast walking, swimming, or joining a community sports team.
Keep close connections with friends and family. They can provide you with support and help you deal with the things that are causing anxiety.Join a support group or see a counselor if there are things you need to talk to about that you can’t tell friends or family.

If there is a pattern in when the sleepwalking occurs, it may help determine why the person is sleepwalking. For example, if the person sleepwalks after stressful days, it may mean that stress and anxiety trigger the sleepwalking episodes.

, This is a technique, where, if the person knows when in the night he usually sleepwalks, someone else can wake him shortly before that time.The person should be woken about 15 minutes before the time when he typically sleepwalks and should then stay awake for about five minutes.
This disrupts the sleep cycle and may cause the person to go into a different sleep stage when falling back asleep, preventing him from sleepwalking.
If you sleepwalk and live alone, try setting your alarm to wake you.

, Alcohol can cause sleep disturbances and may trigger sleepwalking. Avoid drinking alcohol before bed.


Women and men over 65 should drink no more than one drink per day. Men under 65 should have no more than two drinks per day.Do not drink if you are pregnant, have been diagnosed with alcoholism, have had problems with your heart, liver, or pancreas, have had a stroke, or are on medications that may interact with alcohol., Some medications may disrupt people's sleep cycles and cause sleepwalking. But do not stop taking your medications without consulting a doctor first. Your doctor may be able to recommend a different medication that will still treat your health problem but reduce the sleepwalking too. Medications that may cause sleepwalking as side-effects include:Sedatives
Medications for psychiatric conditions
Short-acting hypnotics

, Though most sleepwalking is not a sign of a more serious condition, there are a few conditions that may trigger sleepwalking:Partial complex seizures
Brain disorders in the elderly

Removing causes of stress often helps, but when that isn't possible, learn practices to help relax your mind and body. Meditation, yoga, and regular massages are a few such options.;
, Moderate physical activity can help regulate your mind and body. Try walking at a brisk pace for 15 to 20 minutes each day. Schedule these walks for the morning, late afternoon, or early evening.


Avoid exercising shortly before bed, however. Cardiovascular exercise, in particular, stimulates your circulation and may make you feel more awake for a brief period of time. For that reason, you should exercise no later than one to two hours before your intended bedtime.

, Spend more of your waking hours in natural, indirect sunlight. Try to soak in at least six to eight hours of daylight on a daily basis.


By getting more sunlight during the day, you can help your brain associate “light” with “wakefulness” and “dark” with “sleep.” After several weeks of increased daylight, you may notice yourself feeling more awake during the day and more tired when it's time to sleep. This could lead to deeper, more relaxed sleep, which typically involves less sleep talking.

, If you're in the habit of eating shortly before going to bed, reduce the amount of food you eat or change your routine altogether. You may need to stop eating as early as four hours before your intended bedtime.If you are unable to completely stop eating before bed, you should at least reduce the amount of food you eat. Heavy meals are more likely to cause problems than light snacks. Adjust your eating schedule as needed to accommodate this difference and determine whether or not it has enough of an impact.

, Both alcohol and caffeine can disrupt normal, healthy sleep, so you should avoid drinking either substance during the evening. More specifically, your last sip of caffeinated coffee and soda should be in the late afternoon, and your last sip of alcohol should be with dinner.


You may also need to cut back on other potential stimulants, like sugary foods and drinks. Any substance that could alter the way your body regulates sleep might worsen the problem, even if it isn't directly to blame. This includes substances that make you feel more awake (caffeine and sugar) as well as those that make you feel drowsier (alcohol).

, Do something that relaxes you immediately before you lie down. Even if you aren't consciously aware of your stress, there's still some possibility that your body is retaining enough stress to make normal sleeping habits impossible.


Take a warm bubble bath or listen to soothing music. Read a relaxing book. Spend time meditating, praying, or cuddling with a loved one. Nearly any activity that causes you immediate relaxation can be a good option.

, Sleeping is the only thing you should do in your bed. In other words, you should not be lying in bed while reading, watching television, surfing the Internet, or listening to music.By using your bed for nothing but sleep, you effectively train your brain and body to associate your bed with sleep. That makes it easier for you to fall asleep quickly once you lie down, and sleeping faster can lead to deeper, more restful sleep.
On a similar note, it also helps to sleep in the same spot on the same bed each night. You may talk more in your sleep if you begin to rest in different locations because your brain will be more ""awake"" and alert in these new spots.

, Creating a comfortable sleeping environment can make it easier for your brain to relax, which, in turn, can put an end to sleep talking.


As a general rule, you should keep your bedroom as quiet and dark as possible to help facilitate better sleep. If you live in a naturally noisy place, like a dorm room, use a white noise machine to drown out some of the more inconsistent environmental sounds. If you need some form of light, use a small LED night light instead of a bright lamp.
Make your bed as comfortable as possible, too. Change the mattress if it's worn out or if it leaves you feeling sore in the morning. Swap out old pillows for new ones that support your neck and head better. If your sheets make you itch, look for softer sheets or check for an allergy to certain fibers.

, Most adults need seven to eight hours of sleep each night. If you aren't getting enough sleep, your mind and body might find it difficult to regulate your body's ability to sleep deeply, which may result in sleep talking and other problems.


Ongoing sleep deprivation can also put added stress on your mind and body, and that stress may mean that your brain requires longer, more frequent periods of deep sleep to recover. For that reason, don't expect your sleep talking to vanish after one full night's rest. It could take several days or weeks for your brain to settle into a healthier state.

, Go to bed at the same time each night and wake up at the same time each morning. Keep the same hours each day—even on the weekends—and avoid staying up late or sleeping in.


Your body operates on various patterns, and maintaining those patterns can help regulate its various chemical, hormonal, and physical cycles. The time you go to bed, the time you wake up, and the amount of sleep you get all form the key structure of your sleep pattern. By sticking to a single sleep pattern, you allow your body to more adequately regulate the way it functions during sleep.

, If your sleep talking keeps someone else awake, ask that individual to help you stop by speaking in soothing, comforting tones during an episode.Monitor the results closely. If engaging you while you talk in your sleep soothes you, you'll likely sink into a deeper sleep and the talking should stop. On the other hand, it's also possible that engaging you will cause your mind to remain more wakeful and alert, which could aggravate your sleep talking and make it last longer.

, Since most people aren't aware of their own sleep talking habits, you'll need to talk to the people who have heard you talking in your sleep. Ask them to think about how long the problem has been going on.


If the problem is recent, it most likely has a recent cause. Identifying and eliminating that cause will usually put an end to the sleep talking.
Long-term sleep talking is usually harder to get rid of since the cause will be harder to identify. If your current partner or roommate cannot recall a time when you did not sleep talk, ask the people who used to live with you—past roommates, siblings, parents, and so on—if you used to talk in your sleep while you lived with them. More accurately pinning down the start of your problem can lead to a more accurate analysis of what caused it and how to stop it.

, Make a list of the prescription and non-prescription medications you take on a regular basis. Research each one and determine if any of them have been linked to sleep talking or other sleep problems.


Don't stop taking any prescription medication without first consulting your doctor about it, even if you believe that medicine is responsible for your sleep talking.
Even if a certain medication isn't typically linked to sleep talking, you should still mention it to your doctor if your bouts of sleep talking began around the same time you started the medication. There is still some chance that the medication could be connected to the problem somehow.
If you're taking recreational drugs, whether legal or illegal, you should also note that they could be involved in the problem, too.

, Sleep talking is often a sign of physical and mental illness. Ask yourself if there are currently any underlying health issues you may need to address. Taking care of those may also end your sleep talking episodes.


Even short-term health difficulties can trigger episodes of sleep talking. For instance, you might start talking in your sleep if you have a high fever. The sleep talking usually disappears with the fever in these instances, but if other factors were also involved, it may continue even after the fever breaks.
Mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders, can cause sleep talking, too. This is especially true if you have a mental health disorder that hasn't been diagnosed or treated. Once treatment begins, you may notice a decline in the number of sleep talking episodes you experience.

, When you visit your doctor, be prepared with a complete record of your personal medical history. Be as thorough and honest as possible.


Your doctor may also ask you questions about your family medical history. Sleep disorders often run in family lines, and if you have a close relative with a diagnosed sleep disorder, you might be at a higher risk of experiencing that disorder, too.

, Immediately before or after your initial appointment, start keeping a sleep journal to monitor your sleeping habits. After two weeks, review this journal with your doctor to determine if certain patterns might be the cause of your sleep talking.Record the times you go to bed, when you think you fell asleep, and when you woke up.
You should also record notes about your daily habits and routines. Make a list of the medications you take and when you take them. Note when you exercise and for how long. Write down what you drink each day and when you drink it.

, On occasion, sleep talking could be a symptom of a more serious sleep disorder, or another sleep disorder might be mistaken for standard sleep talking. Watch for other signs related to sleep disorders to determine if you may have a more severe problem.


REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is one common cause. If you physically act out your dreams while talking, or if you shout and become violent in your sleep, RBD could be to blame.Night terrors can also be linked to sleep talking. The talking one does while experiencing night terrors will usually be notably extreme, and may involved screaming or thrashing around.
People with catathrenia (also known as ""nocturnal groaning"") don't often speak in audible words during sleep. Instead, they typically make long, loud groaning sounds.

, A sleep specialist might use a sleep study or polysomnogram to monitor your mind and body as you sleep. This test may allow the doctor to diagnose sleep disorders responsible for your problem.


Under most circumstances, a sleep specialist will use a diagnostic overnight polysomnogram to diagnose problems related to sleep talking. During the test, special equipment will be used to monitor your breathing patterns, blood oxygen levels, heart rhythms, and limb movements. Your overall quality of sleep will be monitored, as well.After the test, the sleep specialist assigned to your case will study the recorded results and look for patterns that could be indicative of an underlying sleep disorder. Once a diagnosis is made, an appropriate course of treatment can be devised.

Snoring can be an indication of a condition called sleep apnea, which can cause high blood pressure, heart problems, or even Type 2 diabetes.Make sure you don’t have any underlying health issues and that an anti-snoring mouthpiece is appropriate for you.;
, There are two main categories of mouthpiece, Mandibular Advancement Devices and Tongue Retaining Devices.


Mandibular Advancement Devices are the most common type of oral device.

They look similar to a mouthguard and usually have some of type of plastic or wire hinge on the sides.
They prevent snoring by moving the lower jaw forward, which helps open the airway
They cannot be used if you have a full set of dentures.
Mandibular Advancement Devices have been shown to reduce subjective daytime sleepiness, the frequency of respiratory events, and the frequency of waking from sleep, while increasing the duration of sleep.


Tongue Retaining Devices are less common but are preferred by some people.

They look like a mouthguard except they have a protruding plastic bulb at the end of it.They work by pulling the tongue forward to prevent it from obstructing the airway.
Some people prefer a Tongue Retaining Device because they have a large tongue or because they are unable or unwilling to fit a device over their teeth.



, Many anti-snoring mouthpieces are quite affordable. They range in price from $35 to over $250. Price depends on whether the mouthpiece will be custom-fit by a specialist using an impression of your teeth or whether the mouthpiece will be molded by you at home. Other factors that affect price is whether the mouthpiece is adjustable and how long the mouthpiece might last.

, There are many online sources to purchase anti-snoring mouthpieces. Be aware that anti-snoring mouthpieces are typically classified as Class II Medical Devices and may require a prescription from your doctor. Also, don’t be fooled into purchasing a nightguard even though it looks similar to an anti-snoring mouthpiece and is cheaper. Nightguards are designed to stop you from grinding your teeth and won’t help prevent snoring.

, Many mouthpieces involve a boil-and-bite technique, which you can do from the comfort of your own home. This involves softening the mouthpiece using warm water and biting on it to form a mold of your teeth. Make sure to read the instructions for your product to determine exactly what steps to follow.

,


A toothbrush
Toothpaste
A medium sized pot for boiling water
A slotted spoon
A timer that shows minutes and seconds
A clean towel
A pair of scissors

, This will help you decide which mouthpiece settings to use


Typical bite: your top front teeth slightly overlap your bottom front teeth.
Mild underbite: your top front teeth are even with or slightly behind your bottom front teeth.
Severe underbite: your top front teeth are very far behind your bottom front teeth.
Overbite: your top front teeth are very far in front of your bottom front teeth.

, It is important that your mouthpiece fits properly in your mouth while you sleep. This ensures safety, comfort and effectiveness. Molding of the mouthpiece typically only needs to be done once.

, Use your regular toothbrush and toothpaste. You can also use floss if you like. It’s important that little bits of food don’t get into the mouthpiece and alter the shape of it during fitting.

, Place enough clean water in the pot to cover the mouthpiece. Bring the water to a simmer or slightly above.

, Lower the mouthpiece into the water using the slotted spoon. This will help you avoid burning your fingers.

, You should typically leave the mouthpiece in the boiling water for exactly two minutes. Make sure you start timing immediately.

, Use the slotted spoon to remove the mouthpiece. Allow the mouthpiece to cool for fifteen seconds.

, Insert the warm mouthpiece into your mouth. Make sure you are holding your lower jaw forward for the best fit. Bite down on the mouthpiece hard enough to make a solid impression in the plastic. Hold your bite for thirty seconds.

, Make sure you don’t make an impression in the plastic or you might ruin the mold. Let the mouthpiece fully cool before handling it further.

, Sometimes the molding process creates jagged edges that might hurt your mouth. Trim these but be careful not to trim too much.

, A dentist with expertise in sleep-related breathing disorders can ensure your mouthpiece fits properly.

, Follow your normal bedtime procedures, which may include brushing your teeth, flossing and using mouthwash. Also, remove any partial dentures. It’s a good idea to have clean teeth before putting in your anti-snoring mouthpiece to help maintain cleanliness of your mouth and the mouthpiece.

, Some people prefer to put in the mouthpiece up to 30 minutes before bed so they can get used to the feeling of it before going to sleep.

, Some mouthpieces have adjustable features, which can be changed according to your mouth and needs.

, If you notice excess saliva, if the mouthpiece makes you gag, or if you experience any major discomfort, remove the mouthpiece and ensure you have put it in correctly.

, The mouthpiece should be worn throughout the night, but if your mouthpiece feels uncomfortable and wakes you up, simply take it out and try wearing it again the following night. It sometimes takes a few days to get used to the sensation of it in your mouth. Also, sleep normally but try to sleep on your side or stomach as this will help with your breathing.

, It’s a good idea to remove the mouthpiece as soon as you get out of bed to prevent unnecessary wear and tear.

, Use warm water, a hard-bristle toothbrush and non-whitening, non-abrasive toothpaste

, Denture cleaning tablets are quite affordable and can be bought at most drugstores.

, It’s a good idea to have a designated place where you always store your mouthpiece so you don’t misplace or lose it.

, Do not continue wearing a damaged mouthpiece. There is a significant risk that a piece could break off and obstruct your airway while you are sleeping.

Ultimately, by wearing a mask, you’ll be changing the way you’ve slept for years. As a result, it will take you time to get used to the sensation of the mask and any changes that come with it.


It may take weeks or months for you to feel “normal” with your mask on.
The vast majority of people who wear CPAP masks report feeling discomfort during the first days or weeks of wearing it.
Wearing a mask might come with a variety of changes, such as a new sleep position, a new pillow, and accepting the need for more space from your significant other.;
, A problem for many people adjusting to a CPAP mask is overcoming the feeling of claustrophobia – a condition in which you feel anxiety over being trapped or closed in. There are, though, some ways to get over the feeling of claustrophobia:


Wear the mask in short increments at first. Try wearing it for 5 or 10 minutes when you are in bed.
Slowly increase the amount of time you wear your mask, until you’re so comfortable with it that you fall asleep with it on.
Disconnect the mask from your machine and wear it around the house as you do housework or watch TV. This way, you’ll slowly grow used to wearing it.
Consider a different style of mask that covers less of your face., A great way to help you overcome anxiety associated with wearing a CPAP machine is to listen to white noise as you sleep. White noise is nonintrusive background noise that helps a lot of people overcome racing thoughts or other symptoms of anxiety.


Rely on an alarm clock that generates white noise.
Use your smart phone. There are a variety of apps you can download that will create white noise while you sleep.
Try different types of white noise. Some people prefer the sound of a rainstorm, others prefer the sound of a babbling brook, while others prefer the sounds of a bustling city street., If you’ve experienced substantial anxiety or discomfort associated with wearing your CPAP mask, you should consult your doctor. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medication to help you adjust to your CPAP.


Doctors have found that a short course of Lunesta may increase the efficacy of CPAP treatment.Depending on your unique health and situation, doctors may be able to prescribe anti-anxiety or anti depression medications.
Always consult your sleep specialist before beginning any medication., One unexpected problem that you may experience when adjusting to your CPAP mask is a dry or stuffy nose. This will certainly increase your discomfort and make the adjustment period more problematic.


Consider a CPAP machine that also comes with a heated humidifier.
Consult your doctor about a nasal steroid spray.
Make sure your mask fits and is not leaky – this could cause you to have a dry nose., Perhaps the most important thing to sleeping with your CPAP is making sure you are laying so you can get restful sleep. Without laying in a comfortable way, the CPAP won’t be effective.


The vast majority of CPAP users sleep either on the left or right side – the recommended sleeping position for people with CPAP masks.
A minority of CPAP users sleep on their stomach or back – positions that are potentially dangerous or undermine the effectiveness of CPAP treatment.
Back sleeping is also not very safe because your tongue may wind up obstructing your airway., One thing you may want to try to help you sleep better with a CPAP mask is to use a special pillow. Using a special pillow or providing proper elevation will go a long way in helping you get more restful sleep, especially when you just first start to use a CPAP machine.


Consider a CPAP friendly pillow that has cutouts for your tube to fit into.
If you are normally a back or stomach sleeper, you may want to consider a special pillow to help you adjust to side sleeping.

, A great way to ease your adjustment to wearing a CPAP mask is to create the best sleep environment possible. By creating a good sleeping environment, you’ll help set yourself at ease, increase your chances of getting restful sleep, and help smooth the transition of your adjustment time.


Purchase new sheets and blankets, if that will make you more comfortable.
Turn on the fan or turn down the air conditioning, if you like it cooler while you sleep.
Consider buying a new bed, if your old bed is worn out or no longer comfortable., To adjust to wearing a CPAP mask, you need to be under the care of a sleep specialist. This is important, as many general practitioners may not have the experience or expertise needed to guide a patient through the problems associated with CPAP treatment.


Seek a referral to a sleep specialist from your primary care physician.
Maintain contact with the sleep specialist as you are adjusting to your CPAP mask.
Make sure all doctors you seek treatment from are aware of your sleep apnea diagnosis and the fact that you use a CPAP mask., There are a wide variety of CPAP masks available. As a result, you should spend a little time making sure you pick a mask and style that work for you. By not doing this, you may be stuck with a mask that is much harder to adjust to. Consider:


Full face masks that go over your nose and mouth. This is the style that will likely stay on your face better while you sleep.
Nasal pillows that cover your nostrils.
Half masks that cover your nose.
Specially designed masks that are custom made to fit your face., Your mask size is also very important in making sure your mask fits properly. Without a mask that is the right size, you’ll have a tough time adjusting to wearing your mask.


Sizes vary based on the brand and style of mask. Don’t expect that the size of one mask will correspond to the size of another. Always make sure to have a proper fitting.
Familiarize yourself with ways of adjusting your mask to fit the best. Many masks offer a variety of ways to adjust tightness and fit.
Contact your doctor if your mask does not fit.
Follow directions when securing your mask."

It may affect your memory, your ability to make decisions, and your level of patience.If you find that you are slow to respond to stimuli (a loud sound, perhaps), that you have difficulty concentrating or understanding complex tasks, you are not alert, you begin making more mistakes, and you have difficulty with flexible thinking, you are likely suffering from sleep deprivation.

Studies have found that medical personnel who work more than 24 hours at a particular time are more prone to making mistakes due to sleep deprivation.;
, It's no surprise that a lack of sleep can cause irritability and changes in mood. You may actually develop a mood disorder if you're consistently sleep deprived. Disruptions in the sleep cycle have been strongly connected to depression and a reduced quality of life.You may also feel more anxious and lose your motivation to do simple everyday tasks.Sleep deprivation may resemble depression or anxiety. Patients report poor mood, irritability, low energy, decreased libido, poor judgment, and other signs of psychological dysfunction. These symptoms usually disappear when normal sleep is restored.

, If you're sleep deprived, you may have trouble concentrating or paying attention. It may be harder for you to make decisions, remember things, or react. All of these can increase the number of mistakes you make and make you feel restless. No matter how hard you try, you feel fatigued throughout the day.


While the purpose of sleep isn't completely understood, studies have shown that sleep energizes the brain.Most people experience an afternoon drop in energy levels, but a little caffeine or rest can help them regain alertness. If you find, however, that you feel like you're dragging throughout the entire day, you may be sleep deprived.
Assess your level of fatigue after napping. Did taking naps used to refresh you and now they don't? If you feel like you're always groggy, even after resting, you be dealing with sleep deprivation.

, Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to weight gain and obesity. This is because your body releases appetite-regulating hormones while you sleep. Sleep is also important for processing glucose faster. Sleep deprivation can disrupt this, contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes. Pay attention to changes in your weight, appetite, and blood pressure. Changes may signal that your body is sleep deficient.


Sleep deprivation can also raise your blood pressure, increasing your risk of heart attack. Sleep apnea has also been connected with heart disease.Lack of sleep may contribute to the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart attack.Consider if you gained weight since the start of the period you've been getting poor sleep. If so, your body may be reacting to sleep loss.

, If you find yourself frequently canceling plans with friends or family because you're too tired, you may be sleep deprived. While passing on a party isn't unusual, if you find yourself constantly avoiding social events this consequence of sleep deprivation can lead to a poor quality of life. Sleep deprivation and anxiety are closely connected, causing tension in family and social relationships.Your work life may also suffer since sleep deprivation can increase your risk of injury on the job, especially if it requires driving.For example, did you used to enjoy seeing friends and going to events? If you now dread the thought of leaving your house, or it just seems like too much work, you may be sleep deprived.

, Track important sleep information so that if you need to see a doctor, you can give details about your symptoms. Keep a log of when you sleep, how long of a stretch you slept, the quality of sleep, and whether or not you had trouble falling or staying asleep.


You should also note how you felt throughout the day, including your energy level.
Note whether your sleep seems to be impacted by outside factors, such as your diet or exercise routine.

, Each person has different sleep requirements. For example, adults over 65 years of age usually need less sleep. Pregnant women also experience changes in sleep needs (like requiring more sleep early in pregnancy and having difficulty sleeping towards the last trimester). In general, the National Sleep Foundation recommends:Older adults: seven to eight hours
Adults (aged 18 to 64): seven to nine hours
Teenagers (aged 13 to 17): eight to 10 hours
School-aged kids (aged six to 13): nine to 11 hours
Preschoolers (aged three to five): 10 to 13 hours
Toddlers (aged one to two years): 11 to 14 hours
Infants (aged four to 11 months): 12 to 15 hours
Newborns (from birth to three months): 14 to 17 hours

, There may be an obvious duty or obligation, like caring for an infant or adult, that's causing the lack of sleep, especially if you work another job. Shift work can also cause sleep deprivation, especially if your hours are irregular. Or, there may be a medical condition depriving you of sleep. These sleep disorders include:Delayed sleep phase disorder
Environmental sleep disorder
Restless leg syndrome
Psychophysiological insomnia
Periodic limb movement disorder

, If you are sleep deprived or feel overly tired, make a doctor's appointment as soon as you can. Once your doctor has determined why you're sleep deprived, you can begin to address the cause whether it's voluntary or a result of some medication you're on. Your doctor will also check to see if you're suffering from an underlying sleep disorder.If your doctor determines that your sleep deprivation is voluntary, you may be able to make changes to improve your sleep. For example, if you're a caregiver for a parent you might ask a sibling to help you share duties. Or, if your job is causing the sleep deprivation, talk with your supervisor about changing your shifts (which may require a medical note from your doctor).

, If your doctor suspects you have a sleep disorder, you may be referred to a sleep specialist for more testing. You'll probably need to participate in a sleep study where your sleep is monitored for problems. Some of the most common sleep disorders include:Restless Leg Syndrome (an irresistible urge to move the legs)Narcolepsy (which causes daytime drowsiness)
Obstructive sleep apnea (pauses in breathing that can disrupt your sleep)Insomnia
Circadian rhythm sleep disorders, where you have trouble with sleep cycles or patterns (like Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, Non-24 Sleep Wake Disorder, and Shift Work Disorder)

, If you are sleep deprived and feel tired throughout the day, you'll need to cope. Although there are no medical treatments for sleep deprivation, studies suggest that napping is the most effective way to deal with sleep loss. Take naps of 30 minutes or less to make you feel more alert.Avoid taking long naps (over two hours long). These are harder to wake from and they can actually make you feel more tired.

, Studies have shown that insomniacs are actually kept up because they're hyper alert.For this reason, behavior therapies are usually effective in treating insomnia. To practice a behavioral therapy, you may learn how to relax, use light to relax yourself, and practice good bed habits.


Some good bed habits include only using the bed for sleep and sex, having a comfortable sleep environment, and limiting the amount of time that you're laying awake in bed., If behavioral treatments don't work and you're becoming anxious about your sleep deprivation, your doctor may prescribe you a sleep aid. These medications (hypnotics) should only be used for a short period of time and in the lowest dose possible. Side effects of prescription sleep aids include complex behaviors, allergic reactions, dizziness, headache, memory problems, and prolonged drowsiness.You should never become reliant on a hypnotic medication to be able to sleep.
Your doctor may determine that another medication you're taking is causing your sleeplessness. For example, some antidepressants can cause insomnia.It's important to discuss any medication you're currently taking with your doctor.

, You can try taking an OTC medication. These generally aren't as effective as prescription hypnotics or sleep aids. But, they may contain antihistamines which can calm or relax you.You may want to use OTC medications if you're concerned about the side effects of prescription sleep aids. OTC medications are considered to be safe when used according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

, Use caffeine wisely. While some caffeine use can increase your alertness, you can actually develop a tolerance to it if you use it frequently. To cope with sleep deprivation, take 75 to 150 mg of caffeine early in the day. Avoid taking it later in the day, since caffeine may keep you up at night.For example, you might drink an 8 ounce cup of coffee around mid-morning. An 8 ounce coffee contains 95 to 200 mg of caffeine (while an 8 ounce cup of black tea contains 14 to 70 mg of caffeine).Avoid using caffeine too often. If you miss your daily caffeine intake when your body is expecting it, you can experience withdrawal symptoms like irritability and headache.

Ask your dentist for an oral appliance.An oral appliance is a form-fitted device that you can wear while sleeping to keep your jaw, your tongue, and your soft palate appropriately positioned for sleep.,
See your doctor if your snoring remains a problem.If your snoring remains unresolved after the methods you have tried, it is important to not simply give up and ignore the problem.,
Obtain a CPAP machine if your snoring is from sleep apnea.A ""CPAP"" machine stands for ""continual positive airway pressure."",
Undergo traditional surgery for snoring.For snoring that is caused by anatomical structures blocking your airway as you sleep, another option (if medical devices are unsuccessful on their own) is to undergo a surgical procedure.,
Opt for palatal implants.Another medical treatment option for snoring is palatal implants.,
Consider a procedure called ""somnoplasty.,
Understand how snoring can impact sleep.Snoring can be more of a problem than it seems at first glance.,
Tell your doctor if you have been experiencing daytime sleepiness.One of the cardinal signs indicating that your snoring could be significantly affecting the quality of your sleeps (to say nothing of your partner's, if you are sharing a bed) is when you begin to experience unusual daytime sleepiness.,
Know the potential risks of untreated snoring.A number of car accidents are caused by people with undiagnosed and/or untreated sleep apnea who temporarily fall asleep at the wheel due to disrupted sleeps and heightened fatigue.",How to Stop Snoring Using Medical Devices," An oral appliance functions to keep your airway open and effective for breathing, hopefully reducing or altogether eliminating your snoring problem.


It is important to go for follow-up appointments with your dentist every 6 months, or as directed, to ensure that the fit or your oral appliance is optimally functional.
At these appointments, your doctor can make any adjustments to your oral appliance as needed to maximize its effectiveness for you.;
, This is because there may be an underlying medical condition, such as sleep apnea or another respiratory condition, that is responsible for your snoring. If this is the case, it is key to have it diagnosed and treated by a doctor.


If an underlying medical condition is responsible for your snoring, you will likely be able to stop the snoring with the use of medical devices.
If your doctor suspects you have sleep apnea, this will be diagnosed during a sleep study

, How the device works is that you wear a mask over your nose as you sleep; it uses positive pressure to force air into your lungs as you sleep, ensuring that your airway does not collapse during the night.


To be diagnosed with sleep apnea (or to be tested for the cause of your snoring), your doctor may request that you stay overnight at a hospital or other healthcare facility to receive an overnight sleep study.
The information gathered over the course of the overnight sleep study can be extremely informative to your doctors about the best course of treatment for your snoring problem moving forwards.
They can also size you for a CPAP machine, or other medical device, to ensure that it fits well and that you are optimally set up to have the best possible management of your snoring problem once you are sent home.
If the CPAP machine isn't effective, you may need to try a BiPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) machine. A BiPAP delivers pressure into your lungs, like the CPAP machine, but unlike the CPAP, it also uses pressure to help you exhale., The specific surgery is called a ""uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.""


You will be put under general anesthesia, and the surgeon will cut or trim any excess tissues in your oral area that may be blocking your airway as you sleep, leading to your snoring problem.
Another option is to have a ""laser uvulopalatopharyngoplasty,"" which is when a laser is used to shorten and shrink tissues in your mouth area as opposed to traditional surgery. This may require several sessions with the laser to be effective.

, This is when small plastic implants are inserted on your soft palate in such a way that it will prevent collapse of the soft palate (and surrounding structures) as you sleep. The goal is to help keep your airway open as you sleep, thus preventing snoring.

,""Somnoplasty is when radio frequency waves are used to shrink tissues in your mouth area that may be blocking your airway. You will be given local anesthetic to block any pain while the procedure is performed.


As you can see, there are a variety of medical procedures available to help ""cure"" (or treat) snoring that is related to anatomical blockages of the airway.
Your surgeon can advise you as to which procedure is most suited to you, depending upon your specific snoring symptoms and your anatomy.

, In addition to being disruptive to your partner (if you are sharing a bed with someone), it can also cause you to have several inadvertent awakenings during the night.


If snoring is caused by an underlying medical issue, such as sleep apnea or another underlying respiratory problem, your airway may collapse during the night to the point where you temporarily stop breathing.
In addition to snoring, this can lead to very disruptive sleep patterns for you — and you may not even be aware it is happening.
It if for this reason that unresolved snoring warrants professional medical evaluation and treatment.

, This may include signs and symptoms such as:


Feeling unusually fatigued
Heightened irritability
Decreased focus and concentration
Falling asleep or losing focus at inappropriate times, such as during conversation, at work, or, most dangerous of all, at the wheel of your car while driving.

, Undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea (and other medical conditions that may cause snoring) can also lead to a number of other health problems down the road. This is why receiving an official diagnosis and treatment plan sooner rather than later is key.

Exercise.,
Avoid sleeping in.,
Take an ice bath.,
Take a warm bath!,
Get a massage.,
Try aromatherapy.",How to Rest1," This might seem counter-intuitive, but exercise is proven to make your rest not only more rewarding, but actually more restful. Studies show that exercise can raise the quality of your sleep and boost your mental health too. Exercise will also make resting easier, you will find that you are far less antsy when you are trying to relax. Try not to exercise six hours before bedtime, as this can contribute to poor sleep.;
, If you start hitting the snooze button too many times you can mess with your internal clock which causes you to start to feel tired at a certain time of the evening. Sleeping in can mess with your sleep cycle just as much as staying up really late can, so try to stick to a schedule. It might be hard, but that means getting up at the same time even when the weekend rolls around.

, Ice baths can do wonders for your body and have you feeling physically rejuvenated. There's a reason why so many professional athletes use ice baths as a way to recover. All you have to do is grab a three bags of ice from a convenience store, fill the bathtub halfway with cold water, pour the ice in, and then jump in yourself. If you find yourself feeling physically worn down this technique may do the trick, especially if you are proactive about the treatment.

, If the ice bath sounds like too much for you, warm baths can help you relax in a different way. As long as you don't stay in the hot water for too long, warm baths can help ease anxiety, soothe your skin, and even make it easier to fall asleep. Going from a warm bath to the bed can help trigger a change in temperature in your body that leads to melatonin production that will help you sleep. , Massages are a great way to get your body to relax and you'll find that even a quick one hour massage can help immensely. There are lots of different types of massages, so research which one sounds most appealing to you. Swedish massages are more gentle, deep massages are slower but more forceful, and trigger point massages focus on only very specific sections of your body to release muscle tension. , The idea behind aromatherapy is that the essential oils found in plants can help heal and relax your body. The treatment involves inhalation of these essential oils as well as having them massaged into your skin. Researchers aren't totally sure how it works, but they think the smells from these essential oils trigger certain and influence parts of your brain that lead to relaxation. Many people have reported decreased pain, improved mood, and a general sense of relaxation.

Wash your hands.,
Purchase ear plugs that can easily be moved between your fingers.,
Roll the earplug between your thumb and index finger.You want to roll the earplug into a snake-like shape.,
Pull your ear up and back.,
Carefully insert the earplug.,
Hold in place for 20 – 30 seconds.",How to Put in Ear Plugs1," Before you attempt to handle ear plugs, make sure to wash your hands. You do not want to expose your ears to dirt and germs.Wash your hands with soap and clean running water before using ear plugs.Get your hands wet with clear water and then lather your hands in soap. Scrub your hands for about 20 seconds. If you need help tracking time, hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song to yourself twice. Make sure to wash under your fingernails, between your nails, and the backs of your hands.
Rinse your hands completely when you're done. Then, dry your hands with a clean, dry towel.;
, Try to test them in your fingers before buying if possible. Buying in bulk is advised as soft foam ear plugs are not reusable. They should be thinner and rounded on one edge so the plugs can be easily inserted into your ear.

, This will make it smaller so it can be easily inserted into the ear. The foam will expand again once you’ve fitted it inside your ear, blocking sound. If the ear plug is particularly thick, you can roll it between your hands instead. Just make sure that you are just thinning the ear plug out lengthwise, rather than rolling it up into a ball.








, Grab the top of your ear with the hand not holding the ear plug. Stretch it slightly up and backwards.This will pull your ear open a bit, allowing you to more easily insert your earplug.









Don’t pull too hard. Just a gentle tug is enough to have your ear expanded enough for the ear plug.It may be helpful to use a mirror so you can more clearly see what you're doing.

, Slowly and gently insert the plug it into your ear canal. It should easily slide in place with your ear canal expanded slightly. Do not put the plug in too far and don't force it. While most of the foam body should be in the ear canal, there should be enough of the plug outside the canal that you can easily grasp it with your fingertips.







, Hold the plug in place with your fingertips. This will allow the foam to expand, preventing sound from getting into your ear canal. Slowly count to 20 or 30 as you hold the plug in place.


To see if the plug is working, listen to yourself speak. You should sound muffled, as should the sound around you. Do not expect it to completely silence the surroundings, but it should quiet them.If the plug is not working, you may need to try a different form of plugs or possibly smaller ones. Most of the foam body should be in your ear canal by the end. Sometimes you have to try again if the foam is not sealing sound out properly.

Meditate.,
Take incremental breaks on the micro and macro level.,
Practice not thinking.,
Try to get an appropriate amount of sleep.,
Listen to instrumental music or ambient noise.",How to Rest2," There are many types of meditation, so finding the one that works for you is important. Meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, lessen anxiety, and much more. If you’re looking for a way to rest without actually sleeping, meditation is a rewarding and mindful way of achieving that goal. Rather than laying on the coaching tossing and turning trying to feel rested, practicing meditation can actively improve your quality of rest.

, Work breaks into your day before you start to feel exhausted or overtired. If you keep pushing yourself until you actually start to feel awful, it will make it much harder to recover and feel rested. Work breaks into your life on a daily basis, a weekly basis, a monthly basis, and a yearly basis. Everyone needs time to recoup and recharge. This can be as easy as sitting outside for a few minutes before going back to work, taking one day to yourself a week, or a relaxing vacation. , We all have a strong habit of discursive thinking, which means one thought flows to the next and then the next. This can be exhausting, and if you practice not thinking you can give your mind a valuable break. Open your senses to what is happening around you and pay attention, but don't think about them. Just experience them. When you find yourself drifting back into a line of thought, notice this and go back to paying attention to what you are experiencing.

, Sleeping is the one time when we are really able to give our minds a rest. Although meditation can help, sleeping is absolutely necessary to feel rested. Don't sacrifice sleep for other activities because the odds are they won't benefit your well being and happiness nearly as much as those extra hours will.

, Sounds like running water, birds chirping, and even storms can help you relax and stop stressing about whatever is going through your head. You can find playlists of these online. Other great options include gongs, chimes, or whatever instrumental music you might like. The brain always wants some sort of sensory input , and by supplying these sounds you might be able to let go of the more stressful input that you are supplying.

Think about rest before and after you do it.,
Stay away from electronics when you’re trying to rest, particularly at night.,
Switch up your bedtime routine.",How to Rest3," It’s not easy to go from moving full speed all day to relaxation. You have to ease into it, and thinking about how you might like to relax can be a helpful tool. Take a second to think about when you are going to be in bed, what it will be like to be in bed. Basically, try to look forward to it! This will make hopping in bed feel very rewarding and you will fall asleep much quicker.

, A lot of electronics emit a light that tell your brain that it is daytime out, which can really mess with your sleep cycle and your ability to get some shuteye. If you’re having trouble feeling well rested, electronics might be a part of the problem. Using your laptop in the living room and then leaving it out there is a great way to separate your sleeping arrangement from electronics. The same goes for your cell phone.

, Nightly rituals can help, but establishing a healthy routine is one of the best ways to fall asleep quicker and rest more easily. Try to avoid eating a snack right before going to bed or drinking caffeinated tea. Instead, set a positive daily cycle that puts you in bed at a similar time each night and without any sugar or caffeine intake too close to that time.

, How did this feel? What did you want to do with your body position? Your head position? Try to recall the exact feelings.

, Your friends are also very tired; imagine them yawning, half closing their eyes and then imagine more yawns going around the group.

, Join in the yawning yourself.

, If not, imagine them closing again and again, gently.

, Feel the yawn in your throat or jaw. If your mind wanders, look back at your imagined yawning friends.

, Let warmth spread through you and feel the drowsiness take hold.

, By now, drowsiness should have taken hold and you'll be ready to hop straight in.

Disinfect the cut.,
Apply the petroleum jelly.,
Cover it up.,
Change the bandage regularly.",How to Heal a Cut Due to Dry Skin1," Wash with soap and warm water. Dry well by patting, not rubbing, the skin. Make sure there is nothing around the cut that might continue to irritate your skin., Spread petroleum jelly (or Vaseline) in the cut with a cotton swab. Do not dip the swab in the jelly more than once, because you could contaminate the jelly., Once the cut is covered with petroleum jelly, cover it with a bandage. If the cut is on your fingers, you can simply roll a finger cot over the cut. Make sure the bandage is on dry skin so that it will stay on — if it’s on the Vaseline it will probably fall off., If the cut is on your hand, the bandage will probably come off after repeated hand washing. On other parts of the body, it’s likely to come off in the shower or bath. When this happens, change it. If it isn’t coming off, coat it with petroleum jelly and change the bandage every morning, monitoring how well your cut is healing."

, Have a glass of water with each meal. This will aid in digestion by helping to break food down so that your body can absorb nutrients. Water also softens stool and helps prevent constipation.Remember to drink water along with any snacks you have during the day as well.


If you're hoping to lose weight, drink water before you begin eating in order to feel full sooner.

, If you work in an office, keep a bottle on your desk and sip from it throughout the day. Set reminders on your computer if you have trouble remembering. If you work a more physical job, try to find a spot to keep a water bottle where you can access it regularly or just carry it with you.For more precise water intake tracking, find a bottle that has measurements marked along the side.
Try a bottle with special features like insulation to keep the water cold, a built-in filter, or a separate cylinder inside for infusing your water with fruit.

, An additional 1-2 cups (.25-.5 liters) of water is sufficient following moderate exercise, but intense exercise with excessive sweating may require a sports drink, such as Gatorade or Powerade. These beverages contain sodium, electrolytes, and carbohydrates, which will help replace what you lost through sweat., There are several apps available on your smartphone to help you remember to drink more water. The WaterLogged app allows you to track your daily water intake. Others, like OasisPlaces and WeTap, help you find nearby water fountains where you can refill your water bottle for free., Every individual needs a different amount of water to stay healthy. But the “8 by 8” rule (8 ounces, 8 times a day) is easy to remember and can help you easily track your water intake each day.


Outside the US, this translates to about .25 liters 8 times a day.

, Many people believe liquids with caffeine will dehydrate you, but this is not true when they are consumed in moderate amounts. Water is best, but if you prefer other beverages, such as fruit juice or caffeinated coffee and tea, continue drinking those to reach your daily liquid requirements.Limit your daily caffeine intake to 2-4 cups of coffee or tea daily. Beyond that, you may experience insomnia, irritability, headaches, or other side effects. Children should avoid caffeine altogether.Caffeinated beverages may not be a good source of hydration for those who do not have a developed tolerance to the effects of caffeine. It can be a weak diuretic in the early few days of drinking coffee, but soon tolerance is developed when consumed regularly for 4-5 days, and the diuretic effect disappears., About 20% of your daily water intake comes from food.Watermelon, celery, cucumbers, and lettuce are good, healthy diet choices that help with hydration. Soups and broths are also a good way to sneak more water into your diet.

, If you dislike drinking plain water, a variety of products exist that add flavor or sweetness to a glass of tap water. Some are available as powders while others are liquid additives.

Be sure to read the ingredients of these products. Some contain thickening agents like propylene glycol that are considered controversial.If you would prefer something more natural, try cutting up strawberries, lemons, or cucumbers and putting them into your water to infuse it with those flavors.

Lie face-down and extend your arms to grab the ball.,
Raise your arms and legs at the same time.,
Lower your arms and legs to the ground slowly.,
Repeat 10 times.",How to Do Medicine Ball Back Exercises1," You can also use a carpeted area, but a yoga mat is preferable, as you want to be able to keep your body as straight as possible throughout the exercise.


Medicine balls vary in both weight (from 2 pounds to 30 pounds) and material (hard plastic, dense rubber or synthetic leather).Choose the type and weight that works best for your level of fitness. It’s better to start with a lighter weight ball and work your way up to a heavier one to avoid injuries.;
, The ball should not be directly in front of the mat, but placed within arm's reach on one of the shorter ends of the mat.

, Your head should be facing the ball. When you extend your arms to grab the ball, keep them as straight as possible.


Keep your legs extended straight along the mat. You can point your toes or relax them.
Give yourself enough space to fully extend your body without bumping into anything.

, While gripping the ball, raise your arms and legs at the same time. Hold the position for a minute or two at the top.


It's fine if your legs only rise a few inches above the mat. Your back muscles will still get a workout.
Keep your core tight and make sure to keep breathing!

, Don’t hurry this part of the exercise. Take a deep breath and slowly bring your arms and legs to the ground. Your core should still be tight and you should feel the muscles in both your back and abs being engaged.

, Try to do two or three sets of 10. This beginner level exercise will help to work your lower back, which is often forgotten due to lack of visibility. Remember that weak lower back muscles put you at risk of developing poor posture."

It is most effective if you set aside at least twenty minutes a day.The habit of journaling will allow you to process your thoughts, emotions, and goals., You don’t need to be a literary genius to write a journal, just let your consciousness flow onto the page. Do not worry about grammar, spelling or what other people think. Just let your thoughts flow onto the page., If you feel stuck, try writing all of your thoughts and emotions down on the page as quickly as possible. This can help to remove some inhibitions., Sometimes it helps to choose a theme to focus on for a period, whether it is a week or a month. This can help keep you motivated in your journaling. It allows you to go deeper into a particular part of your life.For instance, you might choose to write on the topic of family, relationships, or marriage. Choose a theme that allows you to dig into a part of your life that you are trying to figure out.Journaling can also be a great way of working through depression. It can allow you to see your thoughts and feelings in a different light., Typically, a diary will record events and things that happen in your life. It is great to record the events in your life. Yet, a journal can go beyond simple recording what happened. It can be a space for you to reflect on your reactions and perceptions of the events in your life. Try to dig deeper into why (e.g., why did I react this way?) and how (e.g., how did I respond in that situation?) questions in your journal., The journal is a form of self reflection so you don’t need to worry about editing for spelling and grammar., When you start a new journal, leave two pages blank at the beginning of your journal. When you finish your journal, write a table of contents on these pages. Review your journal to find significant moments that you will want to review later. Write down these moments with a page number in your table of contents. This will help you find goals and events that you might want to review at a later point in life., The diary is a means of wrapping up a day. Whatever your degree of success or failure on that particular day can be summarized and put to rest in your diary. Once you have finished your diary entry for the day you are free to close the book on the day and move forward to tomorrow.

Your body will also release endorphins which will calm you emotionally.Exercise can also wake your body up, so it is best to do it earlier in the day. If you can chose between going to the gym in the morning and in the evening, try going in the morning.
Adults between 18-64 years of age should get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week for at least 10 minutes at a time.Make sure children that have trouble sleeping get enough exercise. This will help them to be tired at night.;
, Caffeine-free teas that contain chamomile or valerian can help start the process of relaxing you before bed. Look for teas containing these calming ingredients or teas labeled for ""sleepy time.""

, This is a great way to clear your mind and relax your body so you can fall asleep. Once you are in bed and in a comfortable position:Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Close your eyes and focus on feeling your breath as it moves through your body. Visualize its path through your mouth and nose, into your lungs, and back out again.
Notice where you carry tension in your body. As you exhale, consciously relax those areas.
If your thoughts return to your worries, acknowledge them and then focus again on your breathing.

, In this method you give your mind something to focus on other than the stresses of daily life. What works for you will be highly personal. It might be a favorite place, an imaginary location, doing an activity that you enjoy, or telling yourself a story.Slowly imagine the scene in as much detail as you can. For example, if you are imagining a beach, visualize the waves, listen to them crashing onto the shore, hear the seagulls calling, and image how the saltwater smells. Feel the breeze blowing and the warmth of the sun.If you find yourself returning to the stresses of your daily life, remind yourself that you will deal with it tomorrow and refocus on the imagery. It may take some practice, but you will get better at it over time.
This method may also help children who have trouble sleeping.

, This method is particularly good for people who carry their stress physically. If you are someone whose stress causes you to tense muscles in your back, your neck, or your head, this method may help you relax and fall asleep.Start at your toes and slowly work your way through each muscle group in your body.
Tense the muscle group for five seconds. Focus on how it feels. Then consciously relax the muscle group. Feel the difference. Repeat this five time for each muscle group. Then move on to the next muscle group.
Don’t hold your breath while tensing the muscles. Take deep relaxing breaths.

, If you have an area of your body where you carry your stress, this can lead to pain which can make it hard to sleep. Many people carry stress in their shoulders and neck, causing back pain and headaches.Have your partner give you a short, gentle massage before you sleep. If you have a particular area that hurts, focus on that area. The massage and the feeling of your muscles relaxing will relax you both physically and emotionally, preparing you to fall asleep.Turn the lights off or keep them low to reduce visual stimulation.
If you use a massage oil, chose one with a calming odor, such as lavender or vanilla., Read something that is engaging enough that it will prevent you from worrying. But don’t read a book that is so exciting that you can’t put it down.


Reading scientific or informative material will engage your mind but not your emotions.
Avoid mystery novels. They will increase the risk that you will be up all night reading.
This technique works well for children who have trouble unwinding at the end of the day. Read to your child before bed for 10-20 minutes to help him or her relax.

, If you can't relax because you're trying to keep track of everything you need to do the next day, stop and write it down. Write down anything that is bothering you or causing you to worry. If you start to stress again, remind yourself that you've written everything down and you can pick up again tomorrow.

, If you are laying awake for more than 20 minutes, get up and walk around. This will help you to clear your head and avoid worrying. Take 10 minutes and try:Taking a warm shower to physically relax.
Reading a book to take your mind off your worries.
Listening to relaxing music.

, Waking up at the same time and falling asleep at the same time every day will help your body’s sleep-wake rhythm to prepare you to fall asleep at the right time and wake up at the right time. Maintain this schedule during the entire week. Even though you can sleep later on the weekends, don’t give in to the temptation to stay up late or sleep late.Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep per night.If you are still tired, this may be because you happen to need more. Some adults may need up to ten hours per night. Children and teenagers frequently need even more.
Try not to nap. While it may feel good at the time, if it means you can’t fall asleep at night, then it may be more harmful than helpful.

, About an hour before bed, treat yourself to a warm shower or bath, relaxing and heating up your body. When you step out into the cool air, your body temperature will drop, which mimics the action your body takes as it is preparing for sleep. Adding this step to your nightly routine can help your body begin to get into sleep-mode.

, Reduce any stimuli that could keep you awake. This may include noises, uncomfortable temperatures, a television, light, allergens, or uncomfortable mattresses. Possible solutions for managing these problems include:Use ear plugs or “white noise machines” to dampen sounds. White noise machines make a low, constant noise which, after a few minutes, you won’t notice. However, it cancels out other sounds which might disturb you. These techniques may be helpful if traffic noises or your neighbors keep you awake.
Use eye shades or blackout curtains to reduce light. This may be helpful if you work nights and have to sleep during the day, or if there is bright street lighting outside your window.
Keep your room a comfortable temperature. Most people sleep best when the room is between 60 and 67 °F (16-19 °C). If you live in a hot, dry climate, try using a cool humidifier or fan to bring the temperature down.
If you have allergies, try to reduce the number of allergens you are exposed to in your room. If you have pets, it may mean keeping them out of your room. Another option is to vacuum frequently to remove allergens such as pollen, dust, and pet dander.
If your mattress is older than 10 years and you wake up with back pain, it may mean that it’s time for a new one. After a lot of use, mattresses are no longer as supportive as they were when they were new. Check your mattress to see if there is a permanent indentation where you sleep. If so, consider a new one. It's worth it to invest in a quality mattress and pillows.

, This includes computers, laptops, the television, and radios. The bright lights from the screens make it harder for your body to switch to the sleep phase of your sleep-wake cycle.It may be best to leave devices like tablets and televisions out of the room completely. Try to make your bedroom a place for sleep only.


Turn off or remove computers and screens that produce bright lights. The lights will be stimulating and prevent your circadian rhythm from shifting to the nighttime mode. This will make it more difficult to sleep.Turn off devices that make noise. This may mean moving a clock with a loud tick or turning off the radio. If you have an easier time falling asleep with background noise, choose something soothing without words. The words will keep your mind engaged and may prevent you from falling asleep.
Don’t allow yourself to watch the clock as you try to fall asleep. This will make you anxious about not falling asleep, which will then make it harder to sleep.

, This technique may be helpful to shift workers who have to wake up during the night and sleep during the day. You can manipulate the light stimuli you experience naturally, or control it more precisely with bright sun lamps.Take advantage of the natural light by letting the sunshine into your room in the morning or going for a short walk in the sun. This will help your body’s clock to program you to wake up at this time. Similarly, avoid bright lights shortly before bed.
Purchase a sun lamp which you can program to come on a few minutes before your alarm clock goes off. The light will expose you to the light spectrum of the sun, causing your body to begin to wake up. This will help your body maintain a fixed sleep-wake cycle. This can be very useful for shift workers who might not be exposed to natural light during their waking period.

, This includes caffeinated drinks, alcohol, and nicotine.Don’t drink coffee, caffeinated tea, or caffeinated sodas after lunch. Even if you still feel tired and think it won’t prevent you from sleeping, it interferes with how your body regulates your sleep-wake cycle.
Don’t smoke. Nicotine is a stimulant and it may make it harder to sleep.
Reduce your alcohol intake. Though excessive drinking may cause you to ""pass out,"" alcohol can interfere with deeper stages of sleep, causing you to sleep restlessly and wake up more frequently. In addition, if you have drunk a great deal right before bed, it may force you to wake up to urinate several times in the night.

, Acid reflux can make it uncomfortable to lie in bed. Eat dinner at least two hours before bedtime to give you a chance to digest. If you are hungry before bed, eat a small snack such as a piece of fruit or crackers.Avoid foods that may give you indigestion, such as fatty foods, tomatoes, or spicy foods.

, Don’t dehydrate yourself because if you are thirsty, it will keep you up. But avoid drinking large amounts of sugary drinks before bed. These will both wake your body up and cause you to need to urinate in the middle of the night.


If you reduce your liquid intake before bed, be sure to drink a large glass of water when you wake up to prevent dehydration.

, Many people with sleep problems, including insomnia, have the following symptoms:Taking 30 minutes or longer to fall asleep
Waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back asleep
Waking up too early
Sleepiness during the day
Being in a bad mood, feeling depressed or anxious
Forgetfulness, making more mistakes at school or work
Tension headaches
Gastrointestinal problems
Worrying about not sleeping enough

, Some medications contain stimulants or alter sleep patterns in other ways. This includes even some over-the-counter medications. Drugs that may do this include:Over-the-counter pain medications, decongestants, and diet products
Stimulants like Ritalin
Allergy medications
Corticosteroids
Antidepressants
Heart and blood pressure medications

, This is often suggested for people who have had difficulty sleeping for over a month. There are several techniques that the therapist may use:.



Cognitive behavioral therapy: This therapy is aimed at helping you change thought patterns that might be keeping you awake. This may be helpful if you are prone to worrying or under a lot of stress.

Stimulus-control therapy: In this technique, you reduce the amount of time you spend in bed awake and use your bed for only sleep and sex.

Sleep restriction therapy: During this method, you reduce the amount of sleep you get on one night, with the goal of making you sleep better the next night. As you get back on a regular sleep cycle, you increase the amount of time you spend in bed.

Paradoxical intention: This treatment can be effective for people who worry a lot about not sleeping. Instead of worrying about not sleeping, you try to stay awake.

Biofeedback: This method can be helpful for people who may not realize that they are too tense to sleep. By measuring your activity of your body, such as your heart rate and muscle tension, you can learn to consciously relax. To make sure you are working with someone reliable, ask if there is a doctor supervising the work.

, If you are severely sleep-deprived your doctor may recommend a medication that will make you sleepy. However, many have serious side effects including being addictive, so it is important to use them for as short a time as possible. In general they shouldn’t be taken for longer than a month.Some medications you may use for sleep include:


Over-the-counter antihistamines. Be aware that you may be too drowsy to drive or operate machinery the next morning. Also, if you have urinary problems or frequently have to get up many times at night to urinate, these medications may make it worse.Melatonin (Circadin). This medication consists of the hormone melatonin which controls your sleep cycle. It is most often prescribed for seniors. It can be used for up to 13 weeks. Side effects include headaches, cold symptoms, back and joint pain.
Benzodiazepines (Valium and others). These medications can be addictive and, as you become habituated, they become less effective. They also cause side effects such as dizziness, difficulty focusing, lack of emotion, depression, irritability, and sleepiness the next day.
Z-drugs (Ambien, Sonata). These medications are also addictive and less effective over time. They can cause drowsiness, diarrhea, snoring, dry mouth, confusion, nightmares, delusions, and hallucinations. If you experience psychological side effects, go immediately to the emergency room.

Purchase the right size ear plugs.If you use ear plugs a lot, it may make sense to purchase reusable plugs.,
Read the instructions first.,
Pull your ear up and back to straighten your ear canal.,
Insert the plug using a rocking motion.",How to Put in Ear Plugs2," As long as you wash them after use, you can reuse plugs made from silicone, plastic, or rubber multiple times. However, you'll first need to figure out your size. Reusable plastic ear plugs are sometimes marketed as ""one size fits all"" while some come in sizes ranging from small to large. You can try a ""one size fits all"" to start, but may have to do some trial and error before you find the right size for your ears.


You may need different sized plugs for each ear. This is not uncommon, so don't be surprised if you have to buy two different types of plugs.
It may be a good idea to buy a few packs of plugs in different sizes and see what works for your ears.

, Before attempting to insert a reusable ear plug, read the instructions that came with your package thoroughly. How you insert reusable ear plugs varies depending on the precise shape of your plugs. For the most part, the process of inserting a reusable plug is very similar; however, it's a good idea to review your instructions for any special considerations regarding your specific type of plug., Reach over your head with one hand. Grab the top of your ear and pull up and back.This will pull your ear open a bit more, which makes the plug easier to insert.

, Once you've expanded your ear drum, insert the ear plug using a gentle, rocking motion. Rock the plug back and forth to slowly push it into the canal. Keep going until you've sealed off the ear canal.








Make sure you do not push the plug in too far. Most of the plug should be in the canal, but you should still be able to easily grab the plug with your fingertips when you need to remove it.
If you can still hear well with the plug in place, you may have inserted it incorrectly. Refer to the instructions manual and try again. If the plug still does not work after a second attempt, you may need a different size plug.

Remove any cotton wrapping.,
Soften the wax by enclosing it in your fist for 40 seconds.,
Shape the ball into a cone.,
Pull your hair out of your face and away from your ears.,
Insert and seal the ear plug.",How to Put in Ear Plugs3," Wax ear plugs come packaged in tiny balls surrounded by cotton. Use your fingers to peel the cotton away before using. Use one hand to roll the ball between your thumb and index finger. With your other hand, pull away the cotton as you roll the ball. Continue spinning the ball of wax and pulling away the cotton until it is completely removed.







, In order to make the ball of wax moldable, take a moment to soften it. You can do this easily by enclosing the ball in your fist for about 40 seconds. You should start to feel the ball become soft and sticky.








, Hold the ball in between your thumb and forefinger. With your other hand, pinch the top of the ball of wax. Continue pinching while you rotate the ball with your other hand. The wax should start to form a rounded cone shape.







, It is important to keep your hair out of the way given how sticky these plugs tend to be. If you have very long hair, you may want to tie your hair back before you attempt to insert the ear plug.

, Insert the ear plug until it seals off your canal. Most of the plug should be in your ear canal, with a small end sticking out. Rub on the end of the plug, spreading it over your ear canal to form a seal. This should successfully muffle outside sound.

Purchase liquid bandage at your local pharmacy.,
Disinfect your cut.,
Apply the liquid bandage.,
Wait until the bandage falls off.",How to Heal a Cut Due to Dry Skin2," Liquid bandage works to seal your cut, keeping moisture in and germs out. It can last up to a week effectively. It can be a great option for children’s hands because you don’t need to apply a bandaid over the top. (Even though children often enjoy having a bandaid on, it can be a struggle to keep it on and the wound clean and protected.), Clean the skin with soap and warm water. Pat dry. It’s especially important when you have dry skin or go out into the cold throughout the day to properly dry your hands every time after washing them., It acts like glue, filling the cut and sealing it. It’s most effective for small and superficial wounds. It doesn’t need to be covered with a bandage. Avoid picking at it., It will typically take between five and 10 days for it to fall off. At that point, the cut should be healed."

Use lotion consistently.,
Don't use instant hand sanitizers very often.,
Wash your hands and dry well.,
Wear gloves.",How to Heal a Cut Due to Dry Skin3," Lotion comes in many forms — some are to restore severely dry skin, while others are lighter and meant to maintain the moisture already in your skin. Choose the lotion that will best take care of your hands. Investigate what works best for you by going to your pharmacy and using lotion from the various tester bottles. Try applying it before you really need it. Start applying it in the morning after you take a shower, and reapply throughout the day. If your skin is extremely dry, apply lotion and then put gloves over it before going outside during the winter months. You could also consider wearing lotion under gloves to bed (it sounds weird, but it can really help hydrate severely dry skin)., Alcohol will dry out your hands even more and can make cuts on your hands sting. Washing hands with glycerin soap is the best option during the winter.Additionally, as odd as it sounds, the sanitizer strips weak germs off your hands, possibly leaving a clean slate for stronger germs to attack.

, Washing your hands too much can dry them out and strip away the good oils that exist on your skin, but it’s important to keep your hands clean. When you do wash them, choose glycerin soaps that are not antibacterial — they help keep your hands moisturized.Ensure that your hands are dry when you move from the warm to the cold in winter — this includes waiting five to ten minutes after washing before going outside. Even with gloves, the change in humidity and temperature can sap the moisture from your skin and damage it.

, If you have to put your hands in water for an extended time (washing dishes, cleaning, etc.) wear rubber gloves. Protect your hands if you’re going to be doing manual labor. If you’re chopping wood, working on your car, lifting and moving things outside — wear gloves. They will help minimize the possible damage."

Write about food in your health diary.,
Keep track of your fitness in your health diary.",How to Get Healthier Using a Diary2," These are the milestones that you hope to achieve in the long run. You can monitor your progress towards them in your daily journal.Be realistic about your goals and only choose one or two main goals.Make sure that you are setting SMART goals. These are goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time based.For example, you might set a goal to “lose twenty pounds in the next four months.” You can then track your progress towards this goal by tracking your calories in a food journal.
Or, you might set a goal to “run a 5K in under 25 minutes.” You can then check your progress in a fitness journal.

, For instance, if you have a very busy schedule during the week this could be an obstacle to daily exercise. Write about how you will address the main obstacles you anticipate facing., These are the things you plan to do immediately towards realizing your main goals. They should be specific and doable steps.For example, you might write, “jog one mile.”
For example, you might write, “eat two servings of fruit and two servings of vegetables.”

, By keeping track of what you eat, how much you eat, and when you eat, you will be able to take control of your eating. Food diaries help you identify habits and patterns that you want to change. They also help you figure out where you might be able to make changes that will help reduce weight. The act of recording everything you eat will help deter mindless munching., A fitness journal can help you keep track of your fitness goals and monitor your progress. If you have an injury, you can monitor your progress back to health. If you are working towards a race or event, the journal can help you track your training progress."

Watch for side effects.",How to Increase Luteinizing Hormone1," When the fertility drug Clomiphene doesn't work, doctors often turn to gonadotropin treatment.In women, LH is needed for ovulation, and gonadotropin acts in a similar way to LH, encouraging your body to produce the other hormones needed for ovulation.In men, LH is needed to produce testosterone. Gonadotropin can act in its place, increasing testosterone and a man's sperm count, which also increases a couple's chances of conceiving., Typically, if you're a woman, you take this this treatment every day for about two weeks, and you or your partner will inject it under your skin. Once your body has responded, you stop the treatment and a doctor will monitor your follicles until they are ready for an egg to be released., When your follicles are ready, your doctor will give you an injection of hCG to tell your body it's time to release the eggs into your uterus. At that time, you can try to conceive for the next day or so., Men usually start with hCG. Generally, you'll have a couple of injections a week. You'll try it for about half a year. If it hasn't helped, your doctor may add hMG to your regimen., The primary side effects of gonadotropin are swelling, irritability, restlessness, headaches, tiredness, and depression.Men may also have an increase in acne, an increase in breast size, and changes in sex drive."

Identify the symptoms of low hemoglobin levels.,
Have your hemoglobin levels tested.,
Know the other medical conditions that could cause low hemoglobin.",How to Increase Hemoglobin Levels," Sources of heme iron (aka organic iron) are generally the easiest for your body to absorb. About 20% of heme iron is absorbed during digestion, and that absorption level is not affected by any other dietary elements.Heme iron sources can also help your body absorb more iron from non-heme foods. Red meat tends to have the highest absorbable iron levels, but other forms of meat and seafood are also highly absorbable.To increase your hemoglobin levels, try consuming the following foods:


Beef
Chicken
Pork
Lamb
Tuna
Halibut
Shrimp
Oysters;
, Non-heme (or inorganic) iron is typically found in plants and plant-based foods. These iron sources are absorbed at much lower rates than heme iron sources. Generally speaking, you will only absorb 2% or less of the iron in non-heme foods;however, with proper planning (by pairing non-heme foods with other iron sources), inorganic/non-heme foods can and should be a part of any balanced diet.Common sources of non-heme iron include:


Beans
Nuts
Potatoes
Avocados
Apricots
Raisins
Dates
Spinach
Asparagus
Green beans
Whole wheat bread/cereal/pasta
Any bread that has been fortified with additional iron

, Non-heme foods may have lower absorption rates than heme foods, but there are a number of things you can do to increase the amount of iron absorbed from non-heme foods. Non-heme foods are still an important part of a well-balanced diet, and with some very minor modifications, you can significantly increase the amount of iron you get from them.Combine heme and non-heme foods to increase the absorption of iron. Heme foods help your body extract and absorb more iron from non-heme foods when paired together.
Cook non-heme foods in an iron pot/pan/skillet. The food will absorb some additional organic iron from the cookware, which will help increase your absorption of the non-heme food's iron.
Pair non-heme foods with vitamin C. Eat oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, tomatoes, and broccoli with your regular non-heme food items.
In addition to vitamin C, you can pair any acidic food product with non-heme iron sources to increase the iron absorption. Even vinegar will help you absorb more iron from your plant-based foods., Just as certain foods help increase your absorption of non-heme iron, some foods/beverages can actually decrease your absorption.If you're struggling to increase your hemoglobin levels, try avoiding these foods/drinks/supplements and see if your hemoglobin levels improve:


Dairy products
Tea
Coffee Leafy greens
Bran and other high-fiber foods
Beer
Wine
Cola beverages
Calcium supplements, Iron supplements are an excellent and direct way to increase the amount of iron you consume; however, if your body is having difficulty absorbing iron, you may need to take other precautions.There are a number of different types of OTC iron supplements (such heme iron polypeptide, carbonyl iron, ferric citrate, ferrous ascorbate, and ferrous succinate). Studies suggest that they are all equally effective — the most important thing is that they are taken properly and regularly.Taking iron tablets on an empty stomach can help increase the absorption of iron from those tablets; however, it can also cause an upset stomach, so you may prefer to take iron with a little food.
Never take iron tablets with an antacid. Fast-relief heartburn medications tend to hinder your ability to absorb iron.
If you must take an antacid, take your iron tablets either two hours before you take the antacids or four hours after.

, Folic acid is necessary for your body to make new cells, including red blood cells. If your body is unable to make enough red blood cells, this may lead to low hemoglobin levels.You can get folic acid through vitamins/supplements, or through dietary changes.Most multi-vitamins available in the United States contain the recommended daily dose of folic acid you need to stay healthy.
If your breakfast cereal is labeled as having 100% of your daily value of folic acid, a bowl each day can also help get your hemoglobin levels higher.
Not all breakfast cereal has 100% of the daily recommended value of folic acid. Consider replacing your usual cereal with one that provides more folic acid.

, Vitamin B6 helps your body make more hemoglobin. If you're experiencing low hemoglobin levels, vitamin B6 may be able to help.Vitamin B6 is naturally found in certain foods like avocados, bananas, nuts, beans/legumes, whole grains, and certain meats.
You can also purchase vitamin B6 supplements at most pharmacies and health food stores.
Most adults under age 50 need 1.2 to 1.3 milligrams of vitamin B6 each day.
Adults over age 50 should consume 1.5 to 1.7 milligrams of vitamin B6 every day.

, Vitamin B12 helps your body make red blood cells.This can help reduce the symptoms of low hemoglobin levels and/or anemia that you may be experiencing.


Vitamin B12 is only derived naturally from animal proteins. Plants do not have any natural vitamin B12, though some plants are fortified to include this vitamin.
Taking 2 to 10 micrograms of vitamin B12 every day with iron and/or folic acid supplements can help reduce the symptoms of anemia in up to 16 weeks.Increase your vitamin B12 intake if you adhere to a vegetarian or vegan diet. Many vegetarians/vegans do not get enough vitamin B12, and often experience anemia as a result.
If you're over age 50, talk to your doctor about your vitamin B12 needs. Many adults over 50 have difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food.
Anyone with digestive disorders or a previous gastrointestinal surgery should consider taking vitamin B12 supplements.

, Some women with heavy menstrual flow experience anemia. This can result in lower hemoglobin levels. There is no guarantee that oral contraceptives will work for everyone, but many women have found that oral contraceptives do help reduce menstrual flow.Oral contraceptives will not provide immediate relief of your low hemoglobin levels, but they may help reduce iron deficiency anemia caused by heavy menstruation.

, Peptic ulcers are frequently associated with low hemoglobin levels because they can cause slow GI bleeding. Most peptic ulcers are treatable with a ""triple therapy"" regimen of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor, which your doctor can prescribe to you.Peptic ulcers are almost always caused by the H. pylori bacteria.Treating H. pylori bacterial infections with antibiotics can help reduce the anemia that was brought on by that infection.

, Iron deficiency is a lesser known symptom of celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that is triggered by gluten and causes damage to the lining of the small intestine. If you are unable to determine the cause of your anemia, there is a good chance you may have celiac disease — even if you don't have any other symptoms. Ask your doctor to test you for celiac.The damage to the lining of the small intestine means it can't absorb nutrients properly, including iron.
If you are found to have celiac disease, you will need to switch to a gluten-free diet. After some time, your small intestines will heal and will be able to absorb iron., Certain medications can cause iron deficiency — talk to your doctor about any medications you may be taking. If these are affecting your ability to absorb iron, then discuss the possibility of switching to a different medication.


Some drugs that may impair iron absorption include some antibiotics, some antiseizure medications (phenytoin), immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, azathioprine), antiarrhythmic drugs (procainamide, quinidine), and anti-clotting drugs (aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel, heparin)., Low hemoglobin levels are frequently caused by low red blood cell counts. A low red blood cell count is often associated with persistent bleeding — ""occult"" bleeding refers to gastrointestinal bleeding that the patient is not aware of — or any condition/ailment that either lowers your red blood cell production or destroys red blood cells at a rapid rate.A tumor/fibroid/polyp that bleeds, reduces your ability to produce red blood cells, or causes bone marrow to fail can cause anemia and low hemoglobin levels in some individuals.Having the polyp, tumor, or fibroid surgically removed can help reduce or eliminate the bleeding and/or low red blood cell problem that caused the anemia and subsequent low hemoglobin levels.

, Only a doctor can diagnose low hemoglobin levels. Your doctor will need to test your blood in order to give a proper diagnosis, and then potentially do other studies to determine the cause of your low hemoglobin. If you're experiencing severe symptoms of low hemoglobin, however, you should see your doctor as soon as possible.Common symptoms of severely low hemoglobin levels include:


Weakness/fatigue
Shortness of breath
Fast/irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
Paleness of the skin and/or gums

, The only way to confirm that you have a low hemoglobin level is by having your blood tested by a doctor. If you are experiencing any of the symptoms of low hemoglobin levels on a regular basis, see your doctor as soon as possible to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.Your doctor will most likely run a complete blood count test to confirm that you have a low hemoglobin count.
To run the blood test, your doctor will need to collect a small sample of blood. You will be stuck with a needle, but it is not particularly painful, and any pain is very short-lived.
Normal hemoglobin levels for adult men are between 13.8 and 17.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL).
Normal hemoglobin levels for adult women are between 12.1 and 15.1 g/dL.If the blood tests do not indicate low hemoglobin levels, your doctor will need to run further tests to determine what other medical issues could be causing your symptoms.

, Low hemoglobin levels can be caused by a number of underlying conditions. Any disease or condition that reduces your red blood cell count can result in low hemoglobin levels.Common conditions that cause low hemoglobin levels include:


Anemia (aplastic, iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency, and sickle cell)
Cancer and certain non-cancerous tumors
Chronic kidney disease
Cirrhosis of the liver
Enlarged spleen
Lymphoma (both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's)
Hypothyroidism
Internal bleeding
Lead poisoning
Leukemia
Multiple myeloma
Porphyria
Reactions to HIV or chemotherapy medications
Vasculitis

Speak with a renal dietitian.,
Identify any underlying cause.,
Take prescription kidney medication.,
Discuss other medications with your doctor.,
Periodically check your GFR.,
Go on dialysis.,
Wait for a kidney transplant.",How to Increase GFR," Your doctor can test your GFR by administering a creatinine blood test. Creatinine is a waste product present in your blood. If the amount of creatinine contained within a sample is too high, your kidneys' filtering ability (GFR) is likely too low.Alternatively, your doctor might administer a creatinine clearance test, which measures the amount of creatinine in both your blood and urine.;
, Your test results are only one factor involved in calculating your GFR. Doctors also take into consideration your age, race, body size, and gender when determining the actual GFR rate.


If your GFR is 90 mls/min/1.73m2 or greater, your kidneys are considered to be in good health.GFR between 60 and 89 mls/min/1.73m2 puts you into stage two chronic kidney disease (CKD). A rate between 30 and 59 mls/min/1.73m2 puts you into stage three CKD, and rate between 15 and 29 mls/min/1.73m2 are considered stage four CKD.
Once your GFR dips below 15 mls/min/1.73m2, you are in stage five CKD, which means your kidneys have failed.

, Your doctor can provide you with additional detail regarding your GFR score and how it impacts your life. If your numbers are lower than they should be, your physician will probably recommend some type of treatment, but the specifics may vary from patient to patient.


You'll need to make certain changes to your diet and overall lifestyle regardless of which stage of CKD you've entered. During the early stages, however, these changes might be enough to improve your GFR. This is especially true if you've had no prior history of kidney problems.
During the later stages of CKD, your doctor will likely prescribe some form of medication to help improve your kidney function. This medication should be used alongside lifestyle changes and should not be thought of as a substitute treatment.
In the final stages of CKD, your doctor will almost always put you on dialysis or recommend a kidney transplant.

, Increased creatinine and low GFR go hand-in-hand; one issue generally won't be present without the other. Animal products contain creatine and creatinine, so you may need to restrict the amount of animal-based protein you consume.Plant-based sources of food, on the other hand, do not contain creatine or creatinine. Maintaining a largely vegetarian diet can also help reduce other risk factors of CKD, including diabetes and high blood pressure.

, Smoking increases the number of toxins in your body, and those toxins will have to pass through your kidneys. Quitting the habit will ease the burden on your kidneys and improve their ability to filter out waste.


Additionally, smoking can also cause or aggravate high blood pressure. High blood pressure is linked to CKD, so maintaining healthy blood pressure can further improve your GFR.

, Damaged kidneys have difficulty filtering sodium, so diets high in salt can aggravate your condition and cause your GFR to worsen.Eliminate salty foods from your diet and opt for low-sodium alternatives when offered. Try seasoning your food with other spices and herbs instead of relying strictly on salt.
You should also eat more home-cooked meals from scratch and fewer boxed dinners. Meals made from scratch generally contain less sodium since many boxed meals use salt for its preservative qualities., Both phosphorus and potassium are two other minerals your kidneys may have difficulty filtering, especially once they've already been weakened or damaged. Stay away from foods high in either mineral and don't take any supplement that contains either mineral.


Potassium-rich foods include winter squash, sweet potato, potato, white beans, yogurt, halibut, orange juice, broccoli, cantaloupe, banana, pork, lentils, milk, salmon, pistachios, raisins, chicken, and tuna.Phosphorus-rich foods include milk, yogurt, hard cheeses, cottage cheese, ice cream, lentils, whole grains, dried peas, beans, nuts, seeds, sardines, pollock, colas, and flavored waters., Drinking one to two 8 oz (250 ml) cups of nettle leaf tea each day may help reduce creatinine levels in the body, and as a result, it may also help increase your GFR.


Check with your doctor to verify that nettle leaf tea is safe based on your specific medical history.
To prepare nettle leaf tea, steep two fresh nettle leaves in at least 8 oz (250 ml) of simmering water for 10 to 20 minutes. Strain and discard the leaves, then drink the tea while it's still hot.

, Cardiovascular exercise, in particular, can help improve your circulation. As more blood pumps through your body, it can more effectively flush toxins through the kidneys, thereby improving your GFR.


Note that strenuous physical activity can increase the breakdown of creatine into creatinine, though, which can increase the burden on your kidneys and cause your GFR to drop further.
Your best option is to engage in regular moderate exercise. For instance, you might consider cycling or walking at a brisk pace for 30 minutes a day, three to five days a week.

, In most cases, weight management will be the natural result of a healthy diet and regular exercise. You should avoid risky diets or fad diets unless they are specifically recommended by a physician or renal dietician.


Maintaining a healthy weight makes it easier for blood to pass through your body and may help regulate your blood pressure as a result. Once blood can flow through your body more readily, it will be more able to flush toxins and fluids through your kidneys, and you should see an improvement in your GFR.

, During later stages of kidney disease, your doctor may recommend you to specialist capable of devising the best diet for your condition. These specialists are known as ""renal dieticians.""


Your renal dietician will work with you to reduce the stress on your kidneys while maintaining a balance between the fluids and minerals in your body.
Most specialized diets will include elements similar to those described in this article. For instance, you might be instructed to reduce your intake of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and protein.

, Most CKD and low GFR rates are caused or influenced by other underlying conditions. In such cases, you'll need to get these other ailments under control before you can raise your GFR.


High blood pressure and diabetes are the two most common causes.
When the cause of kidney disease isn't easily identifiable, your doctor may administer additional tests to diagnose the issue. These may include urine tests, ultrasounds, and CT scans. In some cases, your doctor may recommend a biopsy to remove and evaluate a small sample of kidney tissue.

, When another condition causes kidney disease, or when kidney disease causes related problems, your doctor may prescribe certain medications to help treat your overall condition.High blood pressure is often linked to low GFR, so you may need some type of blood pressure medication. Options include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, and others) or angiotensin receptor blockers (losartan, valsartan, and others). These drugs can maintain blood pressure while also reducing protein levels in your urine, allowing your kidneys to work less hard as a result.
During late stages of kidney disease, your kidneys may not be able to produce an important hormone called ""erythropoietin,"" so your doctor may need to prescribe drugs that can help remedy the problem.
You may also need vitamin D supplements or other drugs to help control phosphorus levels since your kidneys will have difficulty filtering phosphorus in the body.

, All drugs are filtered through the kidneys, so you should discuss any medication you plan to use with your doctor while your GFR levels are low. This includes both prescription and non-prescription drugs.


You may need to completely avoid NSAID and COX-II inhibitor drugs. Common NSAID drugs include ibuprofen and naproxen. One common COX-II inhibitor is celecoxib. Both drug classes have been linked to increased incidents of kidney disease.
Talk with your doctor before trying any herbal remedy or alternative treatment, as well. ""Natural"" treatments are not necessarily better for you, and if you aren't careful, you could take something that may make your GFR levels dip lower.

, Even if you successfully increase your GFR, you should continue to check your GFR throughout your lifetime. This is especially true if you've ever had lower than average rates or if you face an elevated risk of kidney disease.


GFR and kidney function naturally decline with age, so your doctor will likely recommend continued exams to help monitor the rate of decline. He or she may need to adjust your medications or dietary recommendations based on any changes to your GFR.

, If your GFR is extremely low and you've entered into renal failure, you'll need to go on dialysis to filter waste products and excess fluid from your system.


Hemodialysis involves the use of an artificial kidney machine with a mechanical filter.
Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdomen to help filter and clean waste products from your blood.

, Kidney transplants are another option for people with advanced kidney disease and exceptionally low GFR. You'll need to be matched with the right donor before a transplant can take place. Oftentimes the donor is a relative, but in many cases, it may also be a stranger.


Not everyone with advanced kidney disease qualifies as a candidate for transplant, however. Age and medical history may rule out this treatment option.
After receiving a transplant, you'll still need to carefully monitor your diet and overall kidney health to prevent your GFR rate from dropping too low again.

Treat the underlying condition.,
Try D-aspartic acid.,
Consider chasteberry.",How to Increase Luteinizing Hormone2," LH is important, but an absence of this hormone can be treated in other ways than increasing LH. That is, you can treat the effects of low LH rather than trying to increase LH levels., If you are not trying to get pregnant, then the most likely treatment for you will be to take estrogen to replace what's not being produced because you are low on LH. You'll also need to take cyclic progestins to decrease your chances of developing cervical cancer.Generally, you take estrogen and progestins in pill or patch form., In men, the treatment often means taking testosterone. Testosterone can be taken by young men who have a delayed onset of puberty because of low LH. It can also be taken by men who have a low sex drive or who have lost some of the defining male characteristics, such as facial hair.However, some doctors may recommend that men with low LH take gonadotropin even if they are not wanting to increase their chances of producing a baby.Testosterone can be taken in shot, pill, or patch form., Some people develop low LH because of an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa. You should be within 15 percent of your ideal weight to stave off low LH due to an eating disorder.If you do have an eating disorder, reach out to a medical professional. You'll likely need a team of medical professionals helping you, including your primary doctor, a psychologist or psychiatrist, and a nutritionist. Your primary doctor can help point you in the right direction.

, Many conditions can cause your LH to be low, such as overuse of opioids and steroids, issues with your pituitary gland, high levels of stress, long-term infections, and nutrition issues. Sometimes, treating the underlying condition will help with your LH levels., Some people have luck with taking 3 milligrams of D-aspartic acid per day. This supplement may increase the levels of LH in your body. However, only take supplements under the advice of your doctor, as anything that messes with your LH may affect your other hormones, too., Another supplement that may help increase your LH levels is chasteberry. This supplement may also decrease your FSH levels, though. FSH is a hormone that's important for fertility, so this supplement is likely not a good choice if you're trying to get pregnant. Ask your doctor before taking it."

Exercise more.,
Modify your diet.,
Lose weight.,
Quit smoking.",How to Increase Good Cholesterol1," Lifestyle modification is recommended for any abnormality in cholesterol or triglyceride levels. To help increase your good cholesterol levels, you need to work out regularly.The American Heart Association recommends that adults should do at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardiovascular activity for at least five days per week. This can include running, hiking, swimming, or bike riding. In addition to this, the AHA also recommends two days of moderate to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity, such as weight training or circuit training with weights.


You can substitute the cardiovascular workouts for at least three 25 minutes exercise sessions a week of vigorous aerobic activity. This includes activities such as high intensity interval training, spinning, and aerobics classes.
If this is too much for you at first, start with small workouts before you work up to the intensity level the AHA recommends. Start by walking or using an elliptical machine a few times a week. Then you can work your way to more and more activity each week until you can meet the guidelines.It can take up to six to 12 months for the benefits of lifestyle modification to become evident. ;
, Diet modification is crucial for helping with cholesterol levels. Reduce your intake of carbohydrates, especially those with a high glycemic and high fructose content. These are often referred to as bad or simple carbs because they have a high calorie content but create very little energy during metabolism. They are processed and used by your body extremely fast, plus they cause fat deposits and spikes in bad sugars and fats, which are metabolized into bad cholesterol.


Simple carbs include sugary and refined foods such as candy, cakes, white rice, processed cereals, cookies, white bread, sodas, alcohol, chips, and juices.Have a diet that is balanced. This means you have an equal amount of vegetables, whole grains, fruits, and low fat dairy. Try to avoid any products with added sugars and high levels of fat, especially saturated and trans fat. Eat plenty poultry, fish, and beans.
Always avoid butter, fried foods, high fat cheese, and foods high in sodium.Mix a healthy diet and exercise to help you lower your bad cholesterol and increase your good cholesterol.

, If you are overweight or obese, lose weight to help with your cholesterol. In order to find out if you are considered overweight or obese, calculate your body mass index (BMI). This scale estimates the weight range that is right for you according to your height and sex. If you follow a balanced diet plan and exercise, you should start to lose weight. If you are not losing any weight despite this, you might need to be more diligent and start counting your calories. This can be an easy and efficient way to lose weight. Cut your calories to an amount lower than what your body uses per day, which will help you lose weight.


The number of calories you need a day to changes depending on your sex, age, and daily activity level. Consult your doctor to see how many calories you need to eat to stay healthy but that will help you lose weight.
A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9. BMIs below 18.5 are underweight, from 25.0 to 29.9 are overweight, and above 30.0 is defined as obese. There are multiple BMI calculators and charts online that you can use to find your correct BMI.To stay healthy while you lose weight, only lose about a pound a week.

, Smoking puts you at serious risk for cardiovascular disease. An individual who stops smoking can expect to increase HDL about 10%. Quitting smoking is an extremely hard undertaking. It is recommended that you discuss your options for quitting with your healthcare professional.


There are many ways you can quit, including a nicotine patch, nicotine gum, counseling, support groups, medication, and quitting on your own.

Have a physical fitness examination to find out if you are overweight.,
Create a weekly aerobic exercise routine.,
Aerobic exercise is the amount of physical activity where your body can produce enough oxygen to allow you to work your heart.,
Do several aerobic exercise activities per week, or walk on different paths.,
Learn to juggle or play ball with friends and family.,
Walk or hike on uneven ground.,
Increase your physical activity as you get into shape.",How to Improve Your Memory with Exercise," People who maintain a healthy weight maintain healthy glucose levels, which then help to regenerate tissues. A physical trainer in a gym or a general practitioner can come up with an exercise routine to help you obtain a healthy weight.;
, Aerobic exercise has been shown to increase the hippocampus, which in turn increases spatial memory. Aerobic exercise can include walking, cycling, running, flow yoga, swimming and more.

, The number of heartbeats per minute to achieve aerobic activity changes with age, but is generally listed as exercise that increases your heart rate but still allows you to keep up a light conversation.


Understand that the longer that you maintain an aerobic exercise routine in your life, the easier it will be to maintain a good memory. However, it is never too late to start. People between the ages of 55 and 88 have been shown to diminish the likelihood of dementia by starting an aerobic exercise routine.

, Breaking away from the same pattern helps exercise the brain and allows it to make new memories. Your intelligence increases as you form new memories.

, The act of throwing the ball and focusing on catching it helps to improve hand-eye coordination. Try this combination of exercise and hand-eye coordination by playing catch, baseball, squash, racquetball, football, basketball, tennis, badminton or ping pong.


Use your weaker hand to play catch. Using a subordinate hand will help to increase the use of neurons. It helps to increase brain power and will have long-term positive effects on brain function.

, Scientists believe that walking on rocky or uneven surfaces can help the vestibular system, which helps with balance. This connects with the brain's ability to remember and cope with obstacles.

, Straying away from your comfort zone will increase concentration, allowing you to remember and stay focused for longer. Also, stray from your comfort zone with hobbies, conversations and intellectual pursuits to increase your memory.


Doctors suggest you get at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week, or 30 minutes of aerobic activity 5 days per week. Increase your workouts to 40 minutes or do them 6 to 7 days per week.

Seek immediate treatment if you have a severe infection.",How to Know if You Have a UTI," Dysuria, or a burning sensation while peeing, is an initial symptom of having a UTI. When a bacteria enters the urinary tract it causes inflammation to the urine passageway making it painful to urinate and have the burning sensation that is usually felt in your urethra.An average adult urinates 4 to 7 times depending on the liquid consumed and if you are having an infection, pain and burning sensation maybe felt each time you urinate.;
, When an infection occurs, the affected area also becomes inflamed, increasing its size. The bladder is also affected by inflammation. Its walls are becoming thicker, decreasing its storage capacity. It fills a lot faster, thus the frequent need to urinate.


A UTI makes you have an urge to urinate more often even if you’ve just urinated. Take note that the amount of urine is very small -- sometimes just having drops of urine come out.
This frequent urination is also experienced even if you are sleeping at night, forcing you to wake up just to urinate.

, After you urinate, pay attention to whether or not you're sure you're done. A UTI will be slightly confusing -- odds are you'll try to urinate again and only a few drops will come out.Again, since some parts of the urinary tract are inflamed, this gives you a sensation that you want to urinate again and again. You'll feel this urge mere seconds after urinating. It might not be strong, but it'll be there.

, A normal urine is usually clear and a little yellowish and not that smelly. Infected urine is cloudy and contains a strong or foul bad odor. If the color appears to be red, bright pink or cola colored, that's a sign of blood present in the urine -- a common sign of a UTI. Its main cause is inflamed parts of the urinary tract that also affects the blood vessels.Discoloration in the urine is not usually a sign of infection; foods that we eat may cause this change as well. Some medications can also change the color of urine and can also be a sign of other health problems just like urine that is colored dark yellow (which is a sign of dehydration). The point is that any change in you urine calls for medical attention. Go to your doctor for a right diagnosis., If left untreated, the infection will travel through the urinary tract, reaching the kidneys. The infection will become larger, causing fever. In this case, immediate medical attention is necessary.


Fever is a sign of a UTI that has progressed and gone on untreated. If you catch your UTI at the first sign, fever won't be present.

, Lower abdominal pain is usually present when you have a UTI, especially if you have a bladder infection, too. The bladder is located in the lower part of the abdomen. The pain is due to inflammation of the bladder and also due to urinary frequency and urgency forcing your bladder to urinate (which stresses and puts pressure on it). This gives a bloating feeling as well.This lower abdominal pain is also connected with pelvic pain for women and rectal pain for men. These parts are affected due to its location and the muscle force created as you are urinating over and over again. It’s tolerable but quite uncomfortable.

, Seek for medical attention immediately when these symptoms are present. High fever may be connected, too, with other severe diseases since this high fever is also accompanied with nausea and vomiting.


Fatigue, another symptom, is classified as feeling tired, exhausted, sleepy and stressful. This physically weakens your muscles and lessens your ability to move -- also accompanied with headache and high fever. The worst case scenario for having fatigue is that it can affect your concentration on different things and force about mental changes or confusion..

, Women are more vulnerable to urinary tract infections due to their anatomy. The urethra is a lot shorter and closer to the anal region, making it easy for the bacteria to travel from the stool inside the urinary tract. That being said, postmenopausal and pregnant women are at even higher risk. Here's why:After menopause, a loss of estrogen takes place which changes the normal bacteria in the vagina that can increase the risk of having a UTI.
As for pregnancy, it causes hormonal changes that affect the urinary tract which can cause infection. And also, the uterus grows during pregnancy that compresses the bladder making it hard to empty the bladder completely. Retained urine in the bladder is a source of infection too.

, Women who have an active sex life are prone to develop this condition. Frequent intercourse will increase the chances of contracting a urinary tract infection.


Pressure on the urinary tract during sex can move bacteria from the colon to the bladder. The colon or the large intestines are where the bacteria live. is why many claim it's important to urinate after sex.
If you have recurring UTIs and sex seems to be the issue, you can get on an antibiotic to take immediately after. See your doctor to discuss this issue., Certain birth control methods, such as using the diaphragm, can increase the risk of infection. Germs and bacteria can attach to the surface of the diaphragm, facilitating the access to the urinary tract.


Spermicides and condoms can create skin irritation that increases the risk of having bacteria enter the bladder. Diaphragms create pressure in the bladder making it again hard to urinate, too.

, Children born with an abnormally shaped urinary tract will be prone to infection. Urine will not leave the body as usual, creating a great culture environment for bacteria., Anything that obstructs emptying the bladder can be a great risk factor of having UTI. Presence of kidney stones, an enlarged prostate and certain forms of cancer can make it difficult to urinate.Kidney stones are actually crystals that forms in the kidney until it goes down the ureters blocking the passage way of urine making it difficult to urinate and painful as well.
On the other hand, enlarge prostate affects the urethra. The prostate and the urethra are close to each other so when the prostate becomes enlarge, it puts pressure on the urethra making the exit hole for the urine smaller, making it hard to urinate.

, A suppressed immune system will not be able to fight against pathogens. Diabetes or other diseases in which the immune system becomes weak will increase the chances of infection.

, Not consuming the right amount of fluids (2 liters per day) will cause low urination frequency. The amount of bacteria inside the urinary tract will increase, making it easier to get infected. The urine that you do have stays in your system because so little accumulates.


Drinking plenty of water is not only advisable when you have a UTI, but it's smart when you don't, too!

, When you visit your doctor, they'll do a culture test, which will tell them which antibiotic is best for you -- your type of infection and the severity will clue them in on what'll be the best course of action. And if this is a recurring problem, let them know; you can get a preventative antibiotic for the future, too.


A common antibiotic prescribed when suffering from this condition is levofloxacin. The maximum dosage is of 750 milligrams per day, for a duration of five days.

Finish all the antibiotics given even if you feel better to ensure that the infection is gone. Infection may return and maybe even harder to treat if you do not finish the entire course of the medicine.

, Increasing your fluid intake by consuming a lot of fluids will help you stay hydrated (remember this bullet point above?). The high fluid intake will increase the urine secretion that will help you flush out the pathogen.


Drink tea, water, and lemonade. Have them as many times per day, anytime you wish. You should avoid alcohol, caffeine and sugary drinks, because they will have the opposite effect, dehydrating your body.

, Cranberry juice will prevent the infection from recurring. A daily intake of fifty to one hundred and fifty milliliters of 100% cranberry juice will have great effects in combating the disease. It will prevent any further development of bacterial culture by inhibiting bacterial adhesion to the urinary tract.


You must drink the kind that has a low sugar concentration. If the juice is not sweet enough, use an alternative sweetener, like sucralose or aspartame. You must not drink any sugar free juice, because it will be too acidic.

, Heat will increase blood flow, decreasing pain and irritation caused by the infection. Apply a heat pad on your pelvic area each day. Keep the heat level low, and do not exceed a 15 minutes time, to avoid any burns.

, The needed ingredients are half a teaspoon of baking soda and a cup of water. The baking soda will neutralize your urine’s acidity. Drink the mix only once per day, because it can disturb the bacterial flora in your intestines.

, Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme with great anti-inflammatory properties. Used together with antibiotics, pineapple makes a wonderful alternative treatment. Eating a cup of pineapple per day will be wonderful for you.

, This infection already involves the kidneys; in this case, complications are harder to treat and get worse. This condition makes your body so weak that you are needed to be brought in the hospital for proper treatment.


Antibiotics are given directly through your veins or intravenous insertion because the symptoms keep you from swallowing oral medications. Intravenous fluids are also given as you are already dehydrated due to severe vomiting because of the severe infection.
Complicated infections are usually treated for several weeks. Add to that, when you are feeling better already, a 14 day antibiotic treatment is also given to ensure that the infection is gone.

Treat and manage stress.",How to Maintain an Erection1," Certain foods, such as those that are fatty, fried, sugary, and processed, can result in decreased blood flow throughout your body and can contribute to a vascular form of erectile dysfunction. Increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and heart-healthy fats to improve your blood circulation and increase the amount of time you’re able to maintain an erection.


A diet high in animal fat will put pressure on your cardiovascular system, potentially damaging your blood flow.
Try to limit the amount of meat and cheese you eat.;
, There is evidence that suggests that a sedentary lifestyle can be a factor in erectile dysfunction. Aerobic exercises, such as running and swimming, can help prevent ED. The exercise can help improve blood flow and circulation, naturally help lower high blood pressure and cholesterol, and can even help improve hormonal balance and drive weight loss – all of which are factors that can help you improve ED and maintain an erection.


Be wary of exercise that puts particular pressure on your perineum (the area between your scrotum and penis).
If you like going for long bike rides, be sure you have a bike that fits. Opt for a padded seat, wear some padded shorts, and be sure to stand up on the pedals regularly., Eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of exercise will improve your overall health and help increase your blood flow. Maintaining a healthy weight by combining a healthy diet with exercise will also help you lower your risk of type diabetes, which can contribute to ED.If you are overweight you may have a heightened risk of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both of which can damage blood vessels.
Having good blood flow is important for maintaining an erection.
If you’re overweight, losing weight can help you to tackle erectile dysfunction., Smoking can constrict your blood vessels and affect blood flow, which can lead to problems with maintaining an erection. Stop smoking as soon as possible, and practice one or more smoking cessation programs that can help you kick your habit indefinitely.


Studies have shown that smokers are much more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than non-smokers., Chronic heavy drinking can interfere with normal bodily functions, including your ability to maintain an erection. Consult with your healthcare provider to determine the amount of alcohol you should or should not be consuming regularly based on your health history.It is not uncommon for a man to be unable to maintain an erection if he has been drinking heavily immediately beforehand., Psychological stress can increase your body’s levels of cortisol and adrenaline, leading to hormonal imbalance and the constriction of blood vessels.If you frequently suffer from stress, look for ways to eliminate reduce stresses from your life, or find new, healthy ways to manage stress.


Practice deep breathing and yoga, listen to music, or set aside more time in which to enjoy your favourite activities.

Avoid medications linked to liver damage.Certain medications and medication combinations can cause damage to the liver, especially when taken regularly for an extended period of time.,
Treat underlying causes.",How to Lower ALT Levels," Excessive alcohol use is one of the most common causes of liver damage, but even moderate amounts of alcohol can damage liver cells over time.


Moderate alcohol use is defined as one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. Stay under this limit to improve your liver health and improve your ALT levels. If you already have some form of liver disease, you should cut alcohol from your diet completely.;
, Surprisingly enough, early research suggests that drinking a cup of coffee every day can help lower your risk of liver disease. Since ALT levels and liver damage are so closely related, drinking coffee may also have a positive effect on your ALT amount.


Note that these studies are fairly recent, however, so the link between ALT and coffee is still uncertain.
Green tea may also improve liver health. It contains plant antioxidants called ""catechins,"" which are believed to improve many bodily functions, including liver function.

, If your ALT levels are notably high, consider switching to an organic diet. Most people can tolerate chemical food additives, but for those with high ALT levels and liver damage, these chemicals will only worsen your current situation.


The liver filters toxins out of your body, but when it has to filter out too many possible toxins, it weakens and declines.
By law, organic foods are free from genetically modified organisms, synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, antibiotics, growth hormones, and similar drugs, making them easier for your body to process.

, Many sugars and fats also place stress on the liver, so cutting them out or limiting them can improve both your liver function and ALT levels.


In particular, reduce the amount of fructose and trans fats you consume. Fructose is found in soda and fruit juice. Trans fats are found in fried foods, fast food, and processed foods.

, Many fruits and vegetables naturally detoxify the body. In doing so, they relieve stress from your liver, allowing it to heal and lowering your ALT levels as a result.


Sulfur-rich vegetables, including onions and garlic, are notably helpful.
Cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, kale, collard greens, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower, are also among the best for improving ALT amount.
Other fruits and vegetables linked to improved liver health include grapefruit, beets, leafy greens, avocados, and lemons., Fiber pushes toxins through your digestive system faster, so those toxins spend less time festering in your liver.


Many fruits and vegetables are a good source of fiber.
Whole grains and seeds are another excellent source of fiber. Flax seeds can be especially beneficial since they bind specifically to potentially harmful hormonal excesses and help flush them out of your system more effectively.

, While some herbal remedies claim to restore liver health and improve ALT levels, there is often very little research to support these claims. Some herbal remedies and supplements can even hurt the liver and worsen your ALT amount.


Talk to your doctor before taking any herbal remedy or remedy combination.
Herbs linked to liver problems include cascara, chaparral, comfrey, kava kava, and ephedra.
Milk thistle seed extract is one herbal supplement believed to promote liver health. Other supplements include fish oil, green tea extract, curcumin (found naturally in turmeric), alpha lipoic acid, and acetyl-L-carnitine., Exercise improves your overall health, so naturally, regular cardiovascular/aerobic exercise can also help improve your liver health and ALT levels.


Studies suggest that staying active for a minimum of 150 minutes per week can improve liver enzymes like ALT in the average adult.Exercise can help you shed excess weight and limit the amount of fat entering your liver. It can also encourage sweat, which is part of your body's natural detoxification defenses.

, Obesity can cause fat to infiltrate the liver cells, and when this happens, your liver can become inflamed.


The best way to lose weight is to do it gradually through a healthy diet and regular exercise. Losing weight too quickly through crash diets and radical procedures can actually put stress on your body and its organs, ultimately causing more problems than you started with.

, Chemical additives found in cigarettes often contain toxins that damage your liver cells when your liver attempts to filter them. Quit smoking the strengthen your liver and improve your ALT levels.


Similarly, you should also avoid second-hand smoke, since you can breathe most of these harmful toxins in and face the same danger.

, Many household chemicals also contain toxins that can damage the liver, so limiting your exposure to these chemicals can improve your liver health and your ALT levels.


These toxins can be found in many cleaning products, aerosol products, and insecticides.
Swap out chemical household products for natural products. When possible, use natural alternatives already available in your home, like using vinegar to whiten your clothes instead of bleach. There are also commercial products labeled as ""natural"" that may be worth checking into.

, A small air purifier can help filter out air pollution in your home. By filtering toxins out of the air you breathe, you limit the toxins passing through your liver.


This can be especially important if you live in a high-traffic area.

, To improve your ALT levels, stay away from drugs known to weaken the liver.


Acetaminophen can be toxic to the liver when taken in excess. Aside from being marketed as a separate painkiller, it is also found in many cold medicines and prescription pain medications. Other pain medications can have similar consequences, including aspirin, diclofenac, and naproxen.
Cholesterol drugs can also harm the liver, but you should talk to your doctor before you quit taking a prescription cholesterol medication.
Additional drugs that may cause elevated ALT levels include some antibiotics (sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin), tuberculosis medications (isoniazid), anti-fungal medications (fluconazole, itraconazole), seizure medications (phenytoin, carbamazepine), and tricyclic antidepressants. Statins, chemotherapy, narcotics, and barbiturates can cause elevated ALT levels, as well.If you are already taking medications, talk to a doctor or pharmacist before starting a new medication to verify that the interaction with your current medications will not hurt your liver.

, High ALT levels are not necessarily harmful on their own, but they often indicate that something is wrong with your liver. To lower your ALT levels long-term, you need to treat any diseases that could be hurting your liver.Hepatitis is a major cause of elevated ALT levels. This includes acute viral hepatitis (both A and B) and chronic viral hepatitis (both B and C).
Cirrhosis can also cause high ALT levels. This occurs when the liver experiences scarring due to prolonged inflammation.
Fatty liver disease can cause elevated ALT levels, as well, especially alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Hemochromatosis has also been known to cause high ALT levels. This is a genetic condition caused by iron build-up in the liver.
Diminished blood flow to the liver will also elevate your ALT levels. Usually, this occurs when you undergo shock or heart failure.
Less common medical conditions linked to elevated ALT levels include wild mushroom poisoning, Wilson's disease, liver cancer, autoimmune hepatitis, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel diseases, gallstones, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

This causes the different body systems to be overworked. You may also start feeling very weak, which can be perceived as being fatigued.;
, The feeling of being excessively itchy is caused by the accumulation of the waste products in the blood stream, as the diseased liver is not able to perform its function of removing waste products., When the liver becomes damaged, it has a harder time producing blood clotting factors. This problem can lead to red palms, as well as nose bleeds. You may also notice that you begin to pass black tarry stools., Damage to the liver means that it is unable to accumulate glycogen, a carbohydrate that provides the body with temporary energy. When the liver is damaged, it forces the body to use its muscle tissue to supply energy in between meals and this causes weakness and muscle wasting, which in turn causes weight loss., When the liver stops functioning properly, it is unable to perform its tasks that it normally does effortlessly. Toxins will begin to accumulate in your blood which can cause a loss of appetite or a feeling of nausea.

Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically the DHA and EPA, are great ways to help your cholesterol levels. You can buy these oils in supplements over the counter at your local pharmacy. Take 1g per day to reduce your triglycerides levels and lower your risk of death from heart disease.


These acids are also found naturally in oily fish such as anchovies and tuna. Eat one to two servings of these kinds of fish to help each day as well., Soy contains isoflavones, which can act to raise your good cholesterol levels as well as lower your levels of bad cholesterol and triglycerides. Get between 20 to 50 mg of soy protein a day. These soy proteins can be found in a concentrated form in a supplement at your local pharmacy or health food store. They come in 50 mg tablets and should be take once a day.


Also eat more soy products as well, which are lower in saturated fats than other types of proteins. Add tofu, edamame, and dried soy beans to your diet as an additional source of isoflavones., Plant stanols and sterols are naturally occurring supplements that act by preventing the intestines from absorbing cholesterol. Take them as a dietary supplement once a day. There are also some products that have these supplements added to them to give you an extra boost of them a day. These can be found in certain margarine, juices, and rice milks.


You can also get them naturally in a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes.

Learn about the medications.,
Take fibrates.,
Buy nicotinic acid.",How to Increase Good Cholesterol3," Currently, drug treatment directed specifically at raising HDL is not recommended because there is no convincing evidence that the medications improve cardiovascular outcome. However, there are two types of medications that are used to raise HDL, which are fibrates and Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin or vitamin B3.


These are mostly prescribed with other medications. This is because a few studies have suggested potential cardiovascular benefits when using these medications in conjunction with medical therapies to lower LDL, but the data is not convincing enough to definitively recommend their use in all cases.Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) is a protein in your body that facilitates the transfer of lipids from HDL to other components in your blood. It has also been found to be associated with lower levels of HDL in some studies. As a result, there are several trials looking into medication that inhibit CETP, such as the medications torcetrapib, anacetrapib, dalcetrapib, and evacetrapib. Some of these show promise in the treatment of high cholesterol, but there is no generally consensus just yet., Fibrates are one type of medication that helps raise your good cholesterol levels. They are prescribed in pill form and should be taken one to three times daily. There are some forms of this medication that must be taken with meals, so check the label on your prescription to make sure you follow directions.


These medications have been associated with muscle toxicity, especially when taken with statins, which is another type of cholesterol medication. They can also interfere with the metabolism of other drugs, such as warfarin. Ask your doctor about any drug interactions. , Nicotinic acid, typically called niacin, is a vitamin (vitamin B3) that is available over-the-counter that is used to boost good cholesterol levels. You can also get a prescription-strength dosage of niacin, which has been shown to increase HDL levels by up to 35%.Take it as a pill with a dose of 1g to 3g per day. The most common side effect is flushing of the skin. While undesirable, there is generally no harm experienced from this side effect. You can also consume niacin through foods as well.


To prevent flushing, aspirin can be taken 30 minutes prior or ibuprofen can be take 60 minutes prior to taking niacin. Certain slow release formulas of the vitamin can also be used to decrease incidence of flushing.
Toxicity to the liver is reported in higher doses of niacin, with doses ranging from 2g to 6g daily, especially when it is taken in conjunction with other medications. Check with your doctor about appropriate dosing to avoid this."

Learn about cholesterol.,
Understand the need for good cholesterol.,
Avoid risk factors.,
Get tested frequently.,
Watch out for warning signs.",How to Increase Good Cholesterol4," There are two major groups of these components. There are those that carry bad cholesterol, also known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and those that carry good cholesterol, also known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). When a person consumes too much fat, LDL become elevated and can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. HDL has been shown to have remove of excess cholesterol from the body, which means HDL acts like a cholesterol hunter that seeks out the surplus of cholesterol in your blood and transports it to your liver to be destroyed., Too much fat in the blood, which is caused by too much bad cholesterol, is directly associated with a higher risk of stroke and heart attack. It leads to atherosclerosis, which results in narrowing and stiffening of the blood vessels. This results in elevated blood pressures. Increased pressures in the blood vessels can result in fatty plaques breaking off and blocking smaller, narrowed vessels downstream. Blocking blood flow can lead to tissue death, which causes a heart attack or a stroke.It can also lead to heart failure. Narrowing and stiffness of the vessels in the body forces the heart to pump harder to achieve appropriate blood flow. The muscle of the heart grows larger to compensate for this. Eventually, the work required of the heart may go beyond its capacity, leading to insufficient blood flow and fluid build-up, which is called heart failure., Unfortunately, the symptoms of the conditions caused by high cholesterol frequently do not develop until there is a stroke or heart attack, which means the damage to organs is already done. There are a variety of things that can contribute to your risk of developing high fat content in your blood. These include poor lifestyle habits such as not exercising regularly and poor diet that frequently lead to being overweight or obese.


It may also be caused by a family history of the high cholesterol.
High cholesterol may also be caused by diabetes, alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, smoking, high blood pressure, and older age.
Your levels may also be increased if you take certain medications, such as beta blockers, estrogen replacement therapy, or steroids., You must visit your doctor and have blood tests to check your levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Screening can begin at any age, especially if you think you might be at risk. Start no later than age 45. The blood tests are generally checked at least every five years, but there may be shorter intervals if you have abnormal levels. During these tests, blood will be drawn after a period of 12 to 14 hours of fasting.


There are several different cholesterol levels reported from these tests. These include total cholesterol, which is normal below 200 mg/dL. Your doctor will also test for LDL cholesterol, which needs to be below 130 mg/dL or lower if at risk of heart attacks or strokes, and HDL cholesterol, which need to be above 60 mg/dL. It also checks non-HDL cholesterol, which is normal below 160 mg/dL, and triglycerides, which are normal below 150 mg/dL.Any abnormality in these tests may be associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Most frequently, an abnormally low level of HDL is also associated with elevated levels of LDL and triglycerides. Sometimes a person may have cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are all normal, except for an isolated low HDL. This is still associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, studies have suggested that having high levels of this good type of cholesterol is associated with prolonged life and significantly reduced risk of heart disease. , Even if you are actively trying to lower your bad cholesterol and raise your good cholesterol, you may still suffer from a heart attack or stroke. Be aware of the the signs for a heart attack and stroke so that you can seek medical attention immediately when they arise. Heart attack symptoms include pain or a heavy feeling in your chest, nausea, vomiting, pain in your jaw, arms, stomach, or back, shortness of breath, sweating, lightheadedness, dizziness, and fatigue.Stroke symptoms include sudden numbness, tingling, weakness, or paralysis in your face or extremities. It also includes sudden vision changes, confusion, trouble understanding others, severe headache, and trouble speaking."

Talk to your partner.,
Be intimate in new ways.,
Consider counselling.",How to Maintain an Erection2," Communicate openly to your partner about your difficulty maintaining an erection. Couples who are unable to talk openly to each other sometimes find it harder to be sexually intimate. If there is no communication, each partner may blame themselves. If you are both uncomfortable talking about it counselling may help.


In some cases, your partner may have ideas or suggestions about how he or she can help you maintain your erection in the bedroom.
Getting to really know your partner will help you become more intimate and feel more comfortable.

, If your sex is focused just on penetration and climax, you may feel under more pressure to quickly get and maintain an erection, which can make this harder to do. Try to find new and more varied ways to be intimate with your partner that are not just about sprinting to the finish line. Take time with each other, such as taking a bath or shower together or massaging each other.You can also try practicing different sexual positions to enhance blood flow.
Being on top or standing up while engaging in sexual activity can increase your blood flow and help you maintain an erection., If you or your doctor suspect your problems with maintaining an erection are psychological, consider the possibility of undergoing counselling. A professional, experienced psychologist may be able to help reverse your problems with ED.


Problems with maintaining erections are not normally psychological. Emotional causes are more common in younger men and physical causes in older men.
If you have erections in the morning or at night, it is likely that your difficulties maintaining an erection for intercourse are not physical.

"
"
Visit your doctor.,
Consider oral medication.,
Investigate mechanical aids.,
Use penile injection therapy.,
Ask about transurethral pharmacotherapy.,
Evaluate surgical options.",How to Maintain an Erection3," If you have tried making changes to your lifestyle, and you are still struggling to maintain an erection, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. ED can be caused by type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, certain prescription medications, stress, and even excess body weight.


Your doctor will check your blood flow circulation, examine your penis and rectum, examine your nervous system, and ask you questions about your medical history, such as how long you have had trouble maintaining an erection.
Your doctor will rate your cardiovascular risk factors as mild, moderate, severe, and make sure that your heart is healthy enough for sex.
Your doctor can help recommend the proper course of treatment to resolve ED based on your personal health history. For example, if you have low levels of testosterone, your doctor may recommend a testosterone patch.If you are relatively healthy, then your ED may be classified as psychogenic, which means that there is a mental or emotional barrier preventing you from getting and/or maintaining an erection.

, Your doctor may prescribe you medication that works by increasing the blood flow to your penis, and thus helping you maintain an erection. Medications commonly used to treat ED include Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra.If your doctor prescribes Cialis, your doctor will likely recommend that you take 10 to 20 mg at least 30 minutes before sexual activity. You should not take the medication if you experience severe hyperactivity to the medication or if you are using nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, for chest pain.
If your doctor prescribes Levitra, then you will need to take it with or without food 60 minutes before sex. This medication should not be taken with nitrates either.

, You may also ask your doctor about the use of mechanical aids to help you achieve and maintain an erection. Some men use vacuum devices and constriction rings to aid erections. The vacuum is placed over the penis and pumps out air, drawing blood to the penis and causing an erection.


This is maintained by placing a band or ring at the base of the penis, that keep it erect for up to thirty minutes.
This can, however, be a uncomfortable and awkward way to treat ED., An alternative method that you may be advised on by a doctor is penile injection therapy. For this you will be trained by the doctor how to inject your penis with medicine that relaxes the blood vessels and promotes the blood flow that causes an erection. This treatment has been shown to be effective at treating a range of issues both physical and psychological.


Potential side effects include scarring, and the risk of sustained and painful erections if improperly dosed.
You may experience high blood pressure and dizziness as a result of injection therapy., Your doctor may suggest you try this treatment, which involves placing a suppository into the urethra. The suppository contains alprostadil, which is then absorbed into the blood stream, relaxing blood vessels and improving blood flow into the penis. This treatment is thought to be less effective than the vacuum devices, or injection therapy., If the other treatments have not proven successful, your doctor may recommend a surgical procedure that will involve an inflatable penile prosthesis being implanted into your penis. Typically a pair of inflatable cylinders are inserted into the penis, which can be pumped up and deflated using a connected device that is inserted into the scrotal sac.


The prosthesis does not change the sensation on the skin, or effect the man’s ability to orgasm and ejaculate.
The surgery involves two small incisions and is not noticeable after healing."
"
Keep track of any feelings of confusion that may develop.,
Call a doctor if you notice that your skin has turned yellow.,
Take note if any parts of your body begin to swell.,
See a doctor if you notice that your heartbeat has increased.,
Pay attention to any gradual weight loss that occurs.,
Note if cuts won’t seem to stop bleeding.",How to Know if You Have Cirrhosis2," In the advanced phase of the disease, the liver is unable to filter the harmful substances from the blood. This will cause an accumulation of poisonous substances in the brain therefore altering the brain function. You may begin to suffer from fainting episodes, sleepiness, and confusion. In turn, these symptoms can lead to a coma in severe cases. See a doctor right away if you suddenly feel very confused or begin to have fainting spells.This same issue can also cause personality changes that include behavioral change and memory problems.

, In particular, examine your eyes, skin and tongue. When these parts of your body turn yellow, it is a sign that you have jaundice. Jaundice is caused by cirrhosis; your liver is not functioning properly, thus there an increased amount of bilirubin in your blood., Swelling of the feet, legs and ankles occurs because the liver is not able to remove waste products to include the excess water from the body. This causes water and salt to accumulate in the body. This will also cause the abdomen to become distended as water accumulates.


Men will often experience the swelling of their breast, shrinking of testicles and, in worst cases, impotence.

, Increased heartbeat occurs because of the increased volume of fluids in the bloodstream. This happens because the diseased liver is not able to remove excess water from the body. This overworks the heart because it is already pumping all of your blood throughout your body. In turn, your heart rate will increase., Damage to the liver means that it is unable to accumulate glycogen, a carbohydrate that provides the body with temporary energy. When the liver is damaged, it forces the body to use its muscle tissue to supply energy in between meals and this causes weakness and muscle wasting.

, One of the side effects of late stage cirrhosis is the inability to stop a cut from bleeding. When the liver becomes damaged, it has a difficult time creating the blood clotting factors needed to stop blood from leaking out of a cut.


You should also take note if your gums seem to bleed more often than normal, even if you brush them very gently.

Know that alcoholism can cause cirrhosis.,
Monitor chronic liver infections.,
Know that steatohepatitis can cause cirrhosis.,
Note that bile duct blockage can cause cirrhosis.",How to Know if You Have Cirrhosis3," The main cause of cirrhosis is long-term alcoholism. Men and women react differently to alcohol as tolerance varies from one person to another. Most men can take two to five bottles of beer a day while one or two bottles can damage a woman’s liver. People who consume a lot of alcohol and drink often have a higher possibility of developing cirrhosis, however, it really comes down to the individual. In some cases, one drink can damage a person’s liver., These infections include Hepatitis B and C, both of which can damage the liver. These conditions are caused by viruses, though they can also be transmitted via bodily fluids. The people who are at a greater risk of contracting the disease are health care workers., This is a condition caused by accumulation of fat in the liver. This condition usually occurs in people who are diabetic, obese and have high blood pressure. The fat causes tenderness and scarring to the liver and over a period, this leads to cirrhosis. Therefore, the people who suffer from these conditions are at a higher risk of getting cirrhosis.

, The bile ducts help to transport the bile formed by the liver to the intestines. The bile is used in the digestion of fats and can accumulate, thus scarring the liver. In adults, the bile ducts can become blocked or scarred if the person experiences a serious infection somewhere in the body.


In children, blockage of the bile duct can be caused by biliary atresia, which is when the bile ducts are damaged or they are absent. This causes the bile to accumulate in the liver, causing the liver to stop functioning properly.

Get more vitamin D. A damaged liver allows SGPT to seep into the blood.,
Eat a nutrient-rich, plant-based diet.,
Avoid foods high in fat.,
Avoid foods high in salt or sodium.,
Stop drinking alcoholic beverages.,
Get daily exercise.,
Quit smoking.,
Prevent exposure to other harmful chemicals, too.,
Get a blood sample taken.,
Stop taking over-the-counter drugs.,
Consider taking corticosteroids.,
Take antiviral medications.,
Talk to your doctor about taking interferons.,
Consider taking herbal supplements.,
Know what your goal SGPT level is.",How to Lower SGPT," According to a recent study, vitamin D prevents liver damage, which aids in reducing SGPT levels – those with high levels of vitamin D are less vulnerable to liver disease than those with low levels of vitamin D.Therefore, it’s a good idea to include at least one fruit and vegetable in each major meal to have a daily dose of vitamin D, staving off liver disease.


Good sources of vitamin D are green leafy vegetables, cod liver oil, fish, fortified cereals, oysters, caviar, tofu, soy milk, dairy products, eggs, mushrooms, apples, and oranges.;
, Eating organic foods helps regulate the liver, allowing it to cleanse itself of toxins and create new cells to stop the leakage of SGPT into the blood. These foods are often rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, in addition to being low in fat – in other words, they're great for your entire body. Focus your diet on fresh, whole foods that you’ve prepared yourself. Stay away from products that have gone through unnecessary processing, ridding them of their nutrients.


Make sure your diet has a lot of colors. Green leafy vegetables, broccoli, carrots, squash and a variety of fresh fruits should be staples of your diet, along with nuts, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and lean meats.

, Fatty foods make it hard for the liver to process nutrients in general. Some fat in the liver is normal, but if your liver is more than 10& fat, you know have a condition called ""fatty liver"" disease.The presence of these fatty cells can then lead to inflammation in the liver and damage to surrounding liver tissue.If the liver is damaged, the damaged liver cells release SGPT into the bloodstream, increasing your levels.


It is best to avoid fatty foods such as oily foods that are deep fried, meat fats, pork and chicken skins, coconut oils, butter, cheese, processed foods, sausages, bacon, junk foods and carbonated drinks.

, Excessive amounts of salt in the body, especially in the liver, cause swelling and fluid retention. This makes it harder for the liver to filter waste. This, over time, can lead to liver damage, allowing SGPT from the liver to seep into your bloodstream, raising your levels.


Foods to be avoided are salt, bouillon cubes, baking soda, soy sauce, salad dressings, bacon, salami, pickled foods, and other processed foods. Avoid adding salt to your dishes whenever possible.
Since salt is prevalent everywhere, try to do more of your cooking at home to control your intake. The average adult needs only 2300mg (1 teaspoon) a day., Alcohol is very harmful to the liver and, with prolonged drinking, can shut down entirely. When alcohol is ingested it goes directly to the bloodstream. All the blood is then received and filtered in the kidney. It is now the liver's job to filter all the toxic waste in the body, including toxins from alcohol. This, over time, can create serious liver damage.The more damaged your liver is, the more SGPT can leak out of its cells and into your blood.


Alcohol consumption has been a major contributor to liver diseases such as fatty liver, liver cirrhosis, and hepatitis. Exercise self-discipline to avoid aggravating diseases caused by too much alcohol consumption that will help in decreasing SGPT from leaking into your blood stream.

, Simple exercises such as brisk walking, jogging, and swimming can improve your overall health in addition to helping your liver stay healthy. Staying active excretes toxins in the body through sweating. It also helps burn fats, keeping you trim. Exercise will produce more lean muscles, healthy organs – including your liver – and keep your body in tip-top condition. The fewer toxins your liver has to clean up, the more energy it can dedicate to strengthening its cells.


At least 30 minutes of daily exercise every day can make a difference in your liver’s health. When toxins are excreted it reduces the amount of work that the liver will be doing, thus preventing increased SGPT levels.

, Smoke from cigarettes contains toxins like nicotine and ammonia. When you are exposed to these toxins, they stick to your skin and will be absorbed, giving the liver another workload to filter, getting rid of all the toxins in your body. It’s best to avoid secondhand smoke, too, as this has similar effects.


Not only is it bad for your SGPT levels, but it’s bad for your heart, lungs, kidneys, skin, hair and nails, too. It also causes those around you undue discomfort. If your SGPT levels aren’t enough, do it for these reasons instead.

, Smoke from air pollution contains fumes, gasoline, and ammonia, amongst other harmful chemicals that have dissipated in the air. If you live or work around an environment where you are constantly exposed to these toxins, reduce your exposure as much as possible. These toxins may leak through your skin causing liver damage and raising your SGPT levels.


If you must be around toxic fumes, wear long sleeves, pants, a mask, and gloves at all times. The more precautions you take, the healthier you’ll be – especially in the long-term.

, Your level of SGPT is measurable through a blood sample. In case of acute liver damage, SGPT levels rise dramatically as it is now able to leak through cell walls into your blood. However, a rise in SGPT levels must be verified carefully because it may be elevated due to recently performing strenuous activities or exercises.


An elevation in SGPT’s level is not a confirmation of a diagnosis of damage to the liver. It must be used together with the other types of liver tests in order to verify whether a patient really suffers from damage to the liver.

, If your liver is already damaged and you continue to take drugs that your physician did not prescribe, the liver carries the burden of metabolizing these drugs and filtering harmful substances which can further contribute to liver damage. It is best to take only the drugs which your doctor okays you to take.


If in doubt, consult with your physician. There are drugs that are hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver) and he/she may shift you to non-hepatotoxic drugs.
Medications such as antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause elevated SGPT and SGOT levels. It’s wise to talk to your primary doctor about different types of medications to prevent possible liver damage.

, This medication works by reducing the activity of the body’s immune system. It also decreases inflammation by reducing the production of inflammatory chemicals to lessen tissue damage. These can be taken orally or can be injected through a vein. The most common corticosteroids are Hydrocortisone, Prednisone, and Fludrocortisone.


Once the inflammation subsides, the liver cells will start to regenerate, therefore decreasing the release of SGPT into the bloodstream.
Talk to your doctor about starting corticosteroids. No medication should be started without a doctor’s approval.

, The liver may have infection caused by a virus, such as what happens in hepatitis. Upon conducting a blood test, your physician will know what virus is the underlying cause of the infection and will prescribe antiviral medications such as Entecavir, Sofosbuvir, Telaprevir and others.


This works in the same manner as corticosteroids. Once the infection is eradicated, the liver cells will start to regenerate, therefore decreasing the release of SGPT into the bloodstream.

, These are proteins released by the body’s host cells as a response to the presence of foreign bodies such as viruses, bacteria, tumor cells, or parasites. Taking this medication triggers the protective defenses of the body’s immune system to kill these foreign bodies.


SGPT starts decreasing once the infection is eradicated. The liver cells will start to regenerate, regularizing your levels. With new cells, SGPT cannot leak into your bloodstream.

, Lifestyle medications paired with herbal supplements may help lower SGPT levels. Talk to your doctor to see if any of these is safe and appropriate for you. Possible supplements to consider are the following:



Milk thistle. Prevents and repairs liver damage from toxic chemicals and harmful medications. It’s available in 100mg to 1000mg forms. The standard dosage of milk thistle is 200 mg 2 to 3 times a day.Inositol. Helps the liver in breaking down the fats. However, this can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea. It’s available in 500mg and 1000mg forms. You can take 500mg thrice daily.

Burdock root. Helps in cleansing the liver and prevents further liver damage. It’s available in 500mg to 1000mg forms. You can take 500mg thrice daily.

, Reference ranges differ from laboratory to laboratory and will depend on the method used. However, normal values can be generally found within specified ranges. The normal range for SGPT levels is 10 to 40 international units per liter.Values are significantly higher (greater than 15 times the upper limit of normal) in cases of hepatitis and is moderately higher (5-15 times the ULN) in cases of severe burns, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, and liver tumors. There is a slight increase (less than 5 times the ULN) in pancreatitis, shock, infectious mononucleosis and heart attack.

Understand that there are certain foods and nutrients that can lower your chances of developing certain diseases.,
Eat foods that are known to lower your cholesterol.,
Eat more garlic.,
Add ginkgo biloba to your diet.,
Drink ashwagandha (Indian ginseng) with milk.,
Increase your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that is famous for keeping your immune system functioning.,
Take vitamin A supplements or eat sweet potatoes.,
Load up on magnesium.,
Drink more green tea.",How to Lower CPK Levels Naturally1," These foods, herbs, and vitamins can help to prevent the diseases that lead to elevated levels of CPK.;
, Foods that help to lower your cholesterol levels in turn help to prevent heart disease. Heart disease is one of the most common reasons for high CPK levels, so if you are able to keep your heart disease free, you will be more likely to lower your CPK levels.Try Chinese red yeast rice: Consuming moderate amounts of natural red yeast rice as part of an overall diet helps maintain normal cholesterol levels.
Eat walnuts and almonds: Daily consumption of these nuts is thought to help lower your LDL cholesterol levels.
Eat two to three artichokes a week: Artichoke leaf extract helps your body process and release cholesterol, which in turn lowers your overall cholesterol.
Eat foods that are high in soluble fiber: Foods like oats, legumes, prunes, apples, carrots, and broccoli keep your intestines from absorbing too much cholesterol. If you eat 10 grams of high-fiber foods daily, you can lower your LDL cholesterol levels by 5%.

, Garlic has long been known to promote a healthy heart. It is also known to lower cholesterol, which keeps your heart’s arteries from getting blocked. Garlic produces a chemical called allicin, which is thought to help control and treat various ailments.You can eat up to one clove of garlic a day. If munching on garlic isn’t really your cup of tea, you can also take garlic supplements, which can be purchased as your local pharmacy.

, Gingko biloba is a type of plant that is known to have properties that keep the heart functioning properly. In particular, gingko biloba helps to clear your heart’s arteries, which helps to prevent blockages that could cause heart problems.


You can purchase gingko extract or supplements at most health food stores.

, This herb has anti-oxidant properties and reduces blood pressure and cholesterol while also helping thyroid conditions—all of which produce high CPK levels.


You can add one teaspoon of ashwagandha powder to milk and drink it before bed each night.

, It also plays a role in maintaining your heart’s health. A healthy heart means lowered CPK levels. Try to consume at least 45 mg of vitamin C a day.You can get vitamin C by taking a supplement or eating foods like oranges, lemon, and strawberries.

, Like vitamin C, vitamin A also plays a role in keeping the heart healthy. Sweet potatoes are packed full of vitamin A, so you should eat them often. You can also take a vitamin A supplement or take a multivitamin that contains your daily dose of vitamin A.

, Lack of magnesium can cause muscle cramps or spasms causing elevation in CPK levels. Try to get 50 grams of magnesium a day by taking a supplement or eating magnesium-rich foods like pumpkins, bananas, beet, spinach and other green leafy vegetables.

, Green tea has a lot of health benefits, but the one that is most relevant to someone trying to lower their CPK levels is that green tea is quite effective when it comes to lowering your cholesterol. In fact, a study done in Brazil showed that people who took green tea capsules each day had an average 4.5% reduction in their cholesterol levels.You can take green tea extract capsules or you can drink one to two cups a green tea a day.

Ask your doctor for a prescription for antithyroid medications.,
Learn the side effects of these medications.,
Monitor your progress on these medications.,
Take the medication for 18 to 24 months.",How to Lower TSH Levels Fast1," The fastest way to lower your TSH levels due to hyperthyroidism is to take antithyroid drugs like propylthiouracil and methimazole. These drugs are available by prescription from your doctor. They partially block the production of the thyroid hormone and lower your TSH levels. However, it will take six to twelve weeks for the drugs to take full effect.Your doctor may also recommend antithyroid medications to lower your TSH levels so you can take radioactive iodine to reduce your TSH levels further. You may be given radioactive iodine later and taken off the antithyroid medication.;
, Antithyroid medications can cause serious damage to your liver and lead to a low white blood cell count. If you are allergic to these medications, you may experience symptoms like skin rashes, hives, fever, and joint pain.If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking the medication and speak to your doctor immediately.
Have your doctor confirm you are not allergic to antithyroid medications before you take them.

, Have regular check ins with your doctor to confirm your TSH levels are going down with the help of the medication. It may take one to two years for your TSH levels to go down completely while on the medication.Your doctor may also suggest that you try other treatments like radioactive iodine or thyroid surgery if your TSH levels do not go down with the medication.

, You may experience remission after taking antithyroid medication for 18 to 24 months in a row. Some people experience remission within six months of taking the medication.Always follow your doctor's instructions on dosage of the antithyroid medication. Do not take more than instructed.

Try the Mediterranean Diet.,
Get plenty of omega-3s and 6s.,
Lower how much fat and salt you eat each day.,
Avoid a high-protein diet.,
Cut alcohol out of your diet.",How to Lower CPK Levels Naturally2," The Mediterranean diet is known to promote a heart-healthy meal plan that also helps keep your muscles strong. It focuses on eating five small meals a day, rather than three large ones. It also emphasizes using olive oil rather than butter because olive oil is a monounsaturated fat (which means it’s a good fat).Meals are generally made up of:


Servings of lean meat like fish, grains, fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes can help.
On this diet you can also try to reduce the amount of fatty meat and carbohydrates that you eat each day.

, Don’t let the word ‘fatty’ fool you—omega-3 and omega-6 are two fatty acids that are essential nutrients when it comes to having a healthy body. These two nutrients work together to promote good muscle health; when your muscles are strong, you are less likely to over stress them while working out, which means your CPK levels won’t be as high.


Omega-3 can be found in fish like sardines, anchovies and salmon; eggs, milk, milk products, flaxseeds, and nuts.
Omega-6 can be found in eggs, avocado, nuts, whole-grain breads, and most vegetable oils.

, As mentioned above, blood pressure and heart diseases can increase your CPK levels. You can lower your blood pressure by limiting the amount of salt you eat to approximately 1,500 mg a day. Fatty foods are normally high in salt content and are also linked to obesity, a condition that can cause serious heart issues. Try to stick with low-fat or non-fat products to maintain a healthy weight and a healthy heart.Eat low-fat or non-fat dairy products like skim milk, low-fat yogurt, and cheese.
Avoid very fatty foods like butter, gravies, and lard.

, Increasing your muscle mass can also lead to increased levels of CPK in your blood. Since eating a high protein diet can contribute to having an increased muscle mass, this should be avoided. However, do not eliminate all of the protein from your diet. Eliminating all the protein sources in your diet can cause muscle wasting since the body will try to get the protein it needs from your muscle stores. Muscle wasting entails muscle breakdown and can thus elevate CPK levels.Protein-rich foods include: Beef, pork, chicken, turkey and fish, cheese, eggs, tofu, beans, milk, yogurt, nuts and seeds.
The current recommended daily intake (RDI) of protein is 46 grams for adult women aged 19-70 and 56 grams for adult men aged 19-70. Teenage boys need about 52 grams while girls need 46 grams per day.

, Another reason for an elevated CPK level is drinking alcohol. This is especially true after an episode of binge drinking. Alcohol increases CPK level by acting on muscle tissues. After drinking alcohol, there is stress on the muscle tissues since it is exposed to an increased amount of alcohol in the body.

"
Understand the high CPK levels have been linked to high intensity exercise.,
Avoid strenuous exercise for five days before getting you CPK levels tested.,
Do warm-ups before doing any high intensity exercises.,
Lower your blood pressure by reducing your stress levels.",How to Lower CPK Levels Naturally3," Another common cause of an elevated CPK level is strenuous exercise. All forms of exercise (aerobic, stretching, or weight-lifting) can cause an elevation of CPK levels in the blood since your muscles are undergoing stress and metabolism.Exercises that involve weightlifting and downhill running cause higher increase in CPK levels.

, Strenuous exercise is actually a common cause of a falsely elevated CPK level in patients being tested for CPK levels. Because of this, its important that you don’t exercise for five days before your doctor’s appointment so that you don’t get a false reading of your CPK levels., If you are going to do high intensity workouts, you should always warm up your muscles first. When you warm up your muscles by stretching or doing a light jog or easy bike ride, you help them to stretch and loosen so that they don’t sustain injuries (even slight ones) when you do your intense exercises.Great warm-ups include:



Jogging or biking slowly to work your way into an elevated heartbeat can be a good warm up.

Start out with lighter weights to get blood pumping to your muscles before lifting heavier weights.

, Your stress levels can actually have a physical affect on your body but increasing your blood pressure. When your blood pressure increases, there is a chance that your CPK levels will go up. Because of this, it is important that you stay relaxed.Try mediation or yoga. Both of these practices can help you relax by teaching you breathing techniques and helping you to focus your mind on the present, rather than on the things that are causing you stress.
Try passion flower, valerian, lime flower (Tilia cordata) and lemon balm. These are all tranquilizing herbs that can help to keep you calm.

"
"
Understand that statins can increase your CPK counts.,
Be aware that some other drugs can raise your CPK levels.,
Ask your doctor for a revision of your prescription.",How to Lower CPK Levels Naturally4," Statins are medications that are effectively used to lower blood cholesterol levels. However, one of their side effects is rhabdomyolysis or breakdown of muscle tissue due to inflammation. Because of this mechanism, these drugs cause an elevated CPK level. Examples of statins include:


Simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.

, If you are taking any of the drugs listed in this step, they might be the reason for your elevated CPK levels so you should talk to your doctor about trying different medications to treat your conditions. Other medications that can increase CPK levels include:


Amphotericin B (an antifungal).
Ampicillin (an antibacterial).
Some anesthetics.
Anticoagulants such as aspirin, heparin and warfarin.
Dexamethasone (a steroid).
Clofibrate (another cholesterol-lowering drug).
Furosemide (a diuretic).
Morphine (a pain reliever).

, If you are taking any of the above-mentioned medications and are having an issue with elevated CPK levels, you might want to consider trying different medications. You can consult your doctor, tell him or her of your elevated CPK levels, and ask for a revision of your prescription.If you can’t get a different prescription, your doctor will work with you to find another way to bring your CPK levels down.

Get a prescription for radioactive iodine.,
Be aware of the possible side effects of radioactive iodine.,
Take medication to replace thyroxine.",How to Lower TSH Levels Fast2," Radioactive iodine comes in the form of a liquid or a capsule. It is absorbed by your thyroid gland and shrinks it. Your hyperthyroid symptoms should go away within three to six months.You can use radioactive iodine for years to treat your hyperthyroidism, as it is considered safe for long term use.
Always take the recommended dosage provided by your doctor. Do not take more than recommended.

, In general, this medication has very few side effects and has been proven effective for people with high TSH levels. However, you may experience hypothyroidism as a result of this medication.If you have Graves’ hyperthyroidism, radioactive iodine can make your eye issues worse. Your doctor may suggest preventative medications that you can take along with radioactive iodine if you have Graves’ hyperthyroidism.

, Having radioactive iodine will slow down your thyroid gland, which can cause symptoms related to hypothyroidism. To prevent this, your doctor may suggest you take medication once a day to replace thyroxine in your body.In most cases, you will need to take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for a prolonged period of time to replace the missing thyroxine in your body.
Your doctor will also monitor your thyroid with regular blood tests to ensure the treatment is successful and your hypothyroidism is under control.

Speak to your doctor about thyroid surgery.,
Acknowledge the possible risks of the surgery.,
Allow yourself time to recovery after the surgery.",How to Lower TSH Levels Fast3," Thyroid surgery, called a thyroidectomy, is a good option if you cannot tolerate antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine therapy. Though done in rare cases, it can be a viable option for some with high TSH levels. During the thyroidectomy, the doctor will remove most of your thyroid gland.You will be under general anesthetic during the surgery. You will need to stay in the hospital for about two days to complete the surgery.

, Risks include damage to your vocal cords and to your parathyroid glands. These four small glands at the back of your thyroid gland help to control the amount of calcium in your blood.Your doctor should outline all the possible risks before you agree to the surgery.

, After the thyroid surgery, you will need to recover at home for several weeks. You will need to take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life so you do not develop hypothyroidism.If your parathyroid glands were removed during the surgery, you will also need to take medication to maintain normal blood-calcium levels.

Maintain a healthy diet rich in iodine.,
Exercise regularly.,
Reduce stress and anxiety.",How to Lower TSH Levels Fast4," Have a diet rich in healthy sources of protein like tofu, chicken, and beans. Add a good balance of fruits and vegetables to your diet, specifically sea vegetables, as they are rich in iodine. Have sea vegetables like kelp, nori, and kombu. Foods high in natural iodine are good for your thyroid.You can sprinkle kelp over your salads or soups for added iodine. Try adding kombu to your beans or meat. Wrap foods in nori.

, Being active can help your TSH levels stay balanced. Go for regular runs or bike rides. Join a gym and take workout classes. Make it a habit to be active for at least 30 minutes a day.You can also try taking a yoga class to help you stay active and to reduce your stress levels. Look for yoga classes at your local gym or yoga studio.

, Keep your stress and anxiety levels low to avoid agitating your thyroid. Do relaxing activities like painting, drawing, and knitting. Try doing a hobby you enjoy to release stress and anxiety. Working out can also be a good way to reduce your stress levels."

Eat lots of fresh fruits and veggies.,
Consider taking helpful supplements.,
Cut back on drinking alcohol.,
Don't overdo it on medications.,
Intake less salt.,
Monitor your protein consumption.,
Stop smoking.",How to Maintain Healthy Kidneys," Most Americans don't drink enough water during the day, which probably has the biggest negative impact on their kidneys. Being the high-volume filters that they are, the kidneys need adequate water to remove toxins, waste products and unwanted or unneeded compounds from the blood. As such, drinking plenty of water at regular intervals throughout the day will help your kidneys function properly and not get too congested or calcified.Aim for four to six 8-ounce glasses of water a day if you're sedentary, or eight glasses if you're more active or live in a warm climate.During hot summer months or when exercising strenuously, you need to drink more water than usual to make up for fluid lost by perspiring.
Your urine should be fairly clear or straw-colored when you go to the bathroom. If it's any darker than that, then it may be a sign you are dehydrated.
Caffeinated beverages (coffee, black tea, soda pop) obviously contain water, but caffeine is diuretic and triggers frequent urination, so they are not great sources of hydration. Stick with filtered water and natural fruit/veggie juices.;
, As noted above, high blood pressure is damaging to blood vessels throughout the body, including the small arteries within the kidneys that are so important for its filtrating ability. As such, keep your blood pressure at a target set by your doctor, which is typically less than 140/90 mm Hg.Blood pressure below this level can help delay or prevent kidney dysfunction and failure.


Check your blood pressure regularly, either at your local pharmacy, health clinic, or at home with some purchased equipment. Hypertension often has no obvious symptoms, so you need to keep on eye on your numbers.
Eating a low-salt diet, reducing stress and maintaining a healthy weight all help maintain normal blood pressure.
If lifestyle changes don't make a big impact, then blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be able to protect your kidneys by reducing your blood pressure.

, In addition to watching your calories, getting regular cardiovascular exercise is a great way to maintain your weight, which fosters kidney health. Obesity strains the heart and blood vessels, which leads to higher blood pressure and eventual kidney damage.. Just 30 minutes of mild-to-moderate cardiovascular exercise on a daily basis is associated with better kidney health as it can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as trigger weight loss. Start by simply walking around your neighborhood (if it's safe), then transition to more challenging terrain with some hills. Treadmills and cycling are also great for cardiovascular exercise.


Avoid vigorous exercise to start with, especially if you've been diagnosed with a heart issue. Vigorous exercise (such as long-distance running) temporarily increases blood pressure, which strains the kidneys and heart.
Thirty minutes of exercise five times a week is a good start, and an hour is even better (for most people), but much more time spent exercising doesn't appear to be significantly more beneficial.

, A healthy, low-salt diet is healthy for the kidneys because it keeps blood pressure in check. For the most part, fresh fruits and veggies are low in sodium, high in vitamins and minerals, and a good source of antioxidants, which is all beneficial for the cardiovascular system and the kidneys.Fruits and veggies are also good sources of water, which the kidneys need to properly filtrate the blood.


Veggies that contain moderate amounts of sodium include artichokes, beets, carrots, seaweed, turnips and celery — so go easy on these.
Fruits that have a little more sodium than average include tropical mammy apples, guavas and passion fruits.
Canned and pickled vegetables are usually high in sodium and should be avoided or minimized in your diet.
Fruits and veggies especially rich in antioxidants include: all dark-colored berries, strawberries, apples, cherries, artichokes, kidney and pinto beans.

, The standard American diet is not only too high in sodium, but it's usually deficient in a variety of essential nutrients (certain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids). Eating a nutritious diet certainly reduces the risk of experiencing any nutritional deficiencies, but supplementing can be beneficial and make up for any gaps in your diet. Supplements that have demonstrated to be beneficial to kidney health in studies include vitamin D, potassium, coenzyme Q10 and omega-3 fatty acids.Clinical trials conducted on chronic kidney disease patients concluded that vitamin D supplements improved kidney and heart function.Remember that our skin can make vitamin D in response to intense summer sunshine.
The sodium-potassium balance in the kidneys is crucial for proper function, so adding more potassium to your diet (via foods or supplements) helps to reduce the negative effects of high sodium levels.Coenzyme Q10 helps normalize blood pressure and decrease hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, both strong risk factors for kidney disease.Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation helps to decrease the prevalence of chronic kidney disease by reducing blood pressure and excess protein in the urine., It's no secret that over-indulging in alcoholic beverages (which contain ethanol, a carcinogen) is strongly associated with numerous types of cancer and organ damage, including the kidneys.Ethanol damages the delicate internal structures of the kidneys, making them less able to filter your blood and balance fluids / electrolytes — frequently leading to high blood pressure.


Binge drinking (about 4-5 drinks within a couple of hours) can raise blood alcohol levels to the point that the kidneys essentially shut down — a condition called acute kidney injury.As such, either stop drinking alcohol entirely or limit your consumption to no more than 1 alcoholic beverage per day.
The least harmful alcoholic beverage is considered to be red wine because it contains antioxidants, such as resveratrol, which can help prevent free radical damage of blood vessels and other tissues.

, All medications are toxic to organs such as the liver and kidneys at least to some extent (dosage is obviously an important factor too), but some are much more damaging than others. For example, common over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin are well known to cause kidney damage if they are taken regularly over a prolonged period of time.The byproducts of their breakdown within the body can easily damage the kidneys and liver.


If your kidneys are otherwise healthy, then occasional use of these medicines for inflammation and pain control is probably fine, but keep continuous use to less than 2 weeks and dosages under 800 mg daily.
If you're taking anti-inflammatories on a long-term basis for arthritis or other chronic conditions, ask your doctor about monitoring your kidney function via certain blood and urine tests.

, The typical American diet is relatively high in salt, which is comprised of sodium and chloride. Too much sodium inhibits your kidneys from filtering and excreting water, which builds up in the body and increases blood pressure.High blood pressure (hypertension) creates turbulence within the kidney's small blood vessels, which leads to damage and dysfunction. As such, avoid high-sodium foods and stop using the salt shaker during meals.


You should consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day if your kidneys are healthy, and less than 1,500 mg if you have kidney dysfunction or high blood pressure.Avoid or limit consumption of foods high in sodium, such as: processed meats, crackers, salted nuts and snacks, canned soups, pickled foods, frozen foods and most processed condiments and dressings.Consider adopting some form of DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet that's based on low sodium foods, such as fresh fruits and veggies.

, Protein is obviously an essential macronutrient needed to build muscle tissue, skin, enzymes and many other compounds in the body. However, high-protein diets tend to be hard on the kidneys because they must work harder to filter all the protein and amino acids out of the bloodstream.Furthermore, high-protein diets may worsen kidney function in people with kidney disease because their bodies often have trouble eliminating the waste products of protein metabolism.The amount of dietary protein that's healthy for you and your kidneys depends on your body size, muscle mass and activity levels. Men need more protein than women, and athletes need more than people who are sedentary.
In general, the average-sized adult needs between 46 to 56 g of protein daily, depending on their weight, muscle mass and overall health.Healthy sources of protein include beans, most soy products, unsalted nuts, hemp seeds, fish, skinless poultry.

, Smoking cigarettes on a regular basis is one of the most harmful things you can do to your body. It's well established that inhaling cigarette smoke damages nearly every organ and blood vessel in the body.Smoking is bad for the kidneys because the toxins that become dissolved in the bloodstream damage the small blood vessels and ""filters"" inside the kidneys. The toxic compounds essentially decrease the flow of blood in the kidneys by clogging them up, which compromises their function.Clogged up arteries (referred to atherosclerosis) also increases the risk of high blood pressure within the kidneys and elsewhere in the body.


Deaths related to cigarette smoking is estimated to be about 480,000 per year in the United States — most are related to lung disease, stroke and heart attack, but some are related to kidney failure.The best solution is to stop smoking entirely. Stopping ""cold turkey"" may not work well for you, so consider using nicotine patches or gum to help wean yourself off slowly.

Skip fad diets.,
Cut calories.,
Focus on healthier dining options.,
Control portion sizes.,
Cut out snacks and sweets.,
Drink lots of water.,
Exercise for an hour per day.,
Minimize strength training.,
Maximize cardio.,
Vary your exercises.,
Use a heart monitor.,
Try interval training.,
Log your steps.,
Clean out the fridge.,
Stay busy.,
Eat at home more.,
Get 7-9 hours of sleep each night.",How to Lose Weight in 3 Weeks," Fad diets may lead to some immediate results, but they’re rarely healthy, and the results never last.Fad diets typically mean a gimmick that doesn’t include a well-balanced diet. You miss out on key nutrients over the course of the diet. Most people immediately put the weight back on after concluding the fad diet as well., The simple act of burning roughly 500 more calories per day that you take in can lead to a loss of 1-2 pounds over the course of a week.By counting calories, you can more accurately compare how many you take in on a daily basis versus how many you burn while exercising.


There is a limit to how many calories you can cut safely, though. For instance, if you plan to exercise for one hour per day to see quick results, you should still at least 1,200 calories per day and no less.For comparison purposes, most daily values are based on a 2,000-calorie per day diet.

, To see quick results in a healthy manner, focus on foods like veggies, eggs, soy products, skinless poultry breasts, fish, shellfish, seeds, nuts, pulses, legumes, low fat dairy foods, and 95% lean meat.Choose healthy carbs like long-grain rice, quinoa, oats, and barley. Eat fruit as a treat. A good variety of these options will help you maintain nutrients while cutting out unnecessary starches, sugars, and animal fats.Seems simple, but it’s easier said than done.


Most serving suggestions will be based on a 2,000-calorie per day diet. However, to see fast, safe results with your weight-loss efforts, you should tailor your calorie intake based on your exercise regimen. Never drop below the daily calorie intake highlighted in Step 2.

, Some people mistakenly believe that eating too much of healthy options is still healthy. Even when eating well, you still need to control portion sizes. To get a better idea of correct portion sizes when talking about a “serving size” of healthy options, consider the following.A portion size of a complex carb such as vegetables, grains, and fruit should be the size of your fist.
A portion size of protein should fit in the palm of your hand.
A portion size of nuts fits in the palm of your hand.

, Unnecessary snacking and sugary drinks are the sources of more daily calories than most people realize. Cut out as many of these as possible. Sadly, this also means desserts.


If you do need to snack, have vegetables instead of sweets.Actively try to eat only from a plate at the dinner table whenever possible. Mindless snacking in front of the refrigerator or on the couch adds up., You can cut out plenty of calories each day by replacing caloric drinks with water. In addition to keeping you hydrated, drinking lots of water can also help you feel full, which will cut down on snacking and other habits that way curb your weight-loss progress.This includes alcoholic beverages as well, which often average even more calories than soft drinks.Drink at least eight glasses of water each day, preferably cold water.

, The type of exercise you do and how hard you push yourself will depend upon how active you are before beginning your efforts. However, you should aim to exercise for an hour per day.You’ll quickly see a difference in how hard you can push yourself by keeping up a daily regimen.

, While strength-training regimens are an important part of a fitness routine, they don’t lead to the calorie burning you want for fast results.Cardio is your best bet when you're trying to burn calories fast. Try pliometrics or an interval workout to get high calorie burns while maintaining your muscle mass., When it comes to burning lots of calories fast, cardio is your friend. You don’t have to push yourself to the extreme for the entire hour of exercise, though. For the best results, try to break a sweat during your warm up, then keep yourself sweating for the entire hour.If you have a chronic condition or a lot of weight to lose, check with your primary care physician before taking on a serious physical exercise routine.Ensure that your physician thinks you’re healthy enough for the activity.

, An hour per day is a great way to burn out on a single exercise. The key to maintaining is to vary your exercise routine enough to keep it interesting.Mixing resistance moves with cardio will keep your heart rate up and break the boredom. Cardio means that your heart rate is elevated to 70-85% of your maximum heart rate for a sustained period of time. That means that any movement, including sets of squats or push-ups, can be included in a 60 minute cardio workout.


Add a few intervals of push ups, sit ups, lunges, squats, burpees, jumping jacks, or skipping to walking, hiking, cycling, swimming, skating, jogging, stair climbing, or dancing.
Consider also trying these other exercises that burn roughly 600 calories per hour in the target MHR:Cycling
Rowing
Swimming



, To maximize gains (or losses as it were), keep your heart rate in the optimal range for fat and calorie burning. The range for steady-state fat burning is between 55-75% of your maximum heart rate (MHR). The range of 70-85% of your MHR is considered to be the cardiac training zone. For best results, spend half of your exercise time in the 55-75% range and half in the 70-85% range. This will allow you to get the calorie burn that you want to support your faster weight loss.You can determine your MHR by subtracting your age from 220.
Multiply this number by 0.55 and 0.75 to find your steady-state fat burning range.Multiply your MHR by .70 and .85 to get your cardiac training zone range.
Use a heart monitor to gauge if you’re staying in your ranges during your exercise.

, Interval training refers to the process of alternating between high-intensity bursts and more moderate intensity throughout the routine.When using a heart monitor, you can easily introduce interval training by pushing yourself from the low end of your target range toward the higher end for several minutes at a time.


Building stamina for interval training takes time. Begin slowly with fewer high-intensity bursts with a shorter duration.The emphasis should always be on safety, so don’t overdo it.

, You’ll be much more likely to maintain your workout routine if you schedule and log your daily workouts.Looking back at the number of hours you’ve logged at the end of each week will also motivate you to keep going.


Weigh yourself daily as part of your log as well. You’ll feel even more motivated once you start seeing results on the scale.

, You’ll have an easier time avoiding sugary snacks and other junk food if you don’t keep it in the house to begin with. Clean out your refrigerator and pantry to cut down on any temptations.

, To reduce the risk of snacking and other counterproductive activities, stay busy even when you’re not exercising., You’ll have a much more difficult time controlling your calorie intake if you eat out all the time. Cook at home where you can control the portion size and exactly what goes into the preparation of meals.

, In addition to eating well and exercising, sleep is beneficial to your metabolism. You’ll naturally be tired while burning more calories than you take in each day as well. Give your body the rest it needs to maximize your results.

Put the “HIRT” to your myostatin levels.,
String several resistance training exercises together for a “super-set.” Instead of limiting your set by the number of repetitions per exercise, limit it by a length of time.,
Use caution during HIRT.,
Choose the right weight.",How to Lower Myostatin Levels1," Resistance training of any kind can improve health and build muscle. But to lower myostatin levels, you’ll need to engage in high-intensity resistance training (HIRT). This means doing resistance training that pushes you to your physical limits.HIRT requires doing full-body workouts. In other words, your resistance training regimen should work your arms, back, and legs.;
, Perform as many repetitions as possible without resting during the time limit you’ve set.For instance, do 10 pushups, 10 pullups, 10 leg extensions, then 10 biceps curls as quickly as possible over the course of about 10 minutes.
If you’ve gone through the 10 biceps curls before the 10 minute time limit has elapsed, start the cycle again by doing 10 pushups.
Rest one or two minutes between each super-set.

, HIRT can be physically taxing. Talk to your doctor before adopting a HIRT exercise regimen and don’t perform HIRT more than three or four times per week., When doing resistance training, you must choose the right weight for you. Start at the lowest weight for whatever machine or barbell you’re using. Perform 10-12 reps. If you find that it was very easy and you don’t feel taxed by the end of your 10-12 reps, add weight in small increments. You’ll know you’ve found the right weight for you when 10-12 reps is significantly taxing."

Talk with your doctor.,
Take a zinc supplement.,
Monitor any pre-existing conditions.,
Watch for any potential drug interactions.,
Stop any synthetic DHEA supplements.,
Agree to surgical treatment.",How to Lower DHEA1," Make an appointment to see your general practitioner or an endocrinologist, a specialist who treats hormonal disorders. They will ask you about your medical history and run a blood test for DHEA levels. Bring a list of questions with you to get the most out of your appointment.Your doctor might suggest monitoring your DHEA levels using saliva, serum, or urine tests.These tests will also be used to rule out any larger issues with your adrenal glands, such as Addison disease.Your doctor will likely tell you that it is important to lower your DHEA as high levels can cause aggression and irregular blood pressure, among other health issues. Luckily, a benefit of reducing your DHEA levels is that most of these health concerns will disappear as your numbers drop.;
, Certain minerals, such as zinc, can reduce swelling and inflammation throughout your body. If you’ve felt swollen lately and you know that your DHEA levels are high, zinc may be able to help you. Just make sure to talk with your doctor before taking any supplements., Your DHEA levels can have a direct impact on others areas of your health, including any prior diseases that you may be fighting. Along with your doctor, you may want to agree to additional monitoring for any diabetes, liver disease, or cancers while trying to lower your DHEA levels. This is a proactive approach that can keep you healthy in the long term., Certain drugs have a side effect of boosting your DHEA levels. If you are trying to keep your levels lower, then talk with your doctor before starting any new medications. And, go through with them and evaluate all of the current medications that you are taking.For example, diabetes drugs, such as metformin, are often associated with DHEA boosts.

, Talk with your doctor about gradually weaning off, or stopping cold turkey, any prescribed or over-the-counter hormonal medications that you are currently taking. It’s almost impossible to lower your DHEA while taking boosting medications.Be aware that the weaning off process can take months. Just stay patient and you will see positive results over time.

, If your excess DHEA is caused by a sizeable tumor, then your doctor may suggest a removal procedure. Talk over the risks and rewards of any surgeries with your doctor before agreeing to anything. The benefits of surgery is that it will make it possible to lower your levels quickly."

Perform biceps curls.,
Use a chest press machine.,
Use a machine shoulder press.,
Try other resistance exercises.",How to Lower Myostatin Levels2," Grip a barbell from below with your palms facing up. Grip the barbell in such a way that the weights on either end are equidistant from each hand, and place each hand shoulder-width apart from the other. Lift the bar to your chest using your elbows.Keep your elbows pinned to your side as you lift. Sliding your elbows behind your ribs will decrease the amount of work your biceps do.
Don’t swing the bar up using momentum from your hips.

, Sit at the chest press machine and adjust the seat for your height. The handles should be situated near the middle or bottom of your pectoral muscles. Lay your hands on the handles of the machine. Your shoulder blades should be retracted. If they are not, adjust the position of the machine’s handles so that they are.Keeping your head and chest up, press the handles forward, extending through the elbow.
Pause briefly when you’ve reached your maximum extension, then return the handles to a position just beyond the starting position in order to keep the tension on.

, The machine shoulder press is not unlike the chest press, except that instead of pushing forward, you push up. Grip the handles of the machine, keeping your elbows in line with your torso. If your elbows are not lined up with your torso, adjust the level of the seat. Lift the handles as you exhale. Extend your arms slowly. When you reach your maximum extension, hold the position briefly, then bring the handles back down to a place just above the starting position., There are many other resistance exercises that could lower your myostatin levels. For instance, you might want to use a resistance band, do squats, or lift free weights."
"
Exercise at a moderate intensity.,
Use an elliptical.,
Ride a bike.,
Go for a jog.,
Try other aerobic exercises.",How to Lower Myostatin Levels3," When using aerobic exercise to reduce your myostatin levels, you have significant leeway regarding how much exercise you wish to do. To begin reducing myostatin levels you need only exercise at about 40% to 50% of your maximum ability. Pushing yourself beyond these basic exercise levels will result in a greater decrease in myostatin.Working out at moderate intensity on a bike, elliptical, or in other aerobic exercise will feel similar to taking a brisk walk.
You should burn at least 1,200 calories each week to see real declines in your myostatin levels. To track the number of calories you burn, check the digital readouts on your aerobic exercise equipment, or use a wearable fitness tracking device (for instance the FitBit).

, An elliptical training machine (sometimes called a “ski machine”) is a popular piece of equipment that can help you lower your myostatin levels. To use the elliptical machine, step onto the machine’s foot pads. Place your left foot in the left foot pad, and your right foot in the right foot pad. Grab the left and right handles.Select the settings under which you wish to train. For instance, you can increase the machine’s resistance or set time or calorie burning targets.The handles and feet pads on a given side of the machine work in opposition to each other. In other words, as you swing the machine’s right handle forward, your right leg will move back. On the opposite side, the left hand will be pulled back and your left foot will be moved forward. Swing your feet and arms forward and backward in time with the machine.

, Riding a bike is a common aerobic exercise, and can lower your myostatin levels. You can ride either a regular bike or a stationary bike to gain the benefits of lowered myostatin.Ride at moderate intensity to lower your myostatin levels. Aim to burn at least 1,200 calories per week by riding a bike.
Always use safety when riding a bike. Wear a helmet and ride in the bike lane, or as close to the curb as possible. Do not ride against traffic and do not ride on the sidewalk., Running is one of the most common forms of aerobic exercise, and can lower your myostatin levels. Wear light, loose-fitting clothing when running. Choose a clean, well-lit path.Aim to jog at least 20 minutes. As you gain strength and build endurance, add time to your run in 10-minute increments.

, There are many aerobic exercises you could do which, over time, could lower your myostatin levels. For instance, you might choose to jump rope, go swimming, row a boat, or do jumping jacks."
"
Do not smoke.,
Use a myostatin inhibitor.,
Use a follistatin supplement.",How to Lower Myostatin Levels4," Smoking is associated with higher myostatin levels. To lower your myostatin levels, do not start smoking. If you are already addicted to nicotine, adopt a plan to quit smoking.The best way to quit smoking is to gradually phase out the behavior. For instance, if you decide that in two weeks’ time, you want to stop smoking completely, cut your cigarette intake by 25% today. Cut it by another 25% about five days later. After about 10 days, cut your cigarette consumption by 25% again. Finally, when two weeks has elapsed, smoke your final cigarette.
Nicotine gum and patches can also help you combat your addiction.

, Myostatin inhibitors are still experimental, but if you suffer from cancer or another muscle-wasting medical condition, you might qualify for treatment using one. You’ll need a prescription, since they are not available over the counter. Talk to your doctor about your options for lowering your myostatin levels using an inhibitor.Another experimental medical procedure, myostatin-inhibiting gene therapy, might also be an option for you, depending on your medical need. Talk to your doctor about opportunities to receive such a treatment., Follistatin inhibits the production of myostatin. There are many follistatin-based supplements available that can lower your levels of myostatin. Most of these use fertile chicken egg yolk isolate, so if you have an egg allergy, you might not be able to use them. Consult directions for use before consuming follistatin supplements.Generally, follistatin supplements come in powdered form. They are blended with water or milk, then consumed.

Consult with your doctor before making any changes.,
Eat the right diet.,
Exercise.,
Maintain a healthy body weight.,
Get the right amount of sleep.,
Reduce your stress.",How to Lower DHEA2," If you’d like to try to control your DHEA levels using diet and exercise, then make an appointment to talk over your ideas with your primary care physician. They may be able to give you some extra tips or advice as to what works and what doesn’t. They can also start to track your DHEA levels right away, so you’ll know how to modify your lifestyle changes.

, Just to be clear, foods do not contain DHEA directly. But, eating particular foods can encourage your body to produce more or less DHEA and other hormones. If you are trying to lower your levels, avoid foods that will elevate your DHEA, such as wild yams, sugars, wheat, and dairy products. Instead, follow a diet that emphasizes foods with anti-inflammatory properties, like tomatoes, olive oil, and salmon., Going to work out at least three times a week is a great way to keep your DHEA levels under control. Switch out both cardio and weight sessions to see the most benefits. Working out will help you to build muscle and shed fat., Look at the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a general guide as to where your weight should be as related to your height and age. When your body carries extra weight the fat cells produce excess estrogen, DHEA, and other hormones., To better control your hormones, aim to get eight hours of sleep per night. Come up with a sleep schedule that works for you and stick with it. In fact, some studies argue that even getting a little bit less sleep is better if you are trying to lower DHEA., Your body is very sensitive to stress and may respond by producing excess hormones, such as DHEA. To keep your DHEA under control, find some ways to unwind in your daily life. Take up yoga, which you can do both at work and at home. Practice deep breathing techniques. Eat at least one meal outside each day to enjoy the fresh air. Go see a movie or a take a painting class with friends.You can also ask your doctor to monitor your blood pressure levels alongside your DHEA results. If you engage in stress-relieving activities, you might see improvements across the board.

Watch for natural reductions with age.,
Be careful not to go too low.,
Minimize any cortisol intake.,
Choose a non-hormonal birth control.,
Make no changes at all.",How to Lower DHEA3," DHEA levels usually peak right around the age of 20 when a person becomes fully hormonally and physically mature. Then, they start to naturally decline until almost no DHEA is left by the time you reach your 90s. Talk with your doctor about how to manage the age-based decline of your DHEA levels while also taking outside action, such as dietary changes., In your efforts to lower your DHEA levels, make sure that you go in for regular blood tests with your doctor. Changing up your body’s production of DHEA too much has been linked to some dangerous illnesses, such as certain cancers and type 2 diabetes., Cortisol shots have been linked to boosted DHEA levels. If you decide to take any medications with cortisol, which is a hormone itself, talk with your doctor about your concerns. Your doctor may also recommend cortisol as a partial replacement for a dip in DHEA levels. This is a strategy often used with athletes undergoing heavy training., The chemicals found in many birth control pills and shots can cause a boost in DHEA levels. To determine if you are taking a pill with testosterone-like effects, read your medication’s label and talk with your doctor. If you are considering a birth control shot, discuss the hormonal effects with your OBGYN before moving forward.Non-hormonal methods, such as a copper IUD, have the same birth control benefits without the progestin risk. Many people experiencing migraines or hair loss with hormonal methods also find these to be a good alternative.

, If your high levels of DHEA are asymptomatic, or showing no outward symptoms, then you may safely choose to leave it generally untreated. Perhaps make some of the suggested lifestyle changes and see how those go. In some cases, even DHEA secreting tumors are left alone because the surgery can be more problematic than the excess hormones.

Reduce shouting.,
Avoid whispering.,
Drink water or suck on candy to clear your throat.,
Avoid using your voice when it is hoarse.,
Gargle with salt water instead of mouthwash.,
Avoid speaking while lifting heavy objects.,
Take time to relax.,
Practice belly breathing techniques.",How to Look After Your Voice1," To protect your vocal cords and prevent changes to the sound of your voice, you will want to avoid shouting or screaming. When you raise your voice, your vocal cords come together forcefully, which can cause nodules to form over time. Shouting also causes increased strain to the muscles in your neck., Similar to when you shout, you put more pressure on your vocal cords when you whisper. Whispering strains your vocal cords and can cause damage over time. Instead of whispering, practice speaking in a soft voice., Instead of coughing and clearing your throat, try drinking water or sucking on a sugar-free candy. Swallowing hard works, too. These can help clear your throat without causing the vocal strain that coughing and aggressive throat clearing cause., If you have lost your voice or have had a sore throat, it is important that you speak or sing as little as possible.

It is especially important that you rest your voice if you are sick. Illness puts extra strain on your voice, and talking or singing can put even more stress on your vocal cords. Over time, this can lead to unwanted changes in your voice., If you use mouthwash, use it for rinsing your mouth only. Gargling with mouthwash in the back of your throat can be harmful to your vocal cords, as mouthwashes often contain alcohol and other irritating chemicals., If you are lifting heavy objects or straining your neck, wait until you are finished to speak. Talking while straining your neck can cause unnecessary stress on your voice., Since your voice is part of the muscular system of your body, tension in your body can negatively impact your voice. Make some time to integrate relaxation techniques and relaxing hobbies into your life. Doing so will help you to use your vocal cords in a way that doesn’t cause damage.Some ideas for relaxing activities include walking, swimming, doing yoga, and meditating.
You also want to be sure that you are getting enough sleep at night—between 6 and 8 hours. Sleep recharges your body as well as your voices, and being underslept can cause your voice to become more easily fatigued and strained., Belly breathing, also known as diaphragmatic breathing, is a method of deep breathing that allows your body to receive more oxygen with each breath. Learning good breathing patterns helps you to have a strong voice without having to strain. To practice belly breathing, sit or stand up straight with your shoulders pulled back. Put one hand on your stomach, and breathe in through your mouth. You should feel your stomach push out against your hand. Then, slowly breathe out through your mouth. As you breathe out, you should pull your stomach back in. Repeat this 5 times, as often as you wish. It will start to feel more natural with practice. You can also try these breathing exercises to improve your voice:Sit up straight in a chair, and breathe in through your nose. Breathe out slowly through your nose, and begin to make a humming sound (“hmmmm”). You should feel the sound vibrating in your nose. The sound should be coming from your nose, not your throat.
Lie on your back, and place a small book on top of your stomach. Breathe in through your mouth. The book should rise up as you inhale. Breathe out slowly through pursed lips. The book should lower as you exhale.

Stop smoking.,
Limit your caffeine intake.,
Limit how much alcohol you drink.,
Beware of spicy foods.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Eat foods with vitamins A, E, C. Foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables contain these vitamins, which help to keep the mucous membranes in your throat healthy.",How to Look After Your Voice2," Quitting smoking is one of the most important factors in looking after your voice. The tar and heat inhaled while smoking cause your vocal cords to become inflamed, dry, and swollen. Smoking causes hoarseness and a deeper vocal pitch.Smoking cigarettes is the primary cause of throat cancer. If you are a smoker and your voice is becoming hoarse, you should make an appointment with an otolaryngologist to be sure you do not have throat cancer., To prevent your vocal cords and larynx from becoming dry, you will want to limit how much caffeine you consume. Caffeine dehydrates your body, including your vocal cords.Try substituting a caffeine-free tea or warm water with lemon and honey for coffee. This will give you the pleasantness of a warm drink without the caffeine.

, While alcohol in moderation isn’t problematic for your vocal cords, excessive drinking can dry them out and cause voice changes over time. If you drink, try to limit your alcohol intake and avoid binge drinking. At least one day every week should be entirely free from alcohol.A moderate consumption of alcohol means up to one drink per day for women of all ages, and up to two drinks per day for men up to age 65. Men over age 65 should also limit their consumption to one drink per day., Eating spicy foods may cause stomach acid to move into the throat, which can cause heartburn or GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Spicy foods affect each person differently, so you can experiment to see which foods cause you to have heartburn and which ones have no effect. Those that cause heartburn are likely causing acid to move into the throat and esophagus and therefore should be avoided., Keeping your vocal cords hydrated is very important. Be sure to always drink when you are thirsty. Try carrying a water bottle around with you wherever you go to remind you to take sips throughout the day.,"
"
Use a humidifier.,
Reduce background noise.,
Avoid chemical sprays and air fresheners.",How to Look After Your Voice3," Dry environments or dusty air can cause the mucous membranes in your throat to dry out. Over time, this can result in changes to your voice. If you are spending time in a dry environment, or one with central heating or air conditioning, you may want to purchase a humidifier.

The recommended amount of humidity in the air you breathe is 30%.
In the winter time, and in climates that are dry in general, humidifiers are very important for keeping your vocal cords lubricated and moist.Another way to hydrate and soothe dry, irritated vocal cords is by inhaling steam. Fill up a large bowl or kettle with boiled water, and add some chamomile flowers if you’d like. Then, sit with your face over the bowl—if the water is too hot, let it cool for a few minutes first. Cover your head and shoulders with a towel, and breathe in and out through your mouth. After inhaling the steam, avoid talking for about thirty minutes. This will let the newly hydrated mucous membranes rest., People often speak louder than they realize due to excessive background noise. To avoid shouting that can damage your voice, consider moving your conversation to a quieter location if you plan to talk a lot. If you are at home, turn off the TV or music while talking so that you can speak more softly and still be heard., Air-fresheners, hairspray, and perfume all release chemicals into the air. When you breathe these in, they can dry out and irritate your vocal cords. Try limiting your use of these products, or use them in a very well-ventilated area."

Exercise regularly.,
Eat fruit daily.,
Go on a diet.,
Research illnesses.,
Consider becoming either vegan or vegetarian.","How to Live a Long, Healthy Life"," You should exercise about 2 hours a day. You don't have to do bench presses or lift weights to exercise. It could be simple press ups or maybe going on the trampoline if you have one.;
, Eat about 5 vegetables and 5 fruits a day. Don't eat over 10 as this will cause you to gain weight. At dinner, don't eat chips, burgers and pizza, eat a salad and a glass of water.

, If you are eating about 15 dinners a day, that's bad for you. Try going for 3 meals a day. At breakfast, eat a healthy, well balanced cereal which has lots of vitamins. When its the evening, don't eat anything. If you can't go bed, just have a glass of milk or a glass of water.

, Spend some time to look at every illness on the NHS. This will allow you to see every illness there is out there and you will know what to avoid doing to stop you getting ill and if you do happen to get ill what your symptom/s could be. This may take hours but it helps you a lot.


Note down the causes. When looking through all the illnesses note down all the causes for everything. Don't just forget to note one down because you want to still do it. That does not help your health one bit. For an example, a cause of meningitis is using toothbrushes, cigarettes others have used.
Note down the symptoms. Just like the causes, write down all the symptoms of all the illnesses as well. For example some symptoms of bacterial meningitis are a severe headache, fever, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, seizures/fits, photophobia and a stiff neck. Also, note down what to do if you notice these symptoms on yourself or your young child. For example, with meningitis, if you notice any one of the signs you must phone 999, or your local emergency service number immediately.
Know a test method for each illness. This will require long hours of studying, but learn a method to test if a person possibly has a certain illness off by heart.
Don't let this make you a hypochondriac, though. The point is to be aware, not to make you freak out every time you have an itch.

, Studies have shown people who eat off of strict, healthy diets, such as vegan or vegetarian, live longer. Not eating meat also reduces cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. If you choose one of these ALWAYS TAKE VITAMINS. Although vegan/vegetarian is fantastic for your body, you can be missing some vitamins and essential nutrients. Take vitamins, you can even find vitamins specific for vegan/vegetarians at a Whole Foods or other health stores.

Do not take negativity personally.,
Resist the urge to argue.,
Tune it out.,
Have compassion.,
Give in on occasion.",How to Live with an Overly Critical Person1," The most important thing to remember is that it's not about you. If a person is generally critical or negative, chances are they would complain about anyone. When being criticized, try to calm yourself down and remember not to take it personally.


Consider the source of the criticism. Is the person you're living with generally critical? Does he or she complain about work, school, and other friends? If so, this person may simply have a negative outlook. Their criticism is a reflection of that worldview. It is not an objective judgement of your character.Try to remember you're worthwhile. There may be some thread of validity to the criticism. We could all use to improve in some areas. However, flaws and imperfections do not define your character. Your roommate may be right when he points out you always forget to throw out empty milk containers. However, he's choosing to focus on that flaw over your other qualities.;
, It's almost always a bad idea to argue with a critical person. If someone is overly critical, they do not want to resolve a conflict. They simply want to complain. Even if it's difficult, try to resist arguing.


Use empathetic listening when someone is being critical. Simply repeat what the critical person is saying to you. This shows you're listening without forcing you to give in to unreasonable demands. This is a better technique than engaging in an argument. For example, say something like, ""So, I'm hearing you think it's unfair that I forgot to wash my dinner plate last night?""Critical people will often try to force you to engage with them. If you respond empathetically, they may continue to level criticism. Instead of arguing back, calmly state your opinion. You could say, ""I'm sorry that was frustrating for you, but I honestly forgot. I'll just clean it up now and try to remember next time."" If a person is very critical, they may continue to berate you past this point. Do not egg the person on. Simply continue to restate your opinion. Eventually, the other person will get bored and back off., Sometimes, the best means to deal with overly critical people is to learn to ignore them. For a critical person, complaining and nitpicking is simply a way of life. Learn to tune it out.


Overly critical people thrive on conflict and drama. The more you respond, the more likely they'll be to criticize. Therefore, try just responding with monosyllabic answers. When met with criticism, say something like, ""Uh-huh,"" ""Yeah,"" or ""Okay."", Overly critical people are often unhappy themselves. They often have unreasonably high expectations for their own achievements and personal conduct. If someone you live with criticizes you frequently, have some compassion.


Understand you only have to deal with a critical person in the moment. A critical person, on the other hand, has to deal with him or herself all the time. There's a good chance your roommate, family member, romantic partner, or friend criticizes you because of his or her own sense of inadequacy.When someone is criticizing you, consider that person's perspective. There may be reasons he or she is overly critical. For example, say you're a college student living at home. Your father may constantly berate you about your study habits. Consider his perspective. Maybe your dad never got a chance to go to school himself. He could feel insecure in your presence as you're achieving something he never had the chance to achieve. The criticism is not personal. It's a reflection of your father's unhappiness. Sometimes, simply having compassion for someone can ease your frustration with that person., If you're living with an overly critical person, sometimes it's easier to let go of minor things. If your boyfriend bites your head off when you don't fold the laundry in a particular fashion, just to do it his way. It's not a big concession to make and it can ease up on some tension.Even if someone is being unreasonably critical, there could be validity to their complaints. As stated previously, we all have bad habits. It can be annoying if your roommate complains continuously that you leave the bathroom floor wet after you shower. However, someone could slip and fall. Rather than getting annoyed, simply try to wipe up any water with a towel when you finish showering.

These health care professionals will help support your desire for a healthier life. They'll also be able to tell you if you need to start or stop anything in order to have a healthier life.


Visit your primary care physician. Talk to him about your current health condition and if there is anything they'd recommend to help you live a healthier life.
Also visit your dentist. It's typically recommended to go twice a year just for a check up.This is another important visit you shouldn't overlook.
Visit any other doctors you may need. For example: OB/GYN, allergist or endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in hormones).;
, There are a few ways to check on your health status without a doctor. Measuring your weight and overall size can give you some insight into whether or not your body is healthy as well.


Weigh yourself. Note your weight and compare it with national standards for ideal body weight. This will tell you if you're close to a healthy weight or should consider weight loss.
Measure your waist circumference. Another way to interpret your weight and health is by measuring your waist circumference. A large waist may mean you have a high amount of visceral fat which could be dangerous to your health.Men should have a waist circumference less than 40"" and women should be less than 35"".Also figure out your BMI with an online calculator. Again, this is just an additional method of letting you know whether or not you're at a healthy weight.
If many of these measurements are too high and you feel you might be overweight or carrying too much weight, this can be a part of your life you work on so you can be healthier.

, Keeping a journal is a great way to start your healthier life. You can take notes, write goals, track your goals and even keep a food journal. These items will help you figure out what you need to do and motivate you to meet those goals.


You might first want to start taking some notes on any information you get from your doctors or track your weight, BMI or waist circumference.
Also jot down notes about what goals you have and how you think you're going to live a healthier life. It'll take some brainstorming and thinking about all the different aspects of your life you want to change to be healthier.Take notes on your food choices in your journal as well. Studies show that those who journal their food regularly stay on track with new diet patterns for longer.

, A support group is a great part of a healthier lifestyle. They not only can provide support for your goals but also are a support to your mental and emotional well-being.A big part of a healthier life that often gets overlooked is your mental and emotional health. A support group doesn't have to just be there to cheer you on, but be a good friend.
Ask friends, family members or co-workers to join you on certain goals. Maybe others want to lose weight, eat healthier or exercise more.
Studies show that those people who have a support group are morel likely to meet their long-term goals.

, When you're trying to live a healthier life, your diet may be one thing you want to change. Writing up a new meal plan for yourself can help give you the guidelines you need to eat healthy all week long.A meal plan is your blueprint for each meal, snack and beverage throughout the week.
This plan can also allow you to see and plan each of your choices. You can feel confident that what you're eating each day meets your new healthier life.
To start your meal plan, get a pen and paper and write out each day of the week. Write down all your meals, snacks and drinks.
Writing a meal plan can also help you have a more organized grocery list., Mindful eating is a way of eating that helps you bring more attention and focus to how you eat. Mindful eating is important to a healthier life as it helps you enjoy eating.People who eat mindfully typically eat less, have an easier time losing weight and get more satisfaction out of their meals.Eating mindfully involves a variety of things. To start, turn off all electronics (like your phone or TV) and remove any other distractions. You need to be able to fully focus on your meal.
When you're eating pay attention to how your food looks, how it tastes, the textures and temperatures. Really concentrate on each bite.
Also take at least 20-30 minutes to eat your meal. When you take your time with your meal, you may end up eating less and enjoy your meal more.

, A well-balanced diet is the cornerstone of a healthy diet. Eating well is important to help you live a healthier life.When you eat a well-balanced diet you're able to consume all the recommended nutrients your body needs. Your less at risk for nutrient deficiencies and other side effects of a poor quality diet.You will feel and be healthier.
A well-balanced diet is one that includes all five food groups each day. In addition, its a diet that features a wide variety of food. Don't eat the same few foods each day. This limits your ability to eat a wide variety of nutrients.

, When you read the nutrition information and calorie count on food packaging, it is referring to one portion of that food item. But what is a single portion? You might eat an entire bag of chips thinking it only contains one portion, but in fact you've eaten three or four portions. Make sure you're checking portion sizes and that you're not eating more than you need to.


Remember that these measurements constitute a single portion: 3–4 oz of protein, 1/2 cup of grains, 1/2 cup of fruit or one small pieceand 1 cup of vegetables/2 cups of leafy greens. These are serving sizes per meal.
If you go to a restaurant and the portion sizes are huge (as they often are), see if you can get half of your meal boxed up right away to take home. That way, you won't be tempted to clean your plate, even if you're full.

, Make a conscious effort to drink more water. Being adequately hydrated is essential to living a healthier life.


When you're dehydrated you may experience a variety of side effects that may not only affect your health, but how you're feeling as well.
When you're dehydrated you may have chronic headaches, fatigue and afternoon fogginess.Aim for about eight to 13 glasses of clear, hydrating fluids each day. This amount will vary based upon your age, gender and activity level.Drinks that can count towards water include: water, flavored waters, decaf coffee and decaf tea. Keep in mind that sports drinks often contain a lot of sugar, and should be diluted with water in a 1:1 ratio.

, Excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to weight gain or a weight stall and also have negative effects of your overall health.


Health professionals typically recommend that women consume no more than one alcoholic beverage daily and men consume no more than two alcoholic beverages daily.Limit these even further than the recommendations to help support your desire to lose weight and be more slim. Alcohol provides only calories, no nutrition.
Typically one serving of alcohol is 4-oz of wine, 2-oz of liquor or one 12-oz beer., When your diet is limited — due to allergies, dietary restrictions, etc. — you may need to rely on a supplement to help you get enough vital nutrients for your body. Talk to your doctor about whether or not you need supplements and which ones might be right for you.


Supplements can interact negatively with other medications you might be taking, so be sure you talk to your doctor about side effects and possible interactions.Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble, which means if you take too much, you won't just pee out the excess, but it will stay in your body. This can be very dangerous, and therefore it is important you speak with your doctor about how much you should take. Never exceed the recommended amounts.
You may want to consider taking calcium (especially for women), iron (for women who have a heavy period), or B12 (for those who are vegan or vegetarian).Remember, vitamins are there as a back up. They shouldn't be used to in place of foods. You should always aim to get as much of your nutrition from foods as possible.

, Physical activity is an important component of a healthier lifestyle. However, if you do not enjoy the type of exercise you do this can work against your goal of living a healthier life.


Find an exercise routine that you truly enjoy. This will also help support your mental and emotional health. Exercise should feel rejuvenating and enjoyable.
Make a work out mix that you listen to only when you are working out. Every time you switch on the mix your body will get into the pattern of knowing it's time to work out!
Find exercises you enjoy: walking, cycling, yoga, Zumba, ballet — just make sure you are exercising consistently. Peruse your local free library for any workout DVDs or reading material. There is a plethora of information on the internet.
Find a buddy to workout with. You can teach each other your favorite exercises, as well as motivate each other to go during a lazy spell.Also, there's nothing wrong with a little competition!

, In general, health experts recommend you aim for about 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of moderate cardio each week.When doing moderate-intensity cardio, you should be able to talk, but not, say, sing a song.You should break a sweat and your heart rate should be at 50 – 70% of your maximum heart rate.When you include regular cardio, you will be making big strides towards living a healthier life. Exercise, especially cardiovascular activity, comes with a variety of health benefits including: improved mood, better sleep, decreased risk of chronic disease, weight control and improved blood pressure and glucose control.If you want to see additional health benefits from your cardio exercises, aim for 300 minutes each week.

, In addition to regular cardio exercises, its important to include adequate strength training.


Resistance training or strength training offers additional health benefits outside of the ones offered by cardio. Regular strength training can help build lean muscle mass and reduce your risk of osteoporosis. Include 1–3 days of strength training each week. Aim for 20 minutes per session and include exercises that work all your major muscle groups.If you're just starting out, skip the free weights and use machines at the gym. Make sure you ask a trainer to show you how to use them and how to maintain proper form.

, If you're aiming to live a healthier life, it's not about avoiding every unhealthy food or working out everyday. It's about moderation that works for you.


Many health professionals suggest a common rule known as the 80/20 rule. This means that 80% of the time you choose healthy activities or things that will promote a healthier life. 20% of the time you can choose something a little less healthy (like sleeping in instead of your morning workout or having an extra glass of wine).When you first start on your goals towards living a healthier life, make sure to include treats and fun things that might not necessarily be considered ""healthy."" These things will support your mental and emotional health.

, All health professionals will recommend the discontinuation of smoking or using other tobacco products. They have been linked to a variety of healthy problems and diseases.Try to give up smoking as soon as possible. Giving up cold turkey is harder and may come with more side effects, but it's the quickest way to discontinue damaging your body.If you're having trouble quitting, see your doctor for help. They might be able to prescribe you a medication or refer you to a smoking cessation program.

, Stress is a hard to control emotion that can wreak havoc on your health. Low-grade chronic stress is very common and can inhibit your progress towards living a healthier life.


Stress can lead to a variety of health related side effects including: headache, depression, fatigue, raises your risk of a heart attack and type 2 diabetes, acid reflux, and reduced immunity.Engage in other behaviors to help you calm down, release stress and anxiety. Try: meditation, yoga, light exercise, listening to music, talking to a friend or taking a hot shower or bath.

, These health professionals will be able to give you direct guidance on how to better manage your stress, a hectic lifestyle and other life situations.


You may want to talk to your primary care doctor about a local therapist or someone they would recommend you to.
Seeing a therapist isn't only reserved for those people dealing with a significant mental illness like depression. Many studies have shown that people of all ages and background can benefit from seeing a therapist or a life coach., Getting more sleep will help you feel more rested and ready to face the day in the morning. It gives your body more time to rejuvenate itself as well! This is when your body repairs itself on a cellular level.


It's typically recommended to get between 7–9 hours of sleep each night.To help you get a well-rested sleep, do not exercise right before bed, turn off all electronics, turn off all lights and things that make noise. This will help you get the best sleep.Don't ignore chronic sleep problems. If you can't get enough sleep, aren't sleeping well or do not feel well-rested, make an appointment with your doctor to see if they can help alleviate this problem.

Assert yourself.,
Examine the nature of the criticism.,
Provide some honest feedback.,
Use ""I""-statements.,
Be open to compromise.",How to Live with an Overly Critical Person2," You cannot put up with criticism indefinitely. Criticism can reach a point where it's no longer tolerable. It's one thing for your roommate to get on your case about taking the garbage out. However, some critical people begin giving unsolicited advice about your personal and professional life. In this case, you should assert yourself.


Be firm, but also be kind. You do not want to be aggressive or disrespectful. This can escalate the situation and lead to an argument instead of a resolution.Simply state your concern in simple, concrete terms. For example, say your roommate is on your case about your relationship with your girlfriend. Say something like, ""I appreciate that you're concerned about how much time me and Madeline spend together. It's nice to know you care about me enough to express this. However, I think my relationship is pretty stable. At the moment, I'm happy and don't need advice. If that changes in the future, I'll let you know."", Even if it's hard, it can sometimes be helpful to try to objectively examine the criticism. If you try to understand where the other person is coming from, you can more effectively address the issues.


First, consider what is being criticized. Is it something you can control? If so, maybe you could make the effort to change. You could try doing your dishes after using them. However, critical people have a tendency to nitpick people about things they cannot change. If you tend to laugh loudly when watching funny movies, this is more of a personality trait than a conscious choice. In this case, the criticism may be unfair.How is the criticism expressed? If you're living with someone, you need to be able to communicate. If you're doing something that bothers your living partner, that person has a right to express him or herself. However, how criticism is expressed matters. If the other person is yelling, using foul language, or otherwise being harsh, this is not reasonable.Why is this person criticizing you? Do you think your roommate genuinely wants you to change, or do you think she just enjoys complaining?, One way to cope with highly critical people is to give them feedback. Some people are simply inefficient at communicating with others. They may not understand how to be helpful without coming off as critical or condescending.


A critical person may have valid feedback or advice. However, how they dish out this advice is not always helpful. If you have to deal with a critical person each day, try telling that person what is and is not helpful. Eventually, they may learn how to better communicate with you.For example, say your roommate is lecturing you excessively on how you mop the floor. You've already mopped the floor that day. You know you'll forget this advice the next time the chore needs to be done. Say something like, ""I understand you want me to change how I mop the floor. But next time, can you tell me before I start cleaning? I'm worried I'll forget by this time next week."", It's possible an overly critical person has hurt your feelings. People who are negative and demanding often upset those around them. When expressing your frustration, use ""I""-statements. These are statements designed to highlight personal feelings over blame. You express how something made you feel instead of passing objective judgement on a situation.I statements have three parts. You start with ""I feel"" and state you feeling. After this, you explain the behavior that led to this feeling. Finally, you explain why you feel this way. This helps avoid blame. You are not telling someone they're objectively wrong, but rather emphasizing how their actions affect you.For example, say your boyfriend always criticizes you for taking too long in the shower. Do not say, ""It's really irritating when you get on my case about my shower time. I don't bother you when you're in the bathroom. This is disrespectful."" When you use language like this, even though you may have a valid point, your boyfriend may feel unfairly blamed or judged.Instead, rephrase your feelings using an ""I""-statement. In the above scenario, you could say something like, ""I feel disrespected when you lecture me about how long I shower because I feel like I always respect you privacy when you're in the bathroom."", Even if you feel you're in the right, living with someone means compromise. Look for ways you can meet an overly critical person halfway.


Accept any criticism that is valid. We all have bad habits that can irritate a roommate, family member, or significant other. If there's something you're doing wrong, even something small, make an effort to change.Try to work on letting go of some of your own resentment. Understand where the other person is coming from and, on occasion, give in to his or her demands."
"
Lead by example.,
Maintain your own happiness.,
End the relationship, if necessary.",How to Live with an Overly Critical Person3," One of the best ways you can deal with an overly critical person is to foster your own sense of positivity. Avoid allowing the critical person to make you feel negative. Show him or her how to be a happier, more positive person.If someone is criticizing everything you do, give them the opposite response. This helps show them they cannot drag others into their negativity. If your girlfriend is berating you because she disagrees with your political beliefs, respond with something like, ""Isn't it wonderful we live in a country where we're all entitled to our opinion?""Try to avoid placating a negative person. Many negative people thrive on complaining and may continually go on about their problems. They may refuse to listen to any potential solutions. In cases like this, cut the critical person off. You are not helping them by allowing them to complain endlessly. Say something like, ""I'm not sure what to tell you, but I'm sure you'll find the solution."" Then, offer a smile and back out of the conversation., It's very important you take responsibility for your own happiness. Even if you're living with a negative person, you need to make an effort to enjoy your life. Work on consciously staying happy despite your circumstances.Adopt a more positive attitude about life. This can be difficult, especially if you're met with an onslaught of negativity. However, people are generally happier when they accept their circumstances, good or bad. Try to think to yourself, ""It's difficult to live with this person, but that's life. I'm still me and I can still enjoy myself.""Take time away if you need it. Spend a few hours each day outside the house. Go out with friends on your own on a Saturday night. Surround yourself with positive, happy moments and people. This can help you maintain a level of happiness even while living with an overly critical person., If the criticism is extreme, you may have to question if the relationship is really worth it. This is especially true if this is a romantic relationship. It's hard to feel positive and happy with your partner when each day comes with an onslaught of criticism. If there's no change after you've made an effort to talk things through and compromise, it may be time to move on. Evaluate the relationship and consider whether or not it's important enough to salvage."

Forget vitamins and supplements unless a doctor recommends them. If you eat a variety of foods, including plenty of fruits and vegetables, you'll get the nutrients you need.Get in the habit of eating when you're hungry and stopping when you're full. Pay attention to your food while you eat so that you notice your level of hunger decreasing.
If you think about food all the time, if you eat when you're not hungry, or if you avoid eating at all, you might have an eating disorder. Consult your physician.;
, Drink water, some juices, broth, milk, and other liquids throughout the day. Drink 2.2 to 3 liters, or about eight 8oz glasses of liquid a day.Eating juicy vegetables and fruits will also hydrate you.

Activity that counts as vigorous is when you maintain 70-85% of your maximum heart rate for the entire period of exercise. It's better to exercise more frequently than to get all your working out in one day, so do something daily if you can.


You don't have to join a gym to exercise. You can take brisk walks, go on runs, swim, or join a dance troupe.

, Sleep has everything to do with health. To maintain your immune resistance, your weight, and your mental health, keep a regular sleep schedule.

, Cooking at home is cheaper and healthier than eating out, so teach yourself to cook the things you love, and keep a well-stocked fridge.Shop healthily. Plan out your meals for the week, and go to the grocery store with a list. Start in the produce aisles, and skip the chips and snack aisles.


If your time is limited during the week, try cooking a lot of food at once during the weekends. Stews, grain salads, casseroles and roasts keep well in the fridge.
Cook food you like, or you won't want to eat it.
To guarantee weekly vegetables, order a CSA from a local farm if you can afford one.
In some areas you can use SNAP, or food stamps, at your local farmer's market. They're worth twice as much that way, so check to see if you can., If you have trouble getting to the gym on a regular basis, build more activity into your daily routine. Take up gardening or another active hobby. Get a dog so that you remember to go on walks. Cut your commute and walk part of the way to work, or get in the habit of patronizing nearby businesses so you can walk there and back.


See if you can bike part of your commute instead of walking it.
Take the stairs, not the elevator.

To expand your social contacts, join a religious congregation, activist collective, artistic cooperative or other organization. Get involved in the organization, and stick with it.
Get to know your neighbors. You don't need to make best friends with everyone on your block, but getting to the point where you can have a friendly chat when you see each other is a good idea.
Volunteer to help out people in your life when they are in need, and ask for help when you need it.
If you're single, consider dating. If you're happily coupled, consider moving in with your partner.

Look for neck and back pain.Spondylosis often has no symptoms.,
Recognize stiffness in your neck and back.Stiffness, along with pain, is one of the most common symptoms of spondylosis.,
Look for a lack of coordination.,
Monitor your bathroom habits.",How to Know if You Have Spondylosis1," However, if it does produce symptoms, pain along the neck and spine is one of the most common. This pain is the result of the spinal discs dehydrating and creating friction between the vertebral bones and/or pressure on the nerves. The pain in your back or neck pain may also radiate to your limbs.


Your pain may also get worse when you are sneezing, coughing, or laughing.
Pain is most commonly felt at nighttime.
Neck pain may flare up and then temporarily get better. This intermittent pain might be brought on by aggravation to or intense use of the neck or back. The pain might get worse over time and/or become chronic.
Instead of pain, you might also experience tingling or numbness in your limbs. This is due to the pressure on the nerve roots and symptoms are specific to the area that is being compressed.
If your nerves are being affected, you may also have a burning sensation, pins and needles, or a prickling sensation.;
, You might feel stiff in the morning, especially, then gain more mobility as the day wears on. Your stiffness might make it impossible to bend over or turn your head in certain positions.


You’ll likely have trouble moving your head from side to side.
The stiffness associated with spondylosis occurs due to the slow deterioration of a joint’s cartilage.
Stiffness means that it is difficult for you to move the joint; it seems to ‘stick.’
Neck stiffness associated with spondylosis usually gets worse over time. It usually occurs after a night's rest.
Headache may also occur, usually starting at the back of the neck and radiating to the top of the forehead.

, You might have trouble catching things, lifting your arms or hands, or squeezing something tightly in your hand. This lack of coordination might also result in a lack of balance.Be careful of falling when you have spondylosis. Move slowly and cautiously.

, If you notice any significant changes in your bathroom habits, then this may indicate that there is a problem. Change in bowel or bladder habits, such as being unable to go to the bathroom when you have the sensation or losing control unexpectedly, are warning signs that a part of the spinal cord may be compressed. This is considered an urgent reason for evaluation or re-evaluation."
"
Stay healthy and maintain a healthy weight.Eating right and maintaining a healthy weight are two easy things you can do to reduce your chances of developing spondylosis and minimize the impact of the condition once it has developed.,
Find a less physical job.If you have a job that puts a lot of wear and tear on your back, try to find another line of work that is less physically challenging.,
Manage prior medical conditions.",How to Know if You Have Spondylosis2," Try to get at least one hour of exercise each day.


Do light exercise that does not twist or negatively impact your back, such as gentle yoga. Avoid contact sports like football, hockey, and rugby. You should also avoid lifting heavy weights. Instead, go for run, walk, or bike ride.
Eat a healthy diet composed primarily of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with a small amount of lean protein. Avoid eating meat, fast food, and processed foods, which are heavy in sugar, salt, and fat. Drink at least eight glasses of water each day and avoid soda and sweet drinks.
Do not smoke. Smoking could increase your neck pain.If you already smoke, invest in nicotine patches or gum to reduce your cravings. Cut your cigarette intake down gradually. For instance, smoke half a pack instead of a full pack each day for a couple weeks. Then cut down to one pack every three days for two more weeks. Continue to reduce your cigarette consumption in this way until it reaches zero.

, Bending, twisting, and straining your back can increase your chances of developing spondylosis down the line. If possible, try to find another job with the same company you work for now. For instance, move to a desk job instead of doing unpacking, lifting, and similarly physical work.


Even desk jobs, however, can have their own risks. Sitting all day in one position with your neck craned toward a computer can lead to neck and back pain, too. Ensure your chair provides an adequate amount of back support. Adjust your position frequently to avoid developing cramps and pain in your back and neck. Walk about the office – even just a short distance -- every 30 minutes or so.

, There are a number of medical procedures that can increase your chances for developing spondylosis later. Arthritis, a ruptured or slipped disk, fractures due to osteoporosis could all increase your risk for spondylosis. Talk to your doctor about treatment for these and related conditions, especially those related to neck or back injuries.Follow your treatment plan in order to avoid developing or worsening spondylosis.

Make a list of symptoms.When you begin noticing the symptoms of spondylosis, write them down, including the day, time, length of the symptom, and the activity that brought the symptom about.,
See a doctor.If you have any symptom of spondylosis, it may or may not indicate the actual presence of spondylosis.,
Get a neck compression test.A neck compression test, or Spurling test, can be done to figure out whether or not spondylosis is accompanied by a bulging disc.,
Test for the Hoffman reflex.,
Get a neck x-ray.X-rays are black-and-white images that can reveal neck abnormalities.,
Have an MRI (magnetic resonance image) doneMRIs produce 3D images of your neck and spine.,
Look into getting a CT scan.A computer tomography (CT) scan is a diagnostic procedure that can determine if you have spondylosis.,
Get a myelogram done.A myelogram involves injecting dye into your spinal canal, then waiting a brief period while the dye moves through your spinal column.,
Look into nerve function tests to assess if your nerves are functioning properly.,
Get medication.",How to Know if You Have Spondylosis3," Your doctor can use this information to better understand your medical history and develop a treatment plan for you.


In addition to a list of symptoms, get information about your family’s medical history. Spondylosis may be inherited, so if others in your family have a history of spondylosis or other back troubles, your doctor might use this to make a diagnosis.

, However, even if you do not have spondylosis, it is important to get these conditions checked out by a medical professional, since they could indicate another, equally serious condition.


Many people with spondylosis experience no symptoms at all. It is important to get regular health checkups, especially after the age of 60, when most people show some signs of spondylosis in x-rays and medical examinations.Let your doctor know of any medications you’re taking as well.

, The doctor will ask you to simply extend your neck and laterally flex and rotate it to the side. This will show your doctor if there is bulging in your neck, or what kind of pain response you get when performing this simple movement.

, The Hoffman reflex is a reflex response test. Doctors perform the test to identify a number of illnesses, including multiple sclerosis, spondylosis, and ALS.The Hoffman reflex is tested by pulling your fingers into a tight fist, then flicking the thumb, middle, and index finger.


Your doctor will place your hand at rest and then stabilize it between his index and middle fingers.
Then he will pinch or flick your middle or ring finger, and watch for contraction of your index finger and thumb.
If your reflexes show an incomplete contraction, it may indicate spondylosis.

, A neck x-ray can detect bone spurs, disc injuries, fractures, osteoporosis, and wear on the spine, all of which are indicative of spondylosis.


Neck x-rays can also identify other changes that occur in the spine, and can rule out other conditions that are similar to spondylosis.
This test is done in the hospital’s radiology department by a radiologist.
A neck x-ray can help evaluate neck injuries, numbness and pain.

, In this test, magnetic fields and radio waves produce detailed cross-sectional image of the bone and tissues. An MRI or CT scan is usually indicated if there is no improvement with medications, education, and physical therapy after a number of weeks or if there is a sudden increase in pain or other symptoms.


MRIs can identify areas where nerves may be pinched.
Don't eat for 4 hours before the MRI scan.
Remove metal objects from your body, because MRI scanners produce strong magnetic fields.
An MRI scanner looks like a short cylinder that is open at both ends.
You will enter the scanner either head first or feet first. Sometimes a frame is placed over your body to pick up signals sent out by the body to create a better quality image.
Be sure to be still during the scan to produce a quality image.

, A CT scan uses x-rays from multiple directions in order to produce a cross-sectional view of the neck. These scans are used to better understand the condition of your bones.


Before a CT scan, you must remove all your jewelry and wear a hospital gown.
The CT scan is done while you are lying down on a table which moves back and forth while the camera takes a picture.
It is important that you remain still during the procedure to produce a good picture.

, When combined with a CT scan or x-ray imaging, doctors can track the movement of the dye to better understand the condition of your spine.


Areas where the spine is injured will appear in the myelogram.

, Nerve function tests can help determine if nerve signals are travelling properly to the muscles. There are two nerve function tests that could help diagnose spondylosis:An electromyogram (EMG) is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity of the nerves while transmitting messages to the muscles.
This test is done both when the muscles are contracting and when they are at rest. EMGs can assess the function of the muscles and the nerves.
Another type of nerve function test is the nerve conduction study. This test is done by attaching electrodes to the skin above your nerves. A small amount of electricity is passed through the nerve to measure the strength and speed of nerve signals.

, There are a variety of medications available to help you manage spondylosis. These drugs can help you relieve pain and reduce inflammation in your back and neck.Anti-seizure medications like gabapentin and pregabalin can help reduce your pain.
Corticosteroids like prednisone have also been shown to relieve acute pain, and they are usually given for a short period of time due to the side effects. Oral steroids are typical, but in extreme cases your doctor might recommend injection steroids.
Muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine and methocarbamol might reduce muscle spasms in your back.
Over-the-counter medicine like ibuprofen are also useful for pain management.

Consult an ophthalmologist, preferably one who has eye correction experience.,
Don’t expect the surgery to correct multiple vision problems.,
Understand the risks.,
Be aware of the side effects.,
Don’t make eye surgery your first option.,
Assume you will still need glasses.,
Expect to pay out-of-pocket.",How to Know Whether You Should Get Eye Correction Surgery," Get a thorough eye exam and discuss the results with your doctor. You may not qualify for corrective eye surgery if:


You have glaucoma.
You have macular degeneration.;
, There is no procedure that can correct both nearsightedness and near farsightedness. However, it is possible to have a procedure called monovision where one eye is corrected for one condition and the other eye is corrected for another condition.

, According to the Mayo Clinicthere are some risks involved even though eye surgery is a low-risk procedure. Surgery complications include under correction and over correction. Obviously, over correction (when too much tissue is removed) is harder to fix. Uneven tissue removal can cause astigmatism, which would require additional surgery to correct.

, Like any surgical procedure, there are often side effects. You may or may not experience them, but be sure to ask your doctor what you can expect. Some of the side effects of eye correction surgery are:


Dry eyes
Difficulty with night vision
Incomplete healing of the eyes and risk of infection due to autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency disease.

, The best results for corrective eye surgery are for people who have worn corrective lenses with stable prescription strength for two or more years.

, According to Consumer Reports,more than half of the people who have Lasik eye surgery still have to wear glasses at least some of the time.

, Most insurance policies don’t cover eye correction surgery because it is considered an elective medical procedure. Weigh the cost of the surgery against the cost of replacing eyeglasses or contact lenses during your lifetime. In the end, the surgery may be cheaper.

Look for red and white lesions.,
Pay attention if angular cheilitis begins to form.,
Take note if eating or drinking makes your pain increase.,
Pay attention to how the pain feels.",How to Know if You Have Oral Thrush1," One of the most apparent symptoms of oral thrush is the appearance of red and white lesions on different parts of the mouth. These parts can include your tongue, gums, tonsils or your inner cheek. These lesions create the same sort of pain that you would feel if you had a mouth sore, particularly when you put pressure on them., Angular cheilitis is the drying out and cracking of the corners of your mouth. This is a common side effect of having oral thrush. The corners or your mouth may become cracked and red., For people with oral thrush, eating and drinking may become difficult. When the lesions that grow in your mouth become irritated, or have things like pieces of food scraping up against them, they can begin to bleed and the pain you feel will increase.

, Often, the pain caused by oral thrush can also bring a sensation of itchiness or a burning sensation. However, if you attempt to scratch a lesion, you will only scratch off the surface. While doing this won’t increase the pain, it also won’t make you feel any better."

Note any sharp, burning, or aching pains.,
Pay attention to any numbness.,
Notice if your symptoms are worse at night.,
See a doctor if your pinched nerve symptoms continue.,
Get a physical exam.,
Undergo some tests.,
Know that if you're obese, you're at higher risk.Obesity can predispose people to developing a pinched nerve the excess weight can add pressure to different parts of your body.

,
Be aware that your sex plays a role, too.,
Think about your lifestyle and recent activities.,
Know that rheumatoid arthritis or wrist arthritis also is a factor.If you have rheumatoid arthritis or wrist arthritis, then this also increases your risk of developing a pinched nerve.,
Consider your family history.,
Take bone spurs into account as well.This condition makes your spine hard and lose its flexibility.,
Consider your posture.",How to Know if You Have a Pinched Nerve," Muscle weakness is a common symptom of a pinched nerve.Pay attention to any changes in your strength to determine if you may have a pinched nerve.


For example, if you have a pinched nerve in your wrist, then it may affect the function of your fingers and thumb and reduce your grip strength.;
, This is technically called ""paresthesia.""It's normally described as a pricking or itching sensation on the skin in the affected area. If you notice any tingling sensations, pain, or weakness in the affected area, then you may have a pinched nerve.

, You may notice pain in one area of your body or pain that radiates from one area of your body.For example, if you have a pinched nerve in your neck, then you may notice a sharp pain in this area only or pain that radiates from this area.


Sharp pain in the lower back may radiate down to the buttocks and legs. Conversely, presence of pain in the upper back can radiate through the shoulders and even to your arms. Bending, straining, and lifting will make the pain worse.

, You may feel a tingling sensation in any part of the body that is affected by the pinched nerve.For example, a pinched nerve in your shoulder may lead to numbness in your shoulder or part of your arm.

, Some people with a pinched nerve have irritating sleep disturbances because their pain gets worse during the night.People with pinched nerves have difficulty finding a good sleeping position because no matter how they lie, they experience pain.


Sleeping on the back or sides may put strain and pressure on the spine and neck, compressing the nerves located in that area and as a result, the pinched nerve worsens.

, If you continue to have symptoms of a pinched nerve for a week or longer, or if your symptoms do not respond to things like taking an over-the-counter pain reliever or using a heating pad, then you should see a doctor. Tell your doctor about your symptoms including when they started and what (if anything) seems to help.Tell your doctor about any recent changes in your physical activity levels and any changes you have noticed in your bowel or bladder habits.Be aware that leaving a pinched nerve untreated may lead to other conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome., Your doctor will examine your body for any signs of a problem. Be sure to point out the areas where you have been having symptoms. For example, if you have been having numbness and tingling in part of your leg, then specify the area of your leg where you have these symptoms.Over time, a pinched nerve may cause swelling, pressure, and scarring, so your doctor may be checking for this. Let your doctor know if you have noticed any of these symptoms., Your doctor may not be able to make a diagnosis based on your symptoms and a physical exam alone. You may have to go for some tests to identify the problem. Some tests your doctor may order include:Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Your doctor may order an MRI to get images of the affected region. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radiowaves to generate images of the inside of your body.
Nerve Conduction Study. For this test, a series of electrodes will be placed on your skin to measure the how your nerves respond when a small electrical current passes through them.
Electromyography (EMG). For this test, your doctor will need to insert a needle into the muscles where your symptoms are located to test their reaction and determine if there has been any nerve damage.
X-ray. Although an x-ray will not show your nerves, it may help your doctor to detect any bone degeneration or changes in your bones due to arthritis.,, Women are at greater risk for a pinched nerve because they are more likely to develop a syndrome called carpal tunnel, a condition of numbness and tingling sensation in the thumb, middle and index finger.This doesn't affect the back, but it does wreak havoc on the hands and arms.
When women become pregnant and gain a large amount of weight, they are more like to get a pinched nerve., Pinched nerves may also be the result of performing repetitive or strenuous activities. Think about your hobbies, daily activities, and any recent activities that might have contributed to your pinched nerve.For example, a repetitive activity like knitting or typing may lead to a pinched nerve in your wrist. Likewise, a strenuous physical activity like running may lead to a pinched nerve in your hip or back.

, If you have arthritis, be sure to start treatment now to decrease your chances of developing a pinched nerve.

, If a family member has a history of pinched nerves, then you're at higher risk of getting them. Some people are predisposed to having a pinched nerve because one of their family members or relatives has a history of it. Talk to your family — Does anyone else suffer from having a pinched nerve? Do they know anyone, even distantly related, who does?


If conditions that lead to obesity or arthritis run in your family, you're more likely to get a pinched nerve as a symptom of these health issues., This, in turn, makes the space for your nerves in the spinal cord narrower, eventually causing a pinched nerve in the back.


Bone spurs generally form where bones meet — that is, your joints. But they can form where the bones meet in your spine, too. Technically, they're called osteophytes and they're little bony projections that stick out along the edges of bones.Not great for your nerves at all!

, Poor posture can increase your risk of having a pinched nerve.If you don't sit or stand correctly, your back may get out of alignment and lead to a pinched nerve.


If you think your posture may be your back pain culprit, consider reading How to Improve Your Posture or How to Improve Posture While Sleeping.

Head movements, watching TV for prolonged periods, reading books, focusing on an object for a long time, crowds, darkness and walking often aggravate dizziness. It is due to bizarre signals from the vestibular system of both ears.


The semicircular tubes of vestibule are filled with special type of fluid. Movement of this fluid stimulates nerve tissue within the tubes which provokes a sense of position and balance. Labyrinthitis alters the normal composition of this fluid, leading to abnormal signal production which is interpreted as dizziness.

Dizziness or lightheadedness may be experienced in many other conditions. In anemia, low blood pressure, low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), blood loss or dehydration the prominent symptom will be weakness. You may also faint sometimes.

;
, You may feel that your head is spinning or the world is spinning around you. This is also a symptom of vestibular system inflammation. Head injury, Ménière's disease, stroke, etc. may also cause vertigo but they will have specific patterns and other associated symptoms (which will be discussed later).


Severity of vertigo varies considerably. You may feel mild dizziness and out of balance or the attack may be so severe that you cannot remain upright anymore. It may also be associated with nausea and vomiting. Vertigo in labyrinthitis is most severe in the first week. Thereafter it starts to get better as you learn to cope with the symptoms.

, You may hear constant ringing, buzzing, whistling or humming sounds in the affected ear. It is due to involvement of the cochlea or hearing apparatus. In tinnitus, there is a formation of abnormal particles in the fluid of the internal area that stimulate hair cells (nerve endings that carry sound signal). This unusual stimulation is interpreted as tinnitus.


Conditions that cause vertigo may also cause tinnitus. Additionally, exposure to noisy environment may cause tinnitus. In that case you will usually have no other symptoms.

, It occurs when the cochlear nerve is damaged or blocked by inflammation. You may experience reduced or total loss of hearing. This is a more severe symptom of labyrinthitis that warrants urgent medical attention because the hearing loss may be permanent.


If hearing loss is accompanied by tinnitus, check your external ear for impacted wax. You will fully regain hearing function after removing the wax.

, Discharge of pus or watery fluid indicate bacterial infection of the middle ear (otitis media) that has perforated the tympanic membrane (a partition between external ear and middle ear). You should visit your doctor promptly to control the infection because it may permanently impair your hearing.


Think about if your ears feel heavy. If there is accumulation of pus or fluid in the middle ear, you may feel a heaviness or pressure in the affected ear. It is common in bacterial infections.

, These are actually symptoms of the symptoms. Here's how it works:


Pain in the ear is also a sign of an infective condition. It may be accompanied by tinnitus.
The vertigo or dizziness that accompanies labyrinthitis may lead to nausea and vomiting.
A fever that is above 38°C (100°F) is an indication that you have an infection in your body.
Blurred vision may be the result of a pinched nerve. It may be difficult to read and see things at a distance.

, A few conditions mimic labyrinthitis. In order to treat yourself effectively, it's important to be sure that you have this infection and not something similar. Here are some conditions that mimic labyrinthitis:



Ménières syndrome. It is caused by unusual accumulation of fluid in the inner ear. A typical attack starts with a feeling of fullness in the ear, increasing tinnitus and decreasing hearing followed by severe vertigo, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. An attack usually lasts 20-30 minutes.

Migraines. It is not exactly a problem of the ear. Migraine occurs due to constriction followed by dilatation of blood vessels of the brain. One sided headache is most prominent symptom.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. It occurs due to displacement of crystals from utricle and saccule into semicircular canals. The displaced particles inappropriately stimulate semicircular canals leading to vertigo and dizziness.

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini stroke. If there is vascular insufficiency in hearing or balance related areas of the brain, you may experience dizziness, loss of balance or loss of hearing temporarily. You should feel better in a few minutes and the symptom will not recur.

Brain tumor. Usually you will experience very specific set of symptoms. It will depend on the location of the tumor. However, headache and convulsion are common with any brain tumor. There may be weakness in a specific site of the body.

, Symptoms may last about 1 to 3 weeks. Even though it may be short, it is still best to call your doctor when experiencing these symptoms to avoid a serious complication of permanent hearing loss. There are laboratory tests that can confirm if you have labyrinthitis.

, Viral infection usually affects people of 30-60 years of age. Viruses that cause infections of the mouth, nose, sinuses, airways and lungs are mostly responsible for this illness. In a viral infection, the organisms reach the inner ear via your bloodstream. This type of infection may go away without treatment.


You will often have a history of common cold or flu about one week before the attack. Runny nose, cough, sore throat are symptoms of common cold and flu.
Other viral infections that may cause labyrinthitis less commonly are measles, mumps, herpes and glandular fever.

In measles you will have typical skin rash. There will be swelling of face in front of the ear in mumps. In glandular fever you will have fever, sore throat and nodular swelling in different parts of the body.



, It is less common but more severe. Typically children are the sufferers. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the culprit organisms. This type of infection requires treatment and should be taken more seriously as it could lead to permanent hearing loss.


The infection usually spreads from middle ear or meninges (covering of brain) via the bloodstream or through a gap caused by head injury.

, In some autoimmune diseases, like Wegener’s Granulomatosis or Cogan’s Syndrome, the body’s immune system erroneously attacks self tissues. There is formation of antibodies that attack labyrinth thinking it as foreign tissue.

, Some drugs are particularly toxic for the ears such as gentamicin, ASA, diuretics, anticancer drugs etc. They are highly concentrated in the inner ear causing its damage.


Some medications such as aspirin, anti-seizure medications, diuretics, and antihypertensive can cause a side effect of inflammation and irritation to the inner ears. Some are considered to be as ototoxic (causing toxic reactions to the ears) causing dizziness and vertigo.

, This disorder usually occurs adults with the age between in 30 to 50 years. However, bacterial labyrinthitis is also common in children.


Having an existing medical condition such as mumps, respiratory infection, colds, and cough can make the inner ear and most parts of it to become inflamed brought by the infection you had. Bacterial and viral infection can irritate and spread to other sites causing inflammation and irritation.
Having allergies like hay fever, rhinitis, and cough when present will raise your risk in developing labyrinthitis. It is due to swelling and inflammation of the nasal passage that may result in this infection. Present respiratory irritation can cause infection that spreads to lungs and inner ears.

, This is to avoid dehydration. Constant vertigo can impair your daily life and provoke anxiety. You may become careless about food and fluid intake. Dehydration may concentrate the infected fluid in the inner ear making the condition worse.

, In the first few days you may feel severe dizziness and vertigo. You should take rest during this time to avoid fall and injury. After about a week you should start feeling better.


You should not drive or operate sharp machinery during this time. Sudden aggravation of vertigo may cause accident or severe injury.
You should not watch TV or read books for a long time. This may lead to eye fatigue which in turn interferes with balance.

, These can help you boost your immunity to help you fight against any viral or bacterial infections. Such vitamins are:


Vitamin A: it helps by reducing inflammation in the ear and fights off viral or bacterial infection.
Vitamin C: it is known to be an antioxidant which promotes healing and recovery. It also makes the immune system stronger.
Vitamin B6: it is believed that it prevents or reduces dizziness.
Vitamin E: it also helps the healing process to be faster and also boosts the immune system.

, If you experience vertigo or dizziness while walking or standing, go to bed to take rest. You should find a position that relieves your symptoms. Often you will feel better by lying on your side rather than facing up.


Change positions slowly. Sudden head movement shakes the inner ear fluid that inappropriately stimulates the nerves. If you need to get up from bed, do it slowly. Similarly, lie down slowly from a sitting or standing position.
If you notice symptoms while lying down, try sitting up in a chair.

, They will just make you more uncomfortable. Bright light and absolute darkness both aggravate feelings of imbalance. Use soft light in your room. Similarly, extreme noise will aggravate your tinnitus.


The aim is to give rest to the vestibular and hearing systems. You will gradually be able to cope with the altered function of these systems if there is no external interference.

, Being natural stimulants they make inner ear nerves hyper-excitable. As a result you will experience more exaggerated responses from minor stimuli such as a slight movement.


Alcohol and coffee also cause dehydration which is bad for inner ear health.

, These are a range of movements carried out under supervision of a physiotherapist. VRT retrains your brain to adapt to the abnormal signals arising for the vestibular system. Your brain learns to identify wrong signals and ignore them. It is highly effective particularly in chronic labyrinthitis.


Do the gaze stability exercise. Try moving your head side to side while looking at a stationary object. Your head will move but gaze will remain fixed.
Do habituation exercises. Their purpose is to provoke symptoms deliberately and train your brain to get used to the symptoms. One example is the Brandt-Daroff exercise. You will need to lie down promptly from a sitting position with the head turned to an angle of 45 degrees. Lie still for 30 seconds or until the vertigo goes off. Then sit up again. Repeat the procedure on the opposite side. Do the exercise 3 times a day.

, These are for relief of symptoms, not to cure the infection. Vertigo, dizziness, nausea or vomiting may be severe enough to impair quality of life. Therefore, medication may be necessary. Here are your options:



Antihistamine: this will help in relieving allergic reactions thus minimizing chances of developing into labyrinthitis. You can take diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 25g and 50mg. you can take 25mg twice a day for symptomatic relief.

Anti-emetic: you can take meclizine hydrochloride to prevent or decrease dizziness and vomiting. It is effective for vertigo. It is available in 25mg and 50mg. this can be taken with or without food. Do not exceed 2 tablets within 24 hours.

Steroids: this medication is for inflammation. It is an anti-inflammatory that helps in decreasing inflammation to the affected areas. Prednisone is the drug of choice. It is available in 20mg. You can take it 3 times a day with 6-8hours interval.

Antibiotic: this is prescribed when the cause of your labyrinthitis is bacterial infection. It should be treated right away to prevent permanent hearing loss. Your doctor will be the one to prescribe the appropriate antibiotic for your condition

Antiviral: this is used to treat variety of infections caused by a virus. Acyclovir 400mg or 800mg can be the drug of choice. However, your doctor will prescribed the right dose intended for you.

Schedule regular eye examines.,
Notice any blind spots.,
Pay attention to a loss of peripheral vision.",How to Know if You Have Glaucoma1," Open-angle glaucoma leads to the gradual deterioration of your vision over an extended period of time, usually years. Most people suffering from open-angle fail to notice symptoms until the glaucoma is very advanced and nerve damage has occurred.Because open-angle develops so slowly and stealthily, it is important to schedule eye examines every year, especially if you are over the age of 40 or have a family history or glaucoma.
Open-angle is the most common type of glaucoma in the United States, affecting roughly 4 million people.
Realize that nerve damage is permanent. If you suffer from open-angle glaucoma, there is unfortunately no cure and, once symptoms have presented, significant nerve damage has occurred. Although your doctor may be able to slow the deterioration, the damage done to your vision is largely irreversible.;
, As your nerves become increasingly more damaged, blind spots will develop in your field of vision. Blind spots are exactly what they sound like, areas in your vision where you are unable to see things. Eventually, the nerve damage becomes so severe that you lose your vision entirely.If you notice any blind spots, talk to your doctor immediately.

, With open-angle glaucoma, you will eventually notice a loss of peripheral or side vision. Objectives at the edges of your vision will become increasingly less clear and more difficult to define. As the glaucoma worsens, your vision will narrow and you will only be able to see things directly in front of you.The resulting loss of vision will come to resemble tunnel vision.

Be alert if you have difficulty swallowing.,
Take note if you regurgitate food.,
Know that you may experience some of the same symptoms as people with sliding hernias.,
Pay attention to any acute chest pain you may feel.,
Take note if you constantly feel bloated.",How to Know if You Have a Hiatal Hernia1," The stomach is a very acidic environment (pH of 2) because it must mix and break down food while fighting off harmful bacteria and viruses. Unfortunately, the esophagus or food tube is not built to handle acidic material. When the hernia causes backflow of food from the stomach into the food tube, a burning sensation in the food tube occurs. The close location of the food tube to the heart makes a person feel the burn in their chest area near the heart; hence, the name heartburn., The food pipe becomes filled with food from the stomach when heartburn is present; therefore, food from the mouth cannot be swallowed and accommodated easily. If you suddenly find that you cannot easily swallow food or water, contact a doctor.

, Sometimes, the acidic contents of your stomach reach the top of the esophagus after a major heartburn and leave a bitter taste. Regurgitation can be described as throwing up in the mouth and could be a sign that you have a sliding hernia., A paraesophageal hernia squeezes itself into the hiatus while the part of the stomach remains in its normal position, effectively acting like two people trying to fit through a narrow door simultaneously. This causes compression and gives more symptoms. Heartburn, difficulty with swallowing, and regurgitation are common.

, When the hernia and the part of the stomach that is in its normal position become too compressed, the blood flow to the stomach is severely cut-off. This leads to a poor blood supply and potential death of a part of the stomach. The drop in blood flow triggers an acute, crushing, heavy chest pain similar to a heart attack. This symptom warrants immediate medical attention and physician consultation is strongly advised.

, A person with a paraesophageal hernia feels full when he or she starts to eat because the stomach cannot clear the contents right away. This can cause a lack of important nutrients because your stomach is not properly processing food.

Call a doctor if you have trouble swallowing.,
Watch out for fevers.",How to Know if You Have Oral Thrush2," If oral thrush goes untreated, the lesions can actually spread to the back of your mouth and down your throat, towards your esophagus. If they are able to spread this far, you will feel a severe pain when you try to swallow anything, even water.It may also feel like food is getting stuck in your throat each time you swallow.

, In people with severely compromised immune systems, including those with HIV or cancer (especially if they are taking chemotherapy), the Candida yeast that causes thrush may spread from the mouth to the skin, or into the bloodstream and into other organs. In this case, a high fever will likely develop (unless the immune system is completely absent) and the patient will appear severely ill, will be unable to get out of bed and with pale, and will have clammy skin."

Know what causes oral thrush.,
Know that brushing your teeth can prevent oral thrush.,
Note that taking too many antibiotics can actually promote oral thrush.,
Know who is most at risk for getting oral thrush.",How to Know if You Have Oral Thrush3," Your mouth normally contains a small amount of candida bacteria. The amount of bacteria is kept in check by the presence of other non-harmful bacterial. However, an imbalance can occur, causing an increased number of yeast cells to grow inside your mouth. When the yeast cells grow, you are more susceptible to oral thrush., Brushing your teeth two or three times a day and flossing at least once a day are both very important activities. Good oral hygiene is essential when trying to prevent or fight off oral thrush. If you have poor oral health, your mouth can become an excellent place for fungi to grow.

, Antibiotics kill off bad bacteria. However, sometimes, they can also kill off too much good bacteria, which in turn can throw off the balance between good bacteria and candida, causing oral thrush to occur.

, Anyone can get thrush, but it’s more common in certain populations. Babies and toddlers are more likely to get thrush, because their immune systems are not yet fully developed. The elderly are also more likely as their immune systems decline. Pregnant women have an increased risk, because the immune system is mildly suppressed during pregnancy.People with diabetes are more likely to get thrush, especially if the diabetes is poorly controlled; this is because the extra sugar in the bloodstream feeds the yeast.
People with an extremely suppressed immune system, such as those with HIV or cancer, or who are taking chemotherapy or high-dose steroids are more likely to get oral thrush.
Alcohol also suppresses the immune system, and so those who drink a lot of alcohol are more susceptible to getting thrush.

Pay attention to eye pain and headache.,
Report a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes.",How to Know if You Have Glaucoma2," The sudden onset of hazy or blurred vision may be a symptom of acute angle-closure glaucoma. You will notice a general fuzziness in your vision and a general lack of clarity in the things you see.This may also be normal eye deterioration, myopia or hyperopia. Be sure to visit your doctor if your vision quickly changes.

, If you are suffering from acute angle-closure glaucoma, you may rapidly become ill and vomit. This is a result of the increased pressure in your eyes causing dizziness, resulting in nausea.If you begin experiencing persistent nausea and vomiting, be sure to visit your doctor.

, You may notice vibrant halo or rainbow-like circles that appear around sources of light. These are due to increased pressure in your eye distorting your vision and may occur suddenly.These symptoms may appear if lights are dimmed or if it is dark.

, Eye redness is very common and happens when blood vessels swell inside the eye, making the sclera, or the white part of the eye, turn red. However, if you are suffering from glaucoma, the blood vessels may be swollen because of increased pressure in the eyes.If you notice redness accompanied by any of the other symptoms, visit your doctor immediately.

, In the early stages of acute angle-closure glaucoma, you may experience a general discomfort or soreness in your eye. If untreated, the increased pressure in your eye will result in severe pain and possibly an intense headache.If you have intense eye and head pain, accompanied by any other symptoms, visit your doctor immediately.

, In the advanced stages of acute angle-closure glaucoma, you may experience sudden vision loss. This is the result of sever nerve damage due to increased eye pressure.If you lose vision, visit a doctor immediately.

Realize that poor vision might cause glaucoma.,
Know that steroid or cortisone use might cause the disease.,
Understand that eye injury or surgery increases your risk.",How to Know if You Have Glaucoma3," Unfortunately, glaucoma, particularly open-angle, is likely genetic. You are more likely to have the disease if someone in your family is suffering from it. However, that does not mean that you are guaranteed to develop it.If you have a family history of glaucoma, be sure to see an eye specialist regularly to monitor for the disease. Even if glaucoma is inevitable, you can slow its progress.

, Those over the age of 50 have a greater risk of developing glaucoma. As you get older, your body is less capable of regulating normal functions, like maintaining proper eyeball pressure. If you are over the age of 40, be sure to receive regular eye exams and get checked for glaucoma.

, In the United States, glaucoma is about five times more common for African Americans than for other ethnic groups. Although it is unclear why the African American community has higher rates of glaucoma, there is some evidence pointing to genetic factors. Environmental factors, such as diet and access to health care, may also play an important role.African Americans over 40 years old have a greater risk of getting glaucoma, and African American women are more likely to have the disease than men., A recent study found that those with diabetes had a 35 percent increase risk of developing glaucoma. This is due, in part, to the fact that diabetes damages the blood vessels in the retina, leading to irreparable nerve damage.If you have diabetes, be sure to let your optometrist know so that they can monitor your eyes for increased pressure or possible nerve damage.

, Myopia, or nearsightedness, and hyperopia, or farsightedness, can both be indicators for glaucoma. This may be due to the shape of the eye and its ability to drain properly., Those who use regularly and consistently use certain topical ocular (eye drops) and dermatological (creams) steroids over a long time may be more likely to develop glaucoma. If used regularly over an extended period, steroid eye drops can cause increased pressure inside the eye.If you are prescribed any of these steroids, be sure to use them as recommended and receive regular eye checks.

, Previous injuries or surgeries involving the eye can cause nerve damage and impact fluid drainage. Examples of eye problems are retinal detachment, eye inflammations and eye tumors. Complications from eye surgery can also lead to glaucoma.Because of this, be careful with your eyes! Always wear protective gear when necessary and follow doctor's orders when it comes to pre- and post-surgery protocol.

Know the different kinds of hiatal hernias.,
Consider your age.,
Consider your gender.,
Consider your weight.",How to Know if You Have a Hiatal Hernia2," There are two kinds of hiatal hernia – sliding and paraesophageal (which literally translates to next to the esophagus).


Sliding hiatal hernia is the most common form. This occurs when your stomach and a portion of your esophagus merge or join together and slide up through your chest via the hiatus.
You should be more alarmed and concerned if you develop paraesophageal hiatal hernia. In this instance, your stomach and esophagus will stay in place but a portion of your stomach squeezes next to your esophagus causing strangulation and in worst cases poor blood circulation.

, People who are 60 years old or older have a 60% chance of developing paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Those who are 48 years old and above are at risk of developing a sliding hernia. As you age, your muscles tend to lose their elasticity, putting you at risk of developing a hernia because your muscles are not holding your internal organs in their proper places.

, Women are more prone to getting hiatal hernias because of certain physical changes that occurs in their bodies, particularly if they gain a considerable amount of weight when they are pregnant. Their growing baby can actual cause the out pouching of the diaphragm, resulting in a hiatal hernia.


A woman is more at risk if her growing baby is very heavy (3 kilos over the usual weight is cause for concern) or if she develops gestational diabetes while she is pregnant.

, Obese people have a higher amount of visceral fat (fat inside the abdominal cavity that sticks to the digestive system organs). This increases the amount of pressure within the abdominal cavity and can cause a hernia to occur.

See if you've had more than one drink per hour.,
Use an online calculator.,
Know what it means to be legally drunk.,
Use a breathalyzer.",How to Know if You Are Drunk1," Every country, and sometimes even every state, has a slightly different limit for what it means to be legally drunk. Everyone is different, but as a rough rule of thumb, your body can process (metabolize) one drink per hour. If you've had more than one drink per hour, then -- you guessed it -- you are drunk. Legally, anyway. Even if you don't feel drunk, don't even think about driving a car even if you feel perfectly fine or going to work or caring for a child, or, editing wikiHow or doing anything else you need to have full control of your faculties for.


""One drink"" means one standard glass of wine, one shot of vodka, or 12 ounces of beer or the equivalent of in other alcoholic beverages. A sherry, a pint of cider, a Bacardi, a larger etc.;
, Do you have a computer or phone handy? If you want to find out if you're legally drunk right now, check out a helpful Blood Alcohol Content (B.A.C.) calculator. One of the most well-respected ones comes from the University of Oklahoma.But if you're not living in the United States, then you should check out an online calculator from your country.


Online calculators also take a significant factor into account: your weight. The bigger you are, the more slowly you'll get drunk. So, a 100 lb. girl drinking two beers will get a lot more drunk than a 200 lb. guy drinking the same two beers.
The calculators may also offer more than just the option of the standard meaning of ""one drink,"" and give you more variables so you can see exactly how much you really consumed.

, Drunk is normally defined as having a B.A.C. of .05-.10. In some countries, like Russia, you are not allowed to drive if there is any alcohol in your body at all.


That is a percent, so if your blood is more than 0.1% you are probably legally drunk.
A good assumption is about .08, but look at your local laws.

, Breathalyzers are small devices that you can breathe into to calculate your B.A.C. Though you may not have one handy currently, you can get one at most pharmacies or order it online -- hopefully you don't encounter one in the hands of a police officer. Stocking your car or home with a breathalyzer is a great idea because it can let you know if you -- or your guests -- are legally able to drive.


Don't take a big swig of alcohol before testing your B.A.C. Even if you're just having fun, it will give you a higher reading than normal.

These may be chronic conditions, or they may pass with time — for example, if you have a bad cough. Risk factors for hernias include:Increased abdominal pressure
Coughing
Heavy lifting
Constipation
Pregnancy
Obesity
Advancing age
Smoking
Steroid use;
, A hernia is an imperfection in the muscular container of an organ. Because of this imperfection, the organ is pushed through an opening, resulting in a hernia. As the organ comes through the opening, it will create a swollen area or bulge in the skin. A hernia often gets bigger when you are standing or when you are straining. The site of the swollen area may vary depending on what kind hernia you have. The terms for different hernia types refer either to the location or the cause of the hernia.Inguinal - These are hernias occurring in the inguinal region (between the hip bone and crotch) or groin.
Umbilical - Occur around the belly button
Femoral - Occur along the inner thighs
Incisional - Occur when incisions from prior surgeries create weak points in an organ's muscular container
Diaphragmatic or hiatal - Occur when there's a congenital defect in the diaphragm

, If the hernia affects your intestine, it can change or even block the flow of food through your digestive system. This can cause an intestinal back-up that results in nausea and vomiting.If the intestine is not completely blocked, you may just see milder symptoms, like nausea without vomiting or decreased appetite.

, You may experience constipation if you suffer from an inguinal or femoral hernia low in the body. Constipation is, in essence, the exact opposite of vomiting. When the flow of feces is blocked, you may experience constipation -- instead of it all coming out, it stays in. Needless to say, this symptom necessitates immediate surgical intervention.


Hernias can be very serious when they interfere with the functions your body needs in order to survive. If you are experiencing any constipation, see your doctor immediately.

, Many people with hernias don’t have any complaints of pain or severe or significant noticeable symptoms. But, they may have a feeling of heaviness or fullness in the affected area, especially in the abdomen. You might chalk this up to complaints of bloating. If nothing else, you'll feel keenly aware of your abdominal area, whether it's feeling full, weak, or just has a mysterious pressure. You can relieve the ""bloating"" from hernias by resting in a reclined position., Though it's not always present, pain is a sign of hernia — especially if there are complications. Inflammation can cause a burning sensation or sharp pain. Pressure build-up can result in a tearing pain that suggests the hernia is directly touching the muscle walls. Here's how pain affects hernias in different stages:


Irreducible hernia: the hernia cannot return to a normal state, but instead gets larger; you may feel occasional pain.Strangulated hernia: the bulging organ is losing its blood supply, and could be dead soon without medical attention. You'll feel significant pain in this case, along with nausea, vomiting, fever, trouble moving your bowels. This condition requires emergency surgery.
Hiatal hernia: the stomach bulges out of its cavity, causing chest pains. This also affects the flow of food, causing acid reflux and making it hard to swallow.
Untreated hernia: hernias are usually painless and symptomless, but if left untreated, may cause pain and other health problems.

, All hernias have the potential to become dangerous. If you suspect you have one, you need to see a doctor for evaluation as soon as possible. He or she will determine whether you actually have one, and also discuss its severity and your treatment options.


If you know you have a hernia and feel sudden throbbing or pain in the area, go to the emergency room immediately. The hernia could become ""strangulated"" and cut off blood supply, which is highly dangerous.

, According to studies, even if a hernia that is present at birth — which is common in newborn babies — most of them are in male babies. The same is true throughout adult life! Men's greater risk can be explained through a hernia's connection to having undescended testicles. This is because a man’s testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly before birth. A male's inguinal canal — which holds the chords that connect with the testicles — usually closes after birth. In some cases, though, it does not close properly, making hernias more likely.

, Some hereditary disorders affect connective tissues and muscles, and leave you vulnerable to hernia. Keep in mind that this genetic likelihood only applies to hereditary defects. In general, there's no known genetic pattern for hernias.


If you have a history of hernias yourself, you're at higher risk of having another one in the future.

, Cystic fibrosis (a life-threatening lung condition) fills the lungs with thick mucus plugs. Patients with this condition develop a chronic cough as the body attempts to clear away the mucus plugs. This increased pressure from coughing is a risk factor of having hernias. This kind of cough puts so much pressure and force on your lungs that it damages the muscle walls. Patients feel pain and discomfort when coughing.


Smokers are also at high risk for developing a chronic cough, and are also more likely to develop hernias.

, Constipation forces you to strain your abdominal muscles when moving your bowels. If you have weak abdominal muscles and are constantly forcing pressure against them, you're more likely to develop a hernia.


Weak muscles are caused by poor diet, lack of exercise, and old age.
Straining when urinating can also put you at risk of having a hernia., Growing a baby in your uterus creates a lot of increased pressure inside your abdomen. You're also increasing your abdominal weight, which is a factor of developing hernias.Premature babies are also at risk of hernias because their muscles and tissues have not yet fully developed and strengthened.Genital defects in babies can stress the areas most likely to develop hernias. These include abnormal position of the urethra, fluid in the testicles, and ambiguous genitalia (the baby has genital characteristics of each sex)., Obese or overweight people are more likely to develop hernias. Just like with pregnant women, a larger belly increases abdominal pressure, which can affect weak muscles.If you're overweight, it's advisable to start a weight loss plan now.


Beware that large, sudden weight loss from crash dieting weakens the muscles and causes hernias, too.If you lose weight, lose it healthily and gradually.

, You are at risk of herniation if your job demands long stretches of standing and a lot of physical strength. Some people vulnerable to work-induced hernias include construction workers, salesmen and women, carpenters, etc. If this describes your current job, talk to your employer. You may be able to arrange a different situation that's less conducive to hernias.

, During a physical examination for a hernia, the doctor should always have you stand up. While the he or she gently probes the swollen area, you'll be asked to cough, strain, or perform a movement to the best of your ability. The doctor will evaluate the flexibility and movement in the area where a hernia is suspected.After assessment, he or she will be able to diagnose whether you have one, and what type of hernia you may have.

, In men, this canal holds chords that connect to the testicles, and hernias are usually caused by a natural weakness in the canal. In women, the canal holds ligaments that keep the uterus in place. There are two types of inguinal hernia: direct and, more commonly, indirect.


Direct inguinal hernia: Place your finger on the inguinal canal — the crease along the pelvis where it meets the legs. You will feel a bulge that pops out toward the front of the body, and coughing will make the larger.
Indirect inguinal hernia: When you touch the inguinal canal, you will feel a bulge going from outside towards the center of your body (lateral to medial). This bulge may also move down towards the scrotum.

, Hiatal hernias happen when the upper part of your stomach pushes through the opening of the diaphragm, and into the chest. This type of hernia usually happens in people over 50 years old, though. If a child has a hiatal hernia, it's likely because of a birth defect.The diaphragm is a thin sheet of muscle that helps you breathe. It's also the muscle responsible for separating the organs in the abdomen and in the chest.
This kind of hernia causes burning sensations in the stomach, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing

, Though they can occur later in life, umbilical hernias commonly occur in newborns or babies less than 6 months old. They happen when intestines push out in the abdominal wall near the belly button or the navel. The bulge is especially noticeable when the child is crying.


With umbilical hernias, you will see a bulge at the ""umbilicus,"" or belly button.
Umbilical hernias usually go away on their own. But, if it lasts until the child is 5 to 6 years old, is very large or is causing symptoms, the hernia may need surgery.Take note of the size; small umbilical hernias, around half an inch (1.25cm), can go away on their own. Large umbilical hernias require surgery., The incisions (cuts) performed during surgery take time to heal and scar over properly. It also takes time for the surrounding muscles to regain their strength. If organ tissue pushes out through the incision scar before it's healed, an incisional hernia occurs. It's most common in elderly and overweight patients.


Place gentle but firm pressure near the surgical site with your fingers. You should feel a bulge somewhere in the area.

, While femoral hernias can happen to both men and women, the vast majority of cases occur in women because of their wider pelvic shape. In the pelvis, there's a canal that carries arteries, veins and nerves into the upper-inner thigh. This canal is normally a tight space, but it often becomes larger if the woman is pregnant or obese.When it stretches out, it becomes weak, and thus vulnerable to potential hernias., In the case of an incarcerated hernia, the doctor may first try to physically push the hernia back into its original position. This can reduce the acute inflammation and swelling and provide more time to allow for an elective surgical repair. Strangulated hernias need immediate surgery to avoid tissue cell death and organ tissue puncture.

, Even if the hernia is not terribly dangerous, your doctor may recommend elective surgery to repair it before it progresses to a more dangerous state. Studies have shown that preemptive elective surgery lower morbidity and mortality significantly., Depending on the type of hernia and the individual patient, there's a wide range in the likelihood of a hernia recurring.Groin (pediatric): These hernias have a low recurrence rate of <3% after surgical treatment. They can sometimes heal spontaneously on their own in infants.
Groin (adult): Depending on the experience level of the surgeon operating on this hernia, the recurrence rate after surgery can be anywhere from 0-10%.
Incisional: About 3%-5% of patients will have a hernia recurrence after their first surgery. If the incisional hernias are larger, patients may see rates of up to 20%-60%.
Umbilical (pediatric): These types of hernias can usually resolve on their own spontaneously.
Umbilical (adult): There is a higher recurrence of umbilical hernias in adults. Usually, a patient can expect up to 11% recurrence rate after surgery.

Do the ""touch the nose"" test.,
Try the ""walk a straight line"" test.,
Try the ""one legged stand"" test.",How to Know if You Are Drunk2," ""Field Sobriety Tests"" are tests that law enforcement uses to see if a suspect is drunk. They can be useful in figuring out whether or not you're drunk because they tend to be pretty accurate. NHTSA has determined that sober people can pass these tests in almost all cases, while about 80% of the people that are over the level of legal drunkenness in the USA (.08%) will fail. The ""touch the nose"" test is one of the easiest tests to try. Here is what you have to do:


Close your eyes and extend your arm all the way out.
Try to touch the end of your nose with your forefinger, while keeping your elbow extended straight out. If your elbow drops to your side, it doesn't count.
If you miss your nose, you are probably drunk.

, This tests sees if you can walk on a straight line, turn, and walk back. Here is what you have to do:


Find a straight line on the ground.
Walk six steps forward on the line, heel to toe. Then, turn on the heel, and walk six steps back.
You fail if you use your arms for balance, fall off the line, are unable to follow instructions, can't walk heel to toe.

, This test sees if you can stand with one leg slightly off the ground for 30 seconds. Here is what you should do:


Lift your leg about 6 inches (15cm) off of the ground.
Hold it there for about 30 seconds.
You fail if you do two or more of the following: swaying, putting the foot down, hopping, or using your arms to balance.

See if you suddenly think you're Superman.,
See if you're busting out the wild dance moves.,
See if you start telling a stranger your most intimate personal details.,
See if you start confessing your love to your crush.,
See if you start sending incoherent text messages.,
See if you're highly emotional for no reason.,
See if you lose all coordination.,
See if the people around you seem confused by you.,
See if you remember nothing the next day.,
See if you're acting completely out of character.",How to Know if You Are Drunk3," If you're drunk, then you may start thinking of that nearly-empty bottle of malt liquor in front of you as invincibility juice. Have you started to feel wildly empowered, ready to do anything, and capable of complicated physical tasks? Have you tried to pick up a person heavier than you are, to walk on your hands, or to climb the side of a building? Engaged in an arm-wrestling contest with an ogre? Tried to lift eight boxes filled with lead? If so, you are drunk, drunk, drunk.

, If you're normally a dancer, great. But if you're more of a wallflower and are suddenly doing ""The Macarena"" with your Aunt Gerta at her retirement party, or trying to break dance to some hip hop while falling all over the floor, then you may have had a bit much to drink. It's okay to drink to get a bit more dancing fuel, but if you find yourself trying out moves you would never dream of on a cold sober night, then you are drunk.

, Maybe you just met a friend of a friend, have become acquainted with your cousin's new girlfriend, or were just introduced to the guy who works on the 3rd floor at your annual Christmas party. Okay, so far, so good. But have you found yourself talking about how you think you have genital warts? Your inability to cope with the death of Pooh-Pooh, your pet gerbil? How you have a fear of intimacy that goes back to walking in on your parents doing the deed when you were in third grade? If you find yourself revealing these intimate details to anyone who will (or tries not to) listen, then you guessed it--you're drunk.

, You've opened a bottle of wine or your second box of Franzia and see your crush walk in across the room. And suddenly, you're in front of him, talking about how cute he looks, how much you like him, and then--gasp--you're suddenly leaning in for a kiss...only to land face-first on the floor. If you find yourself revealing this intimate information to the person you like while knowing that you would never dream of doing so in the light of day, then you are drunk, my friend.

, Check out your phone log from the last hour. As soon as you notice that it's nearly impossible to type or to get a coherent word out, it's time to put away that texting machine and to chug some water.

, Are you suddenly crying just because of your friend's Halloween screening of Hocus Pocus? Are you weeping into your dinner because your friend wished you a happy birthday? Are you inconsolable because your crush didn't show up to the party? If you're not normally a high drama person but are suddenly upset or touched by every little thing that happens, then you are drunk.


You know that warm, fuzzy feeling that makes you feel like everyone around you loves you and that the world is all right? Yep, that's alcohol.

, Having a hard time opening the bathroom door? Unzipping your own pants? Dipping a pita chip into a giant bowl of hummus? If so, then you are losing your coordination because you have had a bit too much to drink. If walking from one end of the room to the other is suddenly a grueling task, then your body has been inhibited by alcohol.

, Do you think you're in the middle of a winning story about how you won the spelling bee when you were in the 4th grade or about your life-changing volunteering trip to Costa Rica...only to find that the people around you are squinting up at you, scratching their heads, and looking generally confused by everything you're saying?


If people keep asking you to repeat yourself or say, ""What are you talking about?"" or even, ""Do I know you?"" then you are definitely drunk.

, If you don't remember what happened the night before, then you were blackout drunk. If you remember a few things, then you can think of yourself as being brownout. Either way, not so good, my friend. Not remembering what you did because you had too much to drink is scary, dangerous, and not a good way to live.

, If you're normally shy and are suddenly the life of the party, or if you're normally gregarious but are sitting near the radio, thinking about the meaning of life and swaying to ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" then you are not acting like yourself. If you think of what you've been doing during alcohol time and realize that you were acting like another person completely, or even like a more bold, loud, dramatic person, then you were probably drunk.

Know when you are dangerously drunk.,
Consider buying an ""ignition interlock"" for your car if you're afraid you'll drink and drive.,
Know if you're an alcoholic.",How to Know if You Are Drunk4," If you are dangerously drunk, then chances are, you won't remember it, or you will be so out of it that you won't consider your own level of intoxication. If you are dangerously drunk, then the other people around you will hopefully be able to tell. Symptoms include stumbling around and falling, vomiting without stopping, having the room spin ridiculously fast, and generally looking vacant and not like yourself at all.


This is no joke. There is no magical B.A.C. number that says you are a danger. But at a high level of drunkenness you become ever more of a danger to yourself and others.
People with a BAC over .19 make up 41% of traffic deaths.At a BAC of .3, side effects of drinking can include death. At .5%, most people will die. So don't drink too much even if you are at home.

, These prevent you from driving if you are drunk, automatically. Though the interlock is typically placed in the cars of people who have had more than one D.U.I., you can take this preventative measure to help yourself stay out of trouble in advance.

, This means more than just throwing a few drinks back with your friends every once in a while. It means drinking to a level of not remembering a thing that happens, drinking by yourself frequently, and generally being dependent on alcohol. Alcoholism means different things to different people, but if you think you have a troubled relationship with alcohol, then you should get help.

If you need to keep your knees strong or have body aches and pains then cycling is the best solution.Come up with a daily walking, jogging or cycling routine that fits with your schedule (i.e. go for a jog everyday at 6:00 p.m.). After a while you can increase your distance, speed and eventually time.
Go out of your way to walk more. For example, if you go to the grocery store try to park in the farthest spot from the entrance so you are forced to walk those extra steps to get there.
Walk or bike to work/school. If you live close enough to work or school a good solution would be to start walking or cycling.
If you jog you should jog at least a kilometer to keep the fat off, but it is very important to pace yourself.;
, Not everyone has the time or money to go to the gym and there is no need to. Working out at home is very easy and can be very beneficial. Some at-home exercises include:



Push-ups. Use your weight against the floor or wall to work on your upper body strength.

Sit-ups. Sit-ups can be done by simply laying on the ground or, with a more advanced technique, with a chair or exercise ball.

Yoga. Yoga practices such as downward facing dog or sun salutations are easily done on the carpeted ground or on a yoga mat.

, If you like the gym atmosphere and can afford the membership then the gym is a great place to stay fit.


Utilize the machines for cardio and weights, but be careful and never use a weight that is too heavy. Use smaller weights and you will find that you will progress through the weights very rapidly.
Learn strength training and muscle toning techniques from an instructor or professional.

, If you are not a fan of the gym or practicing random exercises then joining a local sports team may be a great solution to get outside, move around and have some fun! Many cities have their own recreational sports teams that meet and play on certain days.


The most popular city sports are: Dodgeball, kickball, softball, basketball and ultimate frisbee.

, It is one of the most important components of a fit lifestyle. Many people ignore it, but if you exercise and eat a lot of junk food you will not get any fitter. This is because the junk food turns to fat almost immediately. Junk foods contain little to no nutrition and are high in sodium and sugar. Because of this, your body sugar levels drop after consumption and you end up feeling fatigued with a major lack of energy.Foods to avoid are:


High in sugar: Donuts, cakes, cookies, pudding, cereals, canned and dried fruits, and sodas.
High in fat: Processed meats, butter, hydrogenated oil (coconut and palm kernel), shortening, cheese and animal fats. (Please note: although cheese is high in fat, it is also high in protein which is a great nutrient for the body. Aged and less processed cheeses are the best solution)High in cholesterol: Egg yolk, fried foods and mayonnaise.
Avoid anything containing: High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and Monosodium glutamate (MSG).

, Maintaining a balanced diet can be difficult to do if you do not have the time to cook for yourself every day. But, it is easy to find healthy solutions in restaurants and take-outs as well. You will find that maintaining a healthy and balanced diet can increase energy and productivity, boost your metabolism and make you a happier person because you will be consuming the nutrients and vitamins your body needs.Foods to eat are:


Fresh fruits and vegetables: Melons, bananas, apples, oranges, carrots, onions, broccoli and corn, etc. (Please note: These fruits and veggies should be fresh, not canned. You can sauté vegetables in extra virgin olive oil for better taste). If you make a salad, the more colorful the better!
Organic meats: Fish, poultry and beef for protein. Instead of frying the meats, try to bake them with extra virgin olive oil or lemon juice with herbs.
Grains: Whole wheat toast, oatmeal and pastas.
Foods high in protein: Tofu, soy beans, egg whites, nuts, cottage cheese and quinoa.
Foods high in fiber: Cooked lentils, black beans, green peas, pears, raspberries and oat bran., Simple carbohydrates are carbohydrates made of one or two molecules of sugar that have very little nutritional value. Complex carbohydrates are made from a string of sugars but are very rich in fibers and contain healthy vitamins and minerals.Examples of simple carbohydrates: Sugars, syrups, jams and candy.
Examples of complex carbohydrates: Whole grain foods and vegetables.

, It is really important to avoid skipping meals. A lot of people might think that you will lose weight by skipping a meal but that is very inaccurate. In fact, skipping meals decreases the speed of your metabolism and can result in losing nutrition your body needs.Here are some examples of healthy meals and snacks and when to eat them:


Light breakfast: Egg whites (you can mix egg whites with some veggies like onions or mushrooms, etc.) with a grapefruit and a piece of toast.
Mid morning snack: Yogurt with some berries.
Lunch: A salad (be careful of the dressing!) with a protein (i.e. grilled chicken or turkey).
Afternoon snack: Apple, orange or a banana with some almonds and a spoonful of peanut butter.
Dinner: Lemon baked salmon with brown rice and asparagus.

, The human body is made of about 50-65% of water, and you need to keep replenishing it. Your body sweats a lot of that water so you need to put it back in.


The amount of water you should drink relies on how much you weigh. To calculate how much water you should be drinking, take your weight and multiply it by 67% (2/3). So, for instance, if you weight 130 lbs. you should be drinking about 87 ounces of water per day.If you are exercising you will need to increase your amount of water intake to replenish what you are sweating out.

, You know you can do it. You are the only one that can control your actions and strong willpower can make you happy!


Stick to a daily or every other day plan. If you have a routine that you follow it is much easier to stick to than just assuming you will get to exercising or you will get to eating a healthy meal.

, If you are at the gym and are using small weights, don't let the person next you using giant weights intimidate you. Just know that you are working at your pace and that it is just perfect for you. If you continue with your regimen you can achieve whatever goal you have set.

, It can be very helpful if you have someone keeping healthy and fit with you. Their extra push of motivation can be very inspiring and it is a great way to bond.


Good people to ask are family members, co-workers or classmates, neighbors (if you have a good relationship with them already) or local friends.

, Set goals for yourself and when you have reached those goals you earn a reward.


For example: If you have kept up with your routine and healthy eating and you accomplished your goal for the week by jogging for 30 minutes instead of 20, then that Friday night you should treat yourself to a small amount of your favorite snack.

, Do not care what other people think. If you are determined and believe that you can achieve your goal of staying fit then you can! Know that feeling when you feel great and strive to reach that goal everyday.


Motivate yourself by wanting to continue on this path of fitness and health. You want to feel good, you want to look good, you want to be healthy... and you absolutely can!

Cook your food well.",How to Kill E. Coli in Your Body," E. Coli predominantly affects the gastrointestinal tracts in adults. It causes either watery diarrhea or, in more severe cases, bloody diarrhea that can lead to other complications such as kidney failure. E. Coli infections occur most frequently while traveling to areas of the world with poorer hygiene than we have here in North America. It is transmitted via fecal contamination of food, water, etc.Symptoms of an E. Coli infection include:


Abdominal pain
Nausea and/or vomiting
Diarrhea
Fever
Abdominal cramps;
, It is important to understand that E. Coli infections are not able to be ""cured"" (and the bacteria cannot be ""killed"") with typical medical drugs such as antibiotics or even antidiarrheals. Rather, the treatment offered by medical professionals is ""supportive,"" meaning it consists of rest, fluids, and medications for symptom management such as pain and/or nausea.


This is counter-intuitive for many people, who often expect medical drugs as a ""cure"" for illnesses such as an E. Coli infection.
Antidiarrheal medications are not helpful because they delay the passage of the infection and a worsening of symptoms. Your best bet, counter-intuitive as it may seem, is to allow the diarrhea to continue to get rid of the infection as soon as possible.Antibiotics are also not recommended — they have been shown to worsen the illness, because when the bacteria are killed they release more toxins, resulting in greater damage., Because antibiotics are not advised in E. Coli infections, it will be up to your immune system to kill off the infection. Fortunately, your immune system is very capable of doing this, given adequate time and proper support. Rest, follow your doctor's instructions, and allow your immune system to do its job!


Talk to your doctor about the supportive measures you can take to get through the infection. It will be important to stay hydrated as you will be losing lots of fluids while you are sick.

, It may sound simple, but rest is key to recovering as quickly as possible from an E. Coli infection. Since there is not much that traditional medical treatments can do, rest becomes very important to allow your body the energy to best fight off the infection using its own natural defences.


Take time off work or school. Not only is it important to stay home and rest for your own recovery, it is also important as a means to avoid contaminating others in the workplace or school. You should remain isolated socially because E. Coli infections are very contagious and you do not want to be responsible for infecting your entire office or class with this unpleasant bacteria.
Be sure to wash your hands frequently, and to avoid others as much as possible for the duration of your illness (which should get better within a week or so).

E. Coli is transmitted through fecal matter, so wash your hands extra thoroughly after using the restroom., E. Coli infections tend to cause lots of diarrhea. As a result, is important to rehydrate yourself with water and fluids containing carbohydrates and electrolytes to compensate for the fluids lost in the diarrhea.


Dehydration is more serious in extremes of age. If the individual with E. Coli is an infant or a senior citizen, consider taking him to his doctor for treatment., Oral rehydration salts (ORS) is a powder containing salts and electrolytes that are needed in the body. It is more effective than plain water when it comes to rehydration. The powder is mixed in a litre of water and then the solution should be drunk of the next 24 hours. The powder can be obtained online and in pharmacies and most grocery stores.


Alternatively, ORS can be prepared at home by dissolving 4 tablespoons of sugar and half teaspoonful each of baking soda and salt in one liter of water.
For further information, read wikiHow's How to Make an Oral Rehydration Salts Drink.
The powder should be mixed in safe water to avoid further infection. Boil it if need be.

, You will be given intravenous fluids to replace the electrolytes and ions that have been lost during diarrhea and vomiting. An indication of when to go to hospital is when you can no longer tolerate fluids by mouth because of nausea, or when you are having diarrhea more than four times a day. If in doubt, it is best to see a medical professional to assess whether IV fluids can help to speed your recovery.


Electrolytes are substances that are found in the body and help to maintain the normal functioning of the body.
You may be required to get a blood transfusion in cases of severe bloody diarrhea (which some strains of E. Coli cause). Your blood will be checked to determine hemoglobin levels. This helps to know the amount of blood that has been lost so that the blood can be transfused back.

, To help with symptom relief, you can take pain medication such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for abdominal pain. This is available over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy. Follow the dosing directions on the bottle. You can also try anti-nauseant medications such as Dimenhydrinate (Gravol) to help combat nausea.

, As your condition improves, start with a low fibre diet at first. This will help the digestive tract restore its normal function more quickly. If you have too much fibre, your stool will bulk up and pass through your digestive tract too quickly — a process that is already likely happening with your condition. You can add more fibre back into your diet after the diarrhea has subsided and when you are feeling better.Also avoid alcohol and caffeine. Alcohol can alter your liver metabolism and it is harmful to the lining of your stomach. Caffeine worsens diarrhea by increasing dehydration.

, This includes preparation and cooking of the food. The foods that are usually eaten raw (such as fruits and vegetables) should be thoroughly cleaned before eating to prevent ingestion of contaminated food.Drinking water should be boiled if need be and should be kept in a clean place for cooling. The water that is being used for cooking needs to be clean to avoid contamination.

, Swimming pools should be treated with chlorine and the pool water should be changed regularly. This is to avoid contamination and to ensure that it is safe for swimming.


Fecal contamination in pools does happen more often than most think. In a recent study by the CDC, 58% of public swimming pools tested positive for fecal contamination.This doesn't mean there is E. Coli present necessarily, but it does provide the environment for it to be transmitted.
If you are swimming, avoid swallowing pool water as much as possible. Also, shower after leaving the pool to greatly diminish any chances of infection.

, It is important to keep your hands clean at all times. E. Coli is contagious and can be spread from one person to another through fecal contamination. Poor hygiene in the restroom can lead to the bacteria's spread.


Wash your hands with warm soap and water. Scrub for at least 20 seconds.

, Ensure that your food is cooked well before consumption. If it's undercooked, don't eat it — especially beef. Cooking food thoroughly ensures that any microbe that might be present in the food are not ingested.A food thermometer should be used to ensure that the food being consumed is safe. Beef is only done when it has reached an internal temperature of 160° F (71.1°C).

Some people get flu-like symptoms that may last for a few weeks. Because toxoplasmosis is dangerous for unborn babies, get checked by a doctor if you have these symptoms while you are pregnant:Fever
Muscle aches
Fatigue
Sore throat
Swollen lymph glands;
, Toxoplasmosis is a serious danger to people with weakened immune systems and babies. You can be tested with a blood test conducted at your doctor’s office. Ask your doctor to be tested if:You are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Toxoplasmosis can be passed to an unborn baby in utero and can cause severe disabilities.
You have HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to complications resulting from toxoplasmosis.
You are receiving chemotherapy treatments. Chemo weakens your immune system to the point where an infection that normally wouldn’t be a problem suddenly becomes a real threat.
You are taking immunosuppressant drugs or steroids. These medications can make you more vulnerable to serious infections and complications from toxoplasmosis.

, The blood test will show if you have antibodies against toxoplasmosis. Antibodies are the proteins your body produces to fight the infection. This means that the test doesn’t test for the parasites themselves, making the interpretation difficult.A negative result could mean either that you are not infected or that you have been infected so recently that your body has not yet made antibodies. The latter can be ruled out by retesting a few weeks later. A negative result also means that you do not have immunity against a future infection.
A positive result could mean one of two things. It could mean you are currently infected or it could mean you were previously infected and the antibodies reflect your immunity. If you have a positive test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the results be verified by a specialist laboratory which can analyze the different types of antibodies to help determine whether the infection is current.

, Toxoplasmosis can be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy even if you don’t feel ill. The risks to your baby if she contracts it include:Miscarriage and stillbirth
Seizures
Swollen liver and spleen
Jaundice
Eye infections and blindness
Hearing loss which appears later in life
Mental disabilities which appear later in life

, There are two ways that the doctor might suggest examining your baby.An ultrasound. This procedure uses sound waves to produce an image of the baby in the uterus. It is not dangerous for the mother or the baby. It can show whether the child has signs of an infection such as excess fluid around the brain. However, it does not rule out the possibility that there could be an infection which didn’t exhibit symptoms at that time.
Amniocentesis. This procedure involves inserting a needle through the wall of the mother’s abdomen and into the sac of fluid that surrounds the baby and extracting some of the fluid. The amniotic fluid can then be tested for toxoplasmosis. It has a 1% risk of causing a miscarriage. This test can confirm or exclude a toxoplasmosis infection, but if the child is infected, it won’t be able to say whether the child shows signs of having been harmed.

, What the doctor recommends may vary on whether the infection has spread to your baby or not.If the infection has not spread to your baby, the doctor may recommend the antibiotic spiramycin. This medication may sometimes prevent the infection from being transmitted to your baby.
If your baby is infected, the doctor will probably recommend that you alternate spiramycin with treatments of pyrimethamine (Daraprim) and sulfadiazine. These medications would likely only be prescribed after the 16th week. Pyrimethamine may prevent you from absorbing folic acid which is important for the baby’s development and cause bone marrow suppression and liver problems. Ask your doctor about side effects for you and your baby before you take them.

, If you were infected with toxoplasmosis during the pregnancy, your doctor will check the infant at birth to determine whether there are signs of eye problems or brain damage. However, many children do not develop symptoms until later, so your doctor may recommend a blood test.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends sending all blood tests of newborns to a specialized Toxoplasma Serology Laboratory in California for testing.Your baby may need to be regularly retested during the first year of life to confirm that he or she remains negative.

, If your baby is born with toxoplasmosis, the doctor may suggest regular monitoring, combined with medications. Unfortunately, if your baby has already been harmed by the infection, this damage cannot be undone. However, medications may help prevent further damage.Pyrimethamine (Daraprim)
Sulfadiazine
Folic acid supplements. This will be given because pyrimethamine may prevent your baby from absorbing folic acid.

, Your doctor is likely to recommend different medications depending on whether your infection is active or dormant. Dormant infections occur when the parasite is inactive, but can become active again when your immune system is weak.Your doctor will probably recommend pyrimethamine (Daraprim), sulfadiazine, and folic acid supplements for an active infection. Another possibility is pyrimethamine (Daraprim) with an antibiotic called clindamycin (Cleocin). Clindamycin can cause diarrhea.
If you have an inactive infection your doctor may suggest trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole to prevent the infection from resurging.

, Toxoplasmosis may cause serious infections in the eyes of people with weakened immune systems. The parasite can stay dormant in your retina and then cause an active infection years later. If this occurs, you will be given medications to fight the infection and steroids to reduce swelling in your eye. If scarring occurs in your eye it may be permanent. Go immediately to the doctor if you have:Blurred vision
Floaters
Reduced vision

, This occurs when the parasite causes lesions or cysts in your brain. If you have cerebral toxoplasmosis it would be treated with medications to kill the infection and reduce the swelling in your brain.Cerebral toxoplasmosis can cause headaches, confusion, loss of coordination, seizures, fever, and slurred speech.
The doctor will likely diagnosis it using an MRI scan. During this test a large machine uses magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain. This is not dangerous for you, but it does involve lying on a table that slides into the machine, which may be an issue if you are claustrophobic. In rare, treatment resistant cases, a brain biopsy might be performed.

, Meat, dairy, and plant foods can all be infected with toxoplasmosis.Avoid eating raw meats. This includes rare meats and cured meats, particularly lamb, mutton, pork, beef, and goat. This includes sausages and smoked hams. If the animal was infected with toxoplasmosis, the parasites may still be alive and infectious.
Cook whole cuts of meat to at least 145°F (62.8°C), ground meat to at least 160°F (71.1°C), and poultry to at least 165°F (73.9°C). Measure the temperature with a cooking thermometer in the thickest part. After you stop cooking, the temperature should remain at that temperature or above for at least three minutes.
Freeze meat for several days below 0°F (-17.8°C). This will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of infection.
Wash and/or peel all fruits and vegetables. If the fruit or vegetable was in contact with contaminated soil, it can transmit toxoplasmosis to you unless you wash it or peel it.
Do not drink unpasteurized milk products, eat cheese made from unpasteurized milk or drink untreated water.
Clean all cooking implements and surfaces (such as knives and cutting boards) that came into contact with raw or unwashed foods.

, Soil can be infected if an infected animal has recently defecated in that area. You can reduce your risks by:Wearing gloves when gardening and washing your hands thoroughly afterwards.
Covering sandboxes to prevent cats from using it as a litter box.

, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that it is not necessary to give up your cat if you are pregnant. There are several things you can do to reduce your risk including:Getting your cat tested to see if he is carrying toxoplasmosis.
Keeping your cats indoors. Cats become infected when they come in contact with the feces of other infected cats or by eating infected prey animals. Keeping your cat inside will reduce both risks.
Feed your cat commercial canned or dry food. Do not give your cat raw or undercooked meat. If the cat's food is infected, the cat can become infected.
Not touching stray cats, especially kittens.
Not getting a new cat with an unknown medical history.
Not changing the litter box if you are pregnant. Ask someone else to do it. If you must change it, wear disposable gloves, a face mask, and wash your hands afterwards. The box should be changed daily because the parasite generally requires one to five days to become infectious in feces.

Corns are usually found on feet, due to the friction provided by footwear; however, they can be found on any part of the body exposed to friction from fabric and other materials, like the hands, elbows, and knees.


The skin texture of corns varies, but skin can be waxy, dry, transparent, or a horny mass found on a bony texture of the body.Corns can be either hard or soft, but usually have a harder center surrounded by softer, slightly discolored skin.;
, Callouses and corns are similar in that they develop in response to the same kinds of pressures on the feet and hands; however, there are some notable differences between callouses and corns.


Corns are usually off-white or yellow, while callouses vary in color. They can be white, gray-yellow, brown, and red.Callouses have no distinct borders while corns are confined to distinct borders on the skin that are visible to the naked eye.Callouses are frequently painless and, if they do cause pain, it's a tender pain like an occasionally throbbing or burning. Corns are frequently painful, especially in response to even light touch.Callouses tend to be a lot bigger than corns and their shape is less uniform and round., Corns are more likely appear in certain areas. Knowing where you're most likely to find corns can help you tell the difference between corns and other skin problems.


Corns often appear on the bottom or sole of the foot or over the arch of the foot.As the outside of the fifth toe, the ""pinky toe,"" frequently rubs against footwear, corns are likely to appear here.Corns also often appear between the fourth and fifth toe, as these toes are pressed together while walking and running., Improper footwear can increase your risk for corns. If your shoes are too loose or too tight, corns may be more likely to develop.


Loose shoes can cause your feet to move around within the shoe throughout the day, rubbing against its bottom and sides. Your feet may also rub against seams or stitches inside shoes. This friction can result in corns.Tight shoes and heels can also lead to corns by constricting your feet and causing increased friction. Toes can also be pressed together, causing irritation that leads to corns.Wearing shoes without socks may increase your risk for corns.

, Certain preexisting foot problems can increase your risk for developing corns. Know if you have any conditions that could make corns more likely.


A bunion is when the joint of the big toe sticks outward while the big toe points inward towards the other toes on the foot. This can cause toes to rub together, increasing the likelihood of corns developing.A hammer toe is a toe with a bent middle joint. If any of your toes are hammer toes, corns are more likely.Bony feet tend to be more susceptible to corns as there's a lack of natural cushioning that can protect against corns., Certain activities can increase your risk of developing corns. You may be at an increased risk if you engage in any of the following activities:Running or jogging
Working a job that requires a great deal of physical labor
Playing a musical instrument, like the guitar, that requires heavy use of the hands

, As corns are rarely serious medical problems, you can start off treating them with home remedies. Most corns will successfully respond to at home treatment.


Over-the-counter medicated pads, usually containing salicylic acid, can be placed over the corn to protect against infection while it heals.Soaking your hands or feet in warm, soapy water for about 20 minutes at a time can soothe irritation associated with corns and lessen symptoms.You can rub corns with a pumice stone, nail file, or washcloth to pair down tough skin. Such products can be bought at most drugstores.Always wear comfortable shoes and socks. This can reduce existing corns and prevent the development of foot problems down the road., If symptoms do not improve with at-home treatments, or you suspect an infection, make an appointment with a podiatrist (a doctor who specializes in treating feet) to assess the problem. A doctor can help work with you to reduce symptoms.


A doctor can use a scalpel to trim down excess skin around the corn.Certain medications can be prescribed to reduce corns and callouses. Your doctor will prescribe medication based on your medical history and go over proper usage and potential side effects with you. If infection is a risk, your doctor might also recommend an antibacterial ointment.If your corns are caused by an underlying foot deformity, your doctor might prescribe custom-made padded shoe inserts to address the problem., Corns are rarely a medical emergency, but certain complications may arise that require immediate medical treatment. Go to the ER if you experience any of the following symptoms in relation to corns:Increased pain, swelling, and redness around the corn
Fever
Changes in color of fingers and toes
Any unusual drainage around the sore

Have fun.",How to Keep Your Sanity in College," Never lose sight of why you're enrolled in school in the first place. Most often, it's likely that you're there to better yourself and your family. Always keep that in mind.;
, There may be times when you stray away from the path you've essentially started but that's okay because we all do. Just so long as you make your way back, you'll be fine, and small deviations won't make a huge dent into your overall plan.

, It may sound corny, but it's true––parties and having a social life may seem to hold weight when you first arrive to campus, but don't be fooled. Don't get lost and caught up in your social life. It's all fun and games until your “friends” graduate and you don't.

, Get a planner and use it. Mark down due dates, study periods, revision times, etc., and stay focused on following your plan.


Check your schedule before agreeing to more than you can handle; don't overbook yourself. If you have to second guess your availability, don't agree to doing it until you've checked your schedule. Complete things by their deadline and you'll be fine.
As long as everything is written down, nothing will come as a surprise. All of your due dates should be marked, highlighted or underlined; use anything that draws your attention.

, How many times have you been involved in a conversation where someone has brought up a topic you remember learning about, but you couldn't participate in the conversation as thoroughly as you wanted to because you didn't quite remember all the details? That's because you didn't study to learn, you just studied to remember for the moment, to pass the test. There's a big difference between the two approaches. If you study to learn, you'll remember it forever. Besides, that's what you are in school in the first place, to learn––to use what's being taught to you later on down the road in your career field. Soak it all up. Make trips to the library, don't just study in your room because your room is full of distractions.

, If something doesn't quite click, then ask a question. Help yourself understand. It'll all pay off in the end. You're paying for your education, so why not get as much out of it as you can?

, Yes, it's good to study. Yes, it's great to be on your toes, but it isn't great to burn yourself out in books. The key to survival is any circumstance is balance and moderation. Knowing when and when not to do things.


If there is a party going on Thursday night and you have an 8 A.M. class the following day, don't go to the party. However, if your teacher doesn't take attendance and you have a friend who takes the class with you and they're willing to pass the notes off to you, then sure, go party. On the other hand, if you don't take that class with any of your friends and your professor is big on attendance and participation, then don't set yourself up for a fall. There will be other parties. It is not the end of the world.

, If there's a party Friday and Saturday night, get a head-start on your work before the weekend, so that you can properly recuperate from your hangover on Sunday.

, Enjoy. These should be the best years of your life, but not if you don't live it to its full potential. It isn't hard, but it does require dedication––just be smart and think things through.

Never stop learning, even if you feel like you’re “past your prime.”There are some simple ways you can exercise your mind. For example, you can try taking a different route to work, or brush your teeth with the hand you don't normally use.Read more, and challenge yourself with your reading selection. Alternate between reading those pulp mystery novels you love, and classics like selections by Hemingway, Twain, and London.
Solve puzzles and play games of strategy. These sort of games engage you mentally. You could also learn to play an instrument. All of these activities have been linked to improved memory.;
, Prioritize developing meaningful relationships above simply being social. Surround yourself with people that enrich your life and make you happy. Practice self-disclosure, which means sharing things that are unique to you (your thoughts, fears, favorite movies and music, pet peeves, etc.) with those you trust. This has been shown to be of immense importance to not only forging deeper interpersonal connections, but also feeling validated emotionally. Rutgers article on self-disclosure in personal relationships.


Learn how to have a healthy relationship. Be open about what you are feeling, try to understand what others are feeling, and be willing to compromise. If you think you’re in a manipulative or controlling relationship, get out of it. It’s better to stand strong on your own than be held back by a so-called companion.
Make the time to stay connected to your close friends. This does not just mean posting a Youtube video to their Facebook page every once in a while. If you live far away from your close friends, take the time to call them once every week. If you live near your best friends, make time each week to stop in and catch up (even if you both have busy work weeks/families etc.) Many studies show that people with a wide range of social contacts get sick less than those who don't. Friends make you laugh, and laughing is also an important part of health.
Enrich your sex life. In addition to the psychological benefits of a healthy sex life such as reduced depression, a healthy sex life has been shown to have a wide variety of health advantages including increased immunity, decreased pain, and better fitness.Better still, it’s something you can do with or without a partner. If you do have a partner or partners, be sure to practice safe sex.

, Set some time aside to practice an instrument, do an art project, take photos, build models, weld, bake gourmet cakes, or whatever else enriches your free time. If you want to learn something new, take an evening or weekend class. If you can’t think of anything interesting off the top of your head, take the time to find a hobby.


If you’re convinced that there isn’t enough time in the day to pursue any activities, try to cut back on a time-wasting activity like channel-surfing or hitting refresh on Facebook. You may be surprised by how much time you actually spend in front of a screen when you could be doing other things.
Join a group or club. Meeting up with people who share a common interest will both get you out of the house and boost your sense of belonging. Join a book club, a sports team, or a walking group. Pick up a community newspaper to find listings of clubs located in your area.

, It is important to be aware of what you are feeling. When you are in touch with your emotions, you will be able to both recognize when you are acting out because of your emotions and empathize more thoroughly with others. Knowing yourself is a key part of having good mental health--it’s important to know when something is making you unhappy so that you can either fix it or cut it out of your life. Likewise, it is also good to recognize the things that make you happy. Surrounding yourself with good energy will promote a happier, healthier you.


Go to a meditation group and learn how to focus your mind on the positive. Speak with a therapist who will help you sort through your emotions. Enroll in an emotional awareness course that teaches you to recognize, accept, and understand your emotions.
Learn how to cope with emotional pain and, if necessary, deal with emotional abuse. Speak with a therapist or someone you trust. Bottling up your feelings will only make your mental state more cluttered.

, Doing good will make you feel good. When you put positive energy out into the universe, that positive energy will come back to you. Improving the lives of others will in turn, improve your own mental state because you will know that you have done good by someone else.


If you have some spare time, allocate that time to helping others. Volunteer at a soup kitchen or animal shelter. Work in the community garden or simply help a friend in some way.

, Stress is unavoidable--whether you are running late for work, or have to get a shot at the doctor’s office, it is normal to feel stressed out. However, you can reduce your stress and learn how to manage your reaction to stressful things. Be aware of the things that stress you out and try to avoid those triggers.


For example, if sitting in traffic makes you stressed, avoid driving during peak rush hour. If that means getting up early and getting to work early, then find a coffee shop near your office and relax before work.
Get involved in stress-free activities. If you have noticed that you have a hard time relaxing at night, take up yoga or meditation classes. After work or class, head to your local yoga studio and learn how to focus your breath so that you feel all your tensions unwind.
Take a few moments each day to release any stresses you have and focus on the here and now. Instead of worrying about something that happened in the past, or planning for the future, take a moment to notice what is going on around you. Literally stop and smell the roses--feel the warm breeze on your face, notice the cloud formations above you, focus solely on the things going on around you.

, Avoid fad diets-they are often incredibly unhealthy. To get all the nutrition the human body needs, you must eat a balanced diet including dairy, grains, protein, fruits and veggies, as well as fat (yes, even fat!).By doing so, you'll have a healthy heart, healthy brain, and a fully functional immune system. Eating highly varied foods will also help insure you get all the vitamins, minerals, oils, and enzymes your body craves.


To lose weight, you must burn more calories than you consume.That’s all there is to it. With the exception of sweets, eliminating one area of the food pyramid from your diet won’t replace the need to simply consume fewer calories.
Avoid skipping meals, which is hard on the body. Some people even recommend eating up to six mini meals a day instead of three large ones, which can sustain energy and steady blood-sugar levels; however, many people end up turning their “mini meals” into junk food sessions and end up consuming not just more calories, but emptier ones.Be honest with yourself before making this choice.
If you want to work on portion control, eat low energy-density foods (i.e. more substance, fewer calories). Fruits and vegetables, for example, are packed with not only vitamins and minerals, but also water and fiber, making them take longer to digest and keeping you full longer., Water helps flush metabolic wastes to keep your metabolism in top shape.Water can also help you feel fuller, so drink at least a half-gallon (2 liters) of water every day (or more if you are active or live in a hot climate).


Try to drink water that has been purified. Tap water often contains things like chlorine and fluoride that reduce the health benefits of drinking water., Adults should get 7 to 9 hours daily, whereas school-aged children should get 10 to 11.One of the absolute most important ways of improving the quality of your sleep is to do it in complete darkness, as even small amounts of light interfere with the chemicals that tell your body to rest.If you can’t eliminate the light in your room, wear an eye mask. Another one of the best ways to improve your sleep is to exercise.Sleeping is also a good way to prevent overeating. A study by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition demonstrated that men who only slept for 4 hours consumed, on average, 500 more calories than they did after sleeping for 8., If you don’t want to pay for a gym membership, try strength-training at home. The muscle you develop will help increase your metabolism: the bodies of muscular people burn more calories even while they’re at rest.To help you stick to your regimen, keep a workout journal. Plan out when and where you will work out each week and stick to it. Each time you work out, write down what you did and for how long.


To keep your heart in shape, do cardio. One particularly effective way to improve your cardiovascular health is to do interval training, which means alternating between low- and high-intensity activity. This has been shown to be a quick and extremely effective way to improve heart health and endurance.(Anyone over the age of 60 or who has heart disease, high blood pressure, or arthritis should consult a doctor before attempting interval training.)

, Quit smoking, beat drug addiction, and, if necessary, stop drinking. Avoid other risky behaviors like speeding, fighting, unsafe sex, and excessive thrill-seeking.

, Wash your hands thoroughly after coming into contact with a sick person, using the bathroom, or anything else that could make you sick. (If you’re not sure what “thoroughly” entails, sing Happy Birthday to You in your head as you scrub--when you are done singing the song, you should finish washing your hands.) In addition to flossing regularly, brush your teeth and tongue at least twice daily to limit plaque and harmful bacteria. Take showers regularly. Schedule doctor’s and dentist’s appointments to make sure everything in your body is working properly and you are as healthy as you can be.

, Don’t tire yourself out by making large gestures toward health without addressing the small stuff too. Instead of running yourself ragged at the gym three days a week, park farther away from the store, walk the dog more often, take the stairs instead of the elevator, or weed your garden; instead of attacking your veggies and snacking distractedly in front of the computer or TV, set time aside to slowly enjoy each meal and prevent mindless overeating.Get your new habits to stick by tackling them at the grass-roots level.


Remember to do everything in moderation – including moderation. Turning each aspect of your life into something you need to check off a list can not only make you feel trapped, but also make you more likely to fall (or possibly even throw yourself) off the wagon. Allowing yourself the occasional indulgence to blow off steam will make you much more satisfied with your new lifestyle choices. Give yourself healthy rewards when you complete a week of your new workout regimen or healthy eating plan.

Get IV fluids.",How to Increase Urination1," If you have trouble urinating, you may just be dehydrated. Most people need about two liters of water on a daily basis, or eight eight-ounce cups worth.Drink more if you sweat a lot, work out, or live in a hot climate. Water, juice, and tea count towards your fluids.

If your urine is scarce and a dark yellow, you may be dehydrated.
If you’re dehydrated due to vomiting or diarrhea, don’t drink fruit juice or soda. These can worsen the problem.;
, The most common cause of low urine output is dehydration. It’s also the problem that’s easiest to fix! You can easily become dehydrated if you’ve had diarrhea, been vomiting, or have a high fever. It’s also easy to get dehydrated if you sweat a lot while working out, or are in a hot environment. If you’re dehydrated, your urine will be dark yellow or you won’t urinate much at all. Recognize if you have other symptoms of dehydration so you can treat it appropriately:Dry lips, tongue, and mouth
Feeling thirsty
Fast or irregular heartbeat
Dizziness, especially when going from sitting or lying to standing
Feeling shaky, restless, or irritable

, If your child has low urine production due to dehydration, it’s important to rehydrate them right away. This can occur because of diarrhea, vomiting, or a high fever. Give the child a rehydrating solution like Pedialyte or Hydralyte. Give them a teaspoon every 1-5 minutes at first, and increase the amount gradually.Talk to your pediatrician before giving your child rehydrating drinks. Some require precise dosing.
Use a syringe to give solution to very young children.
Older children can have diluted sports drinks to replenish fluids and electrolytes. Mix half Gatorade or other sports drink and half water.
You may also provide ice chips to children using a cup and spoon.

, Eating a high-salt diet can cause you to retain water, which limits how much you urinate. Decrease salt in your diet by avoiding fast food and processed food like chips and other snack-aisle items. Flavor your meals with herbs and spices instead of table salt., If you have a medical condition that makes your body hold onto extra water – like heart failure, for instance – your doctor can prescribe you a diuretic. That’s a medication that increases how much you urinate. Diuretics should only be used for specific conditions, so discuss your urinary trouble with your doctor and ask if a diuretic is right for you., If you’re severely dehydrated, visit the emergency department for intravenous (IV) fluids. You’ll be given a saline solution through a needle into your vein. This is an effective way to get hydrated, and you will begin urinating more soon afterwards.Signs of severe dehydration requiring IV fluids include:

Not urinating at all for hours, or very dark yellow urine
Dried up, shriveled skin
Confusion or delirium (quick onset of confusion or hallucinations)
Rapid breathing, fast heartbeat, or skipped heartbeats
Severe fatigue or listlessness

See your doctor right away for a kidney function test if you stop making much urine and have swelling in your legs, feel drowsy, confused, or fatigued, have chest pain or experience shortness of breath.Your doctor can check your basic kidney function with a blood test.
Kidney problems can be chronic (long-lasting) or acute (new and abrupt). Many illnesses can cause kidney problems, so see your doctor to get diagnosed and treated., Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are more common in women than men, but both sexes can experience symptoms. UTIs can cause inflammation or swelling that blocks urine flow. Treatment is typically administered in the form of an antibiotic.Visit your doctor for treatment if you have symptoms of a UTI such as:A strong urge to urinate
Burning or pain when you urinate
Urinating often in small amounts, or having weak flow
Urine that looks cloudy, pink, red, or brown
Pain in the center of your pelvis, back, or sides
A strong smell to your urine

, Prostatitis, inflammation of the prostate because of infection, is a cause of slow or weak urine flow in men. You usually also have pain in your groin or pelvis, and possibly chills or a fever. See your doctor to get checked if you have these symptoms associated with difficulty urinating.Prostatitis will be treated with antibiotics if it’s caused by a bacterial infection.

, Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) commonly causes urinary problems in men over age 60. Your prostate enlarges and squeezes the urethra, blocking urine flow.If you have urinary trouble, see your doctor to be checked for BPH. Depending on how severe your symptoms are, your doctor can treat you with natural remedies like saw palmetto extract, medications called alpha-blockers, or surgical procedures.

BPH is very common, but prostate cancer – though much less common – can also enlarge your prostate and cause urinary symptoms. It’s important to have your prostate checked regularly starting at age 50 (or earlier if a relative had prostate cancer).Treatment is often administered in the form of an antibiotic.

, Sometimes if you’re constipated a hard stool can push against your urethra or bladder and block urine from leaving your body. If you’re unable to urinate or have a weak flow and you’re also constipated, try to alleviate your constipation, then see if you can urinate freely.Drink extra water, eat prunes, and avoid dairy to try to alleviate constipation.
Take an over-the-counter laxative like Miralax or Colace, or try a Fleet enema.Ask the pharmacist for suggestions.

, If you’ve had past surgeries in the area of your lower abdomen, scar tissue may have formed. See your doctor for evaluation and discuss any illnesses, surgeries, or medical problems you have had with your bladder, kidneys, urethra, vagina, or prostate. Scar tissue or adhesion can sometimes be removed with a minor surgery, which will allow for more room for urine flow.Scarred areas can also be open up with dilators, which stretch the area to allow urine to flow better. These procedures often need to be repeated over time., Stay away from antihistamines like Benadryl, and decongestants like pseudoephedrine found in many cold medicines. Ingredients in these make it harder to urinate."

Do strengthening Kegel exercises.,
Get physical support for your bladder.,
Use estrogen cream for postmenopausal urinary problems.,
Use heat packs on your lower abdomen.,
Discuss cholinergic medications with your doctor.,
Get a catheter.",How to Increase Urination3," Women and men alike can benefit from doing kegel exercises, which strengthen the pelvic floor and improve continence and urinary flow.You can do Kegels anywhere, simply follow these instructions:While urinating, squeeze the muscles that stop your flow midstream – those are the muscles you want to isolate. You can do the exercise in any position.
Tighten those muscles, hold for 5 seconds, then relax. Repeat this several times in a row.
Gradually work up to holding the contraction for 10 seconds, then resting for 10 seconds. Try to do three sets of ten repetitions every day.
Don’t squeeze other muscles like your abs, legs, or butt. Focus on flexing only your pelvic floor muscles.

, Sometimes, vaginal childbirth or heavy coughing or straining can weaken the muscles that hold your bladder in place, causing your bladder to droop. This can affect how well you can urinate, and may be your problem if you have a feeling of fullness or pressure in your vagina or pelvis, it feels worse when you strain or bear down, you feel like your bladder isn’t fully empty after you urinate, you leak urine during intercourse, or you see or feel a bulge of tissue in your vagina.Ask your doctor about getting a pessary – a support for your bladder that sits inside your vagina.
In severe cases, you can have surgery to reinforce your pelvic muscles and ligaments.

, Most women with leaking or weak stream experience the trouble after menopause – as estrogen decreases, skin and tissues thin and weaken. Using an estrogen cream that’s made for your vagina may help strengthen the surrounding skin and tissues. Ask your doctor or OB/GYN whether your urinary troubles might be helped with “topical” estrogen., Place a hot water bottle or heating pack on your low abdomen between your belly button and your pubic bone. Like with other muscles, the heat may relax your bladder and help you urinate more freely.You can also try taking a hot shower or soaking in a warm bath.

, Cholinergic medications increase how strongly your bladder contracts, which will help you urinate if your weak flow is due to nerve issues. Bethanechol hydrochloride (Urecholine) is usually prescribed, but can have many side effects, so talk to your doctor about whether it’s right for you.Ask your doctor questions about your condition, such as, “What is causing my urinary problems?” and, “What type of medicine will help? What are the possible side effects?”

, In severe cases of urinary retention, you can ask your doctor about having a catheter placed inside your urethra and up into your bladder. This allows a clean, open passage for urine. This is meant as a short-term measure. Some people who have problems urinating due to nerve disorders may need permanent catheters."

Incorporate iron-rich food in your diet for nutritional improvement.,
Get more copper.,
Make sure you get enough folic acid.,
Take vitamin A (Retinol).,
Get your vitamin C, too.,
Get your daily exercise.,
Kick the bad habits.,
Get a blood transfusion if necessary.,
Get a routine physical assessment.,
Know the basics of red blood cells.,
Know how hemoglobin works in the blood.,
Understand the role of red blood cells.",How to Increase Red Blood Cell Count," This will help the body rebuild and replace what is lacking. Daily intake of iron rich food will help increase RBCs in the body. This is because it is an essential part of a red blood cell and hemoglobin as it helps deliver oxygen to different body parts. It also helps in excretion of carbon monoxide upon exhalation. Food rich in iron includes:Beans/Legumes
Lentils
Green leafy vegetables like kale and spinach
Dried fruits including prunes
Organs meats such as liver
Egg yolks
Red meat
Dried raisins

If daily consumption of iron rich food daily is not enough, you can turn for supplements and minerals that may increase red blood production. Iron is available in 50-100mg and can be taken 2-3 times daily.

;
, Copper is another essential mineral that helps the cells access the chemical form of iron necessary for red blood cells during the process of iron metabolism. Copper can be found in poultry meats, shellfish, liver, whole grains, chocolate, beans, cherries and nuts. Copper supplements are also available in 900mcg tablet form and can be taken once daily.


Accordingly, adults require 900 micrograms of copper per day. During the productive years, women menstruate thus require more copper than men. Women need 18mg while men only require 8mg per day.

, Otherwise known as vitamin B9, folic acid helps in the production of normal RBCs. A significant decrease folic acid may predispose anemia.


Cereals, bread, dark green leafy vegetables, peas, lentils, beans and nuts contain high amounts of folic acid. It is also available in supplement form – 100 to 250mcg can be taken once daily.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or ACOG recommends a daily intake of 400 mcg every day for adult women who regularly menstruate. Likewise, the National Institute of Health recommends 600 mcg of folic acid for pregnant women.
Besides aiding in production of healthy blood cells, folic acid plays an essential role in the production and repair of the basic building block of cells in normal functioning DNA.

, Vitamin A, supports stem cell development of RBCs in the bone marrow by ensuring that developing red blood cells access enough iron required to process hemoglobin.


Sweet potatoes, carrots, squash, dark green leafy vegetables, sweet red peppers and fruits like apricots, grapefruit, watermelon, plums/prunes and cantaloupe melons are rich in Vitamin A.
The daily dietary requirement of vitamin A for women is 700 mcg and 900 mcg for men.

, Take vitamin C when you take your iron supplement to bring about a synergistic effect. This is because vitamin C boosts the ability of the body to absorb more iron, increasing red blood cell production.


Taking 500mg of vitamin C once daily together with iron will increase its absorption rate in the body making it more effective. However, take precautions while taking iron as high levels of the supplement can be harmful to the body.

, Exercise is good for everyone – including those with low RBC levels – and it can benefit you both physically and mentally. It keeps you healthy and is recommended to avoid acquiring certain diseases and illnesses.


Cardiovascular exercises such as jogging, running, and swimming are best, though all exercise is good.
Exercise has an important role in red blood cell production. When you do vigorous exercises, you get tired and sweat a lot. Vigorous exercise requires the body to get a greater amount of oxygen. If that happens it will signal the brain that the body lacks oxygen therefore, stimulating production of red blood cells and hemoglobin. This carries and supplies the oxygen needed.

, If you're concerned about your RBC count, it's best to avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. It's best to kick these habits for your overall health, too.


Cigarette smoking can interrupt blood flow as it constricts the blood vessels and make blood viscous in consistency. It will make the blood unable to circulate properly and deliver oxygen to other body parts and. Also, it can make the bone marrow deprived from the oxygen.
On the other hand, excessive alcohol consumption can also make the blood thicken and slow, deprive it of oxygen, reduce RBC production, and will produce immature red blood cells.

, If your RBC count is so low that food and supplements can no longer provide large amounts of RBCs, blood transfusion may be an option. You can talk to your primary doctor and have a diagnostic test given. This is a complete blood count (CBC) that will measure the number of RBCs you have in your body.


Normal range of RBCs is 4 to 6 million cells per milliliter. If you have a very low RBC count a doctor may tell you to undergo a blood transfusion of packed red blood cell (PRBC) or whole blood to meet the demands of RBC and other blood components in the body., Visiting your doctor regularly is the best way to know how your RBCs are doing. What's more, additional tests may be required to rule out any underlying condition which causes low RBC count. It’s best to see your physician regularly. An annual physical check-up is a healthy habit.


If you have been told you have a low RBC count, take the above tips to heart. Dedicate your lifestyle and diet to upping your count and revisit your doctor. Your levels, ideally, will normalize.

, Around a quarter of the human body cells are red blood cells, or erythrocytes. These RBCs are developed in the bone marrow produced at approximately 2.4 million red blood cells per second.


Erythrocytes circulate in the body for 100 to 120 days. It is the same reason why we can only donate blood once every 3 to 4 months.
Men have an average of 5.2 million RBCs per cubic millimeter meanwhile 4.6 million in women. If you are a regular blood donor, you’ll notice that there are more men who passed the blood donation screening than women.

, The iron-rich protein known as hemoglobin is the main component of the red blood cells. It is responsible for the red color as iron binds with oxygen.


Each hemoglobin molecule has four iron atoms and each of which binds to 1 oxygen molecule with 2 oxygen atoms. Around 33% of an erythrocyte is hemoglobin normally 15.5 g/dL in men and 14 g/dL in women.

, Red blood cells play an important role in transporting oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the tissues and cells. RBCs have cell membranes composed of lipids and proteins essential for physiological function while working within the capillary network through the circulatory system.


In addition, red blood cells aid in the removal of carbon dioxide. They contain the carbonic anhydrase enzyme which allows for a reaction of water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid and separate hydrogen and bicarbonate ions.
Hydrogen ions bind with hemoglobin while bicarbonate ions go to the plasma removing approximately 70% of carbon dioxide. Twenty percent of carbon dioxide binds with hemoglobin which then released in the lungs. Meanwhile, the remaining 7% gets dissolved in the plasma.

Breathe more slowly and deeply.,
Seek respiratory training for maximum health benefits.,
Try coughing.,
Practice pursed-lips breathing.",How to Increase Oxygen Saturation1," You breathe involuntarily, but you also probably breathe inefficiently — many adults use only about one-third of their lung capacity while breathing. This inefficiency can cause less oxygen to enter the lungs and thereby the bloodstream, in turn reducing your oxygen saturation. By breathing more slowly and deeply, you can improve all of these elements.Many adults breathe at a rate of around fifteen respirations per minute; reducing this to rate to ten per minute has been shown to benefit oxygen saturation.;
, While occasionally making the conscious effort to breathe more slowly and deeply benefits your oxygen saturation, making more lasting adjustments to your breathing patterns will produce superior results. Both healthy individuals and those with breathing-related medical conditions can increase their oxygen saturation through respiratory training.Especially if you have a medical condition like COPD, talk to your health care team about including respiratory training.
You can also seek out guided breathing training outside of a medical setting, in ways like joining a yoga class or being instructed in diaphragmatic breathing (either by a respiratory trainer or a vocal coach)., Controlled coughing can help you to clear the secretions that may be obstructing your airway and this will help to improve your oxygen saturation. This is a common instruction after surgery to ensure that your airways are clear.

Try coughing a few times to see if this help you to breathe a little easier.

, Throughout your day, you can temporarily increase your oxygen saturation by doing a simple breathing exercise known as pursed-lips breathing. It is one of the easiest ways to more slowly and deeply draw oxygen into your lungs. Try the following steps:Breathe in through your nose for about two seconds.
Pucker your lips (as if giving a kiss) and hold the breath in for a beat.
Exhale through your pursed lips for about six seconds.
Repeat as many times as desired.

Get a good amount of protein each day.,
Avoid a high-fat diet.,
Drink green tea every day.,
Drink a lot of water.",How to Increase Lymphocytes1," Lymphocytes need amino acids to be able to function properly and keep your immune system strong. The amino acids found in protein are also responsible in part for the production of B-cell lymphocytes. Because of this, its important to get a healthy amount of protein each day.


The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound). Use this reference to calculate how much protein you should be eating each day. For example, a 120 pound person should try to eat 43 grams (1.5 oz) of protein a day.Sources of protein include: poultry meat, fish, beans, lean beef, pork tenderloin, and dairy products like milk and cheese.;
, Studies have shown that having a high fat count in your body can actually thicken your lymphocytes, making them less effective. To keep your lymphocyte count up and your immune system working effectively, you should try to eat low-fat products.These include:

Lean meats like poultry (without the skin), fish, and lean beef.






Low-fat dairy products (including milk, cheese, and yogurt).







, Catechins found in green tea help lymphocytes to do their job by speeding up their response time. In addition, green tea also contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which triggers the germ-fighting components from the T-cells that helps to boost the immune system.Try to drink at least one cup of green tea everyday to get these immune-boosting benefits.

, Water helps to flush the body of toxins that might have otherwise affected the number of white blood cells in your body. It is important to stay hydrated in order to be healthy. You should try to drink at least 8 to 12 glasses of water every day.If you are not a huge fan of drinking plain water, you can drink fruit juice diluted with water, coconut water, or herbal tea.

Recognize the signs of hypothermia.,
Get out of the cold.,
Remove wet clothes.,
Rely on skin-to-skin contact.,
Warm the center of the body first.",How to Increase Body Temperature1," When your body is losing heat faster than it can create heat, you run the risk of becoming hypothermic; when your body temperature slips below 95 degrees Fahrenheit, your organs can no longer function normally.Hypothermia can be a serious risk to your life and your health. You can lose fingers, toes, and limbs from the cold, and you might suffer from lasting damage. If you think that you might be growing hypothermic, then your situation is severe, and you need to increase your body temperature as quickly as possible.


In mild hypothermia, you may notice: shivering, dizziness, hunger, nausea, rapid breathing, slight confusion and lack of coordination, trouble speaking, fatigue, and a quickened pulse.
As hypothermia becomes more severe, you may notice that many of the mild symptoms become more severe. You may stop shivering; mumble or slur your speech; feel drowsy; make poor decisions, such as trying to remove warm clothes; feel a worrying lack of concern; experience a weak pulse and shallow breathing; slowly lose consciousness; and ultimately, if treatment (and proper re-warming) is not received quickly enough, die.;
, If your body temperature is dropping dramatically, you need to get out of the cold. If you are outdoors, find a warm room or shelter.


Even getting out of the path of the wind can help. Try taking cover behind a wall or other large object if you cannot get into a building.

, If your clothes are wet, then remove them and put on some dry clothes. Pile on as many warm, insulating layers as possible - including the head and neck. Cut away someone's clothes, if necessary, to keep them from moving too much.


Ensure that you have warm and dry clothing to put on before removing wet clothing.

, If you can't get indoors, curl up with another person under loose, dry layers of blankets or clothing. This can be one of the most effective ways to quickly stabilize and raise your body heat., Your extremities - hands, feet, fingers, toes - are usually the first parts of your body to get cold, but the situation is most severe when the cold spreads to your core. Warm your torso, your belly, and your groin to stabilize your body temperature and get your heart pumping. The warm blood should radiate out through your veins from your core.


Hold your extremities against your core. Place your hands under your armpits or between your thighs. Curl up in the fetal position so that you trap heat between your torso and your legs; try to tuck your feet in so that they don't get too cold."

Use supplemental oxygen as prescribed.,
Learn to check your oxygen saturation and supplementation regularly.,
Take any prescribed medications as directed.,
Ask your doctor about using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.,
Keep an eye out for emerging treatments.",How to Increase Oxygen Saturation2," If you have consistently low oxygen saturation levels due to a condition like COPD, your doctor may decide to place you on supplemental oxygen. This treatment involves the use of oxygen tanks, flexible tubing, and a cannula that feeds the oxygen into your nose. Patients who follow their prescribed oxygen regimens can often lead long and reasonably active lives.Don’t resist this treatment because you’re worried you’ll be “chained” to an oxygen tank and stuck in bed for life. Portable tanks can be very unobtrusive and allow you to go out and about with more energy and endurance.

, People on supplemental oxygen will usually be taught how to monitor their own oxygen saturation by placing a pulse oximeter on their finger, earlobe, or nose. The process is quick, easy, non-invasive, and painless.

As per your doctor’s recommendations, you can adjust your supplemental oxygen to compensate for lower saturation readings, or when you are engaging in activities like walking or light exercise., If you have low oxygen saturation due to COPD or a similar condition, you will likely take medications along with using supplemental oxygen. These may include controller medications that you will take on a regular schedule to improve your breathing and lung function, as well as rescue medications to use when you’re having more acute breathing difficulties.There are numerous types of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), short- and long-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA & LABA), and other medications that may be prescribed to you. Make sure you understand your doctor’s instructions for using them, and follow the plan diligently.These medications are also known as bronchodilators. Bronchodilators increase the diameter of your airways and this helps to increase oxygenation., If you have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), then your airways might not stay open on their own. This may lead to decreased oxygen saturation. Ask your doctor about getting a PAP or BiPap machine to help keep your airways open and raise your oxygen saturation.The machine comes with a hose and a mask that you wear over your mouth and nose.

, While supplemental oxygen, medication, and respiratory training has been — and continues to be — the common and often effective treatment plan for low oxygen saturation, new options continue to be developed. One example is stem cell treatment, in which stem cells are harvested from your blood or bone marrow, isolated, and reintroduced to your lungs.New treatments can also carry new risks, of course, or turn out not to be as effective as initially hoped. Do some research on your own to find out what options are out there, and work with your medical team to determine the treatment plan that is right for you.

Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke.,
Breathe fresher air.,
Lose excess weight if needed.,
Exercise sensibly.,
Consume more water.,
Try sitting up instead of lying down.,
Accept the inevitable variations in oxygen saturation levels.",How to Increase Oxygen Saturation3," Breathing in smoke from tobacco products seriously damages your lungs and inhibits their ability to efficiently introduce oxygen to your bloodstream. If you smoke and have low oxygen saturation levels, quitting is the first and perhaps most vital step you can take to deal with the condition. Seek out whatever help you need to quit.If you are on supplemental oxygen, smoking is also a severe fire hazard. Concentrated oxygen is extremely flammable, and many people have been seriously or even fatally burned as a result of smoking while using supplemental oxygen.

, Oxygen levels in the surrounding atmosphere have an impact on your oxygen saturation; people who live in higher elevations typically have lower saturation levels, for example. The more oxygen and less “other stuff” — like dust, particulates, smoke, and so on — that circulates in the air you breathe, the better for your oxygen saturation.If you live in an area with fresh air, open a window or go outside. Keep plants in the house to boost oxygen levels. Clean and dust regularly. Invest in air cleaners if desired.
Don’t expect major increases in oxygen saturation this way; use it in coordination with other changes.

, If you have a body mass index (BMI) that is above recommended levels, the excess weight you carry likely causes you to breathe with more difficulty and less efficiency. Lower BMI levels have been shown to correlate with higher oxygen saturation levels.Also, even if your oxygen saturation were to remain the same, losing weight makes it easier for you to utilize the oxygen in your body. Compare it to how an unloaded car uses fuel more efficiently., Aerobic exercise in itself does not necessarily increase oxygen saturation, but it will increase your ability to utilize the oxygen you do have more efficiently. Exercise that helps you lose excess weight is more likely to have a positive impact on actual oxygen saturation levels.If you have COPD or another condition that impacts your pulmonary or cardiovascular health, you will have restrictions to your exercise choices. Work with your medical team to develop a realistic and effective plan for you.

, You might recall from chemistry class that a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. So, every time you drink water or eat water-rich foods, you are introducing oxygen into your body. Gulping down water won’t magically fix your problem of low oxygen saturation, but regular hydration is a sensible part of any plan for someone with low levels.Plain water is the best choice for hydration, while fruits and vegetables are water-rich and healthy food choices. Try, for instance, steamed spinach, carrots, or green beans, or freshly-made fruit juices and smoothies.
Drinking water can help to loosen up the mucus in your airways. This will help them to stay open and provide the maximum oxygen access.

, You can cause a slight but demonstrable increase in your oxygen saturation simply by choosing to sit instead of lie down. When you’re resting or relaxing, sitting up may make it easier for you to breathe in deeply and increase your oxygen saturation. Don’t use this as an excuse not to get up and be active, however, as improving your overall fitness will provide a greater, lasting benefit.You can also alter your position to improve your ability to breathe and increase oxygen saturation. This is a non-invasive way to improve your oxygen saturation. For example, if you are laying down, elevate the head of your bed to at least 30 degrees. If you elevate the head of your bed to 45 to 60 degrees, then this may improve your oxygen saturation even more.

, While an oxygen saturation level above 95% is usually considered good and below 90% is often considered problematic, every individual is different. Oxygen saturation levels will vary from person-to-person based on many factors — levels tend to peak around mid-childhood and slowly decline thereafter, for instance. Don’t get fixated on a specific number; instead, work with your doctor to find the range that suits your overall health best."

Up your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C is one of best nutrients when it comes to boosting your immune system.,
Increase your selenium amounts by eating more seafood.,
Add zinc to your diet.,
Eat foods that contain beta carotene.",How to Increase Lymphocytes2," It helps your body increase its production of lymphocytes and other antibodies. You can take a vitamin C supplement each day, or you can get more vitamin C by eating foods like:


Yellow bell peppers, guavas, dark leafy greens like kale, broccoli, strawberries, citrus like oranges, grapefruits, and lemons, tomatoes, and papaya.

, Selenium is known to enhance the production of cytokines (substances secreted by immune system cells that affect white blood cells), which play an essential role in protecting the body against illnesses. Seafood that contains selenium includes:


Oysters, crabs, and tuna. It can also be found in brown rice, garlic, lamb chops, and cottage cheese.

, Zinc helps many different enzymes that are crucial to the success of your immune system. A lack of zinc in your body can cause a decrease of interleukin 1 production (substances that get produced by lymphocytes), the wasting away of lymph nodes and a poor immune response to pathogens (bad microorganisms). You can find zinc in:


Oysters, crab, zinc-fortified cereals, turkey, beef, and green leafy vegetables.
Experts recommend 10 milligrams of zinc for females and 12 milligrams for males. Too much zinc can actually be poisonous, so stay with the recommended amount., Beta carotene helps to increase your body’s productions of T-cell lymphocytes. It is also a powerful antioxidant that enhances cell-mediated immune response by increasing the levels of white blood cell receptors in your body. You can find beta carotene in:


Sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, romaine lettuce, butternut squash, cantaloupe, and dried apricots.

Exercise daily.,
Stay at an ideal body weight.,
Maintain your personal hygiene.,
Avoid stress as much as you can.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Increase Lymphocytes3," Exercising regularly boosts your body’s immune system, making you less susceptible to infection. At the same time, it promotes a normal amount of lymphocytes, and regulates your metabolism (which deals with glucose and glutamine, both of which help lymphocytes to function properly).


Try to exercise for 30 minutes, three to five days a week. You should pick an activity (or multiple activities) that you really enjoy so that you feel more motivated to get out there and get moving. Ideas include running, biking, hiking, swimming, and rock climbing.

, Normal body mass index (BMI) ranges from 18.5 to 24.9. If you have a BMI that is under 18.5, you are considered underweight, while anything beyond 24.9 is considered overweight. Being too underweight or too overweight can make you more susceptible to infections because your lymphocytes are not as abundant.Exercising and maintaining a healthy diet are both important when it comes to maintaining your BMI.

, Washing your hands whenever you’ve been exposed to microorganisms that could make you sick is always a good practice. It is particularly important when you are trying to increase the number of lymphocytes in your body. Washing your hands lowers your risk of getting exposed to things that can cause infections (like bacteria and viruses).


Try to follow the three minute rule when it comes to washing your hands. Use warm water and soap and scrub your hands well, working from your palms to the back of your hands, and then from the tips of your fingers up to your wrists. It should take you about three minutes (or the length of the Happy Birthday song) to be fully free of any microorganisms your hands might have come into contact with., When your immune system becomes weak, your lymphocyte numbers decrease. Stress can take a toll on your immune system because it makes your body overwork. Try to reduce the amount of stress you feel each day. Some ways that you can do this are:



Going to yoga. Yoga engages the mind and the body while helping you to release both the physical and mental stress that you are consciously or unconsciously carrying around with you.Practicing meditation. Meditation is a way to let go of the things that are causing you to feel stressed. Even just practicing 20 minutes of meditation each day can help to calm you down., As mentioned above, when your mind and body is stressed, your immune system’s strength decreases. On the flip side, when you allow your body to rest, your immune system’s strength (and thus the number of healthy lymphocytes in your body) increases.Take breaks when you are tired and tried to get a good amount of sleep each night.


You should try to get around eight hours of sleep each night. Allow your body to rest for three to four minutes between tasking activities.

Put on additional clothing.,
Put on a hat, mittens, and a scarf.,
Use blankets or other materials instead of clothing.,
Eat a meal.,
Consume hot foods and warm, sweet liquids.Having foods and drinks that are already warm will raise your body temperature even more than digestion alone will, because your body will absorb the heat from them.,
Keep moving.",How to Increase Body Temperature2," Layering your clothing helps to hold in your body heat, which will raise your overall temperature. For this reason, simply putting on more clothing will raise your body temperature. Deliberately layering your clothes to maximize heat retention will also help. For example, try layering your clothes in this way:


Undershirt
Overshirt
Sweater
Light jacket
Heavy coat

, A significant amount of body heat radiates out from your head; wearing a hat or other covering can help retain that heat. Similarly, mittens and a scarf will help retain heat in your hands and chest, raising your overall body temperature.


Mittens are often preferable in very cold climates, as they allow the heat from each finger to warm the entire end of the mitten.

, If you really need to raise your body temperature because of cold weather or some other reason, and you don’t have extra clothing, you can wrap blankets or towels around yourself instead. If you don’t even have any blankets or towels, you can improvise using other materials.


Try wrapping yourself in layers of materials such as newspaper or plastic trash bags.
If you are in nature, pine boughs are very insulating as the needles trap air when layered upon each other.

, Digestion in general raises your temperature as your body metabolizes food.Eating any food at all, for this reason, will raise your temperature at least a small amount.


Note also that your body's natural efforts to warm up in the cold raise your metabolism significantly. That is, you burn far more calories than you normally do, when you are not trying to warm your body.
Therefore, consuming food also helps to ensure you have the energy necessary to fuel your body's innate warming processes.

, Any hot meal will help, but warm, sweet drinks can be prepared quickly and the sugar will give your body an added boost of calories to digest (and to fuel thermostat). Good choices include:


Coffee
Tea
Hot chocolate
Warm milk with or without honey
Hot broth
Soup

, The act of movement keeps your body temperature stable, and exercise can partially counteract the cooling effects of a cold environment.Walk or run; do jumping jacks or other dynamic stretches; run sprints or do cartwheels. The most important thing is that you don't stop for longer than a few seconds. You may find that when you stop moving, the cold sets in.


Be cautious. If someone is suffering from severe hypothermia, a sudden or jarring movement could trigger cardiac arrest. Don't massage or rub a person, and don't try to shake them warm.
Only use movement as a strategy if the affected person is not severely cold and at risk of hypothermia.

Most all fruits and veggies are good for you, but some are better for you than others, arguably. If you really want to zero in on mother nature's power, you'll add kale, spinach, carrots, celery, cranberries, blueberries, and pineapple to next week's grocery cart.That's every color of the rainbow, too!;
, As good as fruits and veggies are, you need some other stuff in their to mix it up and stay balanced. When you go for meat, milks and cheeses, and pasta, make sure you choose lean meats, low-fat dairy, and whole grain pasta. That generally translates to white meat (without skin), low-fat or non-fat milk, cheese, and yogurt and brown pasta, quinoa, and oats.


When it comes to grains, the browner the better. White grains shouldn't really be in your diet. If it's white, it's been processed and all the nutrients have been taken out. Then it's just empty carbs.

, If it's in a package, odds are it's not super good for you. And if it's in a package that doesn't go old for years, that goes double. Turns out the FDA doesn't even regulate all the stuff that goes into them and your body doesn't regulate the additives, either! They're not even recognized as food-like things. Your body just stores them away, not knowing what to do with them. Gross.


The FDA doesn't regulate all labels, either. Words and phrases like ""all natural,"" ""free-range,"" ""additive free,"" and ""pure"" are just claims companies can make without retribution.So if you're buying something packaged that makes a claim that seems unfeasible...it's possible it is.

, If you're looking for a miracle on Earth, water is the closest you'll probably get. Stay hydrated and just about every part of you will stay healthy -- your skin, your hair and nails, your organs, and even your mind. And you can lose weight, too! Studies show that you could lose 5 lbs in a year by just upping your water intake around a liter a day.


Part of the reason behind the weight loss is that drinking water keeps you full, but drinking cold water also ups your metabolism. In fact, drinking cold water (17 ounces, to be precise) can up your metabolism by up to 30% for 10-40 minutes. So get icy with your workout and you could burn even more calories.

, Since you're cutting out all that processed gunk, you inevitably will find yourself in the kitchen more, finally putting your passive Food Network viewership to good use. Cooking is great for your budget, your skills, and your waistline, but here's a couple things to keep in mind:


If you can, go as raw as possible. Frozen and canned veggies are all okay, but raw is so much better. None of the nutrients has been taken out in the processing.
Use the right kind of oils, like olive or safflower. They're full of the good kinds of fat. Do the same with cheeses, butters, and spreads -- try to find a lighter version of their full-fat counterpart.
Avoid frying and battering your foods. Chicken is good for you, but not if it's covered in bread crumbs, fried in fatty oil, and doused in sugary condiments.
Don't salt your foods! The American Heart Association recommends keeping salt intake at under 1,500 mg a day. That sounds doable until you realize that a teaspoon is 2,300 mg.Oof.

, We've already touched on it with cooking, but there's even more to explore: fats are necessary (especially for your hair to be shiny, your nails to be healthy, and your digestive system working as normal), but unsaturated fats are much, much better for you than saturated ones (that includes trans fats). Sources of good fats? Olive oil, avocado, and nuts. All in moderation, of course.


These shouldn't be used in addition to the food you normally eat -- they should be used as substitutes. So instead of sauteing up those veggies in vegetable oil, trade it for olive. Instead of grabbing that candy bar, go for a handful of almonds. They're still filling, but your body can process the unsaturated fats much more efficiently.

, There is no way around it: having a sedentary lifestyle is just about the best way to drive your body into the ground. You have to stay active in order to stay healthy. If you don't use your brain, you lose it -- and same goes with your muscles! So whether you want to run 5ks for breakfast or you just walk the dog every night, do something. Your body craves it.


The CDC recommends 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity, including some cardio and some strength-building activities.That's 2 and a half hours, by the way. 2.5 hours out of 168. That's reasonable, right? And the more vigorous your exercise, the less you need.
If you're overweight or obese, the only way you don't know that losing weight is in your best interest is if you've been living under a rock that doesn't get wifi. Even losing 10 pounds can make significant improvements to your health.

, And by that, we mean 1 drink a day for women and 2 for men.And no, that doesn't mean 7 in one day of the week; you can't bank 'em, saving them for later. 1 or 2 drinks a day keeps you healthy and, you know, not making stupid decisions. Be winning!


And by ""drink"" we mean 1 12-ounce can of beer or 4 ounces of wine or one ounce of hard liquor. And if the drink isn't super sugary, even better.

, You also probably know that smoking won't do your health any favors either. And it takes a chunk out of your budget, too. And it can harm those around you -- is that enough reasons for you? If health is even of the least bit concern to you, quitting will be on your immediate agenda.


And you don't have to wait decades for quitting to leave its mark, either. 20 minutes after you quit, your heart rate will drop. Minutes! A year after quitting your risk of heart disease drops to half of what it was. Why wait a second longer? Your body, your loved ones, and your wallet will thank you in no time.

, As we age, it becomes increasingly more important that we are aware of our health, even if we aren't experiencing symptoms of anything. It's in your best interest to regularly go to the dentist and to the doctor, just to make sure you're in tip-top shape. When all goes well, you can breathe a sigh of relief.


In addition to general check-ups with both the dentist and the doctor, be tested for breast or prostate cancer and STDs regularly, and keep up-to-date on your shots. The last thing you want is something sinister to be festering in your body and you not doing a thing about it.

Those STD screenings will be a lot less scary if you practice safe sex. If you're sexually active, use condoms. Just do it.



, Because all work and no play makes Jack a dull, sad, unhealthy boy. They just cut out those last two adjectives to make it sound more pleasing to the ear. But seriously: life needs a little fun or you're work yourself into an early grave. And what's the point of living anyway if you're not having any fun? So make it a point to set aside work and do something you enjoy. All of life will seem better.


Take some time every day and devote it to yourself. Whether it's meditating, reading, dancing around your living room naked, or going for a walk, do it and relish it. You deserve it!

, Sometimes it's hard to get a workout in between work, social gatherings, the kids, and commitments we make that we can't get out of. When those busy times spring up, it's important to find other ways to get moving. Even if it's just 2 extra minutes of exercise, it adds up if you do it every day.


Examples? Park far away from where you're going. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Do 5 minutes of core workouts before your shower. Wash your car by hand. Take your date to the park. There are opportunities everywhere if you get creative.

, The brain is very much so a muscle -- it can get used to the paces you put it through. Put it in front of the television day in and day out and it will atrophy. It'll become lazy. But keep it moving and it'll stay fresh and raring for the next great adventure. So turn off the tube and do something to challenge yourself. Chess anyone?


The Internet makes this so easy. Pull up Lumosity, a sudoku or crossword puzzle, Memrise, Khan Academy, or Coursera (just to name a few possibilities). There is very little you can't do with the computer you have in front of you. So no excuses!

, We talked about having fun before, but we didn't touch very heavily on getting rid of stress, though the two definitely go hand in hand. But on top of having fun, it's important to manage your stress levels. High-stress individuals eat more, sleep less, and are generally less healthy on the whole. Those hormone levels in your head affect just about everything!


The simplest thing you can do is to identify your triggers and not allow them in your life, at least as much as possible. Then add yoga or meditation on top of it and declutter your space. You're basically organizing your life, making sense of it, and then never relinquishing control.

, When we don't get adequate sleep at night, our entire lives are affected. We can't focus, we can't pay attention, we eat more, our hormones get all over the place, et cetera ad infinitum. We all need around 8 hours, but whether you need closer to 7 or 9 is an individual thing.


To make it easier, to get good quality sleep, start disconnecting sooner rather than later -- hopefully 2 or 3 hours before you go to bed. So get off the computer, stop staring at your cell phone, and hit ""off"" on that dang remote control. Read, take a bath, or just chill with your family or roommates. Live in the moment.

, Being social to humans is like breathing. If we don't get enough, our mental faculties suffer and we start losing our grip on how life should be. So make time for your friends! Call up that family member you haven't spoken to in forever. When you feel balanced, when you feel like you're an integral part of a community, everything else falls into place.


It's easy to get swamped with work or to just put work into your relationship, but life is much more fruitful when you surround yourself with a blooming social network. Make it a point to, every so often, have a night with family or friends. It'll be a stress release and you'll have more people to lean on when you need them -- a very, very comforting, healthy feeling.

, To keep your mind kicking, do something you've never done before. Go to a city you've never been to. Pick up a sport you've never played. Get creative if you haven't seen your artsy side in years. Find a hobby that's always intrigued you but you've never gotten around to and make time for it. You'll feel productive, you'll feel like you've accomplished something, and, bottom line? You'll feel good. Just what the doctor ordered.


Whether it's paragliding, taking a cooking class, or stepping into a big city without a map, there will be something you gain from these new experiences. Even if it's just a crazy story to tell!

, Really. Because at the end of day, life without passion isn't a healthy life. Everybody has a dream and even if you can't make it something you're able to pursue 24/7, it can be something that has its own little niche in your life. So spend Wednesday afternoon writing your book. Take guitar lessons at the age of 45. Pack your bags and make that move. You won't feel content without it.


Happiness is an integral part to being happy, and following your passion is a good way to ensure that your happiness is here to stay. If it gives you that warm feeling on the inside, it's meant to be. Never let your passions fall by the wayside. They're there to keep your heart and mind happy and healthy.

Eat a balanced diet of foods that are high-fiber, healthy fats, low-sugar, and low-salt.,
Start your day with a high-protein, high-fiber breakfast.,
Keep a food log of everything you eat each day.,
Read the nutrition labels on packaging.,
Cut up fruits and vegetables when you get home.,
Order groceries online to avoid impulse buys.",How to Improve Your Health1," A healthy diet gives you more energy and improves your outlook and moods. High-fiber diets help keep you regular, and lower your risk for stroke, heart disease, and diabetes, while excess salt can increase your risk for these complications.Sugar causes short energy spikes that can lead to a crash later. It has also been linked to depression and diabetes.


Healthy fats can be found in foods such as fish, nuts, and avocados.Eat lots of leafy green vegetables. Kale, broccoli, cabbage and other leafy greens are packed full of essential vitamins and nutrients.
Whole foods such as fruit and vegetables have more than enough sugar to give your body what it needs.
Limit your fruit intake. While fruit does contain essential nutrients, it is also very high in sugar. Eating too much fruit can be just as bad as eating a cookie.;
, Eating breakfast every day is a must. Waking up and eating a filling breakfast helps you maintain concentration during the day, enhances strength and endurance during physical activity, and can lower cholesterol levels.Eating a breakfast high in protein and fiber will keep you full throughout the morning and help you avoid snacking. Fiber is also digested slower and helps you feel full longer.


Eat lean protein such as eggs or a slice of salmon.Whole grain, high-fiber cereals can also keep you full through the morning.
A hearty breakfast can also keep you from snacking before lunch. While snacking is not necessarily a bad thing, you want to snack smart. Eat a handful of roasted nuts or a small piece of fruit.

, Just the act of writing down what you’ve eaten can keep you from eating that extra candy bar. Keeping a log of everything you eat makes you aware of gaps in your diet or unhealthy foods you may be consuming too much of.Assess the foods you eat on a regular basis (every one to two weeks) and alter your diet as necessary.


Find a logger that works best for you. Some may want to use plain old pencil and paper while others might find a website or phone app works better.
Keep your diary nearby so you don’t have to go out of your way to log the foods you eat.
Some food log apps include nutritional information that can also assist you in your logging.
Be honest with your tracker. This food log is for you, so cheating only hurts you.

, Foods containing hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup are not going to be good for you. Taking a second to read the ingredients list and nutrition facts will make you more aware of what you’re eating. Foods high in sugar and sodium should also be avoided.


When reading the labels, note the serving size.At first glance, a food item might not seem that bad until you realize there are three servings in the package.

, A lot of fruits and vegetables get thrown out because they are forgotten about or you don’t take the time to prepare them right away. Cut up those fruits and veggies in the way you prefer to eat them. Keep them in a clear container at eye level in the refrigerator.


When you are craving a snack and open the fridge to see what’s inside, you’ll see the fresh fruits and vegetables and reach for those instead of something unhealthy.
This will also help you cut down on food waste.

, Grocery stores are specifically set up to encourage consumers to buy things they wouldn’t necessarily have on their list. In addition, many of the items that appear to be a great deal have little to no nutritional value and are not good for a healthy balanced diet. If you find that you have a tendency to succumb to impulse buys, try doing your shopping online.


Check to see if your local grocery store has an online ordering system.
There are plenty of other online sources that allow you to shop online and have the groceries delivered directly to your door.

Exercise at least 30 minutes a day, five times a week.,
Start small by exercising one to two times a week.,
Invest in a fitness tracker.,
Stretch your body.,
Develop an exercise routine that works for you.",How to Improve Your Health2," It is recommended that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity in a week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity.Getting your heart rate up for just 30 minutes a day increases your health as you age and can have positive impacts on brain function, improving focus and mood.Go for a brisk walk (15 minute mile) around the neighborhood before or after work.
Exercise in water for a low impact workout.
Try weight lifting. Cardio exercises are not the only way to get your heart rate up. Weight lifting can be a very rewarding exercise and helps you stay fit. Strength training also helps maintain bone density as you age, which helps prevent osteoporosis..

, Don’t try to change your whole life routine in one day; it won’t work very well. Start by implementing small changes that can grow into something more. Try adding exercise one to two times per week. Gradually increase this until you’re doing something small at least once a day. You can also add a small exercise to something you normally do every day:


Try doing pushups, sit-ups, or jogging in place while the water warms up for the shower.
Walk around while talking on the phone.
Do a few calf raises while you’re waiting for water to boil.

, Keeping track of your walking and exercise can help make you more aware of the amount you get up and move in a day. Some trackers can be set to buzz if you have been inactive for too long, encouraging you to get up and stretch or walk around. Many fitness trackers also have an encouraging social community incorporated into the phone app that you can choose to use.


Ask friends and family to join a fitness challenge through the app to keep everyone motivated.
Set fitness goals for yourself and see how many days in a row you can meet them.

, Stretching may seem like a very passive exercise, but it will get your heart racing if you do it right. Stretching helps you maintain flexibility and strengthens muscles to help with balance and prevent injury.Start a daily routine to stretch in the mornings after you get up to add some energy to the start of your day.

, Not everybody can be a marathon runner or go to the gym every day. Exercise is all about getting your body moving and your heart rate up. Gardening, dancing, hiking, biking, swimming, and chasing after your kids and pets can all be great exercise.


Join a gym and try the fitness classes there.
Sign up for a sports team to exercise and be social at the same time.
Look under the ""Fitness"" section of a discount site and see if there are any classes that look interesting.

Wash your hands.,
Avoid over-sanitizing your home.,
Take probiotics.,
Quit smoking.,
Moderate alcohol intake.,
Challenge your brain.,
Get an annual check-up with your doctor.",How to Improve Your Health3," This one may seem like a no-brainer, but it is still important. Washing your hands is one of the easiest ways to avoid getting sick and spreading disease. Wash your hands regularly, particularly after you use the restroom and before you eat food.Wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. Dry them well with a clean towel.


If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer can work in a pinch; however, it is less effective when hands are visibly dirty., Although keeping your hands clean is important, it is also okay to get dirty every now and then. Your immune system functions to prevent disease, but has to first be exposed to that disease or something similar before it can fight off future infection. Keeping your environment too clean and limiting your exposure to microbes can be detrimental your immune system's ability to fight disease.Do be careful to sanitize after handling animal products such as raw meats and eggs.

, Probiotics are the good bacteria that help your body function and stay regular. These “good” bacteria are important in maintaining intestinal health, as opposed to the bad bacteria that can lead to infection. They may also help in the prevention of yeast infections and urinary tract infections.Probiotics can be found in yogurt or taken as a daily supplement.
In addition, don’t ask for antibiotics every time you get sick. Your body needs to develop its defenses by fighting the infection on its own. In addition, antibiotics only work when you have a bacterial illness. They will have no effect when you are sick with a virus, such as when you have the flu.

, It’s no secret that smoking is bad for your health. It’s also not easy to quit smoking, but there are ways to help you succeed. Benefits of quitting include decreased risk for heart attack and stroke, decreased coughing/shortness of breath, reduced risk for mouth, throat, esophageal, and bladder cancer, and better overall quality of life.Nicotine gum and patches are available to help ease the cravings during the process of quitting.
Talk to your doctor about prescription medication that can also assist in quitting.
Join a support group to help you quit and keep you motivated.
Write down all of the reasons you want to quit and refer back to that when you have a strong craving.

, A glass of wine or a beer every now and again is okay, but drinking every night or excessive drinking (like binge drinking) can be hard on your body. Your liver in particular has to work overtime to process alcohol. Drinking too much over a lifetime can lead to liver failure and other bodily harm. Alcohol is also very calorie-dense and can lead to weight issues.


Women should limit alcohol to less than one drink a day, men less than two.Do not drink alcohol if you are pregnant or have other complicating conditions.

, Many studies have shown that keeping your brain active by doing puzzles can be beneficial to your health and lower your risk for dementia and memory loss.Keep a puzzle book handy by your bed or in the bathroom.
Try an online subscription to a brain games website.

, A great way to keep yourself healthy is through prevention. Going to your annual check-ups allows your doctor to know how you are doing and catch any potential illnesses before they begin. Many illnesses are manageable in their beginning stages, but become much more difficult to treat if they have been left unchecked.


Schedule your appointment for the following year before you leave the doctor’s office.

Identify common stressors in your life with a stress journal.If you feel overwhelmed all of the time and don’t know how to manage, start by keeping a journal of what makes you stressed.,
Try meditation.,
Take a deep breath.,
Think positively.,
Write a manageable to-do list.,
Take care of small tasks right away.,
Get better sleep.,
Make time to relax and have fun.",How to Improve Your Health4," Write down exactly what made you feel stressed, how you felt, how you responded to that stress, and what, if anything, you did to feel better.


Identifying the common areas that cause you stress can help you better manage them long-term.
When you know what’s causing the stress, you can take steps to counteract it before it gets out of control.
The stress journal can also help you identify if you have any unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as overeating, binge drinking, or procrastination.

, Meditation is a great way to de-stress and relax for a few minutes each day. Daily meditation may even make you more resilient to the stressors of everyday life.Sit up straight with both feet on the floor, close your eyes, and recite a positive mantra such as, “Be at peace.”
Take deep breaths and try to sync them with your mantra.
Don't get mad at yourself or become frustrated if your thoughts wander — this is normal. Just gently return to your mantra. Let the distracting thoughts drift away.

, Deep breathing can lower your heart rate and blood pressure allowing you to take a moment away from a stressful task.If you are feeling overwhelmed, stop what you are doing and take a quick breathing break. Turn everything off for five minutes and focus on inhaling deeply and exhaling slowly. You should feel your belly rise with each inhalation and lower when you exhale.

, When you’re feeling stressed, it’s easy to get into a “doom and gloom” mode. Every little thing seems to be working against you, but in reality it’s just the way you’re currently seeing the world. Thinking positively will help you get out of this mode and reframe your view of the situation.Try thinking positive phrases, such as “This will pass,” “I’ll get through this,” and “I can manage this with a few deep breaths.”

, A lot of stress in our lives comes from knowing that we have a thousand things to do and no time to do them. Write a master list of all the things you can remember that need to get done and then break that down into manageable tasks. It can also be helpful to set certain tasks for certain days.


Don’t worry about the huge to-do list, just focus on a few items that you want to tackle that day. Before you know it, you’ll have everything crossed of your list.
Breaking tasks down into smaller, manageable chunks makes it easier to actually get started crossing them off instead of being paralyzed by the work load.

, If there is a task that has been nagging you, but it will only take two minutes to complete, just do it right when you think about it. If you’re not able to do it in the moment, add it to your small, but manageable to-do list.


Tackling the small things will keep them from bringing you down and give you a feeling of accomplishment.
Write down all the tasks you’ve taken care of each day to keep track of how much you really can do in a day.

, Many individuals don’t get enough sleep at night. Lack of sleep can lead to premature aging, high blood pressure, and increased stress.Try to get at least eight hours of sleep a night. If you find you have trouble sleeping at night, there are a few ways to improve your sleeping habits.Keep your bedroom at a comfortable, cool temperature.
Only use your bedroom for sleeping. If you have a desk in your bedroom and do work in there, your brain will not associate that space with sleeping. Try to keep the bedroom just for sleeping to train your brain that it is a place just for resting and recharging.
Establish a nightly routine. Do the same few things before you go to bed every night to let your body know that it’s time to sleep. Keeping this routine will help you fall asleep faster.
Set a sleep schedule and stick to it. Oftentimes, it is hard to stick to a consistent sleep schedule, but it is one of the easiest ways to improve sleep quality. Set the same time for going to bed and waking up every day, including weekends!
Don’t have caffeine at least six hours before bed.

, If you’re happy about things and feeling good about your life, you’ll be able to handle stress better than if you’re in a bad mood all the time.Make a list of activities that make you happy and help you relax and use them when you are feeling overwhelmed. Take a little time out of every day to indulge in an activity you enjoy.


Schedule relaxation time. If you’re a planner, you might need to specifically schedule time in your day to relax; that’s okay, as long as you actually take that time for yourself.
Small activities such as cuddling with your pet or significant other, making a quick art project, taking a walk, listening to music, or writing in a journal can be great stress relievers.

Call 911 or the emergency services in your area if you think you (or another person) are experiencing a stroke.If you believe you (or another person) are having a stroke, it is key to receive emergency medical evaluation as soon as possible.,
Do not ignore early symptoms.,
Be aware of numbness and/or tingling of the face, arm, or leg.A person having a stroke may notice sudden weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis developing, most likely on one side of the body and not the other.,
Watch for trouble speaking.One of the hallmark signs of a stroke can be trouble speaking.,
Notice changes in balance and coordination.A person experiencing a stroke may begin to feel unsteady while walking, or have a sudden onset of dizziness.,
Observe any visual changes.If a person is having any visual disturbances, including blurred vision, double vision, or blackened vision in one or both eyes, it may be a sign of a stroke.It is important to understand that the symptoms of a stroke all depend upon which area of the brain has reduced (or cut off) blood supply - the area that is affected is what will lead to specific symptoms.,
Look for a facial droop.If you believe you may be having a stroke, stand in front of a mirror and try to smile.,
Note that any of these symptoms may indicate a possible stroke.One of the key features of strokes are that they present differently in different cases.,
Consider it a medical emergency if you experience the worst headache of your life.There is one subtype of stroke, called an SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage), that presents as a ""thunderclap headache,"" which is a sudden onset of the worst headache of your life.,
Record the duration of symptoms.If you notice any signs or symptoms that are worrisome for a stroke, you should seek medical attention immediately.,
Go to the hospital immediately if you show any sudden, unexplained signs of a stroke.If you are experiencing signs and symptoms indicative of a stroke, get someone to drive you to the hospital or call 911 immediately.,
Ask your doctor for TPA.TPA stands for tissue plasminogen activator.,
Be aware of mini-strokes.There are occasions when a first time stroke, or TIA (which stands for ""transient ischemic attack,"" otherwise known as a ""mini-stroke""), is not too severe and does not cause too much lasting damage.,
Understand some of the underlying causes of strokes in young adults.Note that if you are a young adult, you are more likely to have an underlying disease that could be responsible for your stroke.,
Follow up and check for underlying conditions.Particularly if you are young, your doctor can order tests and investigations to determine if you have an underlying condition, and can treat it accordingly if one is found.,
Reduce your risk of having a stroke as a young adult.While many of the causes of stroke in young adults relate to more unusual medical conditions or conditions you are born with, you can still decrease your chances of having a stroke by modifying lifestyle-related risk factors.",How to Identify Stroke Symptoms As a Young Adult," This is because effective treatment of a stroke is time-dependent; in other words, the sooner medical treatment is received, the better the outcome and the fewer long-term health consequences that are likely to result from the stroke.


Treatment for a stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain must occur within three hours of the onset of symptoms.
The faster you get treatment, the better your chances are of avoiding severe, permanent brain damage. If you wait too long, you will no longer be eligible for the drug.
Early treatment may be even more beneficial when administered to young stroke patients.;
, If you are in your early 20's, you probably don't think symptoms like unexplained fatigue, jaw pain, or dizziness are related to a stroke — most people think of strokes as something that happens to much older adults.Do not dismiss your symptoms or wait to see if they will go away — get treatment now.


Strokes have actually been on the decline amongst adults over 65, but the number of strokes among people under 45 has increased by one-third.If you are experiencing the sudden, unexplained symptoms of a stroke — no matter how old you are — seek medical help immediately.

, It may be localized to a single area, such as the arm, or one side of the face, or it may span a larger area.


One strategy to assess for arm weakness is to ask a person to lift both arms above their head. Then, see if they can hold them up for 10 seconds. If one arm falls or slumps, this could be a sign of weakness and an indication of a stroke.

, It may be slurred words, confusion, or trouble understanding others. The medical term for difficulty speaking is called ""aphasia.""Aphasia results from lack of blood flow to the area of the brain that controls language and communication (as a result of the stroke).
Aphasia may resolve in the days to weeks following the stroke, or it may remain as permanent brain damage. It depends on the extent of damage caused by the stroke, as well as the length of time that the language and communication centre of the brain was deprived of blood flow (due to the blockage from the stroke).
Speech therapy is often given following a stroke to help people regain communication skills as quickly and effectively as possible.
You can assess for stroke-related aphasia in another by asking them questions and seeing if they respond appropriately, and/or seeing if they are able to follow and understand instructions from you.

, Dizziness or imbalance is a worrisome sign indicating a potential stroke. It is important to sit or lie down to prevent falling, and to have someone call for immediate medical help.

,


If the area of the brain responsible for vision is partially or fully deprived of blood flow, this is when a person will experience visual symptoms.
As with most symptoms of a stroke, a person's vision will likely improve (and may even return fully to normal) following the stroke, as the brain recovers. It may, however, take a few days to a few weeks for recovery to occur.

, If one side droops more than the other (in a way that is abnormal for you), this could be a sign of a stroke.


If you are observing for a possible facial droop in another, ask them to smile and take note if their smile is uneven (if one side appears higher than the other). This is an indication that they may be having a stroke.
Similarly, if the muscles on one side of the face seem paralyzed or unable to move properly, this is a sign of a potential stroke.

, This is because the symptoms of a stroke are directly related to which area of the brain is deprived of blood flow. The areas that are deprived of blood flow will dictate the symptoms that ensue (for instance, if the movement area is affected, you will experience weakness; if the language area is affected, you will experience communication problems; if the visual area is affected, you will experience vision problem, etc.).


Therefore, if you notice ANY of the signs or symptoms described in this article — or notice these signs and symptoms in another — seek medical help immediately.
It is not necessary to have all of the symptoms in order for a stroke to be occurring.

, It may be accompanied by nausea and/or vomiting. Go to the Emergency Room immediately if you (or another person) are experiencing this.

, You should also take note of when the symptoms began, and whether they have been constant or intermittent.


Just because your symptoms are intermittent or appear to have disappeared does not mean that it was not a stroke.
If your symptoms appear to have gone away, it is still advisable to see your family doctor, or to go to a walk-in clinic for assessment if you cannot get a same-day appointment with your family doctor.
If your symptoms are constant, proceed directly to the Emergency Room.
A ""TIA"" (transient ischemic attack), also known as a ""mini stroke,"" is stroke symptoms that last for less than an hour (normally for about 5-10 minutes and are then self-resolved).
It is impossible to tell a TIA and a full-blown stroke apart until you notice resolution of symptoms, so you should proceed as if it were a full stroke and seek immediate medical care unless and until you find out otherwise.

, Do not put off calling if your symptoms temporarily resolve, as they may come back.

, It is the treatment for an ischemic stroke (a stroke caused by a blood clot), as long as it is given within three hours of the onset of symptoms.


Note that the treatment will be different if you are experiencing a hemorrhagic stroke (a brain bleed) rather than an ischemic stroke (a blockage in an artery in the brain as a result of a blood clot).Treatment for a hemorrhagic stroke does not use TPA, and rather involves medications for blood pressure control and to diminish the pressure in the brain while your doctor works to fix the bleed.

, After you have been evaluated by a physician, he may make recommendations as to how to reduce your risk of future strokes.


This may include beginning a blood thinning medication or an antiplatelet agent, gaining better blood pressure control, effectively managing diabetes, quitting smoking, beginning an appropriate exercise regime, diagnosing and treating any heart arrhythmias (abnormal rhythms such as atrial fibrillation), and receiving a procedural intervention such as a carotid artery endarterectomy if needed, among other things.

, Examples of conditions that may predispose you to a stroke include AVMs (arteriovenous malformations, which is a blood vessel abnormality that can be present in your brain and predispose you to a rupture), as well as other blood vessel diseases or clotting disorders that can be inherited or developed at a young age. Additional possible causes of strokes in young adults include:


Vasculitis — An inflammatory disorder of the blood vessels.
Cerebral vein thrombosis — A blood clot in one of the venous sinuses in the brain, resulting in the symptoms of a stroke.
Moya-moya syndrome — A rare condition in which blood vessels at the base of the brain become blocked.
Diabetes— A disease that affects insulin production, leading to high sugar levels in the blood.
Sickle-cell anemia— A condition in which red blood cells die early, causing a deficiency in healthy red blood cells.

, If you have demonstrated symptoms indicative of a stroke, ask your doctor for her thoughts about what investigative tests you may be eligible for. Investigations you may receive include:


Vascular (blood vessel) studies — This involves using a Doppler ultrasound to assess for any blockages to the arteries.
Brain imaging (such as a CT scan or MRI) — This can identify blood clots in the brain and diagnose stroke-related damage.
Cardiac evaluations — This examines the heart for abnormalities that may predispose one to blood clot formation and subsequent strokes.
Hematologic assessment — This is a blood test that assesses for a variety of stroke risk factors and diagnostic clues.

, Basic measures such as exercising regularly (20 minutes three to four times per week), eating a healthy diet low in fat and sugar, quitting smoking, treating any chronic health conditions (such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and/or diabetes), and decreasing the stress in your life can all serve to decrease your risk of a stroke.


Increasing rates of obesity and high blood pressure among young people may be partly responsible for the rise in strokes.Drug abuse (in particular methamphetamine and cocaine) has been linked to strokes in young adults.Using these drugs may increase your risk of a stroke.
Consider the possibility of arterial dissection. A sharp movement of the neck — from whiplash, a chiropractor, or even yoga — can cause a small tear in a large blood vessel located in your neck.If you have recently experienced trauma, a neck adjustment, or some kind of sharp movement of the neck and later notice signs of a stroke, do not hesitate and seek medical help immediately. If possible, avoid neck adjustments and other activities that may lead to this type of movement.
Also, following through with the recommended diagnostic tests and investigations prescribed by your doctor is key. This is because these more detailed tests may reveal an underlying cause (or risk factor) for stroke that, if identified, could be effectively treated.

Tell your doctor if you are experiencing ongoing diarrhea.Diarrhea is when you have three or more loose, watery stools daily.,
Take note of abdominal pain and/or cramps.Another common symptom of ulcerative colitis is abdominal pain with or without cramps.,
Look out for problems passing stool.Not all people with ulcerative colitis present with diarrhea.,
Take note of your energy level.Ulcerative colitis typically presents with a higher level of fatigue than you would normally experience in your day-to-day life.,
Watch for weight loss.If you have ulcerative colitis, the inflammation in the colon interferes with nutrient absorption.,
Measure your temperature.Ulcerative colitis may also present with a fever in conjunction with prolonged diarrhea and abdominal pain.,
Observe the course of your disease.Ulcerative colitis typically goes in waves, with periods when it is worse and periods when it gets better.,
Look for signs and symptoms of severe bleeding.One of the potential complications of ongoing ulcerative colitis is an episode of severe bleeding.,
Tell your doctor if you experience a sudden worsening of your abdominal pain.A number of the potential complications of ulcerative colitis present with sudden onset, severe abdominal pain.,
Watch for inflammation of your skin, joints, eyes, and mouth.Another potential complication of ulcerative colitis is redness and inflammation of the skin anywhere on your body, sore or swollen joints, irritated eyes, or developing mouth sores.,
Ask for blood tests.If you have symptoms suggestive of ulcerative colitis, one of the ways to investigate further is by ordering blood tests.,
Get a stool sample.A stool sample can also aid in the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.,
Have a colonoscopy.While blood tests and a stool test both help in the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, a colonoscopy is the best way to thoroughly evaluate your colon and to confirm the diagnosis.,
Ask your doctor for an x-ray or CT scan if he or she suspects complications of ulcerative colitis.If you show signs and symptoms of potential ulcerative colitis complications, an x-ray and or CT scan is often the best way to view these.",How to Identify Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms," If you are experiencing diarrhea for longer than a few days — and particularly if your diarrhea has blood or pus in it — it may be a sign of ulcerative colitis.


The diarrhea in ulcerative colitis may also be severe enough to wake you from sleep with the need to defecate.;
, You may feel this in any area of your abdomen, as it depends upon which area of your colon is diseased. (Note that the area of the colon that is affected will vary from person to person in ulcerative colitis; it may even vary at different times within the same person.)

, Some people may have an inability to defecate in spite of the feeling that they need to.


A struggle with defecation is often accompanied with rectal pain, and sometimes with rectal bleeding as well.
Note that blood or pus in your stool is a very common symptom in ulcerative colitis.

, Tell your doctor if you have been feeling more tired than normal.


This can be secondary to blood loss. Anemia can occur if blood loss is severe, presenting with symptoms of bleeding from rectum, fatigue, shortness of breath and/or heart palpitations.

, As a result, your body may not be absorbing the nutrients it needs, and you may be inadvertently suffering from malnutrition. Tell your doctor if you have been losing weight, as this could be a sign that you are not absorbing food properly due to ulcerative colitis.


In children, rather than weight loss, malabsorption from ulcerative colitis typically presents as a failure to thrive.

, If you have an unexplained fever lasting for more than a couple of days it is important to inform your physician. Note, however, that if your fever is due to another cause such as a cold or the flu then it may not be correlated to ulcerative colitis.

, In other words, it is not a steady condition, but rather one that improves and worsens variably over time.


Some people have prolonged periods of remission of their ulcerative colitis, while others experience frequent flare-ups of the condition.

Stress can often affect this condition and make it worse.

, Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following, which could indicate worrisome bleeding:


Feeling unusually faint or lightheaded (which can be a sign of substantial blood loss)
Noticing red blood in your stool

, Potential complications to be aware of include:


A ""perforated colon"" — This is when you develop a hole in your colon at an area that is diseased.
""Toxic megacolon"" — This is when part of your colon becomes blocked with inflammation and subsequently swells to a very large size. This causes your colon to become thin-walled and dilated, and it can eventually become perforated.

, Inform your doctor if you are experiencing any of these as there are treatment options available.


Ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease, which is why other areas of the body can be affected. Treatment is focused on modulating and suppressing this response.

, These may include a comprehensive chemistry panel or complete metabolic panel measuring kidney function (creatinine, glomerular filtration rate), liver function, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium). Specifically, your doctor may look for:


Anemia (low hemoglobin), which may indicate blood loss from inflammation in your colon. This is measured by a complete blood count (CBC) measuring red blood cells (and their components), white blood cells (measures body's ability to fight infection), and platelet count (cells that help body clot or stop bleeding).
Elevated white blood cells, which may indicate infection or inflammation. This may also be determined by a CBC.

, Your doctor may test for blood (hemoglobin) in your stool, which again may be a sign of blood loss. A stool test can also look for elevated white blood cell counts, and can examine for possible infections (such as parasitic, bacterial, or viral infections) that may present similarly to ulcerative colitis.

, A tube is inserted through your anus and passed all the way up your large intestine. There is a camera at the end of it to examine each portion of your colon, looking for damage and inflammation that may be suggestive and/or diagnostic of ulcerative colitis.


Biopsies of suspicious areas of your colon can also be taken during a colonoscopy.
The biopsy samples can then be looked at by doctors under the microscope.
The appearance of the diseased tissue under the microscope can be used to confirm the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

, For instance, and x-ray and/or CT can pick up:


Bowel wall perforation (a hole in the bowel wall) due to the disease
""Toxic megacolon,"" which is a rapidly swelling colon due to a partial blockage from inflammation
Colon cancer, as having ulcerative colitis predisposes you to a higher likelihood of developing colon cancer

Discuss your weight loss goals with your doctor.,
Cool down for a couple hours a day.,
Keep your thermostat low.,
Use a cooling vest.,
Use ice packs on your upper body.,
Bathe in cold water.",How to Increase Brown Fat1," Before making changes to your habits, talk to your doctor about the health benefits of brown fat and the best way for you to increase it. They can help you develop a diet and exercise plan that is right for you. Tell them what your plan is - for instance, ""I'd like to use a cooling vest daily to increase my brown fat,"" - so they can caution you if your plan is risky for you.


Your doctor might refer you to a specialist like a dietitian or physical therapist.;
, People exposed to cold temperatures for 2 hours per day have shown an increase in their brown fat.This technique is not particularly pleasant, but can be effective because brown fat production is stimulated by cold temperatures.


Try to spend time daily in an environment that is between 14-19°C, or 57-66°F.
If you live in a cool climate, try taking a walk outside for a while each day. Dress warmly enough to stay safe, but limit layers so that your body cools down. Stay warm enough so that you’re not shivering.
Sit in an air-conditioned room in summer clothing for two hours a day., If you have an air-conditioner, keep it turned down to within the mid-60s F or cooler (about 18.5°C). Living in this environment at home or in your office may be enough to stimulate your body’s brown fat.Allow temperature fluctuation in your home so you’re not living at a comfortable 72° all year round. Ideally, keep your air conditioning going in summer and keep your heat low in winter.

, Cooling vests may help increase brown fat, and some companies are working to develop vests for this reason. Vests lower your body temperature more than just being in a cool room.You can purchase a cooling vest at some sporting goods stores or venues like Walmart.

, Place ice packs on your upper back and chest for about 30 minutes each day. Most brown fat is located in your neck and collarbone area, so stimulating this area with cold may be beneficial.Wrap the ice pack in a towel rather than placing it directly on your skin.
Research is still being done about whether or not cooling one part of your body is effective in increasing brown fat., Take cool or cold showers instead of warm showers, or at least take contrast showers where you alternate between having the water warm and cold. If it’s not too uncomfortable, you can also try sitting in an ice bath up to your waist for about 10 minutes three times per week.As an alternative, go for a swim in a chilly lake or pool.

Keep track of any upper back, leg, or side pain you may feel.,
Look out for shortness of breath, bad breath, and/or a metallic taste in your mouth.,
Take note if you suddenly become very itchy or have dry skin.,
Be aware that in some cases, there may be no noticeable symptoms until the later stages of the disease.,
Be aware of conditions leading to acute renal failure.,
Be aware of common causes of chronic renal failure.,
Learn about how renal failure is diagnosed.",How to Identify Renal Failure," Both acute and chronic renal failure are often accompanied by high urine output or no urine output. Chronic renal failure, specifically, is accompanied by urinary incontinence and/or recurrent urinary tract infections. Damage to the renal tubules results in polyuria, which means excess production of urine and usually occurs in the beginning stages of renal failure. Chronic kidney failure can also cause decreased amounts of urine, which usually occurs in more advanced forms of the condition. Other urinary changes may include:Proteinuria: During renal failure protein and red blood cells leak in the urine. Protein in the urine causes foamy urine.
Hematuria: Dark orange urine is the result of red blood cells in the urine.;
, One of the first signs of acute renal failure is fatigue. This may be due to anemia, which is when you don’t have enough oxygen-carrying red blood cells in your body; less oxygen makes you feel tired and cold. The onset of anemia is attributed to the fact that kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which triggers your bone marrow to make red blood cells. However, because the kidneys are damaged, they make less EPO, and hence fewer red blood cells are produced., Edema is the medical term for fluid buildup in your body, and it can occur in both acute and chronic renal failure. When your kidneys are no longer functioning as they should, fluid builds up in the cells and causes swelling. This happens mostly in the hands, feet, legs, and face., Dizziness, poor concentration, and mental apathy may be related to anemia, as not enough red blood cells are reaching your brain., Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) causes fluid filled cysts to build up in the kidneys and sometimes the liver; these can be painful. The fluid in the cysts contains toxins that can injure the nerves in the lower extremities, resulting in neuropathy, the disfunction of one or more of the peripheral nerves. Neuropathy, in turn, causes pain in the lower back and legs., As your kidneys begin to fail, metabolic waste products that are mostly acidic begin to accumulate in the body. The lungs will try to compensate for this high acidity by removing carbon-dioxide through hyperventilation. This will cause you to feel like you cannot catch your breath.There may also be water accumulation in the lungs, which makes it difficult to breathe normally. This is because the lungs cannot expand adequately during inspiration due to the surrounding fluid., Chronic renal failure causes pruritus (the medical term for itchiness). This itchiness is created as phosphorus builds up in your blood. All foods contain a certain amount of phosphorus, but some foods, such as dairy products, contain more phosphorus than others. Healthy kidneys are able to filter and remove phosphorus from the body. However, during chronic renal failure, phosphorus stays in your body and causes crystals to form on the skin, resulting in itching., This is especially true in the case of chronic renal failure; in this case, symptoms will only appear when the kidney can no longer remove waste products from the body or maintain water balance., Both acute and chronic renal failure are often preceded by certain medical conditions. If you know you have any of the following conditions, be especially wary of any kidney failure-like symptoms you may develop and promptly consult with your doctor for further guidance:Myocardial infarction, or heart attack.
Blockages of the urinary tract.
Rhabdomyolysis, or kidney damage due to muscle breakdown.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome, or the obstruction to the small vessels inside the kidney.

, If you notice symptoms attributed to renal failure and you have one of the following conditions, consult with your doctor for further guidance. Conditions which can lead to chronic renal failure include:Poorly controlled diabetes.
Longstanding hypertension, or high blood pressure.
Chronic glomerulonephritis, or the inflammation of tiny filters in the kidney.Certain genetic diseases like polycystic kidney disease, Alport’s syndrome, or Systemic Lupus.
Kidney stones.
Reflux nephropathy, or the backwards flow of urine back into the kidneys.

, A diagnosis of renal failure, chronic or acute, often takes the form of blood tests, imaging tests, urine output measurements, urine tests, or a kidney biopsy."

Take the recommended dose of turmeric if you are an adult.,
Look for turmeric supplements that contain lipids.,
Do not take turmeric supplements if you are on blood-thinning medication.,
Avoid taking turmeric supplements if you are on diabetes medication.",How to Improve Your Health with Turmeric1," There are currently no studies being done on turmeric supplements for children, so children should not take turmeric supplements.Adults can take turmeric supplements in capsule, fluid extract, or tincture form.


Have up to 500 mg a day of turmeric in capsule form.Take 30 to 90 drops of fluid extract turmeric a day.Have 15 to 30 drops of turmeric in tincture form, four times a day.;
, It can be difficult for your body to absorb turmeric if you are taking it on its own. The herb is not water soluble and as a result, 99% of the herb can go right through your body, with no absorption. Taking turmeric supplements with lipids, or fat, seems to increase its absorption rate., You should speak to your doctor before you take any herbal supplements, including turmeric supplements. If you are on blood thinning medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), and aspirin, you should avoid taking turmeric supplements. Turmeric supplements can strengthen the effects of these drugs, thereby raising your risk of internal bleeding.You should also avoid turmeric supplements if you are taking medication that reduces your stomach acid, as it can interfere with these drugs and increase the production of stomach acid to dangerous levels. Avoid turmeric supplements if you are on the following stomach acid medication: Cimetidine (Tagamet), Famotidine (Pepcid), Ranitidine (Zantac), Esomeprazole (Nexium), Omeprazole (Prilosec), Lansoprazole (Prevacid).

, Turmeric can increase your risk of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, so it should be avoided if you are on diabetes medication."

Exercise regularly.,
Work out in a cool environment.,
Sleep at least 8 hours nightly.,
Ask your doctor if you can switch your beta-blocker medication.",How to Increase Brown Fat2," Exercising may increase a hormone in your blood, irisin, that gets white fat in your body to act more like brown fat.This “beige” or “brite” fat – white fat acting like brown fat – may not be as beneficial as actual brown fat, but may help with weight loss.


Get your heart beating fast by jogging, swimming, walking briskly, dancing, or playing a sport. Try to get 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every day, or at least 5 days per week., Exercise in light clothing in a cool environment to boost your brown fat activity.This gives you the benefits of exercise and of keeping your body cool.


Don’t turn the heat up to increase how much you sweat. Being warmer will inhibit your brown fat.

, Melatonin is a chemical released in your brain more when you’re in darkness, which is why it’s related to sleep.Set a regular sleep schedule for yourself so that you get 7-9 hours of sleep every night. Poor sleep is linked to weight gain, and getting adequate sleep may stimulate brown fat activity.Melatonin supplements are sold in pharmacies and drug stores. Discuss the use of melatonin supplements with your doctor prior to using them.
Create healthy sleep habits such as sleeping in a cool, dark room and going to bed at the same time each night.

, Beta-blocker medications, which are common heart medicines, may decrease the amount of brown fat in your body.If you take these kinds of medicines, talk to your doctor about your weight goals and whether switching to a different medication is possible.


Do NOT stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor.

Don’t eat too much or too little.,
Get enough iron.,
Choose plant oils over animal fats when cooking.,
Have an apple a day.,
Eat more garlic.,
Drink green tea.,
Eat spicy peppers.,
Add turmeric to your meals.,
Consider a resveratrol supplement.",How to Increase Brown Fat3," Both eating too few calories and over consumption can decrease your brown fat and increase your white fat. Dieting can keep your white fat from turning to brown far while indulging too much both increases your white fat and interferes with brown fat’s ability to burn calories., Iron-deficiency may decrease the amount of brown fat in your body.Eat healthy foods rich in iron such as poultry, seafood, beans, dark leafy vegetables, peas, fortified grains, and dried fruit.Discuss with your doctor whether you need iron supplements – iron deficiency can be diagnosed with a simple blood test, and treated with over-the-counter supplements.


Having enough insulin is important in having enough iron, so be sure to regulate your insulin levels if you’re diabetic.
Having proper amounts of thyroid hormone is also important, so manage your hypothyroidism appropriately with your doctor., High fat diets may limit or decrease your brown fat.Eat a diet low in animal fats and rich in whole grains. There is no scientific evidence that proves eating certain things will increase brown fat, but some research shows that this and certain other foods have potential. Choose healthy fats by:


Cooking with coconut or olive oil instead of butter.
Eating fish and poultry instead of red meat.
Avoiding fast food, processed, and frozen foods.
Getting protein from whole grains and legumes like beans and peas.

, Apple peels contain a chemical called ursolic acid, which may increase brown fat stores. Eat unpeeled apples several times per week, especially before or after working out to minimize the apple’s fructose effect. Other foods that contain ursolic acid include:Dark fruits like cranberries, blueberries, plums, and prunes.
The herbs oregano, thyme, lavender, holy basil, peppermint, periwinkle, and hawthorne.
The herb bitter melon may also be beneficial.

, Studies have shown that ingesting garlic may increase the amounts Thermogenin (UCP1) in your body, which is an uncoupling protein found in brown tissue. Chop up some fresh garlic and throw it in with your olive oil when you cook meals., Enjoy a warm cup of green tea at least a few times a week. Green tea contains epigallocatechin gallate(EGCG), which contributes to fat burning by reducing insulin triglycerides and cholesterol.

Refrain from adding milk or cream to your tea as it will negate the white fat burning effects.

, The capsaicin found in spicy red peppers may activate brown fat.This is still being studied. Try including spicy peppers like cayenne, red chili peppers, and habanero.


Careful – habaneros are very spicy!

, The spice turmeric contains curcumin, which may help activate brown fat.Turmeric is an antioxidant that has been traditionally used for its health benefits. Scientists think it may even show promise in slowing cancer growth., Resveratrol, a plant product, can be purchased from your drug store or pharmacy. This compound may increase your brown fat stores.Discuss using any supplements with your doctor beforehand.

Combine “health” and “hedonism.” Yes, “healthonism” is a portmanteau, the combination of the sounds and concepts from two other words (for instance, “smog” as “smoke” and “fog”).,
Understand the phenomenon.,
Find examples of healthonism.,
Consider if there are deeper connections to this pairing.,
Consider why exercise and drinking seem to go together.,
Look into your brain’s response to both activities.,
Beware of excessive drinking after exercise.,
Remember your calorie balance.",How to Identify Healthonism," Creating new words in this way in order to identify new trends seems to be all the rage, and the seemingly growing trend of combining healthy activities with social drinking has joined the club.Hedonism generally refers to a belief system that emphasizes personal pleasure and its pursuit above other concerns. Typically, you don’t think of a hedonist being concerned with exercise routines or diabetes risk factors, so healthonism appears to refer to a trend with elements that come from opposite ends of the spectrum.;
, The trend-tracking organization J. Walter Thompson Intelligence included healthonism as part of its JWTI Future 100 for 2016, and, like many of the trends on the list, sees it as being driven primarily by millennials. Who exactly fits in the category of a “millennial” is up for debate, but for JWTI’s purposes, it refers to people roughly between the ages of 18 and 35 as of 2015.At its core, healthonism seems to derive from the growing awareness of the importance of health-conscious living, paired with the eternal desire of young people in particular to throw caution to the wind and live for today. It’s a modern spin on the old notion of “work hard, play hard” — be responsible enough of the time that you can be a bit irresponsible some of the time.

, Healthonist activities can take the form of “beer runs,” as you might find near a college campus, or wine-tasting 10k races. In particular, though, it tends to be associated with events at nightclubs, breweries, or other establishments where special events that combine planned exercise and party elements can occur.For instance, a club might hold an event that begins with an hour-long yoga session, followed by a drink-tasting event, followed by dancing. To add a bit more to the “health” side of things, the alcohol may focus on seemingly healthier mixers that use antioxidant-rich, organic, cold-pressed juices, for instance., Even J. Walter Thompson Intelligence notes that healthy behaviors (like eating better and exercising more) tend to pair together — as do unhealthy ones, for that matter — as opposed the the healthy / less healthy teaming of exercise and moderate-to-heavy drinking. Yet the organization also recognizes that there does seem to be something more than a new fad behind this pairing. After all, there have been “beer leagues” in softball and bowling far longer than millennials have been around.It turns out that scientists have also wondered about whether the anecdotal pairing of exercise with increased alcohol consumption has a basis in fact. And, the results indicate that there is indeed a correlation — on days when people exercise more, they are more likely to consume more alcohol than normal., Legitimate scientific research shows that, notwithstanding factors like age group or day of the week, increased exercise and increased alcohol consumption tend to happen on the same day. The trickier question, it turns out, is “why?”.At first blush, it may seem like some combination of “celebration” and “guilt” is the likely cause. That is, an individual wants to congratulate himself for completing a triathlon, so he enjoys a party and drinks heavily. Or, a person knows she’s going to be out all night partying, so she schedules a hard-core workout either the day before or after to make up for it.These factors can play a role in the pairing, but don’t seem to tell the whole story.

, Researchers have determined that the same area of the brain is stimulated by both physical exertion and alcohol consumption. Both of them activate your “neural reward circuitry,” creating feelings of pleasure. Exercise triggers this response because of the advantages of physical activity since humankind’s earliest times. Alcohol was embraced by our ancestors in part because they found that it just happens to trigger the same pleasure response based on its chemistry.Both exercise and alcohol spur a release of dopamine as well as endorphins, both of which stimulate the euphoric feeling you can get after a vigorous workout or a few drinks with friends.Since the two activities tend to make us feel the same, it is seemingly natural for us to want to pair them in order to multiply the effect — or to “keep the good times rolling.”

, Exercise and alcohol consumption may in fact be a natural pairing instead of the “odd couple” you might have assumed. This doesn’t necessarily make healthonism “healthy,” however. Too much of either activity (but especially drinking) — or too much of both — can have negative consequences, regardless of whether your brain rewards you with a pleasure response.


Excessive alcohol consumption after exercise impairs protein synthesis in your muscles, a process that is critical to muscle repair and building. So, basically, if you drink too much after exercising, you won’t physically recover as quickly, and any muscle-building benefits will be decreased. Moderate alcohol consumption should have limited or no negative impact in this area., Always keep in mind that alcoholic beverages are almost entirely empty calories without nutritional value. Also, don’t underestimate the calorie counts of alcoholic beverages, and the amount of exercise required to balance out those calories. Without burning off at least as many calories as you are taking in, there isn’t that much “health” to healthonism, after all.For instance, a pint of beer has approximately 180 calories, meaning it takes the average person about one-half hour of running to burn off two pints. Some simple math will tell you that if you go on a drinking binge, you’ll need to do a lot of running to make up for it.
Also, because alcohol is treated as a toxic substance by the body (hence the term “intoxication”), your body will focus on getting rid of the alcohol instead of other typical functions. This means, for example, that you may burn less fat by way of your workout if you consume excessive alcohol.

Wash your hands between classes.,
Carry hand sanitizer.,
Protect yourself from the cold.,
Get the flu shot.,
Avoid going to class when you are sick.,
Wear shower shoes.,
Keep your dorm or room clean.",How to Improve Your Health During Spring Semester1," When you go around school and college buildings, which are frequented by students, faculty, and staff, you come into contact with all of their germs. To prevent yourself from becoming sick from these germs, wash your hands whenever you touch desk, doorknobs, and other commonly used communal objects or spaces. To wash your hands properly:


Wet your hands with water.
Apply soap, scrubbing the backs of your hands, in between your fingers, and under your nails. Make sure you scrub for 20 seconds, which is the length of time it takes to hum 'Happy Birthday' twice.
Rinse them thoroughly with warm, clean water.
Dry them with a clean towel or air dry them.;
, When you are in a position where you can't wash your hands, hand sanitizer is a great way to help fight germs. If you are in class or in the library working with a group and can't manage to get to the bathroom to wash your hands, having hand sanitizer with you will help.


It isn't as good washing your hands, but it can help in the meantime.
To be effective, your hand sanitizer should be at least 60% alcohol., If you live in a climate where it is cold during parts of the spring semester, you need to protect yourself from the cold. Bundle up with a thick coat, layers, hats, and scarves to cut down on exposure as you walk between school buildings or to class. Cold weather suppress the immune system, which can make your more susceptible to cold, flu, and other medical issues.


You are also more likely to have respiratory problems during the winter months, as certain viruses tend to be seasonal (cold and flu viruses, for example)., If you are worried about getting the flu from other students, think about getting a flu shot. Peak flu season is February, which is right in the middle of spring semester. To protect yourself from getting sick and missing time in class, you need to avoid the flu., In order to protect yourself and others when you are feeling ill, stay home from school or class. This will help you get better faster and lessen the chance you will spread your illnesses to others. Plus, you won't be exposed to other illnesses while your immune system is compromised.Most classes have built in excused absences, so save them in case you get sick.
If you see someone else who is sick in class, avoid them as much as possible.

, College showers are communal, so always wear flip flops in the shower. This will cut down on the spread of viruses or bacteria from the shower that can cause athlete's foot and other issues.Keep your toiletries with you as well. Don't leave them in the bathroom so others cannot get germs on them.

, Clean your room at least once a week to help prevent the spread of germs. Since your dorm room is a communal space with at least one other person, their germs can get over your things. If you still live at home, your friends or family also have access to your room, which can cause the spread of germs.


Use disinfectant spray and wipes to clean off surfaces that are touched often."

You can buy whole yellow turmeric root in bulk and store them in the refrigerator for use within a month.Store whole turmeric root in an air-tight container, layering the roots between clean dry paper towels. Change the paper towels once they become damp so the roots do not mold.

, You can also find turmeric in powder form in the spice aisle of your local grocery store. It should appear bright yellow and often comes in a clear, glass bottle.

Inform your sexual partners.",How to Identify Cervicitis," Healthy women have vaginal discharge, which can vary in color, amount, and consistency over the course of the menstrual cycle. Abnormal discharge, however, can indicate cervicitis or another problem, so make an appointment with your doctor.Because vaginal discharge can vary so much, “abnormal” can mean a variety of things and can be defined differently by different women. That said, pay particular attention to any vaginal discharge with an unusual odor, color, or appearance.;
, Bleeding between your menstrual periods could be a sign of cervicitis. Because the tissue is more delicate, an inflamed cervix bleeds more easily than a normal cervix. Call your doctor if you notice this symptom.You may notice, in particular, that you have spotting after sexual intercourse. This can also be a symptom of cervicitis. Spotting during sexual intercourse can be a symptom of other issues besides cervicitis so you should get it checked regardless.

, Pain during intercourse, also known as dyspareunia, is a common symptom and can indicate a variety of problems, including cervicitis. Make an appointment with your doctor to discuss the issue (along with any other symptoms you may have). There’s no reason to assume that pain during intercourse is normal or unavoidable., Some women with cervicitis experience an uncomfortable feeling of bloating, pressure, or heaviness in the lower abdomen. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have this problem.


Heaviness in your lower abdomen can be a symptom of other medical issues. You should get it checked out whether or not you suspect you may have cervicitis.

, Women with cervicitis sometimes experience related inflammation in the vagina (causing vaginal itching, dryness, and discomfort during intercourse) or urinary tract (causing frequent urination, painful urination, and, sometimes, blood in the urine).


These symptoms are not technically signs of cervicitis itself, but they do suggest co-infections, so see your doctor regardless.

, In addition to the symptoms above, there are some signs of cervicitis that occur very rarely, usually only in those few cases in which an infection starts as cervicitis as then spreads to the rest of the body. These symptoms include:Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
A general feeling of sickness

, Do not attempt to diagnose cervicitis yourself. The symptoms are easily confused with other conditions, such as yeast infections, and more importantly, your cervicitis may have developed because of a serious infection, like an STI, which requires medical treatment., Your doctor will likely perform a pelvic exam as a first step in diagnosing cervicitis. They will insert a speculum and observe your cervix, making note of any redness, ulcerations, inflammation, swelling, or abnormal discharge., If your pelvic exam reveals signs of cervicitis, your doctor will order applicable lab tests, including a culture of your cervical discharge, a culture of the cervical cells themselves, and, if you are sexually active, tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and other sexually transmitted infections.Depending on the results of these tests, understand that your doctor may order additional testing, including a possible biopsy or colposcopy (an examination with a special magnifying device) of the cervix.

, There are two basic categories of cervicitis: infectious and non-infectious. Infectious cervicitis is much more common than non-infectious cervicitis. Your doctor will tell you which type you have.Infectious cervicitis develops due to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) like gonorrhea or chlamydia. The association between these STIs and infectious cervicitis is so strong, in fact, that your doctor may start treating you for STIs immediately, even before the specific diagnosis is confirmed.
Non-infectious cervicitis is much less common. Causes include foreign objects, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and cervical caps; allergic reactions to latex, which can develop after intercourse using latex condoms; and douches and other vaginal washes.
Your doctor may also refer to “acute” or “chronic” cervicitis. In general, acute cervicitis is infectious; chronic cervicitis is non-infectious.

, For infectious cervicitis, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics to treat infections like chlamydia or antiviral medications to treat conditions like genital herpes. They may also recommend taking hormones like progesterone and estrogen or, in rare cases, glucocorticosteroids, to help with inflammation.Side effects of these medications include nausea, upset stomach, and fatigue. Your doctor should outline the side effects of these medications before prescribing them to you.

, For non-infectious cervicitis, antibiotic and antiviral medications will not eliminate the problem. Therefore, your doctor may suggest one of three surgical treatment options. The first, electrocauterization, is a surgical procedure in which a doctor removes unwanted tissue with electricity., Your doctor may also recommend cryosurgery for cases of non-infectious cervicitis. Cryosurgery (a word that comes from the Greek for “icy hand work”) involves the use of extreme cold to “freeze off” or eliminate abnormal tissue., Your doctor may also recommend laser therapy for cases of non-infectious cervicitis. Laser therapy is the use of intense beams of light to burn, destroy, or precisely cut unwanted tissue., While pursuing treatment options with your doctor, you can also take steps to minimize your discomfort. Avoid anything that might irritate your vagina or cervix: douches, vaginal rinses, harsh soaps, and sexual intercourse should all be eliminated.

, If your cervicitis is infectious, make sure your sexual partners also seek treatment. Be aware that even if they have no symptoms, they can be infected, and they can re-infect you, even after you’ve followed the treatment regimen recommended by your doctor."

Keep track of information at the hospital.,
Speak with the post-transplant coordinator.,
Plan to keep all appointments.",How to Help Someone Recover From a Kidney Transplant1," During the procedure itself, trust the transplant team to do their job. You can help by ensuring that all of the recipient’s medical records and insurance information are ready for the hospital’s consideration. Further, write down anything the medical team tells you about how to help the recipient recover. Pay particular attention to advice about medication, lab tests, and other aspects of necessary follow-up care.The recipient will be placed in intensive care for one to two days following the transplant. They will likely stay at the hospital for several days to a week.;
, The recipient’s transplant team will include someone who is responsible for monitoring patient’s recovery. This person will be your main contact following the transplant, and will be able to answer any questions that arise during follow up care.Introduce yourself as the person who will be helping the recipient recover.
The coordinator may have an information packet or other materials that can help you. It may also improve your ability to reach them later on if you make a personal connection at the hospital.

, Even when kidney transplants are successful, the recipient will need to see the transplant team every one or two weeks for the year after the procedure. After that, they still need to visit the team annually.Make sure you attend the first appointment following the procedure. Note the date, time, and location when you’re still at the hospital. Make sure you have the appropriate phone number in case you need to reschedule.
After the first year, plan for annual visits around the time of year that the procedure occurred.
Feel free to reach out to the post-transplant coordinator at any time if you have questions about the recipient’s recovery.

Be aware that anxiety and depression are common among college students.,
Avoid negative coping strategies.,
Know how to get help.,
Learn to manage stress in a healthy way.,
Get help immediately if you are considering suicide.",How to Improve Your Health During Spring Semester2," In 2014, 86.4% of students surveyed by the Spring 2014 National College Health Assessment reported feeling overwhelmed by all they had to do within the last year. 54% reported feeling overwhelming anxiety, 32.6% reported feeling so depressed that it was difficult to function, and 8.1% seriously considered suicide.College is often the first time young adults are away from home for a long period of time and free to make major decisions that may impact the rest of their lives.This causes a considerable amount of anxiety, along with the desire to succeed, as college has become extremely expensive.
The lack of sleep that is experienced by many college students can have a major impact on mental health and coping skills. Make sure you are getting enough rest, even if it means you have to turn down some party invitations, drop a class, or participate in fewer clubs and extracurriculars. You want to make the most of your college experience, but you need to be well-rested to stay healthy mentally and physically.
Learn the signs and symptoms of depression and anxiety so you can identify if you or a friend is suffering.

, Many people may turn to binge drinking, drug abuse and risky sexual behavior in an attempt to cope with their uncomfortable feelings. Unfortunately, these coping strategies are not only dangerous, they can make your uncomfortable feelings even worse.


Binge drinking is defined as drinking five or more alcoholic drinks on the same occasion at least one day out of the last month.According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAA), ""More than 97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are victims of alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape.""1,825 college students in that age group die each year from alcohol-related injuries, and more than 150,000 develop an ""alcohol-related health problem.""The ""hook up"" culture that is often linked to excessive alcohol consumption has been linked to increased anxiety, depression, and drinking.If you are using alcohol, drugs, or sex to cope with negative feelings, talk to a trusted friend and seek out the help of a mental health professional.

, It may seem daunting, but getting help and talking to someone is the first step toward feeling better.Your college or university should have mental health or counseling services available to students, or should have the resources to connect you to a mental health professional in the community.There may also be clubs on campus, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) that offers peer-to-peer support.Try using the search option on ULifeline to find resources on your campus.
If you are not ready to seek professional help, try opening up to a trusted friend, family member, or professor.

, Stress is an unavoidable part of life, but there are ways you can eliminate unnecessary stress and cope with stressors. Becoming a healthy adult means learning healthy, productive ways to deal with stress in your life.


Learn more about time management. People aren't born knowing how to juggle school, work, friends, family, hobbies, etc. It's a skill that you can learn at any time. One thing that may help is learning to say ""No"" so that you don't take on more than you can handle.Set goals and stop procrastinating. Putting things off to the last minute can cause your stress levels to skyrocket.
Try journaling to help you understand your emotions, work through important decisions, and get any worries out of your head and down on paper.Find support through friends and family. These people can listen to you vent, help you through hard times, as well as laugh and celebrate with you. Don't try to deal with your stress on your own — the people who care about you will be happy to help.
Identify and work on changing negative thought patterns. Often, people fall into unproductive thought patterns, focusing on what they think they should or shouldn't do, seeing thing as black or white, catastrophizing, focusing on only the negative and discounting the positive, and more.Learning to challenge these thoughts, and learning more healthy ways to think, can do wonders for your mental health and stress levels.

, Suicide is the third-leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 24.1 in 10 college students has made a plan for suicide, and there are more than 1,000 suicides on college campuses every year.If you are considering suicide, call a friend or family member, or 1-800-SUICIDE or 1-800-273-TALK for immediate assistance. If you feel you are in immediate danger, call 911 or your local emergency number.You can also check yourself into the emergency room to keep yourself safe from harming yourself. Warning signs of suicide include:


Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live.
Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain.
Talking about being a burden to others.
Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs.
Sleeping too little or too much.
Withdrawn or feeling isolated.
Preoccupation with death.
Making arrangements; setting one's affairs in order.
Giving things away, such as prized possessions.

Get plenty of sleep each night.,
Avoid all nighters.,
Set up a sleep schedule with your roommate.,
Don't take on too much.,
Cut back on caffeinated or sugary beverages.",How to Improve Your Health During Spring Semester3," Although school can be stressful, don't cut back on sleep in order to keep up with your studies, extra curricular activities, and work. Losing sleep can put you at an increased risk of sickness, fatigue, and other health problems because it weakens your immune system. Instead, prioritize sleeping at least seven to nine hours a night.


Lack of sleep can also lead to burn out, which can be detrimental to your grades once finals start at the end of spring semester.Lack of sleep can increase chances for increased anxiety and depression as well.

, Although you may need to cram for an exam before a test or work on a paper before it's due, try not to pull an all-nighter. This can mess up your sleep routine and cause you to get behind on your normal sleep schedule.


If you can't avoid pulling an all-nighter, use naps throughout the next day or go to bed early the next night to help decrease your sleep debt.Be aware that studying through the night is not an effective way to study — sleep is a vital part of memory retention, in particular when converting short-term memories into long-term ones.So, if you do remember what you studied for the exam, chances are you will forget it in the long-term.

, If you are having trouble syncing up your sleep schedule with your roommate, have a talk with them. Come to an agreement that will benefit your both. This can include studying in a common space once you go to bed, using headphone to cut down on music or video noise, or using smaller lamps on their side of the room., It may be tempting to try to do everything on campus or join every after school organization; however, this can cause problems with your health and grades. If you overextend yourself, you are at larger risk of getting sick. Only take on what you can feasibly do while maintaining your sleep schedule, health, and GPA.This can be even harsher during spring semester because the break you have between semesters is shorter than summer break.

, Although going to the coffee shop with your friends can be fun, drinking too much caffeine can cause you to be too jittery to sleep. Sugary beverages can have the same effect. This can cause you to lose sleep over time, which can be detrimental to your health.


Try to drink decaffeinated coffee or use all natural non-sugary sweeteners."

Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.,
Add a vitamin D supplement.,
Get more dairy.,
Avoid skipping breakfast.,
Drink green tea.,
Avoid drinking too much alcohol.",How to Improve Your Health During Spring Semester4," Your immune system needs plenty of nutrients to stay healthy. The best way to get this is through having five servings each of fruits and vegetables per day. Have them at each meal as well as part of your snacks.If you are in a rush to make it to class, throw an apple in your bag or a few baby carrots in container to eat throughout the day.
Look for healthy vegetables from your college dining hall during your meals. Keeping these incorporated into your daily meals, even when you are away from home, will help keep you healthier during your semester., Spring semester starts when you have access to limited sun exposure in the northern hemisphere. In summer months, you can get plenty of vitamin D from the sun. However, the sun if farther away during winter and spring months and gives off only weak rays, which means you need to get your vitamin D from other sources.


Take a 1,000 IU to 2,000 IU vitamin D supplement every day to help boost your immune system as well as your mood.
If you are really far north, the sun may not provide you with any vitamin D at all, which is called vitamin D winter. In these cases, you should make sure you take at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day.
If you live in the southern hemisphere, the time of year you don't get enough vitamin D will vary., Dairy products have high amounts of vitamin A and B12, both of which help boost your immune system. During the spring semester, try to add more dairy into your diet, such as yogurt, milk, and cheese. Some of these products can have a high fat content, so look for those make with 2% or skim milk.


String cheese and cups of yogurt are easy to take along with you to class and will help boost your immunity. The bacteria in Greek yogurt help fight many of the germs common during the winter months, so try to incorporate a serving of it a day into your diet., Although it may be tempting to skip breakfast when you are rushing to school or class, this can decrease your health. Starting your day off with a hearty breakfast of oatmeal, porridge, or cereal with some fruits or vegetables to go with it will keep you fuller longer and boost your immune system early in the day.If you don't have a ton of time, try making a smoothie with fruits, vegetables, and even grains you can take with you to class.

, The winter and cooler spring months of spring semester are a great time to drink tea to keep warm. Try drinking green tea, which helps your immune system fight against oxidants and radicals that can cause illness.Buy a thermos or travel mug so you can take a cup with you to class. This will help boost your immunity throughout the day with the added bonus of keeping you warm.

, Although it may be fun to go out and party with your friends, avoid drinking too much alcohol. It can lower your immune function and put you at risk of getting sick.


Hangovers can also make you sick and lower your cognitive functioning."

Help keep medication consistent.,
Watch for side effects.,
Limit sun exposure.,
Encourage helpful medication habits.",How to Help Someone Recover From a Kidney Transplant2," Kidney transplant recipients require immunosuppression medications for the rest of their life. Familiarize yourself with each of the medications the recipient will need, as well as dosages and frequency the medication needs to be taken.Fill out a calendar with the dates, times, and amounts that each medication needs to be taken. Explain the calendar to the recipient and post it somewhere they will frequently and easily see it in their home.

, Ask the doctor that prescribes the recipient’s medications about any side effects the medications may cause. Monitor for these side effects and other symptoms the recipient mentions. Write them down. Be sure to notify their medical team about any effects the medications have., Some of the medications commonly prescribed to transplant recipients may make them more susceptible to skin cancer. Accordingly, encourage the recipient to wear 20 SPF or stronger sunblock. Further, limit the amount of time the recipient spends in direct sunlight., Direct the recipient to keep their medications with them at all times. Tell them not to take any other medication, including over-the-counter medicine, without letting a doctor know first. Explain that it is extremely important that they continue to take their medications until directly otherwise.If other containers are used to hold medications, ensure that they are labeled with names and dosage information.
Discard outdated medication or medication a doctor says is no longer needed.
If the recipient travels, direct them to keep medication with them, not in their checked luggage.

Remind them to wash their hands.,
Handle pets for the recipient.,
Limit exposure to other people.,
Watch for signs of rejection.",How to Help Someone Recover From a Kidney Transplant3," Preventing infection, which may lead to the recipient’s body rejecting their new kidney, is vital. In particular, remind them to wash their hands after eating, handling food, touching anything unclean, or going to the restroom.Wash your own hands before spending time with them as well.

, If possible, a transplant recipient should avoid direct contact with pets, especially for a few months following the procedure. Never allow the recipient to handle pet waste with bare hands, and convey that it’s important for them not to do so.If you take care of pet waste for them, wear gloves and mask. Dispose of everything in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.
Ask the transplant coordinator for more information about pets in the recipient’s home.

, Other people, especially in large groups, can cause a risk of infection for someone following a transplant. During the eight weeks following the procedure, instruct the recipient to keep house guests to a minimum. Anyone with a cold or other infection should be kept away from the recipient. Young children should also be kept away from recipients for this time period.Do not allow the recipient to eat from a salad bar or buffet.
Instruct the recipient to avoid churches, theaters, malls, and other places with large numbers of people.

, If any signs of infection arise, contact the post-transplant coordinator immediately. You may need to bring the recipient to the hospital immediately. In particular, watch out for the following:High fever or flu-like symptoms, including chills, aches, dizziness, or nausea and vomiting.
Pain or tenderness in the abdomen.
Noticeable swelling elsewhere on the body, or sudden weight gain greater than 4 pounds within 24 hrs.
A substantial decrease in the need to urinate.

Return to physical activity slowly.,
Ask their doctor about exercise specifics.,
Increase activity gradually.,
Don’t allow heavy lifting.,
Do not ignore pain or irregular heartbeats.",How to Help Someone Recover From a Kidney Transplant4," A kidney transplant recipient may be able to walk the day after their surgery! However, you should encourage someone to take it slow in terms of physical activity following the procedure. That said, once the recipient is feeling up to it, help them begin to work physical activity back into their daily schedule. While taking care to prevent injury, light exercise can actually speed recovery.Once the incision is healed, have the recipient start with gentle stretching and walking. Make sure these types of exercises are comfortable and easily manageable three or four days in one week before allowing them to exercise more actively.

, As the kidney recipient becomes more capable of physical movement, have them talk to their doctor about the amount of activity they should be getting. They will help identify the appropriate amount of movement and exercise. Great questions for the patient to ask include:How much should I be exercising?
What types of exercise should I favor? Which types should I avoid?
Does exercise affect my recommended medicine schedule?

, Once the recipient is comfortable doing so, encourage daily aerobic exercise. Jogging, cycling, tennis, and swimming are all great options. Direct them to exercise about 20 to 30 minutes every other day. This will help them recover their strength and keep both their mind and body happy and healthy.Direct the recipient to avoid contact sports unless a doctor tells them they are healthy enough to participate.

, For about eight weeks after the surgery, prevent the recipient from lifting anything heavy. For two to three months afterwards, don’t let them handle anything that weighs more than 20 pounds. Don’t let them lift anything heavier than 40 pounds for at least four months., If the recipient is fatigued or breathing heavily, have them reduce the amount of exercise they’re undertaking. There are certain signs of risk related to exercise that you should watch out for. If an irregular or fast heartbeat persists for more than 15 minutes after exercise, contact their doctor for instructions.If the recipient reports exercise-induced pain, tone down the amount or types of exercise they’re doing.
If they experience weakness, dizziness, or lightheadedness, have them stop exercising for the day.

"
Help drive them around.,
Be aware of gender-specific issues.,
Insist they quit smoking.",How to Help Someone Recover From a Kidney Transplant5," For at least six weeks, the transplant recipient should not be driving. Plan ahead to make sure you or someone else can help get them out of the house, particularly to doctor’s visits. Aside from doctor’s visits, be sure to bring the recipient to parks and other relatively secluded areas outdoors. It can improve both mental and physical recovery to get out of the house and spend time outdoors., A female kidney recipient should not become pregnant for at least a year following her surgery. Further, ensure that she gets annual pap smears and mammograms following the procedure, as medications may make her more susceptible to certain types of cancer. Men that receive a transplant may struggle to maintain erections.Have the recipient direct any concerns about fertility or sexuality to their doctor.
If a woman has a baby while taking immunosuppressive medication, advise her to discuss feeding options with her doctor. Immunosuppressive medications can be passed through breastmilk and are harmful to the baby.

, Smoking increases the risk of infection, which can put a kidney recipient in grave danger. Aside from other diseases, the risk of cancer is also greatly increased by smoking following a transplant. Further, smoking decreases your ability to heal and can worsen some of the dangerous side effects of immunosuppressive medications.Help them quit smoking by finding resources and support groups available in your area that are designed to help people quit.

Use protection.,
Get tested often.,
Be careful when you go out.,
Talk to your partner about any issues you have.",How to Improve Your Health During Spring Semester6," When you are sexually active, you should always use condoms. This will help prevent unwanted pregnancies as well as sexually transmitted diseases. Even if you are on birth control, you should use protection because birth control does not prevent sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, crabs, gonorrhea, and HIV/AIDS.


You should also use protection if you have oral sex as well. Sexually transmitted diseases can be transferred as well.
Even if you are a woman, carry condoms with you. You cannot expect the guy to always have some with him. This way, you know you will always be safe., If you are sexually active, you should get tested often. Even if you use protection every time, you should still get tested to ensure your sexual health. Herpes, HPV, syphilis, pubic lice, and scabies can all be transmitted even if you use a condom, as they are spread by skin-to-skin contact, not bodily fluids.Just because you get tested does not mean you do not need to use protection in the future., When you go to a party, avoid sharing drinks with other people. You can get sick from other people's germs. Also avoid kissing or getting together with people that are sick, which can cause you to get sick.


Always keep a watch on your drink as well because you may be at risk of it being drugged., When you are young and in a sexual relationship, you may feel uncomfortable talking to your partner about issues, concerns, or desires you may have. In order to keep yourself mentally as well as physically healthy, make sure you are honest and listen to your body.


Don't be afraid to be honest. This is the best way to stay mentally healthy."

Though vitamins derived from whole foods may be more expensive, this will ensure the vitamin is of the highest quality.Keep in mind vitamin supplements are not strictly regulated by the Federal Drug Association (FDA) and are only loosely regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). It is the responsibility of the manufacturers to test the safety of their products and to label their products properly.

, Many supplements use independent labs to test their products and receive seals of approval for their quality. Look on the label of the supplements from seals of approval from Consumer Labs, the Natural Products Association (NPA), LabDoor, and the United States Pharmacopeia.You can also go directly to the websites of any of these independent labels to see if the manufacturer of the supplement is listed with seals of approval. However, if the supplement does not have any seals of approval, this does not necessarily mean the product is faulty. Getting checked and approved by an independent lab is completely voluntary for supplement manufacturers.

, Folate is vitamin B12 that is naturally found in many foods, but folic acid is the synthetic form of folate and should be avoided.Taking supplements with folic acid can actually hide a vitamin B12 deficiency, if you have one. Consuming too much folic acid can also increase your risk of certain cancers.

, Fish such as trout, salmon, tuna, and haddock all contain high levels of vitamin B12. Clams are also naturally high in vitamin B12. As well, beef products, including beef liver, are high in vitamin B12. Try to add more fish and beef to your diet by having at least one serving a day., Dairy products like yogurt and cheese, as well as eggs, are also high food sources of vitamin B12.Whole wheat cereal is also known to have high levels of vitamin B12. Add whole wheat cereal to your diet by having one bowl a day for breakfast with fruit.

, Vitamin B12 is not found at high levels in plant foods, so individuals with a plant based diet should make sure they are having more food sources of Vitamin B12. Vegetarians and vegans should consider taking vitamin B12 supplements to avoid developing a vitamin B12 deficiency., B12 is necessary for your body to produce enough hemoglobin.If you develop a vitamin B12 deficiency, you may also develop a form of anemia called megaloblastic anemia. Once you have this form of anemia, you can experience symptoms like fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, and constipation.You may also experience tingling or numbness in your hands and feet, balance issues, soreness of the mouth or tongue, and depression. Taking vitamin B12 supplements and having more vitamin B12 high foods can help to prevent the development of anemia.

, If you are an expectant mother, you should make sure you are taking vitamin B12 supplements and eating vitamin B12 rich foods while pregnant and while breastfeeding. This can reduce the likelihood of birth defects in your baby, such as neural tube defects, movement disorders, developmental delays, and megaloblastic anemia., Vitamin B12 has been shown to help reduce the chances of developing heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and osteoporosis.Taking vitamin B12, as well as folate and vitamin B6, can lower the level of homocysteine in your system, which is a substance that acts as a biomarker for heart disease. Though taking vitamin B12 cannot prevent heart disease, it can significantly reduce your chances of developing it.

Receive treatment.",How to Train Your 'V Shaped' Walking Style to a Straight Style," Observe how you stand and walk. If your feet are automatically in a V-shape, watch the extent to which they turn out to help you figure out the extent to which you need to turn you feet inwards.Use a mirror to watch your feet. Make sure to observe your feet as you stand and as you are walking.Ask a friend or family member to watch or photograph you for further reference.
Pay attention to how you walk for a few days or a week. This may help you identify problem areas or the ways in which you are exacerbating your V-shaped walk.;
, It may be easiest to help correct your walk by using a treadmill. This will allow you to gradually increase your speed as your gait straightens out.


Start very slowly, at around 1.0mph to allow you to make sure you are placing your feet one in front of the other and in a straight fashion. From here, you can gradually increase your speed.
If you do not have access to a treadmill, walk on a flat surface, such as a paved road or sidewalk. Ask a friend or family member to go with you and walk behind you to help make sure you are walking slowly and using a straight stride.
Aim to walk every day for at least a few minutes to reinforce your gait training. This can also help strengthen your legs and feet.

, As you begin walking regularly, it’s important to pay close attention to your walking form and correct yourself as needed.This can help ensure that you don’t injure or harm yourself or exacerbate your eversion.When you are walking, make sure that you are:


Holding your head high
Looking straight ahead and not at the ground
Keeping your chin parallel to the ground
Allowing your shoulders to move naturally
Maintaining a neutral, straight back that is arched neither forward nor backward
Lightly engaging your abdominal muscles
Swinging your arms freely
Striking with your heel and then rolling it to your foot., It may feel strange or even uncomfortable at first to correct your gait. Don’t get frustrated and keep working at your gait on a regular basis. Over time, your new walking style will begin to feel more normal and natural.Give yourself positive affirmations whenever you work on your walk or notice that you are improving. For example, say “I’ve been working hard at walking straight and my muscles are sore, which means that my body is responding to my corrections.”Speak to a friend, family member, or even a counselor if you get frustrated. They may offer your positive reinforcement and encouragement to continue., On a regular basis, it’s important to reassess your progress and your gait. This can help you decide whether to increase your speed in your training or see if you need to make other minor corrections to your gait.Look at how you are walking once a week or once every two weeks, which could give you sufficient time to begin noticing changes.Use a mirror to look at your gait and ask a friend to take a picture to help plot your progress.
Increase your speed if you notice that you are walking straight. Make sure to only increase slightly, no more than 0.5mph. This can help minimize the risk of you falling back into old patterns because you’re walking too fast.

, Some people walk with a v-shaped gait due to flat feet. This is when the soles of your feet make full contact with the floor when you stand on it.This can be a painful condition, but wearing arch supports can help.You can purchase arch supports in a drug store, grocery store, or department store.
You can also see a podiatrist for custom arch supports.

, Eversion is most common in younger children, though even in these cases it is still relatively uncommon.There are many different causes of eversion and learning about them may help you identify if you have a problem and get help in a timely manner. Causes of eversion include:


Flat feet, or pes planus
External tibial torsion, or an outward twisting of the leg bone
Hip contracture, or externally rotated hips
Femoral retroversion, or having a thighbone (femur) that is angled backwards., Beyond having feet that point in a “V-shape,” people who have eversion exhibit other signs or symptoms. By identifying potential symptoms, you may be able to get a definitive diagnosis and timely treatment. Some symptoms of eversion include:


Functional difficulties, including walking.
Pain around the front of the knee.Hip tightness.Hip or lower back pain.Discomfort may also be present in your neck and head as your body tries to maintain a straight posture.Weakness in the knees, ankles, or hips., Whenever you are walking, running, or doing other types of exercise, notice if you experience any pain or unusual sensations. This can help you identify potential problems and get help minimize the risk of developing a more serious problem.


Note any symptoms you have, when they start and how severe they are.
Be aware of anything that relieves your V-shaped walk or makes related pain go away.

, If you have pronounced symptoms and/ or pain, or attempts to correct your gait don’t seem to be successful, schedule an appointment with your doctor. She can assess your walk, make a definitive diagnosis, and prescribe proper treatment for your V-shaped walk.Tell your doctor when you first noticed your walk or if you’ve always had it.
Explain any pain or other symptoms you have.
Allow your doctor to examine your walk or your lower body to help make an assessment of what is causing your V-shaped walk. Your doctor may also prescribe tests to better view your bones and muscles, which could also help her make a more definitive diagnosis and formulate the right treatment for you.

, Your doctor may want to have a more in-depth look at your bones and muscles after examining your external structures. Further testing, such as an MRI, can help her more clearly assess what is causing your abnormal gait and formulate proper treatment for you. You could undergo any of the following tests:


A neurological examination that tests motor skills
Imaging tests such as computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET), all of which can help your doctor examine your lower body structure in greater detail.

, Depending on your doctor’s diagnosis and the severity of your V-shaped walk, you may need treatment. Not only can this correct your walk but also relieve pain and structural problems you may have.Typical treatments for out-toeing include:


Leaving the condition to heal on its own, which is a common treatment for children.Operating to rotate and correct structural abnormalities.
Wearing foot orthotics or braces.Be aware that some studies show little resolution of out-toeing with shoes, braces, physical therapy or chiropractic manipulation."

Evaluate for the presence of blood in any vomit.If you have been throwing up, take note if it is a red or dark red color.,
Have a blood test for anemia.Another way to tell if you are losing blood is to have a blood test to measure your hemoglobin levels.,
Test for the presence of blood in your stool.Blood from an upper GI bleed most commonly presents as dark (often black) tarry-looking stools.,
Assess for the presence of peptic ulcer risk factors.Peptic ulcers are the number one most common source of upper GI bleeds (responsible for 62%).,
Opt for an ""upper GI endoscopy.,
Have a ""gastric lavage.,
Be aware of the possible causes of an upper GI bleed.The most common cause of upper GI bleeding is peptic ulcers, which account for 62% of cases.,
Ensure that your vital signs are stable first.If you are in fact diagnosed with an upper GI bleed, the first thing your doctor will want to do is to ensure that you are stable.,
Opt for a blood transfusion if needed.Depending upon your degree of blood loss, you may need a blood transfusion to keep you stable while the doctors work to resolve the underlying cause of your GI bleed.,
Resolve the source of the upper GI bleed.The key to treating an upper GI bleed is to identify the source, and to effectively stop the bleeding.,
Take PPI medication.,
Receive appropriate follow-up as needed.Finally, it is important to understand that a percentage of people experience re-bleeding following treatment.",How to Test for Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding," This may indicate the presence of blood in your vomit, which could be a sign of an upper GI bleed. If you are vomiting blood, it is important to see a medical professional immediately.;
, If your hemoglobin is low, it is called ""anemia,"" and it means that you may be losing blood which could be causing the low hemoglobin counts.


While anemia (low hemoglobin) does not necessarily correlate to an upper GI bleed, it is certainly suspicious of digestive tract bleeding.

, Blood in the stool can be suspected based on the appearance of your stools. It can also be tested for directly via a laboratory test.


In the lab test (called the FOBT - fecal occult blood test, or the FIT test which is the newer version) you submit a sample of stool to the lab.
The stool is then looked at under the microscope for the presence of hemoglobin.
If it tests positive for hemoglobin, this correlates to having blood in the stool which may very well be caused by an upper GI bleed.

, Therefore, if you are trying to test for or diagnose an upper GI bleed, knowing the risk factors and likelihood of peptic ulcers will give you a good indication of where to look as the first possible place for the bleed. Risk factors that suggest that a peptic ulcer may be the source of the bleed include:


Testing positive for the presence of H. Pylori bacteria in your stomach.
Taking NSAID medication (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen), which predispose to the formation of peptic ulcers.

,""An upper GI endoscopy is where a tube is inserted down your esophagus, through your stomach, and into the upper part of your small intestine. There is a camera at the end of it, allowing the doctor to examine the various aspects of your upper GI tract.


If and when the source of your upper GI bleed is located, it can also be stopped via upper GI endoscopy as small procedural repairs can be conducted through the tube.

,""Because the stomach (or other areas of the upper GI tract) may begin to pool with blood in the case of an upper GI bleed, it may make it very challenging to see and to determine the source of the bleed via upper GI endoscopy. If the view is obscured by pooled blood, a gastric lavage will likely be performed.


This essentially ""cleans"" or ""washes"" the blood out of the stomach and GI tract so that the view improves and the source of the bleed can be found.

, Note that taking NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Ibuprofen) is one of the major risk factors for peptic ulcer bleeding. If you are diagnosed with peptic ulcers, you will likely be advised to discontinue any NSAID medications you may be taking and replace them with alternative medical treatments. Other possible causes of upper GI bleeding include:


Bleeding of abnormal blood vessels in the esophagus (called ""esophageal varices"")
Tearing of the blood vessels in the esophagus due to force such as forceful vomiting (called ""Mallory-Weiss tears"")
Stomach, esophageal, or intestinal cancer
Inflammation or irritation of the stomach (called ""gastritis"")
Inflammation or irritation of the upper portion of the small intestine (called ""duodenitis"")
An esophageal ulcer

, In other words, he or she will want to make sure that the degree of blood loss is not causing your blood pressure to fall, your heart rate to rise, and your vital signs to overall be compromised as you continue to lose more and more blood.


Your doctor will measure your vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
If he or she is worried about the rate at which you are losing blood, and/or your degree of blood loss, you will most likely be sent to the hospital where you can be stabilized and/or resuscitated if needed.

, A blood transfusion can be performed in the hospital, if your condition is severe enough to warrant it.

, In general, once the source of the bleeding has been identified via an upper GI endoscopy and possible gastric lavage to improve the camera's view, the doctors will follow a couple of steps for treatment. These are:


An epinephrine injection at the site of the bleed. Epinephrine constricts blood vessels, thus diminishing the blood flow to the area and reducing the rate of the bleed, if not temporarily stopping the bleed altogether.
A band, or clip, or other form of ""ligation"" at the site of bleeding (in other words, a mechanism to close the bleed in a more permanent way than that offered by a simple epinephrine injection). This can be performed at the same time as the upper GI endoscopy, using the camera to view it and small instruments to perform the procedure.

, PPI medication (proton pump inhibitors) have been shown to overall reduce bleeding and to improve the outlook with upper GI bleeds. While their mechanism of action is incompletely understood, your doctor will most likely offer you this medication either for a short while or on an ongoing basis, depending upon the nature (and source) of your bleed.


If the source of your bleed is peptic ulcers, PPIs will likely be recommended long-term to decrease the chances of a future ulcer bleed.
Also, if you are diagnosed with peptic ulcers and test positive for H. Pylori bacteria, you may receive antibiotics to eradicate the bacteria from your stomach., In other words, the treatment (such as banding, clipping, etc.) is not always effective at resolving the bleed in the long-term. Your doctor may keep you in the hospital for a few days to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. Alternatively, he or she may advise that you return a few days later for a follow-up exam to ensure that there are no signs of further or recurrent bleeding.

Take a sample.,
Divide your sample into two parts.,
Test the first sample with Brady's reagent (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine dissolved in methanol and sulphuric acid).,
If the first test is positive, add Tollen's reagent or Fehling's reagent to the second sample.,
Interpret your results:

1st test negative = no ketones.",How to Test for Ketones," You'll need a sample of whatever it is that you are wanting to test for ketones. If your sample is solid, you'll need to dissolve it. Do not use a solvent that contains a ketone group (e.g. acetone), or a solvent that will react with a ketone group. Water, hexane and ethanol are good solvents for this purpose.
, The first will be tested to show the presence of C=O, and the second to show that it is a ketone., Be careful - 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is an explosive! It will go off if handled dry. A red, orange or yellow precipitate indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group., Neither reagent should react with a ketone. If your solution contains any aldehydes, Tollen's reagent will produce a silver or grey precipitate (or a silver mirror on the side of the container), and Fehling's solution will produce a brick-red precipitate.,
1st test positive and 2nd test negative = ketones.
1st test positive and 2nd test positive = aldehydes, possible mixture of aldehydes and ketones.
If the 1st test is negative but you do the second test anyway, and get a positive result, then there are no ketones, but there is a reducing agent present. Try the first test again to make sure it wasn't a false negative.

Be aware of the difference between an ingrown toenail and foot fungus.,
Look closely at your toe.,
Examine your toenail.,
Check for signs of an infection.,
Get medical attention if the toenail becomes infected.,
Soak your foot in warm water.,
Use a small piece of cotton to lift the ingrown.,
Replace the cotton every day after soaking your foot.,
Wear open-toed shoes.,
Cut your toenails straight across.,
Soak your feet two to three times a week.",How to Tell if You Have an Ingrown Toenail," Ingrown toenails are also known as onychocryptosis, and can be caused by stubbing your toe, wearing socks or shoes that are too tight, and cutting your toenails incorrectly. But ingrown toenails can also be caused by a toenail fungus called onychomycosis, which can then cause your toenail to grow abnormally and become ingrown.However, foot fungus like athlete's foot (tinea pedis) can cause your toenail to look discolored and become disfigured. Your toenail may appear spotted with white pits, there may be yellow debris under your toenail, or your toenail may appear chalky and irregularly shaped.
Another foot condition that causes nail disfigurement is the development of eczema or psoriasis on your nails. If you have this skin disorder, your nail may start to peel or split and appear thicker or begin to ripple. Your doctor can run a test to determine if you have a skin disorder that is causing toenail disfigurement.
If your toenail turns black, this may be due to trauma where you dropped something heavy on the nail. But it can also be due to melanoma or skin cancer. If your toenail turns black without any trauma inflicted on it, you should see your doctor right away.;
, Notice if the skin of your toe is reddened with some tenderness and swelling, especially around the sides of your toenail. You may also see some drainage of a yellowish fluid, which may be an early sign of infection or a sign of inflammation, which is your body reacting to the irritation of the toenail., You may notice that the skin around the corner of your toenail may be harder than the skin around your other toes. Your toenail may also curve into the skin in the corner of your toe or disappear into the skin.There may also be swelling and redness around an area of your toenail, as well as pain and tenderness.
If there is a yellowish discharge from your nail, your toenail may be crusty around this area.

, Ingrown toenails can become worse until they get infected or you may try to treat an ingrown toenail at home and cause the toenail to become infected. You can determine if the ingrown toenail is infected by noticing if:The toenail feels increasingly painful, and very tender and swollen
There is pus or yellow discharge visible under the skin or the nail
The skin or the nail feel very warm to the touch
Redness which streaks or begins to spread to your other toes

, If you suspect the toenail has become infected or if you have diabetes or another condition in which circulation is limited in your feet, you should see your doctor.


Your doctor may try to lift the ingrown nail and insert a piece of cotton underneath to help the nail grow over the skin. Your doctor may then instruct you to soak the toe every day and replace the cotton so the nail stays clean and grows properly.
Another option may be to remove part of the nail while you are under local anesthesia. If you have recurring ingrown toenails, you may need surgery to remove an entire section of the nail.

, This can help to prevent an infection and soften the ingrown toenail. Then, put two drops of tea tree oil on the nail.Let the tea tree soak in and then finish with a dab of Vick's VapoRub or Mentholatum on the ingrown toenail. The menthol and the camphor will help to reduce the pain and soften the nail further.
Apply a bandage or a small piece of gauze to keep the menthol and camphor on the toenail.

, The following day, soak your toe again for 20 minutes and then take out a small piece of cotton. Roll it between your fingers so it makes a ½ inch long cotton “tube.”Use clean hands to tape one end of the cotton tube to the top of your toe and then lift the corner of the ingrown toenail up and out with one finger. Use your other finger to work the free end of the cotton tube under the nail and then out the other side. The cotton should sit between the skin and the nail.
Keep in mind this process can be painful. You may need to ask someone else for assistance to help you slide the cotton tube under the corner of the nail.

, Make sure you also apply tea tree oil and the menthol-camphor ointment to keep your toenail soft and to prevent infection. You can also put some tea tree oil on the cotton tube.Avoid using nail files, tweezers, or nail cutters, as these can break or damage the skin. This can then lead to an infection.
Wear white cotton socks and keep your feet clean. Colored dyes on socks can get into your nail and lead to more inflammation.

, Go for comfortable shoes with no heel or a low heel. If you work in an environment where your toes could be injured, wear protective shoes.

, Do not cut your toenails to follow the line of your toes, as this can lead to ingrown toenails. Try not to cut them too short or leave them too long.

, Do this in warm water for 10 – 15 minutes. This will help to soften your toenails and make them more flexible. It will also make it easier to lift the edge of your toenail over the skin so they do not grow into your skin and become ingrown.


Add two tablespoons of Epsom salts to your foot bath or soak them in Domeboro Astringent solution, which can be found at more drugstores.

Pay attention to thirst.,
Monitor your urine color.,
Tune in to your emotions.,
Note changes in vision.,
Pay attention to any pain.",How to Tell if You Are Dehydrated1," Mild dehydration can be marked by feeling slightly thirsty. If dehydration is becoming a problem, you may experience extreme thirst. This can often cause related symptoms such as a dry mouth or a dry tongue., Check the toilet bowl after you pee. Your urine color can be an indication of health. Urine should be pale, straw colored, or light yellow. Darker urine may indicate dehydration.Urine that's somewhat dark yellow indicates you're mildly dehydrated and should drink some water soon.
When urine becomes amber colored or brown, this can indicate severe dehydration. You need to start drinking water right away and contact a doctor if the problem persists.

, Dehydration can cause changes in mood. You may feel confused, frustrated, or angry. If you notice that your mood seems off, then this could indicate dehydration if you also notice physical symptoms.You may notice you're irritable and struggling to concentrate with daily tasks if you're dehydrated. You also may be quick to anger.

, If your vision is becoming blurry, this can be a sign of dehydration. Your eyes will also begin to feel dry, which can lead to pain or irritation in the eyes., Since your body requires water to function properly, dehydration can cause a variety of aches and pains. Headaches and muscle cramps are common symptoms of dehydration.Headaches may also cause confusion and lightheadedness.
Muscle cramps may occur before or after exercising if you did not drink enough water to prevent dehydration.

"
"
Go to the emergency room if you experience severe dehydration.,
Undergo tests if necessary.,
Talk to your doctor about how to replenish lost fluids.",How to Tell if You Are Dehydrated2," Mild dehydration can be treated at home. However, if you notice symptoms of severe dehydration, this can be dangerous. Seek immediate help if you notice any of the following:Lethargy
Confusion
Dizziness
Not passing urine for eight hours
A weak or rapid pulse
Bloody or black stool
Diarrhea for more than 24 hours
You are unable to keep fluids down

, Your doctor will want to run a few routine tests if your dehydration is severe. These tests can help identify potential underlying causes of dehydration. They can also help your doctor figure out the right treatment options for you.Dehydration can be related to electrolyte imbalances, diabetes, or kidney problems. Your doctor may want to run a blood test to check for these conditions. Determining an underlying cause for your dehydration will influence treatment.
Your doctor may want to determine the level of your dehydration to recommend the right treatment option. In this case, you may need to provide a urine sample for urinalysis.

, The only way to treat dehydration is to replace lost fluids. For most healthy adults, this means drinking water. Children or infants may need special solutions made from water and salt to replace lost fluids.Your doctor may recommend you not drink soft drinks or fruit juices if you're dehydrated. Depending on things like your electrolyte levels, they may recommend sports drinks containing electrolytes.
Severe dehydration may be treated with intravenous fluids.

Hydrate before and during exercise.,
Drink extra fluids when you're sick.,
Up your fluid intake during hot or cold weather.",How to Tell if You Are Dehydrated3," Dehydration is often caused by excessive sweating during exercise. You should work on hydrating before you engage in a heavy workout. It's best to start hydrating the day before. Drink extra water if you know you'll be doing something like running a marathon the next day.Drink water until your urine is clear or pale yellow.
While you exercise, carry a water bottle. Make sure to take sips of water on occasion while you're working out to replenish the fluids lost through sweat.

, Vomiting, diarrhea, and fever can lead to a loss of fluids. This can cause dehydration. Make an effort to drink extra fluids, especially water, when you're feeling ill.If you have trouble keeping fluids down, you can also try eating a little Jello or sucking on a popsicle or crushed ice.

, When it's extremely hot or cold outside, this can cause dehydration. Make an effort to up your water intake when it's very cold or hot out. This can help prevent dehydration in the future.Notice physical symptoms, such as dry skin or hands, during hot or cold weather. If you begin displaying symptoms of dehydration, start drinking water to replenish lost fluids.

Start by mentioning that smoking doesn't only affect the lungs.,
Let them know that smoking is the number one leading preventable cause of death in the United States.,
Follow up by using more statistics.,
Emphasize the dangers of smoking by mentioning the odds of contracting certain diseases.,
Inform them about smoking and pregnancy.,
Inform them that secondhand smoke affects everybody nearby.,
Bring up that if there are benefits of quitting, then starting isn't a good idea.,
Use statistics as your friend.,
Be blunt.,
Bring up the cost of smoking.,
Give them other ideas.",How to Teach People Why It's Important to Avoid Smoking," Every organ of the human body is affected by smoking. The lungs, heart, esophagus, larynx, liver, stomach, and pancreas are some examples.;
, It causes more deaths than HIV, illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, and firearm-related incidents combined.


Smoking causes 90% of lung cancer deaths. Lung cancer is one of the more serious cancers, and smoking increases the chance of getting lung cancer. Moreover, only 10% of lung cancer deaths aren't related to smoking.
A smoker's lung is bombarded with radiation. The units are measured in picocuries per liter, or pCi/L. The average amount a human receives is about 0.2-1 pCi/L a year, and a smoker's lung is over 1000 times that at 200 pCi/L a year.

, Compared to a nonsmoker, people who smoke are more likely to contract heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. All of these complications can be avoided by choosing not to smoke. Of course, there is a small chance that these complications will occur even without smoking.

, Smoking increases the chance of contracting life-threatening diseases. People who smoke are 2 to 4 times more likely to contract coronary heart disease, 2 to 4 times more likely to have a stroke, or 25 times more likely to contract lung cancer. Other health risks include cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and various cancers.

, Pregnant smokers can have serious complications. Because smoking is linked to various complications, the baby will be directly affected.


Smoking while pregnant may result in an early delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, ectopic pregnancy, or orofacial clefts in the infant.
In addition to health complications, smoking can lower the chances of becoming pregnant. Starting a family could be challenging if both parents smoke cigarettes. In addition, infants are likely to have growth complications if they are exposed to cigarette smoke.

, Being in a room with a smoker for a half hour is the same as smoking one cigarette. It's recommended to avoid being in the same room as somebody who is smoking to minimize exposure to the toxic chemicals.


Don't be afraid to get a little angry. Smoking in public areas is selfish. People who choose not to smoke don't want to be exposed to secondhand smoke. Some public places have designated smoking areas.

, Studies have proven that smokers are at risk for a multitude of health problems. Within ten years of quitting smoking, most health risks will be less likely from occurring. However, the odds will never be as good as a non-smoker's.

, A year after quitting smoking, the risk for a heart attack drops sharply. Heart attacks happen at random, and smoking increases the chances of having one. Only after one year of quitting smoking, the risk of a heart attack drops sharply.


Anywhere between 2 and 5 years after quitting, the risk of stroke drops to about the same level as a non-smoker's. Within 5 years, the risk for certain cancers will drop by half. After ten years have passed, the risk for lung cancer drops by half.

, Tell them to avoid smoking in the first place. Most of the aforementioned health risks can be avoided. It may seem convincing to try a cigarette, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Young people are more prone to try a cigarette, so it's important for them to learn how much of a bad habit it is.

, An average pack of cigarettes contains about twenty cigarettes and costs up to $14.00. Some states have lower prices, but the cost of smoking can quickly add up.


Smoking a pack a week can cost up to $416.00 a year. Smoke three packs a week can cost up to $1,248.00 a year.
Some states, such as New York, charge up to $14.00 for a pack of cigarettes. Higher prices are meant to reduce the amount of smokers, but once addicted, it is not easy to quit. These states should use the taxes earned from cigarette purchasers to invest in quitting programs.

, Instead of spending hard earned cash on cigarettes, ask them if they have anything on their wish list. This way, they will be more compelled to save their money rather than waste it on cigarettes.


Emphasize how much money they will save. As previously stated, smoking is not a cheap habit. By reemphasizing how much money they will save by not smoking, it is more likely that they will never start.

Ask the person to lie down for five minutes.He should be completely flat on a table, bed or couch.,
Place your stethoscope over the brachial artery.With the blood pressure cuff wrapped around the person's arm, have her palm facing upwards and place the stethoscope on the inside of the elbow.,
Inflate the armband with the pump.Generally you should inflate it to around 200 as your starting number, and gradually deflate it from there.,
Record the diastolic reading after the sound clears.,
Finish by taking the radial pulse reading.This is the pulse you find by placing your index and middle finger over the inside right wrist.,
Ask the person to stand.,
Pump up the arm band again.,
Wait two minutes.,
Take one last measurement of the patient’s pulse (measure at the wrist).Write down your findings.,
Evaluate the results.Subtract the standing (1 minute) values from the laying down readings.,
Consider the person's symptoms.Regardless of the difference between the blood pressure values lying down and standing, if the person feels lightheaded and/or dizzy consistently upon standing he needs to be seen by a doctor for a professional evaluation of what may be causing these symptoms.,
Understand why it is important to measure orthostatic blood pressure.",How to Take Orthostatic Blood Pressure," Wrap the sphygmomanometer, or blood pressure gauge, armband firmly around the person’s upper right arm and secure it with the Velcro strip.;
, The stethoscope has a large surface area, so placing it on the inside surface of the elbow should ensure that it covers the brachial artery, which travels through that area. You will be listening to sounds in the brachial artery as your way to measure blood pressure.

, As the cuff deflates, look for the systolic blood pressure reading. Systolic blood pressure is the force of the blood pumping through the arteries, and it is usually between 110 and 140.


You will recognize the reading for the systolic blood pressure at the moment you begin to hear the ""thump"" sounds in your stethoscope. This is the sound of blood flowing through the brachial artery.
Keep note of this number in your head as you continue listening while the cuff deflates.

, This number should be lower, usually between 60 and 90. It is the pressure on the arteries between heartbeats.


Write the systolic blood pressure number, a slash, and then the diastolic blood pressure number. Both are measured in millimeters of mercury, or mm Hg. For example, you might write “120/70 mm Hg.”

, When you feel the patient’s pulse, watch your clock or watch for exactly 60 seconds and count the beats.


Most people have a pulse between 60 and 100 beats per minute (BPM). If the patient’s pulse is above this, he may not be able to stand and continue the test.
Write down the pulse (or heart rate), and then prepare yourself for the next portions of the test where you will ask the person to stand.

, Ensure that she has support to lean on if she is unstable on her feet. Ask them to hold on to something with her left arm so that you can take blood pressure and pulse on the right arm.


Wait until the patient is stable, but you must take the tests as soon as possible (within the first minute) after standing.Inform the person that if she is feeling lightheaded or faint at any point she should let you know, so that you can sit her down. Although she needs to be standing in order for the test to be successfully performed, you do not want to do this at the expense of them passing out.

, Take a systolic and diastolic blood pressure reading, and record both of these values. Also repeat the pulse test and write down your results., The patient should continue to stand. Two minutes after the first standing measurement (and after three minutes total of standing), a second standing blood pressure value should be obtained.Inflate the cuff again and record the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In normal physiology, the person's systolic and diastolic readings should be higher in the second standing reading than they were in the first, as the body has had more time to compensate for the change in posture.

, Ask the person to sit back down as you calculate blood pressure changes and look over the results.

, Also subtract the standing (3 minute) values from the laying down values, for a comparison and to see how quickly the body adapts.


Judge whether the person is likely to be suffering from orthostatic hypotension. If the systolic pressure decreases by 20 mm Hg or if the diastolic pressure decreases by 10 mm Hg, they likely have this condition.
Note that the condition is diagnosed based on the 1 minute standing blood pressure, not the 3 minute one (the 3 minute one simply provides a comparison to see how quickly the body adapts when given more time to stand).
Also consider whether the patient’s pulse increases by a normal rate. It is usual for the pulse to increase by 10 to 15 beats per minute. However, if the beats increase by 20 beats per minute or more, she should see a doctor for further evaluation.

, The diagnosis of ""orthostatic hypotension"" can be based on these symptoms alone, regardless of the difference in numerical blood pressure values, so it is important to ask the person about any symptoms he may be experiencing when he suddenly stands.

, Having ""orthostatic hypotension"" (low blood pressure immediately upon standing) is very common, particularly among the elderly. It leads to symptoms such as light-headedness and/or dizziness upon standing, and it poses the risk of someone passing out when she stands up due to insufficient blood flow. It is important to be aware of ""orthostatic hypotension"" in order to correct or improve it as best as possible.


In the elderly, common causes of orthostatic hypotension include medications the person is taking, dehydration, insufficient salt consumption (although too much salt can lead to overly elevated blood pressure), or simply a delayed response of the blood pressure after standing, which, to some degree, correlates with the natural aging process.Orthostatic hypotension is far less common in young people. However, it can sometimes occur as the result of other diseases (Parkinson's disease, parapneoplastic syndromes, etc.), extreme dehydration, or large amounts of blood loss secondary to trauma.

Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.,
Say NO to fried foods and YES to healthy fats and oils.,
Be aware of portions.,
Walk, walk, walk.,
Choose full-body exercises.,
Participate in physical activities that are enjoyable.,
Stay hydrated all day long.,
Avoid sugary drinks.,
Drink natural fruit juices and infusions.",How to Take Care of Your Kidneys," You already know that fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants, fiber, vitamins and minerals. All these are essential elements for the correct functioning of your body. It is also well-known that you should consume an abundance of fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, fruits and vegetables are naturally low in sodium (or more commonly known as table salt).


Excessive consumption of salt impedes the correct functioning of the kidneys and can cause kidney stones.
A good trick when you are preparing food is to replace half the salt that you would usually use with other spices.;
, Fast food and highly processed foods contain high concentrations of salt and “bad” saturated oils and trans fats that you should avoid.


Choose fresh foods or if you can’t get them, frozen products.
Oily fish, olive oil, dried fruits, and avocados are excellent sources of healthy fats, which are necessary to line and protect our vital organs.

, Serve yourself small portions of food and eat slowly. When the foods you eat have a high level of nutritional value, a moderate portion will satisfy you. You will feel more active the rest of the day and keep your weight under control.


Being overweight is associated with illnesses like diabetes and hypertension, which are risk factors for various renal and cardiovascular diseases.
The kidneys function better if you maintain an appropriate weight for your physique and age.

, Make your legs your main form of transportation. Walking is a very effective and natural exercise for people. Physical activity delays the aging process and keeps your organs healthy, which is vital to the kidneys. Try the following things:


In your building, at work, or even in the malls, always take the stairs, never elevators.
Walk to work. If you can’t, park your car on the far side of the parking lot and walk to the entrance.

, The best way to maintain good health is to practice sports. Swimming, cycling, mountain biking, dance, and rowing are only a few examples. Besides helping to strengthen the muscles in your whole body, these exercises will help you maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

, If you decide to do a form of regular exercise, make sure to choose an activity that you enjoy. Otherwise, your resolution will be destined for failure.


Join a football team in your neighborhood, learn to skate, take dance classes, play outside with your children or friends or have active sex.
All these activities improve your general health and produce endorphins, the hormones associated with well-being and happiness.
Staying sitting or standing for many hours can be very damaging to your kidneys. This situation becomes even worse when you don’t drink enough water during these long periods of time.

, Get in the habit of taking a bottle of water wherever you go and take small sips throughout the day. Take advantage of times you can refill the water bottle like at work or at the gym. Adequate hydration helps facilitate the work of the kidneys.

, Beverages filled with sugar can make you gain weight and feel dehydrated, two things that you want to avoid for the health of your kidneys.


Also avoid drinks with artificial flavorings, especially coffee (with cream, artificial flavors, marshmallows, etc.).
It is recommended to drink a minimum of 8 glasses of water a day.

, Some beverages are natural diuretics that contribute to better functioning kidneys.


Pineapple juice, apple juice, and the juice of various berries, especially cranberries are recommended for people who suffer from chronic renal diseases and other related illnesses.
Green tea and tea infusions such as Hibiscus and Chamomile also help the health of your kidneys.

Develop an understanding of MS and embrace being part of the MS community.,
Evaluate and organize your financial situation in regards to the medical expenses associated with MS treatment.,
Document the care needs of your loved one.,
Coordinate respite care.Respite care programs provide a break for the caregiver.",How to Support Someone with MS," As a MS caregiver, you will need to educate yourself about the different aspects of the disease, as well as the specific diagnosis of your loved one.


Do some additional research at your local library or on the Internet about MS. The website of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society provides extensive materials on MS and related topics for people with MS, family members, and health care professionals.
Be honest with your medical professionals about the limits of your understanding of a difficult diagnosis or treatment option.
If your provider does not have the time or skill to communicate in detail with you about your concerns, ask if support staff (i.e. a nurse or medical social worker) is available to you.
Reach out to family and friends who have a medical background, discuss your knowledge gaps, and enlist their support for office visits when necessary.
Connect with a support group by getting involved with your local National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

Go onto the National Multiple Sclerosis Website under ""Resources and Support"" to register for an online or in person support group in your area.
Research other national organizations that are available to help caregivers lead more balanced lives.
The National Family Caregivers Association hosts an online forum where you can connect with other caregivers if you feel depressed, want to share a piece of advice, or feel isolated and want to talk with others who might be experiencing the same thing.
The Family Caregiver Alliance provides state-by-state resources for caregivers, including respite providers.

;
,


Work with your MS medical team. Although talking about MS and financial help doesn’t come easily, if you let your doctor know that you have a tight budget, he or she can help you find more affordable treatment strategies and advise you on the best ways to get any needed assistive devices, such as canes, walkers, or wheelchairs.
Reach out to pharmaceutical companies. MS medications may be expensive, but drug companies often have programs for qualifying families that provide prescription drugs at lower cost. Look at the drug company websites or ask your doctor or clinic for help to connect with the local pharmaceutical sales representative.
Take advantage of available programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, disability payments, Veterans Administration benefits, and other programs that can help offset some costs.
Taking a proactive role in budgeting can help you and your family feel more in control. Because MS reduces a family’s overall ability to earn and save for retirement, try to make retirement savings and savings for long-term care a priority, if and when possible.

, Develop a notebook of written information pertinent to your loved one’s care and have it readily available for anyone who is providing care in your absence.


You first want to make sure your notes include the following up-to-date information:

Doctors’ names and phone numbers
Insurance information
Preferred hospital or ambulance
Phone numbers of close family and friends/ who might stop by to visit
Information re: medications and other aspects of care
Medical alert equipment


You will also want to include information on the following things as well:

Where to find personal supplies such as eyeglasses, dentures, hearing aids, lift
Daily and weekly routines
Food preferences
Personal interests
Favorite activities
Things that might agitate or could calm your loved one
Location of household and emergency supplies
Pet information
Organize this information in a way that is most useful to you and easily legible for others who may use it.



, For those providing intense, daily care to a loved one, respite means being relieved of those daily caregiving responsibilities for a time to relax and re-energize.


Many caregivers can create their own respite care by coordinating with friends and family members who are willing and able to visit for a few hours, days, or weeks. However, respite care may also include the paid assistance of home care workers or companions who come into the home to help with your loved one.
You can also coordinate out-of-home respite car which involves intermittent, planned short stays of your loved one in adult foster care homes, nursing homes or hospitals.
These professional services can be purchased privately or provided through community or state-financed programs. Check to see what your health insurance benefits provide.

Wash your face.,
Drink tea.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Don’t skip breakfast.",How to Take a Holistic Approach to Your Health As a College Student1,"


Washing your face is like becoming a new person, it makes you feel fresh, it wakes you up in the morning, and it invigorates your skin to make it look healthy, clean, and glowing. When your face is clean, you feel clean and ready to take on the hectic day ahead.
Use face washes that double as scrubs. Exfoliating beads or gritty textures help clean out your pores and purify your skin from any dirt and oil below the surface of your skin. It also clears out dead skin!
Some of my favorites are Saint Ives Apricot Scrub and Kiehl's Pineapple Papaya Facial Scrub.;
,


Sometimes, you don’t always have time to get that extra hour of sleep or take the time you need to completely recover from the flu. So when you can’t do these things on your own, you need a little help.
That’s where tea comes in! Drinking tea is excellent for your body. Herbal teas especially clear out a lot of toxins in the body and provide you with the boost needed to fight sickness, stress, and sluggishness.
Yogi is a brand of tea that offers tea for every occasion. They have excellent teas for the cold season, but also stress-relieving teas, energizing teas, and even teas modified for the woman’s body.
For when you need an extra boost of energy, drink Yogi’s Refreshing Mint Vital Energy tea. It’s a black tea blend that has peppermint, ginger and cinnamon, to wake you up.

Congrats, you’re in college. No more restrictions, no more rules. What an exciting time for soda and waffle fries to be in abundance.
Unfortunately, these two things are nowhere on the food pyramid. It’s hard as a college student to get the nutrients you need. Red meat is scarce and all the vegetables look gross. But, you have to try to eat balanced and to eat at least three times a day.
Nuts, fruit, cheese, and yogurt are all great snacks to eat on the go. Don’t eat foods too high in sugar or fat. It won’t provide lasting nourishment and too much can lead to weight gain.
Try to incorporate something from every food group.

, Eating breakfast helps you get going in the morning and it will keep you from gorging at lunch and dinner. If you can snack during the day, bring some snacks with you.

Keep a calendar .,
Get sleep.,
Enjoy yourself!",How to Take a Holistic Approach to Your Health As a College Student2,"


This might sound routine, but it’s essential. As a college student, you’re constantly busy and there’s no way you could feasibly remember all of the things you’re responsible for. Writing things down helps you commit to the item, and scheduling a block of time to complete the activity furthers this commitment.
Use highlighters, get a fun pen, grab some sticky notes. Do anything that makes keeping a calendar fun and once you start, you won’t be able to live without it.

,


Getting sleep is essential as a college student. Yes, it’s a lot of fun to stay up late, but you’ll regret it the next morning when you can’t peel yourself out of bed for your 8am alarm. Try to go to bed at a reasonable time. It might take a bit to adjust your internal clock, but once you do, you can be on a healthy schedule that leaves you refreshed in the morning and lasts you through the day so you don’t have to take three hour naps as soon as class is out.
To help you start relaxing earlier, try to stop using your electronics by nine or ten at night. The stimulus from a bright screen keeps you restless and hyper. Removing yourself from these stimulants can help you fall asleep faster.

,


Setting goals is great. But not if they’re unattainable. Nothing good comes of trying to take 18 credits for four years straight or being apart of every club on campus. Figure out what you really feel is feasible while you’re in college. Guess what? You can’t have a full time job and be a full time student. It’s impossible, so don’t stress about goals like that. It’s not happening.
As you think of your goals for your four years in high school, try to include having fun. You have time for fun even if you think you don’t think you do. And if you don’t have fun, if you don’t take a break, then you won’t succeed. Working yourself ragged all the time isn’t healthy. Try to break up the wear and tear of academic life up with some fun activities.
Treat yourself to dinner out, see a movie, go to a party, take a weekend vacation to a neighboring town.
Whatever having fun looks like to you, do it!

Surround yourself with good people.,
Set personal boundaries.",How to Take a Holistic Approach to Your Health As a College Student3,"


In college, you’re exposed to so many people. And those people are going to decide to do different things with their time at college. If you’re trying to graduate early and get the best grades possible, hanging out with people who want to Facebook at the library is probably not your best move. But it goes deeper than this.
Surround yourself with people who will make you feel good. Negative people will drag you down as you pursue your goals and that’s not something you need. Don’t be afraid of ending friendships or relationships that are not in line with what you’re trying to accomplish as an individual.

,


This is key. In college, where so many lines are unfortunately blurred and crossed, it’s important that you as an individual understands what you’re comfortable with.
This doesn’t just refer to intimate relationships, this refers to boundaries of any kind. With professors, friends, colleagues, and roommates.
If you’re not clear with yourself about what you want and need to thrive, then how will anyone else know what you need? They won’t. Setting boundaries and acknowledging what you’re comfortable with is invaluable to your college happiness.

Plan your visit ahead of time.,
Know post-surgery etiquette and hygiene.,
Bring a gift.,
Make the hospital feel like home.,
Organize group visits.,
Plan for the future.",How to Support a Friend After Surgery1," While your friend might usually love a spur of the moment visit, recovering from surgery is a different matter entirely. Not only do hospitals often have specific visiting hours, your friend might need to prepare physically and emotionally for visitors.


Know the hospitals visiting hours and policies. Depending on where in the hospital your friend is staying, there is different protocol for visitation. If your friend is still in the recovery room, for example, only one visitor at a time is permitted, with the nurse's permission and supervision, and there are stricter rules for personal hygiene. Call the hospital ahead of time to ask about visiting hours and any restrictions.Try to reach a family member or spouse to see when would be a good time to visit. This way, you'll have a better idea of how your friend is feeling, what tests have been run, and whether they're up for visitors. Once you know, plan your visit accordingly. Call or text once more before heading out to make sure your presence is still welcome.Plan to stay about 20 or 30 minutes, but use your judgment. If your friend seems tired or disengaged, you should slip out sooner. If they seem happy to see you, and are excited to talk to you, then feel free to stay longer.;
, A lot of things can be bothersome to patients just out of surgery, so make sure you do not do anything to cause your friend discomfort during your visit.


Do not wear perfume, aftershave or strong smelling lotions as people are often sensitive to smells when they're sick or recovering from surgery.When you enter and leave a friend's room, wash your hands with soap, water, alcohol rubs, or hand sanitizer. Check with the nurses' station before entering the room, as you could be required to use a gown, gloves and mask. People are more susceptible to germs after an operation.
If you have any type of illness, such as a a cold or flu, ask the hospital staff beforehand if it's safe for you to visit your friend, it usually isn't.
If you are a smoker, only smoke in designated areas and do not get cigarette fumes anywhere near your friend.
Due to the risk of bacteria and germs spreading, you could be banned from the hospital if you bring a non service dog into the hospital.
Do not swear as this is usually against hospital rules and can get you thrown out and/or banned if caught.
Avoid the patient's bed, as this can spread germs. Do not sit or put your feet on the bed.
Do not touch the patient's wounds or any medical equipment they are attached to.
Do not use the patient's toilet or bathroom, this can also spread germs and bacteria, and nurses may also report you and have you removed from the hospital.
Do not share any property, such as toiletries or tissues, with a patient., People love to receive gifts, especially if they're not feeling well. It's not about the money spent, but just knowing that a person cares. Consider bringing a small gift to your friend for them to enjoy post-surgery.


Many people think to bring flowers, but flowers are not ideal for a hospital stay. They take up a great deal of room, and shelf-space in a hospital room is limited. They also decay quickly, and are hard to transport home.
Boredom is a huge issue with hospital patients, so consider an interactive gift. Try novels, magazines, crossword puzzle, sudoku books, or a journal. If your friend has some kind of electronic media, like an iPad or tablet, try iTunes or Amazon gift certificates, so they can select and purchase entertaining media for themselves.
If food is allowed, bring the patient their favorite snack, as hospital food can get tiresome. However, keep in mind that even if you mean well, they might not want to eat, as surgery and medications can affect their appetite.Many patients are placed on special diets following surgery, and some patients may not be allowed to eat until normal bowel function returns, such as after a bowel resection surgery.

, A hospital can be a drab, impersonal space. If your friend is there for a prolonged recovery period, try to make their hospital room feel less alien by creating a homey environment for your friend.


Decorate the room. Hospital rooms are beige or white and this can grow depressing with time. Bring cheerful posters, a small decorative hanging, or colorful blankets and throw pillows. Just check with hospital staff first to make sure you're not violating any hospital policies.Bring them something familiar. During a traumatic event like a surgery, familiarity can be a comfort. Make a small scrapbook of friends, family members, beloved pets, and other loved ones. Borrow your friend's iPod and create custom playlist of their favorite feel better songs or burn them a mix CD. Buy DVD's of their favorite movies and TV shows, as many hospital rooms have a television set patients can use.
Act natural when visiting. Your friend is probably eager to get back to a sense of normal, so share news of mutual friends and discuss what's been happening in the news or on TV. Let your friend feel like they're part of the world even if they are stuck in a hospital room., If possible, and after you make sure your friend is up to it, get a group of friends together to visit your friend.


Group visits can feel like a more natural hang out session than one-on-one communication, as people often congregate in groups. Your friend will also be happy to see how many people care and have taken the time to visit.
Check hospital policy to make sure there isn't a cap on the number of people permitted in a room at a time.

, Making some future plans and promises can give your friend something to look forward to after their hospital stay, and reassurance their needs won't be forgotten once they're released.


Set a date to go see a movie, go out to dinner, get coffee, go shopping, etc., sometime after they will be released from the hospital. Your friend will appreciate having something small to look forward to after their stay is over.
Offer any assistance in the transition back home, such as driving your friend back from the hospital and running errands for them during recovery.

Talk with your doctor about health maintenance.,
Work with your doctor to create a plan.,
Get routine checkups to stay abreast of health issues.,
Cut out the negative influences.,
Drink enough water and liquids.,
Get enough sleep.,
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Savor your food.,
See an eye doctor annually.,
Go to the dentist annually.,
Stop smoking.",How to Take Control of Your Health1," General health maintenance and an emphasis on wellness will help you take control of your health.Tell your doctor that you would like to schedule a health maintenance examination in order to assess your risks for certain disease. This is especially important for people of older age, gay men and women, pregnant women, people with cancer, and those that have diabetes. In advance of your appointment, consider preparing by doing the following:


Write down your reasons for wanting to create a health maintenance plan. This way you'll have a starting point for your conversation with your doctor.
Write down a list of health goals. For example, you may want to lower your blood pressure, lose a certain amount of weight, or manage your diabetes.;
, Having a plan you can follow will be extremely helpful and will create short-term objectives you can work towards to stay motivated. Ask your doctor to help you break down each goal into manageable steps you can start practicing right away.


Depending on your starting point, taking control of your health could be a one to five year endeavor. Your plan should include specific goals you want to achieve over those one to five years, and it should be broken down into smaller, more manageable goals to achieve on a monthly or quarterly basis.
Your plan is a starting point and doesn’t have to be written in stone. If something happens or if your life changes, update your plan accordingly.
Use your journal to keep track of your short and long term goals, and whether you’ve been able to achieve them. If you weren’t able to achieve them, understand the reasons and add new goals in their place.

, Your health plan should include regularly scheduled checkups and screenings for cardiovascular disease, hypertension and cancer. Talk with your doctor about which screenings you should be getting and how often you need to get them.Cardiovascular disease should be assessed when you are twenty and then every ten years afterwards. A great risk stratification tool is the Framingham risk score. Major risk factors for heart disease include diet, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, physical activity, and diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension screening is recommended for adults great than 18 years old.
Diabetes screening is usually suggested for those with dyslipidemia and hypertension.
Your doctor may recommend screenings for breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and other types of cancer depending on your risk factors. Cancer prevention includes avoidance of tobacco, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, eating fruits and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, protecting against sexually transmitted disease, and avoiding sun exposure.
Additionally, make sure your immunizations are up to date and discuss your particular needs with you doctor.
Maintenance of psychosocial health is important; talk to your doctor about screening for such conditions such as depression and anxiety.
Finally, health issues to consider include osteoporosis and vascular disease.

, We often have such good intentions to become healthier, but then those intentions get off-track by negative influences in our lives. Those negative influences hold us back from achieving our ultimate goals. If you want your plan to work, you need to slowly get rid of those negative influences.Make a list of all the things in your life that you consider to be negative influences. Specifically think of influences that affect your health.
Go through your list and prioritize the items from easiest to hardest to eliminated.
Then slowly work your way through the list and get rid of those negative influences from your life.
You don’t have to stop these influences all at once. Slowly work your way up to cutting as many of them out of your life as possible.
Examples of negative influences you may want to include on your list are: having junk food in the house, regularly passing by a convenient store where you buy a chocolate bar, driving by a fast food drive thru, staying up too late, being disorganized, someone who brings donuts to work, a friend who doesn’t respect your goals, etc.

, Human bodies are made up of 60% water. Because of this, water is a vital ingredient to a healthy body. Water removes toxins from our organs and carriers important nutrients to our cells. Not enough water can lead to dehydration which can make you tired and negatively impact your vital systems. Men need about 13 cups (3 litres) of beverages a day and women need 9 cups (2.2 litres) of beverages a day.These amounts are for all beverages you consume throughout the day, not just water. All liquids replenish your system in some way, but some beverages (like water) do a better, and faster, job.
You do not need to physically measure your liquid intake every day, instead, just make sure if you’re thirsty that you drink enough liquid so as to no longer be thirsty.
Remember that water is lost when your breathe, sweat, and when you go to the bathroom. If you do any of these things more often, or for a longer period of time, (e.g. if you’re sick or exercising) you need to consume more liquids to make up for the additional water you’re losing.

, Adults between the ages of 18 and 64 need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep every night. Adults over the age of 65 need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep every night. The amount of sleep you get impacts your mood, energy and long-term health. In addition to getting enough sleep, there are some basic sleep ‘rules’ that can be followed:Follow a sleep schedule that stays the same every day, including the weekends.
Create a bedtime routine that you follow every night, without exception.
Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet and cool.
If your sleep isn’t restful, consider getting a new mattress or pillows.
Avoid drinking anything caffeinated several hours before bedtime.
Use your bed only for sleeping (and sex).

, To experience substantial health benefits, adults should exercise at a moderate intensity for at least 150 minutes (2 ½ hours) per week, or at a vigorous intensity for at least 75 minutes (1 ¼ hours) per week. Of course, a combination of both moderate and vigorous activities every week is also great.Activity should be performed in periods of at least 10 minutes, and should be spread out over the whole week.
To obtain even better benefits from physical activity, increase your moderate activity to 300 minutes (5 hours) per week, or your vigorous activity to 150 minutes (2 ½ hours) per week.
In addition to this aerobic activity, adults should also perform muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week.

, Sometimes we consume too much food simply because we aren’t paying attention. Usually it’s because we’re eating while doing something else, like working or watching TV. Instead of eating while distracted, dedicate your meal times only to meals. Sit yourself away from distractions and enjoy your food. Eat slowly.When you’re able to eat slower, you’ll be able to ‘read’ your body’s messages better. When your body tells you it’s full, stop eating.
Over time you should be able to tell how much you can eat at one meal, and you’ll only put that amount on your plate. Until then, save the leftovers for another meal or for someone else.

, Eye exams can actually detect more than just vision problems, they can detect symptoms of diabetes, hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. Getting your eyes checked on an annual basis will help ensure you have the right aids (i.e. glasses, contact lenses) with the right prescriptions to help you see your best.Not wearing glasses when you should, or having the wrong prescription lenses, can cause other health problems like headaches. Making sure your prescription is up-to-date can help prevent many of these problems from occurring.
In addition to getting your eyes checked on a regular basis, protect your eyes every day by doing the following:Wear sunglasses when outdoors, all year round. And wear a hat with a brim across your forehead to help with glare.
Always wear eye protection when doing hazardous work.
Wear protective equipment for your eyes when playing sports.



, Being healthy also means having a healthy mouth — with healthy teeth and gums. Seeing your dentist at least once a year will help make sure your teeth and gums are at their best. And it can help identify medical problems at the early stages. As with vision, many diseases can actually be detected from a dental exam before other symptoms appear.Good dental health also means brushing and flossing your teeth on a regular basis.
Ideally you should brush your teeth after each meal, but at the very least brush your teeth once a day, right before bed.You should floss at least once a day, possibly after you’ve brushed your teeth and right before bed.

, If you’re a smoker, one of the healthiest things you can do for yourself is to quit. It is never too late to quit. Quitting smoking will give you immediately and at any age.Quitting smoking can immediately have positive effects on your health like reducing your risk of heart disease, cancer and breathing problems.
Depending on how much you smoked, you can save a significant amount of money that can be put to better use elsewhere.
Most states and provinces have free programs available to help you quit smoking, so you do not have to go it alone.

Someone who starves or doesn't have access to essential nutrients as a young child is likely to become stunted, whereas someone who, for instance, drinks coffee as a teenager is not going to become stunted.;
, UNICEF pinpoints a person's first 1,000 days of life (about 3 years) as the crucial window during which stunting can occur. Depriving a child of food or important nutrients during this time frame will lead to stunted growth and a significantly reduced size for the rest of their life, unless new medical research can reverse it.


It's impossible to ""retroactively"" stunt a person's growth. In other words, while starving later in life may cause a drop in body weight or slowed growth, a person won't suffer the worst, most permanent effects of growth stunting.

, The physical and mental effects are extremely serious and cannot be undone, even with the benefit of modern medicine. Someone with stunted growth will suffer not only from reduced body size and weight for their entire lives, but from a variety of other debilitating problems. Collectively, these problems can reduce the length and quality of the stunted person's life. These problems include:Weakness
Delayed brain development
Learning disorders/difficulties
Disproportionate height/mass ratio (i.e., chubby appearance)
Underdeveloped bones
Delayed organ development
Weakened immune system

, Calcium is an essential nutrient found in milk, soymilk, kale, oranges, oatmeal, cheese, sardines, white beans, and many other foods. Calcium is crucial for healthy teeth and bones and for properly-functioning muscles. By the time you're old enough to make a conscious decision to avoid calcium, the window for stunted growth will be long past. Thus, even though cutting calcium from your diet can cause your height to decrease, it won't technically lead to actual stunted growth. It will, however, lead to the following dangerous symptoms:Weak bones and teeth (which can contribute to decay and fracture)
Faintness
Difficulty swallowing
Lung spasms
Spine and hip pain
Brittle nails and hair
Anxiety and irritability
Loss of mobility
Seizures (in severe cases)

, One common myth is that wearing a heavy backpack, purse, bag, etc. on your back will, over time, make you shorter. This is untrue, However, wearing a very heavy backpack can alter your posture if you're not careful, leading to a hunched, unnatural appearance that may give the illusion of a difference in height.Note, however, that this improper posture puts stress on the neck and back, leading to pain and soreness. In severe cases, back problems like slipped disks can eventually result.

, Massage, from a professional or an amateur, will not ""stretch your spine"" and make you taller. At most, it will relax your muscles and improve your posture, giving the illusion of getting taller. Massage can be a valuable tool for treating back pain and posture problems and should not be avoided, even if you don't want to become taller.

, Perhaps the most common, wide-spread myth about stunted growth is that it can be a result of drinking caffeine during the childhood or teen years. This is simply not supported by scientific evidence.Excessive caffeine intake won't make you shorter, but can make you jittery, irritable, hyperactive, and/or paranoid.


Caffeine can also keep you from getting as much sleep as you need. This can lead to a weakened immune system, drowsiness, and decreased physical and mental performance, among other symptoms. Lack of sleep can also interfere with the release of natural growth hormones,at night and, over time, can inhibit growth (see below).

, While full-blown growth stunting is the result of malnutrition during infancy, certain other factors can have been linked to decreased growth potential, especially when they occur during a child's growing years. For example, the use of certain steroid drugs in children has been linked to lower heights, underdeveloped bones, and more. In fact, even children who use mild steroid inhalers to treat asthma have been found to have heights that are, on average, half an inch lower than those of children who didn't use the inhalers.In general, steroids should only be given to children for legitimate medical problems after being prescribed by a qualified medical professional. Under no circumstances should children take non-prescription steroids.

, Along with caffeine use, smoking is popularly cited as a cause of decreased growth. While caffeine's reputation is unfounded, smoking's is supported by some evidence. Some studies have shown that children who smoke (or are frequently exposed to second-hand smoke) are, on average, slightly shorter than those who do not.The existing data, however, is largely inconclusive, so it is inaccurate to say that smoking inhibits growth beyond a shadow of a doubt.


What are well-documented are the numerous deadly effects of smoking, including heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, emphysema, cancer, and many others.Quitting or avoiding smoking will increase your energy levels, boost your mood, and improve your overall health.

, As noted above, lack of sufficient sleep, especially during crucial childhood years of development, is thought to decrease growth. This is because the body releases natural growth hormones during sleep. If the amount of sleep a person receives is insufficient, these hormones are suppressed.Again, the scientific data linking lack of sleep to lower growth is somewhat tenuous, that linking sleep deprivation to its negative effects is not. Sleep deprivation can lead to drowsiness, irritability, impaired judgement,lower cognitive ability,and, in extreme cases, serious physical and mental problems.

Help out with food.,
Offer your help with chores.,
Provide entertainment.,
Offer to go to any follow-up exams with your friend.",How to Support a Friend After Surgery2," Food is one of the biggest issues post-surgery as we all need to eat, and oftentimes cooking and even shopping are difficult in the wake of an operation. Be prepared to help your friend with meals during their recovery.


Offer to get groceries. If you're able to go grocery shopping for your friend, do so. Check in with them if you're planning a shopping trip for yourself and see if there's anything they need.
Bring over dishes. If your friend is uncomfortable with someone else doing their shopping, cook for them. Great options for meals are dishes that are re-heatable and keep for long periods. Aim for casseroles, soups, lasagnas, and salads.
Be aware of any diet restrictions your friend might have. Oftentimes, certain foods are forbidden after an operation. Ask your friend about any kinds of food the doctor has advised against before preparing them a dish. Also, if your friend had any diet restrictions before the surgery - such as being gluten-free or a vegetarian - make sure you are aware of this.

, Don't tell them to call you if they need anything. They will probably not want to bother you. Offer specific help, like, ""I have some free time this afternoon, do you need help with anything?"" Household chores are a burden after surgery and your friend will really appreciate a helping hand.


Do laundry, dishes, dusting, and any other cleaning. Your friend is probably laid up, so don't let them fall behind. If you have an extra hour, donate it to your friend in need.
If they have pets, help with that. Clean the cat's litter box, walk the dog, make sure the animals have food or water. All of this will be appreciated.
If needed, provide free childcare. Whether your friend is a single parent or has a spouse who's busy with work, chances are they will need help with the kids after surgery. Free childcare is much appreciated., While cooking and cleaning are tangible means to help a friend in need, sometimes recovery gets boring and all a person wants is good conversation and a little entertainment. Spend a weekend night with your friend and keep them engaged in conversation and activity.


Share what's going on in your life, but keep it positive and upbeat. There's no need to mention that you were just laid off or had a big fight with your spouse. You're there to be a source of positive energy.
Watch a movie or television show your friend likes. Ask them beforehand if there's anything in particular they've been itching to watch, and pick up a DVD on the way over or rent from an online outlet.
Board games and cards are a great way to break the monotony. If you can get a group of people together, stop by your friends house for a round of poker or a game of Clue.
While alcohol is great for many social situations, it's unlikely your friend can drink with their post-surgery medication. Be polite. Do not engage in social drinking when your friend cannot.

, After a surgery, there will be a number of doctor's appointments in the following weeks. Such appointments can be stressful, and having a support system is a wonderful asset for someone recovering from surgery.


Let your friend know you can drive them to the doctor's office. Oftentimes, medication interferes with the ability to drive and public transportation can be a hassle following surgery. Offering a mode of transportation is invaluable.
Entertain your friend in the waiting room. Bring playing cards, books of crossword puzzles, magazines, and books or just make casual, funny conversation while waiting for the doctor.
Plan something fun after the visit, even something as simple as stopping for milkshakes or having lunch. Something to look forward to can make trips to the doctor more bearable.

Consider how close you are to this friend.,
Allow your friend to feel what they are feeling.,
Try active listening.,
Ask the right questions.,
Understand the nature of surgery anxiety.,
Know how to cope with surgery and hospital anxiety.",How to Support a Friend After Surgery3," The level of emotional intimacy makes a huge difference when it comes to what you should and should not say to someone after surgery. If you're close, it's easier to ask questions without hesitation and be more open expressing how you feel. If it's a more formal friendship, or just a new one, be natural and warm but do not let the seriousness of a surgery push you to say something that might make you both uncomfortable. Stick to small talk, like ""How are you feeling?"" and ""Do you need any help with anything today?"", There's a good chance your friend is not feeling their best in the wake of an operation. Oftentimes, we feel people need a pep talk or positive reassurance. While this is well-intentioned, it can be frustrating to a friend who simply wants to express their thoughts. Let your friend talk, and accept their feelings with patience and empathy.


Avoid phrases like ""I understand"" or ""I know how you feel."" It's hard to truly understand a situation you are only experiencing secondhand. Instead, say something like ""I can understand how you would feel that way. Tell me more.""Do not say things like ""You shouldn't feel that way"" or ""Cheer up."" Such phrases come off as judgmental if someone is feeling discouraged. Instead, say, ""I'm sorry you feel that way, can you tell me why?"" and other words that let your friend know you're listening., Active listening is when you make a conscious effort to hear what another person is saying and to understand the message being sent. If you're helping a friend after surgery, they are the priority and you need to make this clear. Your friend might need to vent, so try to be a patient and active listener post-surgery.


Pay attention. Give your friend your full attention by looking at them directly, putting aside distracting thoughts, engaging with their body language, and avoiding being distracted by the environment.
Show that you're listening. Nod occasionally, smile and use other facial expressions, make sure your posture is open and inviting, and encourage the speaker to continue with verbal comments like ""yes"" and ""I see.""
Provide feedback. Your role is to understand what is being said, so you may need to reflect on what your friend's expressing and ask questions to fully understand. Try things like, ""So, what you're saying is..."" and ""What I'm hearing is..."" Ask questions for clarification, like ""What do you mean when you say..."" and ""Is this what you mean?""
Defer judgment. Do not interrupt your friend. Wait until he or she is done talking before asking questions, and do not be argumentative or question their responses.
Respond appropriately. Be candid, open, and honest about your responses and assert your opinions respectfully, without dismissing your friends concerns or issues., While your friend might be interested in hearing about you and your life, only talk about yourself when prompted. Talking to a friend post-surgery is about them and how they are feeling, so make sure you know what questions are appropriate to ask.


Do not ask about their health or test results unless they bring it up. Oftentimes, people recovering from surgery grow tired of medical talk and might not want to go into specifics about their doctor visits.
Do ask how they're feeling. A more vague question is appropriate. This gives your friend control. He or she now has the option to open up about their medical issues or to keep things light.
Ask them if they need anything. People are often wary to ask favors, so make sure to offer as your friend might need assistance with day-to-day chores.
Ask them about family members and other loved ones. Show your friend you care by showing genuine investment in the things and people they care about.

, The key to being a supportive, loving friend is empathy. Seeking to understand any fears associated with surgery can help you empathize and be a more effective listener.


Control, or rather loss of control, is one of the biggest fears when it comes to surgery and its aftermath. People fear handing their well-being over to someone else, and the loss of control over one's body and movements that comes in the wake of surgery is frustrating. Understand your friend is feeling a lack of control, and remind them this is a normal feeling.What's at stake when it comes to surgery is a better life. People undergo surgeries to treat prolonged illnesses or injuries, and if improvement is gradual or if the recovery period is prolonged disappointment can set in fast. Remember this when dealing with your friend, and remind them progress takes time.Going to hospitals and undergoing anesthesia bring up fear of our own mortality. This is perhaps the biggest fear associated with surgery, so be aware your friend might want to discuss dark subjects when you visit them. Be emotionally prepared for this., Most people, even the calmest among us, experience some kind of fear and anxiety when in a hospital setting. Know ways to cope with this anxiety that you can share with your friend.


Self-trust is important. Anxiety is rooted in mistrust. Most often this mistrust is projected onto others, but is often a reflection of mistrust for oneself. Remind your friend to trust their body and trust that they are capable of doing whatever is required for recovery.
Taking action can help curb anxiety. Tell your friend to engage in activities that help with anxiety while promoting good physical well-being as well. Eat right, exercise, meditate, spend time outside, spend time with friends and family, engage in hobbies, etc.Planning is also key to staying calm. If your friend is healing, tell them to focus their energy on healing and not anxiety. Help them make a post-surgery plan to get through the days they'll be laid up. Make lists of all the materials needed - such as groceries, reading materials, and toiletries. Is there any work your friend could catch up on that they're able to do after surgery?If so, help them figure out what it is and make a plan to do it."

Create and maintain healthy relationships.,
Help others.,
Reward yourself.,
Pay attention to your spirituality.,
Learn better coping strategies.",How to Take Control of Your Health2," Connecting with other human beings is good for your mental health. Friends and family can help reduce your stress levels and increase your overall sense of well-being. These connections help you feel supported and valued, which in turn will help you feel happier and less lonely.Personal connections are beneficial to your health. For example, loneliness can increase high blood pressure and human connections can actually prolong your life span.
Existing friend and family connections need to be supportive to you, or they may not be beneficial. You should have at least a few friends or family members with whom you: feel comfortable being around; get the sense that you could tell them anything without being judged; can ask for help to solve problems; feel valued; are treated seriously.
If you’re looking to make new friends, consider one of the following activities: enrol in an interesting class; join a book club; participate in a hiking club; volunteer at a non-profit organization.

, Helping other people is obviously beneficial to those people, but it also has many positive impacts on you. Helping other people can: increase your level of happiness; make you feel lucky to be who you are; provide you with connections to other human beings; make you feel needed and helpful; reduce the amount of worrying you do; and give you a sense of meaning or purpose to your life.There is no shortage of charities and non-profit organizations that need volunteers to help do just about any job you can think of. But helping others doesn’t have to be so organized. It can also include helping your neighbor carrying in her groceries, or shoveling another neighbor’s sidewalk after a snowfall.

, Give yourself the chance to feel joy, happiness and satisfaction on a regular basis. Laughing, for example, is known to decrease pain, promote muscle relaxation, reduce anxiety, and help your lungs and heart. Some ways to add fun to your life on a regular basis are:Read joke books when you’re feeling down or bored.
Keep a collection of photos in a place where you can look at them to give you a positive energy boost.
Watch comedies on TV or at the movies, or on the radio while you’re driving.
Check out the silly photos on websites like I Can Has Cheezburger!
Laugh at yourself and the absurd situations you may find yourself in.
Colour in an adult colouring book, or have a colouring party with your friends.
Enrol in a class or activity you’ve always wanted to try, like pottery or stained glass.
Go to the spa for a pedicure, massage or facial (or all three!).

, Spirituality doesn’t have to mean an organized religion. It can mean understanding (or trying to understand) your purpose in life, or the meaning of your life. Spirituality, in general, can: help reassure you of the existence of a greater force or being; give you a sense of purpose or meaning; help you understanding suffering; help you connect with other people; and remind you that good does exist in the world.Spirituality can include joining or maintaining your faith in a specific religious institution, or it can mean focusing on your own notion of God.
Meditation such as deep breathing, mindfulness, visualization and mantras can help you focus your energy and enhance your feeling of calm.

, Not every point in your life is going to be happy and positive. Taking control of your health also means learning how to deal with the bad times by developing strategies that will help you understand, cope and eventually feel better. There are several habits you can develop that will help you cope with the negative things in your life, including:Write out your thoughts and feelings regarding a bad event. Take the opportunity to rant about the situation (in writing). Once it’s down on paper you’ll likely feel better because you’ve been able to organize your thoughts and release the stress you felt about the situation. Ideally you’ll be able to move on from the situation and forget it ever happened.
If the problem you’re experiencing is more logistical than emotional, tackle it like you would any other problem. Write down what the problem is and all the solutions you can think of. Assess the pros and cons of each solution. Select a solution that works best for you and reinforce the positive reasons why you selected that solution. Implement the solution.
Sometimes we worry about a problem way more than we ‘should.’ Not because we want to, but because we can’t help it. When you find yourself worrying a lot about a specific situation, take a step back and ask yourself how realistic your worry is. Is it possible that some of the worry is exaggerated?
Realize that you can’t spend all day, every day worrying, so if you must worry, set aside a specific time every day to do your worrying. Then, once you’ve had a chance to worry, stop and think about the good stuff going on in your life to remind yourself things are not as bad as they may seem.

Take Armour thyroid for hypothyroidism.,
Go to your doctor.,
Reevaluate your TSH levels every few weeks.,
Keep track of your symptoms.,
Take Armour thyroid indefinitely.,
Determine the best time of day to take your medicine.",How to Take Armour Thyroid1," Armour thyroid is an animal-source thyroid replacement used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. It’s used as hormone replacement therapy for people with hypothyroidism. It is also used to reduce the size of goiters and to treat thyroid cancer.It is a natural mix of pig-derived thyroid hormones. It is measured as grains, and the doses range from ¼ grain to five grains. It is an alternative to synthetic, man-made thyroid hormone replacement.
The symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, dry, coarse hair, hair loss, dry skin, wanting to sleep often, intolerance to cold, decreased heart rate, swelling of the thyroid gland (goiter), unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight, constipation, and depression.;
, Since Armour thyroid is prescribed for hypothyroidism or associated conditions, you must go to your doctor. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed by symptoms and lab tests. Your doctor will perform a physical exam to check your thyroid. Your doctor will also take a medical history and have you provide a list of symptoms.Your doctor will also do lab tests, checking things like your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
If your doctor believes you have need to undergo thyroid treatment, your doctor will discuss your options with you.

, If your doctor believes you need Armour thyroid, you will be started on the lowest dose, which is ¼ grain. You will be required to go back to the doctor in one to two months. The TSH levels will be remeasured every four to six weeks.


Your doctor will look at your TSH levels and adjust the dosage of Armour thyroid so that the TSH values fall within a range between 0.5 and 4.0 mIU/L., Since the TSH level range is rather wide, you will need to keep track of your symptoms during the first few months of taking Armour thyroid. Keep aware of how you are feeling so you can talk to your doctor.Some people don’t feel well unless their TSH levels go below 1.0. Others feel much better with higher TSH levels. TSH levels can be very individualized, so your doctor will work with you to find the proper dosage.
Keep up with any fatigue or wanting to sleep more, changes in your hair, dry skin, sensitivity to cold, swelling of the throat, unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight, constipation, and feelings of depression., Once your personal optimal dose of Armour thyroid is achieved, you will likely stay on this dosage level for life. This helps keep your TSH levels at the appropriate place.You should, however, be aware that the dosage required can change. This can happen because of disease, stress, menopause, injury, or trauma. Make certain you talk to your doctor about the level of Armour you take if you experience any of these events.

, For most people, taking their dose of Armour in the morning one hour before eating works best. However, some people do better taking Armour and any other thyroid HRT in the evening. The only way to know is to try Armour at different times.Talk to your physician about the best way to do this to avoid any unpleasant side effects or other problems.

See a doctor if you suspect a dislocated shoulder.,
Get your shoulder joint relocated or reset.,
Prepare the shoulder by cleaning and shaving it.,
Gather your necessary materials.,
Apply the orthopedic underlay or foam.,
Tape ""anchor"" straps.,
Make an ""X"" strap over the shoulder with the tape.,
Make a ""corkscrew"" pattern from the chest to the biceps.,
Secure and cover the tape job with an elastic bandage.",How to Strap a Dislocated Shoulder," Dislocated shoulders usually happen from sports injuries or falling on an outstretched arm. Signs and symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include: intense shoulder pain, an inability to move your shoulder, immediate swelling and/or bruising, and a visible shoulder deformity (it hangs lower than the other shoulder, for example).If you suspect a shoulder dislocation following some type of physical trauma, see a health professional (physician, chiropractor, athletic therapist) immediately for treatment.


Your doctor may take x-rays of your shoulder to confirm the dislocation and see if any bones are broken.
Your doctor will either recommend or prescribe medication to deal with the intense pain of a shoulder dislocation.
Remember that a dislocated shoulder is very different than a separated shoulder. The latter is a ligament injury to the joint that holds the collarbone (clavicle) to the front part of the shoulder girdle — the ""ball and socket"" shoulder joint is not displaced, as with a shoulder dislocation.;
, Before you think about strapping or tapping your shoulder, the ""ball"" of your arm bone (humerus) needs to be relocated into the ""socket"" of your shoulder girdle. This procedure is usually called closed joint reduction and involves some gentle traction (pulling) and rotation of your arm in order to guide the bones back into alignment within the shoulder joint.Depending on the severity of pain, you may need a local anesthetic injection or strong pain killing pills.


Never let someone untrained (such as a friend, family member or bystander) try to relocate your shoulder — they may cause more harm than good.
When your shoulder is relocated, the pain level should drop quickly and significantly.
Immediately icing a relocated shoulder for about 20 minutes will help reduce inflammation and pain, but always wrap the ice in plastic or a thin cloth before applying it to skin.
Strapping a shoulder that's still dislocated is always a bad idea and never recommended.

, Once the shoulder is relocated and the pain is reduced and under control, then it's time to prepare the shoulder area to be strapped. In order for straps and tape to adhere to the shoulder area, the skin covering the joint needs to be cleaned and shaved to remove any hair.As such, gently clean the skin around the shoulder with soap and water, then apply some shave cream and carefully remove any hair (if applicable) with a safety razor.


After you finish shaving the skin, dry the area thoroughly and wait at least a few hours for any skin irritation to go away. Then consider applying some adhesive spray just prior to applying any tape of straps — it will help the straps and/or tape stick to the skin better.
Hair not only prevents tape from sticking, but it also causes pain when the tape and/or bandaging is removed at a later time.
Depending on how much hair is present, you may need to shave around the shoulder, shoulder blade, nipples and the lower neck.

, Gather (or purchase from your local pharmacy or medical supply store) all the materials you need to properly and securely strap a dislocated shoulder. In addition to some spray adhesive, you'll also need some orthopedic underlay or foam (layers of gauze work also in a pinch). These will help to protect the sensitive nipple from the tape and straps. You will also need some rigid strapping tape (ideally 38 mm in width) and an elastic bandage (ideally 75 mm in width).Keep in mind that you'll very likely need assistance to strap / tape your shoulder, even if you have training and experience with the procedure.


If you are within the offices of an orthopedic doctor, physiotherapist, athletic trainer or sports therapist already, they will likely have all the materials needed to strap your shoulder. Family doctors, physician assistants, chiropractors and nurses may not have all the supplies needed, so consider bringing them with you.
Going to an emergency department of a hospital is a good idea to get medication and your shoulder relocated, but they won't likely have the time or motivation to strap / tape it for you afterwards. They'll probably just give you an arm sling to wear instead.
Strapping / taping a relocated shoulder can be beneficial or may even help to prevent a dislocated shoulder, but it's not considered medically necessary, so don't expect it to be part of your standard medical care.

, After cleaning, shaving and spraying some adhesive material to the skin of the shoulder area, apply some thin underlay / foam over sensitive areas such as the nipple and any pimples, boils, healing wounds, etc. This will prevent pain and irritation once the sticky tape is removed at a later time.To save material and time, cut out small patches of the underlay material and place them directly over the nipple and other sensitive areas. The underlay will stick to the adhesive spray at least for a short period of time.
Realize that although an arm sling is usually worn over your shirt and undergarments, taping / strapping of your shoulder is always done on bare skin and underneath all clothing.

, Start taping by applying ""anchors"" over the shoulder and the biceps muscle in the front part of the upper arm. Apply a piece of tape from the base of the nipple up and over the top of the shoulder to about mid-shoulder blade level. Lay one or two more strips of tape over the first for firm support. Then, wrap two or three straps of tape around the middle of the biceps muscle.When this step is complete, you should have one anchor of tape running from your nipple to your upper back and a second anchor or band wrapped around your biceps.
Don't wrap the second band of tape too tightly or you may cut off circulation to your arm. Numbness and tingling in your hand is a sign of reduced circulation. Check your fingernails by pressing them for a few seconds. If the color returns promptly, then the tape is a good fit. If it takes time to regain color, then the tape is too tight and should be reapplied.

, Support and protect the shoulder by applying two or four strips of tape diagonally in opposite directions from one anchor to the other. This should form an ""X"" or ""cross"" pattern around the shoulder, with the intersection (middle of the cross) centered over the lateral shoulder muscles (deltoids).Two strips of tape is the minimum, whereas doubling it up with four strips will provide more stability.


The tape should be applied snugly, but you should still be relatively comfortable. If you're experiencing undue pain from the taping / strapping, remove it and start over.
Although breathable tape is often a good idea for taping other injuries, strapping a relocated shoulder requires thicker, more sturdy tape to be most effective.

, Start at the outside edge of the nipple and run a strip of tape over the shoulder and wrap it around and under the biceps of the upper arm. Essentially, you're connecting the two anchors again, but from the front instead of the side. A corkscrew (or spiral) pattern should be formed when you wrap it under and around the upper arm two or three times.


When wrapping underneath and around the upper arm, it may be better to use two or three separate strips of tape so the ""corkscrew"" doesn't get too tight and cut off circulation. Check your circulation in your fingers after each new application of tape.
When this step is complete, re-anchor the work by applying one additional strip of tape over each of the original anchors (see above). In general, the more tape you use, the snugger its hold will be.
As a reminder, this strapping / taping method is also done to prevent shoulder injury or aggravation, especially prior to playing sports such as football and rugby., After you've finished strapping the shoulder area with tape, it's time to use an elastic Tensor or Ace bandage. Run a length of the elastic bandage from the front of the chest over the top of the injured shoulder and under the biceps. Continue wrapping the bandage across the back, under the opposite armpit of the uninjured shoulder, across the front of the chest and back to underneath the injured shoulder. If you have enough bandage, do another pass for additional support and fasten the bandage to the underneath layer with metal clips or a safety pin.Remember to check circulation with the elastic bandage as well.


The main reasons to use an elastic wrap is to cover the tape and prevent it from coming off, as well as providing a little more support.When using cold therapy, it's much easier and quicker to remove the elastic wrap, apply the ice over the injury (but on top of the tape), then re-apply the wrap again over the ice.
To recap: you should have two tape anchors, connected and covered by a lateral ""X"" pattern and an inner ""corkscrew"" pattern of tape, all wrapped up in an elastic bandage that extends across the back and chest.

Practice deep breathing.,
Do pursed-lip breathing.,
Try breathing from your diaphragm.,
Practice huff-cough breathing.",How to Strengthen Your Lungs After Having Pneumonia1," Deep breathing helps to recover lost lung capacity. Begin either in a sitting or standing position. Place your hands on your waist and relax. Inhale as much air as possible. When you reach the maximum capacity of your lungs, hold your breath for 5 seconds. Exhale as much air as possible. Make sure that you exhale slowly and empty the lungs completely or as much as your health level permits.Repeat the procedure 10 times in each set. It is advisable to do 3-4 sets of deep breathing exercises throughout the day.;
, Perform Pursed-lip breathing will help you increase the oxygen intake of your lungs, while decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide. Start by relaxing your entire body. You can do this in a sitting or standing position. Inhale through your nose within a span of 3 seconds. Before you exhale, you need to purse your lips as if you are going to kiss somebody. Exhale through your pursed lips within a span of 6 seconds. Inhale and exhale slowly. Don’t force the air to come in and out the lungs.


Repeat the procedure. Pursed-lip breathing is done when the patient has shortness of breath. This breathing exercise should be repeated until shortness of breath is diminished.

, The diaphragm is the muscle that pushes and pulls air in and out of the lungs. Start by lying down on your back and bend your knees. Place one of your hands on your belly and another hand on your chest. Take a deep breath. Let your belly and lower rib cage rise while making sure that the upper chest cavity won’t move. This is the challenge you need to overcome in diaphragm breathing. Inhaling should take about 3 seconds. Exhale for 6 seconds. You need to purse your lips as well to better control your breathing.Repeat the whole procedure. At first, this exercise might be difficult for you. However, more practice and repetition of this exercise can train the diaphragm and will eventually increase your lung capacity. As time passes by, diaphragm breathing will become easier.

, Doing huff-cough breathing will help eliminate bacteria and respiratory secretions by triggering the cough reflex. Sit down or elevate the head of the bed if you can’t get up. Relax and prepare yourself. To do the huff-cough exercise:


Step 1: Perform 3 to 5 deep breathing exercise. Combine your breathing with the pursed-lips and diaphragm breathing exercise. Push out air as if you are coughing. When you have done 3-5 cycles of deep breathing, open your mouth but do not exhale yet. You need to hold your breath, tighten your chest and abdomen.
Step 2: Force air out from the lungs in a fast manner. If you have done this correctly, you will elicit the cough reflex and loosened secretions stuck within your respiratory tract. If phlegm comes out, spit it out and repeat the whole procedure.

Fasten the bandage looping.,
Inspect your strap application.,
Check the person’s pulse again to see if your strap is too tight.,
Rest your thumb and wrist.,
Ice the thumb and forearm.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor.",How to Strap a Thumb," You can strap and support your thumb using different techniques and materials.Purchase medical tape or tubular bandages that reduce your range of motion, decrease stress on the injured thumb tissue, and promote healing blood flow to the joint.You may want to use either a trainer’s or kinesiology tape to strap your thumb as these are often optimal for injuries to the muscle. Either type of tape is designed to flex whenever your joint moves. Not only does this make the strap comfortable, but it is also a practical solution for an an active lifestyle.Some tapes can irritate your skin if it is sensitive. In this case, purchase a quick release medical tape. This option has the strength and flexibility of trainer’s and kinesiology tapes without adhesives that can inflame or irritate your skin.Another option for sensitive skin is tubular medical bandages, which are sometimes called ACE bandages. Tubular bandages are fashioned into a strap by wrapping them around your thumb and then fastening them with medical tape or a small fastener.Tubular bandages are often the best option for wrapping joints. They also serve as effective cover wrappings for tape.Trainer’s tape, kinesiology tape, and tubular bandages are available at many pharmacies, medical supply stores, and sports stores.
There is some evidence that black tape adheres better to sweaty skin.;
, Buy either tape or bandages — or both — to wrap, strap, and support your thumb.Bandages have the added benefit that they can reduce any swelling or inflammation present on your thumb.To reduce swelling, you must be sure you are not wrapping too tight while still applying pressure.


Most pharmacies, medical supply stores, and even some sports stores sell bandages and tape.
Make sure to get bandages and tape in lengths long enough to effectively support and immobilize your thumb.
If you decide to use tubular bandages, you also need medical tape or pins to secure the bandage.

, Get the skin around your thumb ready to tape or bandage. You’ll need to wash with soap and water and dry well and, if necessary, shave the area. This removes dirt and debris, and can create a better adhesive surface. It could also minimize discomfort when you remove the strap.Use a gentle cleanser and warm water to clean any oils, sweat or dirt on your skin. This can help the tape or bandage adhere properly hand.Any kind of mild soap is good enough to clean your hand. Thoroughly rinse or wipe off soap so that lingering residue doesn’t disrupt the bond between skin and tape.
If you decide to forego an underwrap or have an especially hairy hand and forearm, you may want to shave a small area around your thumb. Shaving may help tape stick better to your skin. Shaving can also make it far less painful to remove the tape when your thumb is healed.Be careful when you shave so that you don’t cut or otherwise injure your skin., If you want to avoid direct contact with your skin, put an underwrap between the tape and your skin. Be aware that an underwrap can render the tape slightly less effective.An underwrap or skin adhesives are not necessary when taping or bandaging your thumb and are not commonly used.Use either a skin adhesive and an underwrap only on the areas of your thumb and forearm you plan to strap.Underwrap and skin adhesive are available at most pharmacies, medical supply stores and some sports stores.

, If you are able, consider buying pre-cut tape. If not and you bought a round of tape, cut the tape into strips before you strap your thumb. Cutting the tape before you begin wrapping it help you more effective strap your thumb while minimizing how much you waste.Cut the tape into pieces that are approximately the length of your hand.Taper the edges by rounding them so that it is easier to apply.Remove any backing from the tape before application.

, Although you can strap your thumb yourself, if may be easier if someone helps you. Ask a friend or family member to help you tape or bandage your thumb to help ensure proper application., Raise whichever hand you are taping or bandaging. Keep your hand straight and flex your thumb so that it is horizontal or perpendicular from your palm.Prop up your hand with a table if necessary.
Apply one piece gently around your forearm, just below your wrist in a loop like a bracelet. This is the anchor tape for your strapping.Use the same principle with a bandage.
The tape or bandage should be taut, but not tight. Tape that is too tight could cut off your circulation.If your skin begins to throb, the tape or bandage is probably too tight and may be cutting off your circulation. Take the anchor tape off as soon as you can and then reapply it more loosely., Starting at the level of your anchor tape, loop the tape around and then across the side of your thumb, back down to the starting point.This can help provide extra support to your thumb and wrist.Add up to one to three additional side loops of tape, depending on how much support you need., Starting at the anchor tape level, place a strip of tape in the middle of your wrist and loop it over to the front of your hand.Finish off the front loop by bringing back around your wrist and fastening the tape or bandage just above your wrist.Depending on how much support you need, you can add extra pieces of tape or layers of bandage.

, After you completely wrap your thumb and surrounding forearm, fasten the bandage so that is it doesn’t loosen or fall off. You can fasten the bandage with a safety pin, clip, or a piece of medical tape.

, Move your wrist, forearm, and thumb before you start any activity. If you experience any discomfort from the tape or bandage, remove the wrap and re-apply it in a looser and more comfortable manner.

, Your pulse should be between 60 and 100 beats per minute. If it’s not, remove and reapply your strap.


Pressing down on one of your fingernails can also help assess your circulation. Push on your nail and see how long it takes the pink color to return. If the event that it takes longer than four seconds, you may have constricted your blood circulation. Remove and reapply your strap in this case.

, Either completely rest your thumb or undertake lighter activities while you’re having problem. Immobility, rest, and undertaking lower-impact activities can help promote healing and help prevent further injury.Don't write or type with that hand.
Avoid sports such as skiing, racquetball or tennis, which require that you use your thumb more extensively than other sports. Consider doing lower-impact activities such as biking or walking.Consider resting your thumb completely for a week or so to help promote healing.Move the affected area slowly once you’ve rested it. Slow, gentle movements can promote healing and minimize stiffness. If this causes significant pain or discomfort, discontinue movement, consult your doctor, or rest the thumb for a longer period., Apply an ice pack or cold compress to your thumb, wrist, and forearm. Cold can help minimize swelling and inflammation and relieve pain.You can place an ice pack on your thumb and forearm as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time. You can do this up to five times a day.
Fill a plastic foam cup with water and freeze it to gently massage your thumb and wrist.Make sure you always wrap the compress or ice pack in a towel or cloth to prevent damaging your skin.

, Use an over-the-counter pain medication to relieve discomfort or pain. Many pain medications can also help reduce swelling and inflammation.Over the counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, or naproxen sodium.Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium can also help reduce swelling and inflammation., If strapping doesn’t relieve the issues with your thumb, or pain is severe, see your doctor. She may be able to diagnose a more serious injury and come up with an effective treatment plan.A regular doctor or orthopedist, who specializes in treating disorders such as strains and sprains, can help you treat your thumb.Your doctor may manually examine your thumb and wrist to feel or recognize signs of injury. She may also inquire about your health history, including the activities you do. Your doctor may also ask what measures you’ve taken to reduce pain and promote healing.Your doctor could order additional diagnostic tests including an MRI or an X-ray to see your thumb and forearm from a more detailed perspective.

Change their attitude towards food.,
Encourage physical activity.,
Make sure they get enough sleep.,
Set limits on electronics.,
Teach children about online etiquette.",How to Take Control of Your Health4," Only 20% of high school kids in the U.S. consume at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Teens should be encouraged not only to eat the full amount of fruits and vegetables every day, they should also be encouraged to consume ‘real’ food more often. Fast food and processed foods should be avoided as much as possible. Homemade foods and foods made from scratch should be encouraged.One of the fastest ways to eat healthier is to reduce the amount of calories consumed via liquids like pop, juice, energy drinks, milk shakes, etc.

, Kids need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day to stay healthy. But they don’t have to get that 60 minutes all at once, it can be broken up into smaller, more manageable chunks of 10 to 15 minutes.No matter the weather or the season, send kids outside to play as often as possible.
Parents should participate in physical activities with their kids not only as a means of encouragement and a way to bond, but because the exercise is good for the adults as well.
Set family physical activity goals to achieve together. Participate in charity events like marathons or walk-a-thons as a family.

, Kids need between 9 and 10 hours of sleep every night in order to function properly. Less than 9 to 10 hours of sleep can affect you kid’s ability to think, learn and make good decisions. Lack of sleep can also impact your kid physically, by increasing their risk of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression.Help your kids get enough sleep by creating a bedtime routine or ritual. Establish a specific bedtime that is followed every night, including weekends. Avoid computers and TV an hour before bedtime. Spend the hour before bedtime doing calm activities like brushing teeth and reading a book.
Kids and adults need to have a dark room in order to get a restful night’s sleep. Ideally, your kid’s bedroom should be as dark as possible, and their bed should only be used for sleeping.
Avoid big meals right before bedtime. This not only prevents an upset stomach which may keep your kids awake, it may help avoid bad dreams. It’s also helpful to avoid drinking too much before bed, to help prevent your kids from needing to get up to go to the bathroom when they should be sleeping.

, Technology of any kind — TV, video games, computers, cell phones, etc. — should have daily limits. Once those daily limits are reached, encourage kids to perform a physical activity instead, without their technology.Areas like the dinner table should be designated as “no tech zones” where electronic items are not allowed — for BOTH parents and kids. Instead face-to-face (old-fashioned) communication should be encouraged.

, Many kids have never known a world without the internet. They interact, play, and learn online. But kids can also be taken advantage of online, and need to understand the right way to behave when in their online communities.Parents should be effective role models of what good online communication should be. Kids like to mimic what adults do, so if they see you swearing and acting rude online, they may attempt to do the same thing. If they see you being kind and using good manners online, they may follow your lead.
Teach your kids about cyber bullying. Don’t hide the stories about children who have been cyber bullied, instead share these stories with your kids and talk about them. Discuss how your kids should react under similar circumstances (i.e. tell their parents or teacher, don’t post personal info or photos, etc.).
Learn about the software and apps your kids use when they’re online, or on their phones, and understand how they work and what they’re used for. Don’t rely on your kids to ‘teach’ you what they do online.

Take Armour thyroid as directed.,
Refrain from using Armour thyroid for weight loss.,
Avoid Armour thyroid if you object to using pig or animal products.,
Be aware of the side effects.,
Monitor Armour thyroid when taking other medications.",How to Take Armour Thyroid2," Only take prescribed dosage of Armour thyroid. Never increase or decrease your dose of Armour thyroid without discussing it with your physician. An overdose is possible and can be very dangerous, especially if there is any underlying heart condition.Overdosing on any thyroid HRT can cause hyperthyroidism, and in severe cases, coma and death.

, Armour thyroid should not be used to treat obesity. it has been shown to be ineffective for weight loss in people with TSH levels in the normal range.Large doses or using it when your levels are fine may cause serious or life-threatening side effects.

, Keep in mind that Armour thyroid is derived from pigs. If you have any allergies to pigs, or any religious or philosophical objections to using products from pigs, the synthetic alternative may be better for you.Synthetic thyroid hormone replacements are man-made. They have only T4 in them instead of both T3 and T4. Most physicians prefer to prescribe synthetic thyroid hormones because they believe synthetic thyroid hormones are safer.

, While most people take the same dose for long periods of time, even for life, you should always be aware of possible side effects of high levels of thyroid hormone. These include chest pain, fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat, swelling hands, ankles, or feet, and seizures. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical help immediately.Other symptoms can include increased sweating, sensitivity to heat, mental or mood changes such as nervousness or mood swings, fatigue, diarrhea, shaking, headaches, and shortness of breath.
Some patients may experience other side effects. If you experience any side effects, go to the doctor immediately.

, Any form of thyroid medication can interact with many different medications. Always tell your physician about all medications that you are taking. In some cases, dosage needs to be changed, and in other cases, the medications need to be taken at different times.If you take an anticoagulant (blood thinner), your blood clotting needs to be monitored and the dose of Armour may need to be adjusted.
Armour thyroid may interact with insulin or anti-diabetes medications.
Cholestyramine and colestipol, which are used to treat high cholesterol and other conditions, should be taken at least four to six hours apart from Armour or any thyroid HRT.
If you take estrogen or oral contraceptives, the dose of Armour or any thyroid HRT may need to be increased.

Learn what the thyroid gland does.,
Understand hypothyroidism.,
Know what Armour thyroid is.",How to Take Armour Thyroid3," The thyroid gland is located at the base of your neck. It is a very important gland, producing thyroid hormones that help regulate your metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate. In children, the thyroid aids in growth and development. The thyroid is responsible for releasing hormones into the body.Thyroid problems can be divided into two types: an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism, and an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism is treated with Armour thyroid while hyperthyroidism is not.

, Hypothyroidism is also known as an underactive thyroid. This means your body produces too little thyroid hormones, causing body functions to process more slowly. All forms of hypothyroidism can be caused by viral infections, radiation damage, some medications, pregnancy, and other rarer causes.Having an iodine deficiency can cause hypothyroidism. Iodine deficiency may be a more important cause of hypothyroidism since the primary source of iodine for many people who don’t eat fish is iodized salt. Since many people have reduced their salt intake, their iodine intake has also been reduced.
Symptoms of an underactive thyroid include fatigue, constipation, depression, dry, coarse hair, hair loss, dry skin, wanting to sleep often, intolerance to cold, decreased heart rate, swelling of the thyroid gland (goiter), and unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight.
Hypothyroidism is commonly treated with hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). HRT can be accomplished with natural hormone from animal sources, like Armour thyroid, or with synthetic, man-made hormones.

, Armour thyroid is an animal-source thyroid replacement used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. It is a natural mix of pig-derived thyroid hormones. It is measured as grains, and the doses range from ¼ grain to five grains. It’s used as HRT for people with hypothyroidism of any cause except for temporary hypothyroidism, and for the prevention and treatment of goiters, thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, and multinodular goiters.A fourth grain of Armour thyroid is considered to be a 15 mg dose and equivalent to a 25 mcg dose of the synthetic T4 hormone commonly used. This is often the starting dose.
Other dosage equivalents include: one grain equal to 60 mg and 0.100 mg of synthetic T4; three grains equal to 180 mg and 0.300 mg synthetic T4.

Drink lots of water.,
Exercise regularly.,
Quit smoking.,
Take your antibiotics as prescribed.,
Get enough vitamins and minerals.",How to Strengthen Your Lungs After Having Pneumonia2," Drink 8 glasses of water if you are an adult. For children, the amount of water depends on body weight. Water helps mucus in the lungs to become more liquid. Water or fluids helps mucus to be brought out of the lungs and the nose and mouth more easily. This leads to better breathing., Regular exercise and physical fitness training help our pulmonary cope with disease. In most individuals who exercise at sea level, the lungs saturate arterial blood with oxygen more effectively than those who don’t. This means, if there is breathing limitation due to exercising at high altitudes, or to having exacerbation of asthma or other types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, those who actively exercise may have extra ventilation that can be called on.Walking, running, swimming, and cycling are all excellent ways to restore your lungs’ strength. Before you exercise, begin by stretching and bending. Each exercise session should last about 20 to 30 minutes. Stop if you feel short of breath or have palpitations., Smoking is known for being dangerous to health. It is even worse for you if your lungs have been stricken by pneumonia. One effect of nicotine is constriction of the terminal bronchioles of the lungs, which leads to airflow resistance into and out of the lungs. When you are already having trouble breathing, you certainly don’t want you lungs to become even more constricted.Nicotine also paralyzes the cilia, or the hair-like projections found in the cells that line the airways. Cilia help remove excess fluids and particles--paralyzing them will stop them from helping you remove excess fluids in your airways caused by your pneumonia.
Another effect of smoking is the irritation from the smoke itself which causes increased fluid secretion into airway passages.

, Even when you think you’re all good, you shouldn’t stop taking your antibiotics unless your doctor tells you to do so. People who suddenly stop taking these meds or who do not take their meds on time put themselves at risk for drug resistance. This means antibiotics may not be as effective as they could have been if you don’t follow your doctor’s prescription., Good nutrition helps fight illness and a good balanced diet can give you the vitamins and minerals you usually need. For a little boost, intake of multivitamins or a tablet of Vitamin C once a day may help your immune system.


Adequate amounts of vitamins such as A, B complex, C, E, folic acid, and irons such as iron, zinc, selenium, and copper are required. These vitamins and minerals act as antioxidants and help the immune system fight diseases, especially infectious ones like pneumonia.
Zinc sulfate is helpful in the reepithelialization, or in the repair of the lining of your airways.
Vitamin D and beta-carotene supplements can also boost your immune system."

Stop drinking alcohol while you are recovering.,
Keep up to date on vaccinations.,
Cover your mouth when you cough or when someone coughs.,
Wash your hands regularly.,
Clean things that you often touch regularly and thoroughly.",How to Strengthen Your Lungs After Having Pneumonia3," Alcohol may decrease sneezing and coughing reflexes needed to remove mucus from the lungs, interferes with antibiotics or other medicines like those taken during a bout of pneumonia.

, There are several vaccines that are available to prevent the occurrence of pneumonia. Pneumococcal and influenza (flu) vaccines are examples of those that can be given. Some vaccines are routinely administered to children, however, in certain circumstances, vaccines may also be recommended to adults.There are two types of influenza or flu vaccine of vaccines. One of them is the ""flu shot"", which contains a killed influenza virus that is administered to a muscle using a syringe. It is given to those older than 6 months, including healthy people and people with chronic medical conditions.
The other one is the nasal-spray flu vaccine, which contains live, weakened viruses. Because the viruses are weakened, they will not be strong enough to cause disease, but our body will be able to produce defenses against them. It is approved for use in healthy non pregnant people who are 2-49 years old.

, Covering your mouth when you cough or someone else does will help you to avoid sharing germs, making it less likely you will get pneumonia again. It is also important to wash your hands anytime you are around someone who is coughing or sneezing.Ways to cover your mouth and nose include using tissue paper, your upper sleeve, or wearing a face mask.

, We can get and spread pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) from our hands because we use them to cover our mouth when coughing, turn door knobs, handle food, rub our eyes and hold our children. Without washing, pathogens multiply on our hands and spread to everything we touch. The proper handwashing technique as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is as follows:


Wet your hands with clean, running water.
Apply soap and lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails by rubbing your hands together.
For at least 20 seconds, scrub your hands.
Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
Dry your hands.

, As mentioned in the previous step, our hands are effective in spreading pathogens so cleaning objects that our hands usually touch will also prevent the spread of disease.


Things that you should clean include: doorknobs, light switches and remote control.

If you have pets, you may need to vacuum every other day to adequately control pet dander and fur.
Clean or change the filters in your heating and cooling system. Use hypoallergenic filters to trap more respiratory irritants.
Run a small air purifier in the rooms you spend the most time in, including your office and bedroom.
Don't smoke and don't share your space with those who do. You should also avoid traveling in industrial areas with heavily polluted air.;
, Cold air can actually cause your lungs and airways to tense, which may cause or worsen wheezing. If the temperature is cold enough for you to see your breath, you should wrap a scarf around your nose and mouth before stepping outside.


The scarf should warm the air before it reaches your airways. Additionally, the scarf can serve as an extra filter to ward away airborne respiratory viruses commonly spread during the cold winter months.

, Exposing yourself to food allergens and environmental allergens can cause wheezing, and foods that produce mucus can make wheezing worse. Avoid as many of these triggers as possible.


Foods that produce mucus include dairy products, bananas, and sugar.
If you have difficulty identifying your allergens, you may need your doctor to perform an allergy test.
Treat seasonal allergies that cannot be avoided with over-the-counter antihistamines. Severe seasonal allergies might need prescription medication.

, Take a steamy shower or run a vaporizer in the room you're currently sitting in. As you breathe in the steam, the warmth can relax tense airways and the moisture can thin the mucus clogging them.To the same effect, try boiling 1 quart (1 L) of water mixed with 8 to 10 drops of peppermint oil. Once the water begins to evaporate, take it into a small, closed room and breathe in the steam. Don't hold your face directly in the steam, however, since doing so could cause burns.

, Strong odors aren't necessarily bad for you when your lungs are healthy, but if your airways are stressed, they may cause those airways to restrict further. This can both cause and worsen wheezing.


Chemical odors, like paint and chemical cleaners, can be some of the biggest culprits, but you should also avoid things like perfumes and heavily scented soaps or shampoo.

, Following a healthy, balanced diet will keep your body in its best operating condition and can improve the way it functions. Improved function means improved lung health, which typically leads to less wheezing.Diet can be especially important if your wheezing is caused by asthma or anxiety. Proper nutrition eases the stress placed on your body, making your lungs and airways less stressed, as well.

, Drink more water than usual when your wheezing starts. Instead of aiming for eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses per day, try to drink 10 to 12 glasses.


Drinking water can make mucus thin and loose, making it less likely to clog your airways and cause wheezing.
Other hydrating fluids, like herbal tea and citrus juice, can also help, but you should avoid fluids that can dehydrate you (alcohol and caffeine) and those that may produce more mucus (dairy milk).

, Warm fluids hydrate the body while soothing stressed airways, so they can relieve and even end many wheezing episodes when they start.


Herbal teas are some of your best options. Try sipping on ginger tea, chamomile tea, or licorice root tea. Adding 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of honey to your tea can also soothe stressed, raw airways while acting as a mild antiseptic agent.
Hot soup is another good choice, especially if you stick with broth-based soups. Creamy soups may not help quite as much since the dairy they contain can thicken and produce more mucus.
In controlled amounts, coffee can also offer some benefit. Caffeine can dilate the airways, which may make breathing easier and end your wheezing. Since caffeine also dehydrates, though, drink no more than three 8-oz (250-ml) cups daily and offset it with plenty of hydrating fluids.

, Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can strengthen your lungs. While this may not result in an immediate end to your wheezing, it can help stop wheezing in the long-run.


Fish oil capsules are a great way to supplement your diet with omega-3 fatty acid, but you can also increase your intake naturally by consuming fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines.

, If you've ever eaten something spicy when suffering from head congestion, you probably already know that spicy food can cut through that congestion quickly. Similarly, eating foods that contain cayenne pepper can help wheezing, as well.


Cayenne pepper causes the fluids of your body to become active, thereby pushing more fluids through your body and causing mucus to thin out. As the mucus thins, it should become easier to breathe.

, Your body will naturally tense up when you experience respiratory difficulties like wheezing, and as a result, your lungs and throat might become more constricted. Relaxing your mind and body can ease that tension and make it easier to breathe clearly again.


Nearly any activity that relaxes you without stressing your lungs can provide some benefit. For instance, meditating, praying, listening to soothing music, or taking a warm bath might work wonders. Avoid activities like smoking or drinking, though—they may temporarily calm the mind, but they stress the body, so they'll only make your wheezing worse.

, Nasal breathing filters more allergens from your environment, and breathing through your nose can ultimately reduce wheezing and related respiratory difficulties. Before you can start breathing through your nose, though, you'll need to unblock it.


Calm your breathing as much as possible, then take a small breath (inhale and exhale) through your nose. If you can't breathe through your nose, breathe through the corner of your mouth.
Pinch your nose with your fingers, close your mouth, and hold your breath. Gently nod your head up and down while holding your breath, and continue until you feel a strong need to breathe in.
When inhaling, release your nose but keep your mouth closed. Breathe gently through your nose, inhaling and exhaling, and calm your breathing again as quickly as possible.
After two minutes, you can repeat the exercise again if your nose still feels blocked.

, Wheezing is associated with tense nerves and muscles in your chest, so warming this area of your body can help relax it and reduce some of your respiratory difficulties.


Keep a hot towel on your chest, upper back, shoulders, and neck for approximately 10 minutes. Repeat every 30 minutes for as long as your symptoms persist.

, Wheezing can be triggered or worsened by hyperventilation. If you experience both symptoms, learning to slow your breathing can prevent your lungs from hyperventilating and may reduce any related wheezing.Spend a few minutes concentrating on your breathing. During this time, devote 13 to 16 seconds per full breath (inhale and exhale). Breathe through your nose since mouth breathing can encourage quicker breaths.

, Breathing exercises should help improve your lung capacity and strength. They may not stop your wheezing immediately, but over time, your overall lung health should improve and lead to fewer wheezing episodes.


Enroll yourself in a yoga class or mindful meditation course. Either option will include instruction on proper breathing, and you should learn various exercises designed to help improve the strength of your lungs.
Singing classes may also include instruction and advice on improving lung capacity, so if yoga doesn't appeal to you, it might be another option worth considering.

, Cardiovascular exercise, in general, can improve your body's overall health and strengthen your lung capacity over time.


Start slowly by including mild forms of exercise into your daily routine. For instance, you might begin with one 30-minute walk each day. After several weeks, you can turn this walk into a jog. A few weeks after that, turn that jog into a run.
Working gradually will usually work better than pushing yourself too hard from the start. Too much vigorous exercise can actually cause severe wheezing if your lungs aren't prepared for it.

, Wheezing is only a symptom of some other condition. You should schedule an appointment with your doctor to determine the cause of your wheezing if the symptom lasts for more than a few days.Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and triggers. He or she may also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope, and if your lungs have never been evaluated, you might be asked to perform a breathing test. Other tests, including blood tests and chest x-rays, may also be necessary.
Conditions that commonly cause wheezing include asthma, allergies, bronchitis, other respiratory infections, and anxiety disorders.

, Professional treatment for wheezing varies depending on the condition causing it. After diagnosing the cause, work with your doctor to determine the best treatment plan for your needs.


Wheezing caused by asthma can be treated with ""emergency"" bronchodilator inhalers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-lasting brochodilator-corticosteroid combination inhalers, and asthma controller pills.
Wheezing caused by allergies can be prevented by avoiding any identified allergens. Your doctor may also prescribe a non-sedating antihistamine pill.
Your doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator inhaler to treat wheezing caused by bronchitis, and if a bacterial infection develops, he or she might also prescribe an antibiotic.
Patients whose wheezing stems from an anxiety disorder should seek treatment for their anxiety. This treatment can come in the form of medication, psychological therapy, or some combination of the two.

, When wheezing makes it difficult to breathe, you should seek emergency medical treatment. You should also seek emergency care if you develop severe lethargy, dizziness, or a high fever.


Emergency treatment may include a shot of epinephrine to open your airways. You may also need oxygen, corticosteroids, nebulizer treatments, or treatments with a mechanical ventilator.

Dress in layers.,
Use insulation techniques.,
Don’t forget your feet.,
Stockpile blankets and sleeping bags.,
Look for a tent if you know you are staying outside.,
Find a metallic survival blanket.,
Collect plastic bags.,
Look for a mat that will protect you from the cold ground.,
Eat right before bed.,
Go to bed when you’re warm.,
Keep moving.,
Don’t let your sleeping materials get damp.,
Look for a designated winter shelter.,
Check homeless shelters for room.,
Find alternate shelters.",How to Stay Warm on Cold Winter Nights if You are Homeless," The best way to do this is work on collecting your layers year round. Whenever you find a warm winter coat someone else has thrown away, hold on to it. It will come in handy during the winter, and can be used as a pillow or to lay on other times of the year. Think about using a plastic bag over you if you don't have a waterproof layer -- if you get wet, you get cold., You can insulate yourself with multiple layers, but if you’re still cold, try newspaper. By crumpling it up and stuffing it between layers of clothing you can create insulating pockets of air that will help keep you warm. You could also try foam pieces or blankets between your clothing, both of which are much warmer than newspaper. Plastic bags also work well. If you have nothing else, dry leaves will even work.Don't use fiberglass insulation (often pink fibers between layers of paper, used in houses). The tiny glass fibers will cut your skin and could cause infection.

, Wear multiple socks on cold nights. Before it gets cold, work on finding boots that cover your whole foot, ankle, and part of your leg. Keeping your feet and lower legs protected from cold wind is essential to staying warm. If you are really cold, you might need to create layers of insulation on your feet, perhaps even including plastic bags. Make sure you go to bed with dry socks on., Keep an eye out for blankets and sleeping bags during summer and fall that might have been discarded in trash cans, before you really need them. These will be essential when you are sleeping outside, but can also keep you warm in a car or in a more protected shelter. Wrap yourself with blankets and then get into the sleeping bag for maximum warmth.

, Sometimes people throw tents away with only minor holes or rips -- look at campsites or other places where people have put up tents. Some people don’t want to sleep indoors even when it’s freezing. To make sure you have some kind of shelter outside, think about trying to find a tent for yourself. If you can’t find one, stringing up blankets from trees can help create a makeshift shelter.

, These are often handed out at the end of a marathon or other long run and then are quickly discarded. Collect a few of these (they are very light and easy to fold up) for winter nights. Cover the torso area at least of your sleeping bag with the survival blankets., You will need to keep your clothing and bedding dry and protected from the elements. Plastic bags of all sizes will help you keep your possessions in good shape, no matter the weather. You can even use them as a liner to help keep your feet warmer (and prevent your boots from getting damp with sweat). Try to find a big one to use as a poncho so your outer layer doesn't get wet in rain or snow.

, Foam pieces are going to be the best. Air mattresses or pads will easily transmit the cold to your body., Try to get hot food right before you go to sleep. The meal can help you warm up and keep you warm enough to get into bed while your body still has heat. Keep in mind that fattier foods are going to be better for keeping you warm. Try these kinds of foods:Cheese
Canned beans
Cream of Mushroom or Cream of Chicken Soup, If it’s cold outside and you are cold going to bed, you’re not going to be able to warm yourself up. Do what it takes to get warm before you get under your blankets or into the sleeping bag. Run around, windmill your arms, do jumping jacks -- any of these could get your body warm enough., On particularly cold nights, you might have to stay awake and in motion to stay warm. A body in motion creates heat and will help you keep warm. If this means moving around during the night and resting during the day that may be a trade-off you will have to make. However, you must be cautious not to overheat and start sweating. When you sweat, you leave moisture trapped in your clothing and on your skin which can cool you down.

, Wet blankets and sleeping bags in the cold are not going to dry. If you have a sleeping bag, try not to even breathe into it -- it can get it damp quite easily. Package your sleeping materials in plastic bags during the day so that they won’t get wet. Also avoid setting up camp close to water -- it will blow around and get your sleeping materials wet., In regions where the weather gets extremely cold in the winter, most local governments set up shelters for winter in churches and other community buildings. These are only open on the coldest nights. Look for postings around town that will tell you which buildings are designated.

, Homeless shelters typically fill up quickly in the winter months, so if you want to sleep in one for the night, you will probably need to line up early. Many churches and other community organizations operate shelters to help people in need., If you are not able to or do not want to go to a shelter, find a good place to sleep. This can include overhangs that will protect you from rain or alleyways that are out of the wind. In extreme circumstances, you may have to find an area that is warm even if it is not permissible for you to be there; this can include hallways in apartment complexes, subways, public buildings or even unoccupied housing units. When you sleep at night, be sure it is somewhere warm. Hypothermia can set in while you are sleeping if you lack adequate warmth.

Follow through with all vaccine appointments.With the busyness of day-to-day life, it may seem challenging to attend all of the recommended medical and vaccine appointments prior to your trip.",How to Stay Updated on Your Vaccines," It normally becomes available in the late fall months. The vaccine offered each year is slightly different, as it is tailored to the 3 strains of influenza that are most likely to be problematical in the coming year.


To stay fully up-to-date on your vaccinations, it is recommended to see your family doctor for a flu vaccine every year.
This will not only decrease your risk of contracting the flu, it will also put those around you (such as the elderly and young children) at lower risk.
Increased risk patients include: the very old or very young, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, those with certain chronic diseases.;
, When people present to their doctor with an open wound, they will be asked if their tetanus is up-to-date to prevent the wound from becoming infected. If not, a tetanus shot will be offered right then and there in the office. You can also book an appointment with your family doctor after 10 years have gone by to get your tetanus vaccine renewed.


It is recommended to get the tetanus diphtheria combined vaccine once in your life instead of the tetanus vaccine. The additional immunity from the combined vaccine will last a lifetime.
DTaP is given in childhood, then a booster shot at age 11 to 12.

, It is also recommended for young children under the age of 5.


If you are allergic to neomycin or gelatin, you should not get this vaccine.

, It is ideal to receive this vaccine prior to initiating sexual intercourse, which is why it is recommended for girls if possible (however, the vaccine is offered to young women under 25 who have not been vaccinated, even if they have already had their sexual debut).


The vaccine should ideally be given in females aged 11 to 12 for the prevention of cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer.

, If you have never had chickenpox before in your life, you are eligible to receive the chickenpox vaccine; however, it is very rare for an adult never to have contracted chickenpox in his or her childhood. This vaccine is generally given to children since most adults have already had chickenpox, which provides lifetime immunity to the disease.


Doctors recommend routine childhood vaccination with 2 doses The first dose should be administered at 12 to 15 months of age. The second dose should be administered at four to six years old, before the child begins school

, It is one of the vaccinations recommended in childhood. See your family doctor for further information regarding the recommended vaccination schedule for babies and children.

, Pneumococcal disease causes meningitis, bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and ear infections.The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is recommended for infants and young children, adults over 65, and adults over 19 who are immunocompromised by conditions such as HIV infection, organ transplantation, leukemia, lymphoma, and severe kidney disease.The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is appropriate for high-risk children, adults 19–65 who smoke or have asthma, and anyone over 65 years of age., If you believe you may be one of these people, due to your occupation (such as working in the hospital) or your health status, book an appointment with your family doctor to talk about it in more detail.

, People with more severe diabetes, respiratory disease, heart disease, or other conditions such as HIV/AIDS, an organ transplantation, or general autoimmune disease will likely need more vaccinations than the general population.


Talk to your doctor about additional vaccinations if any of these conditions apply to you.

, It is important to talk to your doctor about which additional vaccines you are eligible for, and to plan appointments to receive these immunizations.You may be eligible for the meningococcal vaccine, hepatitis A and B vaccines, and the haemophilus influenzae vaccine, among others. Your doctor will be able to provide you with the exact details depending upon your age, your health history, and your occupation.

, Phone your doctor's office when you are thinking of booking the trip to consult about the timing of when you would need to come in for vaccines.

, When you go in to see your doctor, bring a list with you of the vaccinations you have already received. This way, he or she will be able to determine which new ones you may need, depending upon the area you are travelling to.

, Usually a few months notice should suffice to receive all necessary vaccinations (for trips to higher risk areas). You may not need additional vaccinations if you are traveling to a low risk area.

, However, missing any of these appointments may put you at serious risk of contracting a potentially dangerous illness while away. Following through with all of your appointments will minimize your risk and set you up for a smooth and successful travel trip.


Also, certain vaccines require a series of shots to be completed. It is for this reason that not missing any of your appointments is key.

Prepare in advance.,
Reframe your thinking.,
Move your body to release energy.,
Distract yourself.,
Count on humor.,
Try deep breathing.,
Kick perfectionism to the curb.",How to Stop the Jitters1," One of the best ways to minimize your chances of feeling anxious is through preparation. Symptoms of panic and anxiety often arise due to the unknowns of a situation, so mapping out an activity or event beforehand may help. Do as much as you can in advance to reduce panic later.For example, if you are on edge because of an upcoming job interview, figure out your route ahead of time to reduce your chances of arriving late. Practice questions with a friend or roommate. Ready your outfit the night before.;
, Sometimes nervous jitters can be easily reduced or eliminated if you just change your inner dialogue to be more positive. Words hold a lot of power over how you feel, especially if the words have a negative undertone. As you feel the onset of increased nerves and jitters, do a check in with your words.


Ask yourself, “What words are flowing through my mind that scare me?” Perhaps they are things like, “I’m going to do terrible on that test,” “She'll never say yes if I ask her out,” or “If I try to parallel park here, I will mess up and everyone will see.” When you pay more attention to your internal dialogue, you can usually see that your thoughts are exaggerated, devastating, and down right destructive.
Any time you catch yourself with negative thoughts, take a moment to change them. Replace each negative thought with two or three positive ones. For example, “I studied hard and will ace that test tomorrow,” or “Even if I got a B on that test, I will know I did my best and it is still a great grade.”

, The jitters often feel like pent-up energy inside your body. There’s no better way to release this energy than by moving your body. This can translate to intense physical activity like running or lifting weights. However, you can also simply take your dog for a walk around the block or turn on some music and dance.If you feel jittery before an event, try shaking your hands, stretching, or jumping up and down to alleviate the edgy feeling.

, Typically, when you feel the jitters, you lock your attention on the situation that’s making you anxious. You can stop the jitters by distracting your mind from the panic-inducing event. Distraction techniques can include virtually anything.


Try striking up a conversation with someone sitting nearby. Grab a pen and paper and doodle. Or, write down a reassuring quote over and over again, such as “This too shall pass.” Read a book or listen to some music., Laughing is a great way to relax the body and mind in an anxiety-provoking situation. You might call up a buddy who has a strong sense of humor, tell a joke, or watch a funny YouTube video. A quick laugh may calm jitters and help you regain control of your nerves.

, Calm breathing is an excellent technique for managing the jitters. This exercise involves taking slow, controlled breaths to decrease the heart rate and relax the body. Taking deep breaths and purposefully slowing your body movements increases oxygenated blood flow throughout your body as it courses through all of your organs, including your brain. This increase of oxygenated blood flowing to your brain improves your thinking and your ability to think logically. Spend a few minutes focusing completely on your breath and you’ll notice the jitters have faded.Purposely make your outflow of breath slower than your intake, as this mimics the breathing you have when you are sleeping, tricking our brain and body to become more relaxed.
Breathe in through your mouth. Hold for a few counts. Then, release the air through your nose. Count as you go through each cycle. In and out, “one.” In and out, “two.” And, so on.

, Trying hard to be perfect is one of the main reasons you may experience jitters. You fear failure, rejection, or embarrassment so your body gets shaky and wound up. Tackle your perfectionist tendencies and you can stop the jitters in their tracks.You can cope with perfectionism by getting some perspective. What is it that you are so worried about? Common causes of concern are someone laughing at you or making a fool of yourself. Think about how often that has happened in the past. Then, remind yourself “It’s very unlikely that they will laugh at me.”

Try Pepto-Bismol.,
Have psyllium fiber.,
Ask your doctor about medication you are already on.",How to Stop Severe Diarrhea1," It is often best to let severe diarrhea run its course so your body can rid itself of the bacteria causing the diarrhea. But you can also try taking medications to help slow down your diarrhea. You can get Pepto-Bismol over-the-counter at your local pharmacy. It has mild antibacterial effects and slows down your diarrhea. Follow the label instructions for dosage information.;
, Psyllium fiber can be an effective antidote to severe diarrhea as it can help to soak up water in your intestines and make your stool more firm.


If you are an adult, have 2.5 to 30 grams (0.09 to 1 oz) a day in a divided dose. You can take psyllium when you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
If you are a child, six to 11 years old, have 1.25 to 15 grams (0.044 to 0.53 oz) a day orally in divided doses.

, Sometimes, severe diarrhea can be caused by medication you are already taking for other medical issues. Talk to your doctor about your medications to rule them out as the causes of your severe diarrhea.


If your medication is causing the severe diarrhea, your doctor may switch your medication or suggest a lower dosage.

Prevent dehydration by drinking lots of fluids.,
Eat foods containing soluble fiber.,
Try the BRAT diet.,
Take probiotics.",How to Stop Chronic Diarrhea1," When you have diarrhea you need to replace the water lost during each episode, but bear in mind that water is not the only thing you are losing. You will also need to replenish your potassium, sodium, and chloride.Drink water, fruit juices, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths.


Children should drink rehydration solutions made especially for them — drinks like Pedialyte, which contain salts and minerals.Confirm you are getting enough fluids by doing the pinch test, medically known as the skin turgor test. Pinch a section of skin on the back of your hand, your lower arm, or your abdominal area and hold it for a few seconds. Make sure the skin is tented upward. Release the skin after a few seconds. If the skin snaps back quickly to its normal position, you are well hydrated. If the skin stays tented upward and snaps back slowly, you are likely dehydrated.;
, Soluble fiber will help your body absorb water and make your stool more firm, thereby slowing down your diarrhea. Soluble fiber is found in foods like oats, bran, plain rice, steamed broccoli, and barley.There is another type of fiber — insoluble fiber — that is found in foods like celery and citrus fruits. Insoluble fiber does not absorb water (think about the difference between putting a cup of oats in a pot of water vs. a stick of celery in a pot of water — the oats would absorb the liquid and become sticky, but the celery would remain unchanged).This type of fiber will make your diarrhea worse and should be avoided.Grains should be cooked in a light chicken or miso broth. Use a 2:1 ratio, with twice as much liquid used per one cup of grains. For example, you would cook ½ cup barley in 2 cups of chicken broth.
Insoluble fiber is found in wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains., The BRAT diet can help to bulk up your stool and provide nutrients you may have lost because of the diarrhea and any vomiting. The BRAT diet is composed of:Bananas
Rice
Applesauce
Toast
You can also eat salted crackers to help reduce any nausea or vomiting you may be experiencing.

, Probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG, acidophilus, and bifidobacteria can be found at your local pharmacy. These are “friendly” gut bacteria that help you maintain a healthy gut. Taking them while you have diarrhea allows the “friendly” bacteria to fight off the disease causing bacteria.You can also have yogurt to increase the active cultures in your stomach and counteract the disease causing bacteria in your gut.

Cleanse and moisture your face daily.,
Make sure to take care of those pearly whites.,
Drink 8 glasses of water a day.,
Eat at least five portions of fruits and vegetables a day.,
Know that exercise can be anything from going on the trampoline to walking your dog.,
Stay natural.",How to Stay Naturally Beautiful," Make sure you cleanse and moisture your face two times a day. Early in the morning and just before going to bed. This will help keep your skin clean and looking fresh. Find a cleanser that suits your skin type. If not then just use mild or baby soap. If you have oily skin then use an oil-free moisture but if you have dry or combination skin then you might use a different one.;
, Nothing helps a face look more beautiful than a bright white smile. Brush your teeth at least twice a day. And using a whitening toothpaste will help keep them looking their very best.

, That is basically 2 liters (0.5 US gal). Trust me you need water. 75% of your body is made up of water and without it you won't be able to live for more than 3 days. Drinking water will keep both your skin and body clear. Just try drinking 8 glasses of water for 2 weeks and you will already see the results. Also drinking lots of water means going to the toilet a lot so don't keep it in.

, Fruit and veg are not just important but vital to you. Eating them will help keep your skin glowing. Even if you think you can't have that apple, go for it!

, When people think of the word exercise they think running 1 mile (1.6 km) to keep fit. That's not true. Just make sure you are active and do something everyday and before you know it, you'll be fit.

, The big one and most secret one. It's smiling. Yes that's all, smiling. Just smile to everyone you see, whether it's your mum, dog or even teacher. Smiling will make you feel a whole lot better and it will make you and other people realise what a better person you are. Let your inner self shine

Wait it out.,
Eat something.,
Put natural add-ins into coffee or tea.,
Get some exercise.,
Monitor daily caffeine consumption.,
Reduce or limit your caffeine intake.,
Avoid caffeine consumption late in the day.",How to Stop the Jitters2," Although the least desirable method of action, letting your body calm down on its own is the most effective method of stopping caffeine jitters once they start. As you wait, it may be a good idea to distract yourself with another activity to get your mind off how you’re feeling.


Try lying down for a few minutes and closing your eyes. You may be unable to nap, but doing so may help you calm down and relax.You might also watch TV, run errands, or clean your living space.

, You are less likely to get the jitters in the first place if you don’t drink coffee on an empty stomach. If you have already made this error, correct it by consuming a hearty meal. Try something filling like oatmeal or stew.Because caffeine dehydrates the body, drink some water with your meal, also.
Caffeine drains the body of needed nutrients. You might also experience benefits from eating nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables like oranges, bananas, spinach or kale., When you add natural organic fats, proteins and sugars to your caffeinated coffee or tea, it will help to balance out your blood sugar and energy levels while simultaneously decreasing the stress hormones that give you the jitters. Do not do this with artificial sweeteners and creamers.


Try adding in whole raw organic grass fed milk, soy, almond, or coconut creamers.
Use raw sugar cane, coconut sugar, maple syrup or honey as a sweetener.

, Physical activity can help you burn off some of the excess energy created after drinking too much coffee. Exercise may neutralize the effects of caffeine, so carve out 15 to 30 minutes to get your body moving.Run, jog, walk, or dance. Just focus on getting your body moving to help burn off the extra energy created by caffeine consumption.

, Chances are you have no idea how much caffeine you are actually consuming daily. Most people think of coffee, tea, and energy drinks as having caffeine in them. However there are plenty of other foods that have caffeine as well. An 8 ounce cup of coffee will typically contain about 80 milligrams of caffeine (but this can vary slightly depending upon the source). Your decaffeinated coffee still contains a small amount of caffeine (about 2-25 milligrams).


Most soft drinks can have anywhere between 23 and 69 milligrams of caffeine.
Your teas will vary greatly in the amount of caffeine depending on the source, brand, and type of tea. Some teas, such as black tea can have as much as 47 milligrams of caffeine for one 8 ounce cup of tea.
Chocolate comes from the cocoa beans which typically have a high amount of caffeine. With chocolate, the higher the cocoa content, the higher the caffeine content you will consume. A chocolate bar that is between 45 to 60 percent cocoa can have up to 70 milligrams of caffeine in it.
Ice cream may also contain caffeine if it is flavored with coffee, tea, or chocolate. Some brands and types of ice cream can have as much as 125 milligrams per 4 ounce serving.

, If you’re already feeling jittery due to caffeine consumption, you should stop drinking it immediately. Never continue drinking coffee if you already feel edgy, as doing so will only worsen the problem. In the future, drink a little at a time to reduce the possibility of over-consumption.


The appropriate amount of caffeine varies from person to person. In general, however, 5 to 6 cups may lead to “caffeine intoxication” for some. Symptoms might include a fast heartbeat, sleep disturbance, headache, anxiety, irritability, and frequent urination., In addition to drinking too much, another reason people feel jittery due to caffeine is having it too close to bedtime. Because it’s a stimulant, you may begin to feel on edge and have difficulty getting to sleep. Avoid consuming caffeine at least six hours before your bedtime to reduce these effects.Listen to your body. Some people may have to cut their caffeine intake much earlier to prevent it from interfering with sleep quality.

Fuel your body with nutritious foods.,
Exercise daily.,
Get enough rest.,
Start a self-care regimen.",How to Stop the Jitters3," A bad diet loaded with sugary and fattening processed foods can often exacerbate anxiety. If you tend to feel jittery, you may want to clean up your diet. Choose whole foods like fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, lean sources of protein, nuts and seeds, whole grains, and low-fat dairy.


In addition to cutting out sugary foods, limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol which may worsen anxiety. Drink plenty of water instead., Regular exercise can also combat anxiety. What’s more, squeezing a workout into your day, particularly in the morning, can provide you with an energy boost so you don’t have to turn to caffeine. Find an exercise routine you enjoy and aim to get physical for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week., Sleep deprivation often heightens anxiety and can lead to the jittery feeling you are experiencing. Make sleep a priority to help get anxiety under control. If you have trouble getting to sleep, develop a special nighttime routine that makes getting to sleep easier.


This routine might involve taking a warm bath or shower, doing some light reading, journaling, or listening to calming music. Shut down electronic devices like cell phones and TVs that keep you awake longer., Sometimes, you may feel jittery because you are overworked and lack sufficient self-care. It’s important to set aside time each day to do things you enjoy. This helps you relax, and can even ensure you are more productive when you need to be.


Try a creative pursuit such as writing or knitting. Or, watch your favorite TV show. Do relaxation strategies such as yoga or meditation. Focus on refilling your cup so that you can effectively handle your daily responsibilities."

Drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day.,
Consume high-fiber foods.,
Do the BRAT diet.,
Add a pinch of salt to liquids or soft, solid foods.,
Have probiotics.",How to Stop Severe Diarrhea2," Diarrhea can lead to a large loss of water in your body. Prevent dehydration by having eight to 10 eight ounce glasses of water a day to replace the fluids you have lost.You can check if you are getting enough fluids by doing the pinch test, medically known as the skin turgor test. Use your fingers to pinch a section of skin on the back of your hand, your lower arm, or your abdominal area and hold it for a few seconds. Make sure the skin is tented upward. Release the skin after a few seconds. If the skin snaps back quickly to its normal position, you are well hydrated. If the skin stays tented upward and smooths back slowly, you are likely dehydrated.You can also tell if you are getting enough fluids by checking the color of your urine. If your urine appears darker than normal, drink more water. If you are well hydrated, your urine will appear bright yellow.
Water alone will not always fix more severe dehydration. Try adding a pinch of honey or sugar with a dash of salt to the water you drink, or supplementing your eight to 10 glasses with an electrolyte solution available at your local pharmacy. Correcting electrolyte imbalances can often help the body to ""reboot"" after a bout of severe diarrhea.

, Fiber will help to slow down your diarrhea by allowing your body to absorb water and making your stool more firm. Stay away from fatty, oil, or spicy foods that contain fiber and go for lighter foods high in fiber. Have brown rice with vegetables, barley, or another whole grain like oats or quinoa.


Cook grains in a light chicken or miso broth. Use a 2:1 ratio, with twice as much liquid used per one cup of grains. For example, you would cook ½ cup barley in 2 cups of chicken broth.
Have well-cooked, starchy vegetables like potatoes, yams, sweet potatoes, and winter squash.
You can also have fresh vegetable juices like carrot or celery juice. Dilute the vegetable juice with an equal amount of water.

, The BRAT diet can help to bulk up your stool and provide nutrients you may have lost due to the diarrhea and any vomiting. The BRAT diet is made up of:Bananas
Rice
Applesauce
Toast (whole grain)
You can also eat salted crackers to help reduce any nausea or vomiting you may be experiencing, and ginger ale is often helpful in reducing nausea symptoms.

, Your body will also loose salt when you have severe diarrhea. Add a pinch of salt to liquids you are drinking or soft, solid foods you are eating to replace vital minerals in your body. You can use table salt or sea salt., You can find probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG, acidophilus, and bifidobacteria at your local pharmacy. Probiotics are “friendly” gut bacteria that help you maintain a healthy gut. Taking them while you have diarrhea allows the “friendly” bacteria to compete with the disease causing bacteria.You can also add yogurt to your diet to increase the active cultures in your stomach and counteract the disease causing bacteria in your gut.

Avoid caffeinated beverages.",How to Stop Chronic Diarrhea2," Herbal teas can help to settle an upset stomach or bouts of nausea that may occur due to the diarrhea.Ginger tea is safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Children over two years of age can have light ginger tea or flat non-carbonated ginger ale. Ginger tea has not been tested for use for very young children.

, You can have tea bags or add one teaspoon of chamomile leaf or fenugreek seeds per cup of hot water. Consume five to six cups of tea a day. These herbal teas help to settle your stomach and calm down your digestive system.

, Researchers at The University of Maryland have also found blackberry leaf tea, raspberry leaf tea, bilberry teas, and carob powder drinks can help to settle the stomach. These beverages have antibacterial and antiviral properties.Do not consume bilberry tea if you are on blood thinners or have diabetes.

, Try not to have any coffee, black tea, green tea, or caffeinated sodas.These drinks can make your diarrhea worse, as they can stimulate bowel movements.


Stay away from alcohol as it can also irritate your bowels and make your diarrhea worse.

Devote some time to exercise.,
Put aside time for rest and relaxation.,
Stick to a sleep schedule.,
Consume alcohol responsibly.,
Avoid work related activities, if possible.,
Avoid overcommitting to social activities.,
Reserve time for family.,
Go food shopping.,
Set aside time for cooking.,
Avoid junk food.,
Eat healthy when you dine out.",How to Stay on Track with Healthy Habits on the Weekend," One of the best habits you can form during the weekend is exercise. Strive for a good balance of cardiovascular exercise, weight training, and stretching.Ultimately, the weekend will allow you spare time to get exercise you don’t normally get during the week.


Set aside some time on Saturday and Sunday to exercise.
Consider activities such as power walking, running, swimming, or cycling.
Try to exercise at least 30 minutes per day.
Think about melding recreation with cardiovascular exercise. For instance, consider taking up cycling. You may find that you have time to enjoy cycling on Saturday or Sunday mornings.;
, Make sure you have some downtime so you can recharge during the weekend. This is important, as overcommitting to demanding activities will wear you out and may impact your health.


Build some downtime at home into your schedule. Plan to spend a couple hours watching TV, reading a book, or just sitting around the house.

Meditation and yoga are also great for relaxation.
Spend time with friends and family.
Spend time with your pet, if you have one. The weekend is a great time to relax and take your dog for a walk.
Relax outside. Consider going to the beach, to the lake, or for a hike in the mountains., While it may be difficult, sticking to a good sleep schedule is one of the best habits for your weekend. This is because a work-free weekend offers you the option of staying up late and sleeping in. But in the end, both options may negatively impact your health.


Stick as close as you can to your normal schedule, but allow for deviations. For instance, if you usually go to sleep at 9PM and wakeup at 6AM, stay close to it. Consider going to sleep at 10PM and waking at 7AM or 730AM, if you want to deviate.
Avoid oversleeping. Studies have shown that oversleeping on weekends may result in weight gain and disease risk.
Make sure to get enough sleep. Resist the temptation to stay up all night. Losing sleep on the weekend will negatively impact your health and tire you out for the work week ahead.
Try not to sleep in an erratic way. Staying up all night and sleeping all day will throw your body’s sleep cycle off.If you do end up staying out to late, rather than sleeping in really late, consider taking a short 20 minute nap during the day., Partying, socializing, and drinking alcohol is another important aspect of many people's weekends. As a result, you need to make sure you embrace safe and healthy party habits so you don't put your health at risk. Binge drinking is defined as more than four drinks within two hours for women and more than five drinks for men, and it is unhealthy and unsafe.Eat before drinking. Have something that is a good source of protein. It will help to slow down alcohol absorption.Drink plenty of water before and after you drink alcohol.
Don't drink too much, too quickly. Try to drink no more than one drink an hour.
Limit the number of drinks you consume and avoid drinking and driving., A great healthy habit – both physically and psychologically – is to stay away from work related activities during the weekend. This is important, as work will take time away from other aspects of a positive, balanced weekend. Without exercise, relaxation, and social activities, you won’t be able to recharge so you can be happy and healthy for the week ahead.


Consider staying an hour or so after work on Friday to tie up any loose ends so you don’t have to worry about work over the weekend.
Let your coworkers know that you’re not available for overtime or extra projects over the weekend.
If you can’t avoid work altogether during the weekend, carve out a specific slot for it., You might be tempted to overcommit to a variety of social activities since you have a substantial amount of free time. However, overcommitting may stress you out and undermine your ability to enjoy whatever activities you do commit to.


Use a day planner to plan your weekend activities.
Avoid booking activities back-to-back. Instead, think about the day as three parts: morning, afternoon, and evening.
Allow enough time in between activities. For instance, if you have a morning commitment, make sure your afternoon is free. This will provide you with enough time in case your morning activity runs late.
Overcommitting has been shown to produce anxiety and decrease quality of life., Central to maintaining a healthy life is making sure you have time to spend with your family. Thus, you need to make sure you put some time aside specifically to spend with your family. This will help reinforce your relationships and will likely help you feel more connected to the people around you.


Plan a family picnic.
Play games with your family.
Go to a fair, a festival, or some similar activity with your family., For many people, the weekend allows time to get some desperately-needed grocery shopping done. By having groceries, you’ll make sure that you can prepare meals during the weekend and have healthy foods available at your home during the week.


Pick a time during the weekend to shop.
Prepare a grocery list that considers foods or things you’ll need to prepare meals during the week.
Think about a food budget, and try to stay on it when you shop for groceries., Extra time on the weekend will provide you with extra time to cook and eat things you don’t normally have the time to cook. Cooking will save you money, help you eat healthy, and may be relaxing.


Plan to cook at least three to four meals (or more) if possible.
Cook healthy. Try to use lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Avoid prepared frozen meals, boxed meals, or other popular but less-healthy shortcuts. For instance, try cooking an Asian stir fry meal on Saturday night or a fresh eggplant parmesan on Sunday night.
Consider cooking extra food on Sunday so you’ll have food prepared during first couple days of the week., While you may be tempted to enjoy your weekend by eating junk food or fast food, this is one of the worst things you can do. Ultimately, indulging in junk food during the weekend is counterproductive to your overall health and well-being.


Try not to eat lots of snack food like chips or pastries.
Stay away from fast food entirely during the weekend.
Focus on eating vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.
Drink lots of water, juice without added sugar or smoothies., While eating out with your friends is especially enjoyable on the weekend, it’s easy to slip up and blow your healthy habits. As a result, you need to choose wisely when picking meals you don't prepare yourself.


Avoid foods with lots of carbs.
Stay away from fried foods or oily foods.
Focus on lean protein.
Pick foods with fresh vegetables. For example, when picking an appetizer, try a vegetable plate with hummus instead of fried mushrooms.
Stick to healthy habits when you get take out, too."

Make yourself a simple breakfast of non-fat yogurt, granola, and fruit, or a quick lunch with a grain, a protein (like meat, fish, or tofu), and vegetables. Try not to skip any meals, as this can cause you to have low energy during the day.


Look for recipes online or cookbooks that have recipes that take 30 minutes or less to prepare. Select one meal a day you are going to prepare and shop at the beginning of the week for the ingredients. This will ensure you have everything you need on hand and can make yourself a healthy meal quickly and easily.

, Cut down on your daily sugar intake by opting for lots of water, instead of soda or fruit juice. It can help to carry a full water bottle with you so you can sip water throughout the day.

Meditation has been scientifically shown to reduce your stress levels and help you feel calm and balanced.It has many emotional benefits, from stress management to deeper self awareness and a reduction of negative emotions. It has also been shown to have medical benefits, especially if you suffer from anxiety disorders, high blood pressure, sleep issues or insomnia, and asthma. Meditation is also very effective for maintaining a general sense of well-being and physical health. There are several types of meditation, including:


Guided meditation: This type of meditation is also known as guided imagery or visualization. A teacher or guide will describe images, smells, sounds, and textures that are relaxing and calming. You can find guided meditation guides online and can often access them through a smartphone or tablet so that you can do it anywhere.

Mindful meditation: This type of meditation focuses on being mindful and aware of the present moment. You focus on what you experiencing during the meditation, such as the sounds around you or the flow of your breathing. In this type of meditation, you note your thoughts and emotions and you let them pass without judgement or comment.

When you do yoga, you are often encouraged to practice Pranayama, as the combination of yoga postures and deep breathing can lead to a meditative state.Start with the most basic Pranayama breathing exercise, where you breath in and out deeply through your nostrils using your diaphragm. Begin by sitting in a comfortable position in a quiet area with no distractions or noise.
Place your hands on your diaphragm, right below your rib cage, and take a deep breathe in through your nose. Try to inhale to the count of four.
Hold the breath for one second and then slowly exhale the breath out of your nose to the count of four. Imagine you are trying to fog up a mirror in front of your nose as you breathe out. You should make a noticeable whooshing sound as you exhale.
Repeat this breath cycle for ten to twenty breaths. Over time, you can extend the breath cycle for twenty to forty breaths.

, Improve your well-being by making time in your schedule to do one activity you enjoy a day. This could be something simple like reading a book or going for a walk. You could also do a specific hobby you enjoy, like crocheting, woodworking, or painting. Taking the time to do something you enjoy each day can help you to de stress and slow down, especially if you have a busy schedule or a demanding career.


To ensure you actually make time for an enjoyable activity, block off one hour or half an hour of your schedule for “you time”. This could be early in the morning when you first wake up or after you come home from school or work. Let family and partners know that you will be using this time to focus on your needs and to take some alone time doing what you enjoy.

Talk to your doctor about reducing your prescription drugs, especially if they are not considered necessary for your treatment.

, If you have a bad habit of thinking negatively about every situation or only considering the negative outcome, you may want to try to adjust your thinking to be more positive and proactive. Consider if you hang around any friends, co-workers, or family members that are a negative influence. They may complain often and only focus on the negative outcome of a situation, thereby encouraging you to also indulge in this way of thinking. Put distance between yourself and any negative individuals in your life, as negative thinking can lead to stress and anxiety.


If you notice that you tend to approach situations with a glass half empty approach, try to come up with ways to turn negative situations into positive learning moments. This could mean pausing, taking a deep breathe, and considering how to come up with a solution for the issue or problem, rather than simply complaining about the issue or problem.
For example, you may have an issue with a co-worker who does not follow through on his work commitments and continues to let clients down. Rather than allow the co-worker’s attitude cause you to develop negative thoughts or reactions, talk to the co-worker directly. Ask him to consider other ways of approaching clients and following through on his commitments. If he does not listen to you or show any signs of adjusting his behavior, you may want to escalate the issue to a supervisor. This will allow you to be proactive about a source of negativity in your life, rather than allow the negativity to consume you.

You will have to ensure that the nail does not grow back into the skin.
In severe cases, the entire nail bed may be removed using chemicals or a laser treatment. This, however, is rarely necessary for fingernails and is more commonly used to treat ingrown toenails.

Exercise not only controls weight, it helps fight disease, improves the immune system, and gives you more energy. Exercise also improves your mood and helps you sleep better., Many people find that going to a gym several times a week is a convenient way to exercise, but there are many other ways to stay healthy and active. Running, walking, and swimming are all great ways to stay fit. You might also consider taking lessons for something you'd like to learn: dancing, surfing, or ice skating., Pay attention to all the elements of total fitness, including endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility.Try to build up gradually to at least 30 minutes of an activity that makes you breathe hard. Your goal should be 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week, or 30 minutes five times a week.Lift weights to improve muscle tone. Keeping your muscles in shape will make your daily tasks easier to manage, and will help you avoid problems later in life, such as a broken hip caused by a fall.Improving your balance will also help you avoid dangerous falls later in life, and will allow you to remain active and mobile throughout your life. One easy exercise is to walk in a straight line, placing the heel of one foot directly in front of the toe of the other as if you were crossing a river on a slender beam.Regular stretching exercises will improve your overall flexibility, making it easier to bend to tie your shoes or to reach something on a high shelf. Be sure to stretch your muscles gently, to avoid injury., Having an “exercise buddy” will help you both to stay motivated, and will make your workout time more enjoyable. For a fun weekend activity, get some friends together to play basketball, softball, volleyball, or tennis., Setting goals for yourself will help keep you motivated, and meeting your goal milestones will give you a wonderful boost of confidence and a feeling of accomplishment; however, be sure to break your overall goals down into small, manageable steps, so you won't become discouraged., It isn't necessary to work out first thing in the morning, if you are not a morning person. If you feel most active in the afternoon, schedule your workouts for the afternoon hours., If you aren't sure where to start, enlist the help of a professional fitness trainer. Some gyms offer free consultation with a fitness trainer as part of your enrollment fee. If you don't belong to a gym, seek out an independent trainer to work with you. A trainer will assess your strengths and weaknesses, and suggest a regimen that will achieve your particular fitness goals."

Identify the signs of active cardiac arrest.,
Know what to do if you witness cardiac arrest alone.,
Take charge of a group if you witness cardiac arrest.,
Know the risk factors for cardiac arrest.,
Recognize warning signs for cardiac arrest.,
Seek appropriate medical attention.,
Don’t confuse cardiac arrest with a heart attack.,
Accept the grim statistics.,
Know that warning signs are not only possible, but important, to identify.,
Don’t panic, and be proactive.",How to Spot Early Signs of Cardiac Arrest," If you experience cardiac arrest, there is nothing you can do for yourself because you will be unconscious within seconds. You should be aware of the signs of an ongoing cardiac arrest episode and share it with those around you, so that everyone is prepared to act immediately.


Someone who experiences cardiac arrest will collapse and become unresponsive almost immediately. She will not respond to taps on the shoulder or verbal commands. Pulse and breathing will be non-existent or extremely faint (with perhaps some shallow gasping for air). The clock begins ticking at once — brain damage can begin almost immediately, and death can occur within four to six minutes.;
, As mentioned, every second counts with cardiac arrest. If you see someone collapse and note the other signs of likely cardiac arrest, you absolutely must act without delay if you want there to be any chance of saving that person’s life. Anyone, anywhere — including you — can be a lifesaver.If you are alone with the person, do the following:


Call 911 or your emergency services number immediately

Get an automatic external defibrillator (AED) if one is close by, and use it according to its instructions;
Begin “hands-only” CPR, doing forceful chest compressions at 100 to 120 pushes per minute (if you're not sure how fast this is, try doing it to the beat of the Bee Gee's song ""Stayin' Alive.""
Continue without stopping until emergency help arrives

, If you see a person in a crowd collapse from suspected cardiac arrest, and someone who is clearly knowledgeable doesn't immediately take charge, step up yourself and act forcefully. Give specific people clear roles and immediately begin lifesaving procedures on the victim. Now is not the time to be timid, quiet, or polite.When there are other people around: #*Take charge — order one person to call 911, and another to fetch an AED (assign roles clearly)


Start “hands-only” CPR immediately
Switch off doing compressions with another available person once you tire
Never stop compressions (except when using the AED — and even then, continue until the AED is ready to analyze. Even as they are applying the pads, continue compressions) until help arrives

, Roughly half of all people who experience cardiac arrest have no prior warning signs. However, a majority of these people do have identifiable risk factors for the condition. It is therefore essential that you know if you are at elevated risk for cardiac arrest.Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack or coronary heart disease, but it shares many of the same risk factors. These include:


Family history
Smoking
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Obesity
Diabetes
Sedentary lifestyle
Excessive alcohol consumption
Previous cardiac arrest or heart attack
Increased age (65 or older)
Male gender (men are two to three times more susceptible)
Illegal drug use
Nutritional imbalance (such as low potassium or magnesium)

, While half of people who suffer cardiac arrest have no prior symptoms, the other half do. The problem is that the symptoms can be vague, mild, and often easily ignored as indigestion, the flu, or something else. Especially if you are at an elevated risk for cardiac arrest, do not downplay or ignore potential symptoms.Warning signs of an impending cardiac arrest can occur within 24 hours of the event, and sometimes even up to a month in advance. They can include: chest pain; heart palpitations; irregular heartbeat; wheezing or shortness of breath; fainting, lightheadedness, or dizziness; flu-like symptoms (nausea, abdominal or back pain).

, If you are at an elevated risk for cardiac arrest and you are experiencing any of the ""warning sign"" symptoms in an ongoing fashion, contact emergency services immediately. If you are at elevated risk and experience them episodically, contact your doctor immediately and contact emergency services if necessary.If you are not at elevated risk for cardiac arrest but are experiencing the ""warning sign"" symptoms, consult your doctor. Do not simply ignore the signs because you assume cardiac arrest cannot happen to you.
Even without symptoms or obvious risk factors, it may be a good idea to conduct a risk assessment with your doctor to determine your chances of experiencing cardiac arrest.

, Both conditions impact the heart and can be deadly, but they have different causes. A heart attack is a circulation problem, caused by a blockage that prevents adequate blood flow to the heart. Cardiac arrest is an electrical problem — it involves a malfunction of the heart’s electrical system (an arrhythmia) that regulates the heartbeat, in turn preventing the heart from circulating oxygenated blood properly.A heart attack is like a clogged pipe that prevents food from moving through your garbage disposal; cardiac arrest is like a malfunction that causes the disposal’s motor to stop running food through.
By blocking blood flow, a heart attack can trigger cardiac arrest, but doesn’t always do so. Cardiac arrest will not cause a heart attack, because the heart muscle is already stopped.
Heart attacks can be mild to severe; cardiac arrest is always severe and extremely life threatening.

, Sadly, the numbers are not pretty when it comes to cardiac arrest. When it occurs outside of a hospital setting, cardiac arrest is fatal at least 90% of the time, and about half of the time occurs with no warning. That means over 300,000 Americans per year die from such episodes.The brain is affected almost immediately by a lack of oxygenated blood flow that occurs during cardiac arrest. Brain damage can occur within seconds and may be permanent. Death often occurs within four to six minutes if CPR or an AED are not utilized. These measures improve survival odds, but not overwhelmingly.Most cases of cardiac arrest are caused by a heart attack; cardiomyopathy (an enlarged heart); valvular heart disease; electrical problems in the heart, such as long QT syndrome; or a congenital heart defect. Heart defects are the most common cause of cardiac arrest among seemingly healthy children and young adults.

, Recognizable symptoms occur hours to weeks before cardiac arrest only about half the time, but when they do and are addressed, the survival rate increases substantially. Especially if you are at elevated risk for cardiac arrest, do not ignore warning signs like chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and lightheadedness.According to the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (2002–2012), only 19% of people who experienced symptoms prior to a cardiac arrest episode sought medical attention. Those who did not seek medical attention had a survival rate of 6%. Those who did seek medical attention had a survival rate of 32%. 20% of that group experienced cardiac arrest in the ambulance on the way to the hospital., Despite the worrisome statistics, your odds of experiencing cardiac arrest are low, especially if you do not have one or more elevated risk factors. It is more likely that you will have the opportunity to assist someone else experiencing cardiac arrest, so learn CPR and share your knowledge with others.Living a healthier lifestyle, by eating properly, exercising regularly, not smoking, getting enough sleep, drinking in moderation, and reducing stress can help reduce many of the causes of cardiac arrest.
Talk to your doctor about your overall risk for cardiac arrest and other heart problems. Medications that address high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or other aspects of heart health may be right for you.
If you survive a cardiac arrest episode, an internal defibrillator may be implanted in your chest. This device can shock your heart back into rhythm if another episode occurs."

Start with your feet.,
Move your body weight to the balls of your feet.,
Don’t lock your knees.,
Adjust the curvature of your spine.,
Shrug your shoulders and let your arms drop.,
Check your shoulders for “roundness.” Sometimes people stand with rounded shoulders, which can lead to shoulder and neck pain.An easy way to check whether your shoulders are rounded or not is to stand in front of a mirror.,
Pinch your shoulder blades together about an inch (2.5cm).,
Keep your head even.,
Check your posture with the wall test.",How to Stand Correctly1," They should be hip-distance apart. If they are crossed, uncross them and try to keep them aligned with your hips.Keeping one foot slightly forward of the other can help relieve pressure from your lower back muscles.Keep your feet pointed forward, not out to the sides.;
, If your weight was on the outside of your feet, you are pronated. If your weight was previously on the inside of your feet, you are supinated.Pronation and supination are common problems. However, they can result in ankle, leg, hip and back problems in the future.
If it is very hard to move the weight to the balls of your feet, you can consult a podiatrist to get custom orthotics. They can help correct your posture.

, There should be a very slight, almost imperceptible, bend in them. Locking your knees increases stress on your joints., Your lower back should have a slight curve to it. Some people may have too much of a curve in their lower back, called “hyperlordosis,” which is often caused by weak core muscles or excessive abdominal weight.Other people may stand with their pelvis tucked too far in, causing the lower back to be straight instead of maintaining its natural curve. This is called a “flat back” and is also unhealthy. It can be caused by sitting for too long in one position or by tightness in your core muscles.
If you are prone to low back pain, try contracting your abdominal muscles a little. Imagine you have a corset that is pulling your stomach muscles in and upward. Your back will be supported. Don’t tilt your pelvis; use your abs to support your body.It may take time to develop postural muscles in your legs, belly, back and shoulders. Keep with it for several months to get pain-relieving results.

, Your arms should hang at your sides without too much tension. If your shoulders rise toward your ears, make an effort to drop them., Let your arms drop to your sides and hang naturally. If your knuckles face the front, your shoulders may be more rounded than is healthy.


Focus on pulling your shoulders back just a bit to counteract this roundedness. You can improve your muscle balance and reduce rounded shoulders by strengthening your upper back and core muscles.

, People who work at computers can become hunched. Practice pinching your shoulder blades together to counteract the effects of computer work.Don’t overcorrect by pulling your shoulder blades too far back. This can create a hinge effect at your lower back that can cause pain.

, Try to avoid slumping forward. If your head slumps forward or down, bring it back so that your chin is parallel to the floor.Make sure that your head does not list to one side or the other. Keep your earlobes parallel to your shoulders.Be sure not to overcorrect by hinging your head up, either. Your eyes should look straight ahead, not up to the ceiling or down to the floor.
Imagine a string attached to the top of your head that is pulling you toward the ceiling. Your neck and head should be straight and upright.

, Your spine has three natural curves that create places where your back should touch the wall first if you’re standing properly.Stand against a vertical wall with your heels 2-4” from the wall. Make sure the back of your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks touch the wall.The back of your head should touch the wall due to the cervical curve.
The back of your upper shoulders should touch the wall due to the thoracic curve.
Your buttocks should touch the wall due to the lumbar curve.
You should be able to slide your hand in between the wall and your lower back curve. If you can’t, your back may be too flat. If the gap is much thicker than your hand, tighten your abs to flatten your back slightly until it touches your hand.
If you touch at other places, adjust your standing posture so that these three points hit the wall at once.

Apply a cold compress to relieve itchiness.,
Take an oatmeal bath.,
Apply calamine cream.",How to Treat an Itching Wound1," The cold temperature of the ice can temporarily numb your skin so that you don’t feel the itchiness anymore. The compress also narrows the blood vessels in the surrounding area, which can also help to limit the itchiness.Apply a cold compress to the area for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not exceed 20 minutes, or the cold temperature could cause skin damage. If you do not have a cold compress, wrap ice in a hand towel; do not put the ice directly on your skin.;
, Oatmeal can help to soothe any itchiness caused by a wound. You can generally purchase oatmeal-based bath products at your local pharmacy. Oatmeal contains colloidal protein and high mucilaginous content that can help to keep your skin from drying out and becoming itchy.Soak in an oatmeal bath for 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse off using warm water without soap, as the soap will remove the essential minerals from your skin.

, This medicated anti-itch cream is used for the temporary relief of itching. However, do not apply it to broken skin, as it will only cause further irritation. You can purchase this cream over-the-counter at your local pharmacy.You can apply this cream every six to eight hours, or as necessary.

"
Limit packaged foods.,
Watch those portion sizes.,
Share an entree.,
Eat less meat.,
Eat more whole grains.,
Snack on nuts, seeds, and legumes.",How to Stay Healthy and Active2," Most pre-packaged foods have unnatural chemical additives and preservatives, and often contain unhealthy saturated or trans fat. It is almost always better to eat food you prepare at home, where you can control the ingredients. Most pre-packaged foods are also higher in calories and fat, especially saturated trans fats., Dieticians recommend eating slowly, which helps you recognize when you are full. When you continue to eat after your hunger has been satisfied, you are ingesting a lot of calories that easily could have been avoided.Limit calories to 2,000 kcal/day. If you are trying to lose weight, try cutting down to 1,800 kcal/day. Never consume fewer than 1,200 kcal/day.


One serving of meat, fish, or poultry should be about 3 ounces, when cooked, or about the same size as the palm of your hand.A serving of cooked pasta should be about half a cup, or roughly the size of a scoop of ice cream.
One serving of grains is equal to one slice of bread. One pancake or one waffle equals one serving, which should be about the same size as a typical slice of bread.
One cubed serving of cheese is roughly the same size as your entire thumb.
One serving of vegetables or fruit is about the size of your fist.
A healthy serving size of cooked rice is about enough to fill a standard cupcake wrapper.
Try to make half of your plate consist of vegetables.

, Restaurants often serve food in unusually large portions. Sharing one entree between two people is a good way to ensure proper portion size and save money as well., Although it is not imperative to eliminate meat from your diet entirely, reducing the amount you eat will have a positive effect on your health. Many meats are high in calories and contain a large percentage of fat. Red meats especially have been linked to clogged arteries, higher cholesterol, and heart problems., Oatmeal, brown rice, and whole-wheat bread contain fiber, which is essential to a healthy digestive tract. Whole grains also contain B vitamins, which boost energy and metabolism., Nuts and seeds contain vitamin E and other nutrients that aren't readily found in other foods. Legumes such as peanuts, lentils, beans, and soybeans also provide fiber, as well as protein, iron, folate, and other important nutrients."
"
Spend more time outdoors.,
Make small changes in your daily routine.,
Drink lots of water.,
Wake up earlier.,
Try meditation.",How to Stay Healthy and Active3," Whenever possible, try to spend at least 30 minutes per day outside enjoying the sunlight. Exposure to sunlight triggers the production of Vitamin D, which helps improve your immune system function and strengthen your bones. The sun's rays also increase levels of serotonin in the body, which promotes feelings of well-being and happiness, and helps to regulate your appetite., The accumulated effects of making numerous minor changes will go a long way in helping you become a healthy, active person overall.


Avoid the easy way. Try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and walk through your golf game instead of driving a cart.Park farther from the door when you are out shopping. This small change will add to the accumulated number of steps you take per day, and it might also free up a parking space for a less agile person who needs it more.Wash your car by hand instead of using the drive-thru. This can be a fun activity when the weather is nice, and hand-washing is much gentler on your paint than the big mechanical brushes.Walk or ride to work. If you live close enough to your place of employment, walking or riding a bicycle to and from work is a great way to stay in shape.
Take a lunchtime walk. Taking a long walk on your lunch hour can be an enjoyable way to refresh your mind and your body. Try inviting a friend along!, One of the most important elements of any healthy diet is water. Try to drink around eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, to keep your body hydrated and to avoid potential health problems. Also, water will help you feel full so you will eat less. If you don't like plain water, try adding fruit, herbal tea, or sugar-free flavoring. There are also apps like Waterlogged that will remind you to drink more water!, For two weeks, try setting your alarm clock to wake up 30 minutes earlier than your usual time. Having that extra half hour will eliminate a lot of stress caused by rushing around in the morning, and can also make you feel more responsible and empowered., Just twenty minutes per day has been shown help reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and generate feelings of happiness and well-being. Simply find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed, and sit comfortably with your hands resting, palms-up, gently on your knees. Focus on your breathing, which should be regular and deep, and try to clear your mind.Try candle meditation. If you find that your mind wanders when you try to meditate, you might try lighting a candle, and focusing on the flame.Make use of mantras. Some people find it helps to repeat a word over and over. You can use a traditional Sanskrit mantra, or use any word that has positive associations for you.Practice creative visualization. Another easy technique is to imagine yourself in a peaceful, beautiful location. Imagine all the small details of the setting, and ignore everything in the physical world around you."

Walk around for a few minutes to stretch your muscles.,
Balance on one leg while standing in front of a mirror.,
Work on improving your balance.,
Do wall squats.,
Place a broom handle or foam roller in front of you and slightly to the right.,
Avoid exercises that have you bend from your waist.,
Do planks.,
Do side-lying leg raises.,
Do back extensions.",How to Stand Correctly2," This is especially important after a day of sitting.


If you can do stretching exercises such as yoga regularly, this can help develop flexibility in your muscles and improve posture., Try to keep your body completely straight, instead of listing to one side.Hold this position for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.

, Better balance increases strength and improves your posture. It can also reduce your risk of injury.Stand on one foot and bring the opposite foot directly behind you about four inches. Bring it forward again, keeping it in line with your hip the whole time. Repeat 10-15 times on both sides.
Stand on one foot. Lift one leg out to the side and hold the position for 1-5 seconds. Lower your leg. Repeat 10-15 times on both sides., Wall squats can help strengthen your buttock muscles, which will help you stand correctly. Stand with your back against the wall. Your toes should be hip-width apart with toes slightly out.Slide your back down the wall and bend your knees. When your thighs are parallel to the ground, slide your back up the wall.
Repeat 10 to 20 times.
You can put an exercise ball between the wall and your lower back to help you keep your balance if you’re just beginning.
Try doing it with a chair instead of a wall when you feel stronger. Lower yourself down without the help of the wall. When your buttocks brush the chair during the squat, straighten your legs.

, Place your right hand atop the handle to use for stability. Lean forward and lift your right leg, trying to keep your body aligned the entire time.


Repeat on the opposite side, taking 10 seconds to complete the exercise.
As you get stronger, your trunk should become perpendicular to your standing leg.

, Bending forward from the waist is bad for your posture and can also cause harm if you have osteoporosis.Toe touches, sit ups, and abdominal crunches should be avoided unless they are done under the supervision of a physical therapist or physician.

, Plank exercises are excellent for strengthening your core muscles. Without a strong core, your body has to work hard to stand correctly, and may overuse some muscles and not use others. Plank exercises can help correct an excessive curve in your lower back, a flat back, uneven hips, and rounded shoulders.Lie on your stomach. Raise your body up so that your weight is resting on your toes and forearms.Press your palms together and keep your forearms planted firmly on the floor. Align your shoulders so that they are directly above your elbows. Look at the floor, keeping your head neutral.
Contract your abdominal muscles to form your body in a straight line from your head to your toes.
Make sure that your lower back doesn’t sink or arch up while you’re planking.

, These exercises can help correct poor posture by strengthening your buttocks and lower back muscles. If these muscles are weak, you may have an improper arch or curve to your spine.Lie on one side. Prop your head up with one arm. Bend the knee that is on the ground to a 90 degree angle. Keep your hips level, not pushed too far forward or back.
Contract your abdominal muscles and keep them tight as you perform the exercise.
Keeping the top leg straight, lift it as far as you can without tilting your hips backward. You should feel your buttock muscles contract as you lift your leg.
Slowly lower the leg to the ground. Repeat 8-10 times, then switch to the other side.

, Weak back muscles can lead to a flat back and rounded shoulders. Back extensions can help strengthen these muscles and keep you standing correctly.The “cobra pose” in yoga can also help strengthen these muscles.


Lie on your stomach. Bend your elbows and bring your arms to your side so that your head is resting on your hands.Using your forearms, press your upper body up from the ground. Keep your shoulders, back, and neck long as you arch backward. Don’t bend your neck backwards: keep it in line with your spine.
Inhale, feeling your abdominal muscles stretch slightly. Hold your breath for 5 seconds, then slowly lower yourself to the floor again.

Practice good posture.,
Alternate between sitting and standing.,
See if you can get an adjustable-height desk.,
Buy a cushioned mat to stand on.,
Wear supportive shoes.,
Start with short, 10-minute, periods of standing.,
Learn to break up your workday with standing activities and sitting activities.,
Substitute walking around for standing if your work doesn’t support an adjustable height desk.",How to Stand Correctly3," Standing for long periods of time can have similar effects to sitting for long periods of time. If you have weak muscles, such as the abdominal and glute muscles, your other muscles will get tighter. There has to be a balance.


Avoid leaning on one leg. Shifting your weight from one hip to another is bad for your posture. If your buttock and core muscles are weak, you may tend to stand with more of your weight on one leg to use your lower back and hips to balance you.Stand with your weight distributed evenly between your legs. If your buttocks and core muscles are weak, do exercises to strengthen them such as planks, side-lying leg raises, and bridges.
You can also squeeze your butt muscles while standing to make sure the glute muscles don’t get weak. Do this several times a day.

, If possible, alternate the two positions every 30 minutes, for maximum benefit. Standing all day can have adverse affects on your health, just like sitting, because your joints are supporting you all day.


Ideally, find a sit-stand workstation that can be used when sitting or standing., They are made in desktop models that start at $200 and full-desk models that start at $900.


People who are handy with do-it-yourself projects may find that they can create an adjustable height desk. Even placing your monitor, keyboard, and other work tools on elevated boxes can provide a more ergonomic workstation.
Your standing desk should have your screen 20” to 28” from your eyes and allow you to hold your elbows at a 90-degree angle.You can also use a footstool to take pressure off your back. Stand with one leg slightly bent, and the other leg on a small stool. Make sure you alternate legs every 15 to 20 minutes.

, A small gel mat works well to give your feet extra support.

, Don’t stand at work in heels or flat shoes without arch supports. Add arch supports to your shoes if they don’t have them already.

, As you develop your postural muscles you can increase these periods. Standing too long too soon can result in a backache.

, Standing while answering email, calling or doing research is advantageous because you are likely to do it for 30 minutes and move on. Typing and activities that require honed motor skills are easier to do when sitting.

, Get up and walk around every 30 minutes to ensure that you are getting the exercise and stretching your body needs."
"
Apply a medicated cream.,
Use a 1% hydrocortisone cream.,
Take over-the-counter antihistamines.",How to Treat an Itching Wound2," Neosporin is an antibacterial and anti-itch cream that is used to treat itchy wounds. The cream inhibits the production of protein in bacteria that can result in cell death and cause itchiness.


You can apply medicated creams three times a day, or as directed by a doctor.

, This cream is used for the relief of inflamed and itchy skin. It acts by stabilizing leukotriene lysosomal membranes that prevent the release of acid hydrolases (things that make you feel itchy).


You can apply this cream every 8 to 12 hours to keep your skin from feeling itchy.

, These medications release antihistamines, which inhibit the action of histamines. Histamines cause you to feel itchy. Some commonly used antihistamines include:


Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). It is available in 25 mg and 50 mg pills but you should not take more than 300 mg in a day. Be careful, as benadryl can cause drowsiness.Loratadine (Claritin). It is available in 10 mg tablets and can be taken once a day. This antihistamine generally does not cause drowsiness, but you should still look for the ‘non-drowsy’ banner when purchasing these antihistamines."
"
Avoid scratching.,
Trim your nails.,
Avoid using harsh soaps and detergent.,
Always moisturize your skin.,
Know when to call a doctor.",How to Treat an Itching Wound3," Scratching can reopen the wound, which in turn can delay the healing process. If you cannot help but scratch, rub the wound using minimal pressure, but do not use your nails, as they will irritate the wound., You may unconsciously scratch at the wound during the night. To limit the amount of damage this unconscious scratching can do, trim your nails so they are as short as possible.

, Using products with strong chemicals can delay wound healing as the soap may alter the skin’s production of new cells and tissues.


Mild soap products are recommended such as Dove, Neutrogena, and Cetaphil; these products are mild cleansers and good for the skin.

, When you moisturize, you can prevent dryness, which can limit how much itchiness you feel. Dry skin is more prone to breakdown and irritation than well moisturized skin is.


Moisturize your skin after taking a bath or washing your hands to help your skin stay silky smooth.

, If the itchiness you are experiencing has become constant and more severe, your wound may be infected. If this is the case, you should give your doctor a call. Symptoms of an infected wound include:


Inflammation around the sides of the scabs.
Increasing pain.
Abnormal wound discharges with an unpleasant odor.
Fever

"
Get plenty of rest.,
Drink lots of fluids.,
Try to avoid being around people for a couple of days.,
Use a humidifier.Using a humidifier, particularly in your room at night as you try to fall asleep, can help to ease symptoms of congestion and cough.,
Purchase lozenges or gargle saltwater for a sore throat.If your virus has left you suffering from a sore throat, consider purchasing lozenges from your local pharmacy or drugstore.,
See a doctor if you have preexisting health conditions that could make your infection worse.",How to Treat a Viral Infection1," When your body gets infected with a virus, it works overtime to keep functioning while also fighting off your infection. Because of this, it's important to rest. Take a day or two off work or school and do low-energy activities like watching a movie or sleeping in bed. Resting will allow your body to focus all of its energy on overcoming the virus.Other low-energy activities you can do if you can’t sleep include:


Reading a book, catching up on your favorite TV show, listening to music in bed, and calling someone on the phone.
Be aware that antibiotics are not effective against viral infections and that, in general, you need to simply rest and allow your body to combat the virus.;
, Viral infections generally lead to dehydration (as a result of water lost through mucus production and fever). When you become dehydrated, your symptoms will get worse; it's a vicious cycle that you should try to break out of by drinking plenty of liquids. Drink water, tea, natural juice, and drinks with electrolytes to stay hydrated.Try to stay away from alcohol or caffeinated beverages, as these types of drinks can actually dehydrate you further., Viruses are contagious, which means that you can actually pass the virus to others, making them sick as well. Being around other people can also put you at risk of being exposed to other microorganisms like bacteria, which could make you more sick than you already are.Take at least two days off of work or school to avoid getting other people sick.
If you absolutely have to go into work or school, wear a mask to prevent others from becoming infected.The mask will prevent contagious particles from spreading through the air, especially if you are coughing or sneezing.

, This will help you to sleep better, and a better quality sleep equates to improved healing capacity. Be sure that your humidifier is clean to prevent any air contamination (such as with molds) that could potentially worsen your symptoms rather than improve them.

, Not only does sucking on something help to ease throat pain, but many lozenges also contain local anesthetic to slightly numb your throat and to further reduce pain.


Gargling saltwater (a quarter to half of a teaspoon of salt in one cup of water is recommended) is another way to ease the pain of a sore throat.

, While viral infections are generally not super dangerous, they can be to people who already have a weakened immune system or chronic respiratory problems such as asthma or COPD. If you have cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or another immunity disorder, you should talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a viral infection."

In order to be included as an author an individual should:Have made a significant intellectual contribution in carrying out and writing up the study or have been involved with the medical care of the patient reported
Be able to explain and defend the data presented in the article
Have approved the final manuscript before it is submitted for publication

, The key words are very important for making sure that your article is discoverable. People will search databases of studies using key words.Choose words that you would use to search for your article. Possibilities include the name of the condition or special treatments that you used.
Usually around 4 to 8 key words or phrases are permitted. Check the guidelines of the journal to which you plan to submit your study.

, The abstract summarizes the contents of the study in about 150-250 words.This is a very important part of the article because most people will read only the abstract. And anyone considering reading the whole paper will first read the abstract to decide if they want to read the whole paper. So the article should provide the most important information from the major sections of the paper. Usually abstracts of the article are fully available to anyone online, whereas the entire article usually costs a fee or you have to be associated with an institute that pays an institutional fee for access to that journal. There are two formats for abstracts:A narrative abstract. This type of abstract is written as a single paragraph without headings. The paragraph should logically summarize the study and its results.
A structured abstract contains headings which usually correspond to the major sections of the paper, such as background, methods, and discussion. Check with the journal where you want to submit your manuscript to see what format they prefer.

, The introduction is often the most difficult part of a paper to write because it must clearly convey why the topic and the study is important. It sets up the rest of the paper. Exactly what information you put in will vary based on the study and what you wish to emphasize. An effective introduction might cover:An understanding and review of recent other papers that have come out on the same topics
Why understanding this case study is important
The historical or social context of the condition
If there are particular challenges in diagnosing or treating this condition
If new methods or techniques were developed
What is already known about similar cases
What is already known about the disease, including treatment and diagnosis
How the current study adds to that knowledge

, In the section “Case Presentation,” the author presents the data about the patient. It is written in narrative form, not as an outline or bullet points. Information in this section may include:A description of why the patient sought medical help. This may even include the patient’s own words.
The results of the medical exam. This includes a description of any specialized tests that were performed and their results. Some results, such as x-rays, can be presented as figures with figure legends explaining them.

, It is important for the patient's privacy that the patient is not identifiable. This means that no details can be included that identify the patient, such as the name. Talk to your colleagues to see how they recommend accomplishing this. Possibilities include:


Identifying the patient with a number.
Giving the patient a false name.

, In the section called “Management and Outcome” you explain the plan of care that was created for the patient, what care was given, and what the outcome was. Details to provide include:How long the patient received care
How many times the patient was treated
Exactly what treatments were performed and how
How the patient’s improvement was measured
How and why the treatment ended

, The discussion section summarizes the lessons that are learned from the case and why it is significant for future treatments of similar cases.This section should also outline open questions that remain. If possible the authors should provide suggestions for how to address them in future studies.
Discuss your case study in relation to the current literature on other similar cases., The Acknowledgements section is where people who provided technical assistance should be thanked. This may also include anyone else who assisted with the study or writing, but is not included as an author.If financial support was provided by grants or medical foundations, they should be listed.
It is common to thank the patient, but, regardless of whether or not you do that, you also should indicate that you obtained the patient’s consent to anonymously publish the information.

, This is where you provide the full bibliographic information of the sources which you used to support the statements you made.Most of your sources will probably be other medical studies. Check with the journal where you plan to submit the paper to determine how the bibliography should be formatted. Most formats require the following information for each reference:


Authors of the study
Title of the study
Journal it was published in
Volume of the journal
Page numbers of the paper
Year

, Your target journal is the journal where you would like to have your paper published. Talk to your colleagues and co-authors to see where they recommend. Read the author guidelines for the journal carefully to make sure they do indeed publish case reports. Not all journals do. Other things to consider are:


Does the journal index the papers in the PubMed database?Is there a publishing fee?Is the journal well-respected in its field? One way of measuring this is the journal’s impact factor. This information should be available on the journal’s website.
Is the journal peer-reviewed? Peer-review is a process in which manuscripts are given to experts in their field who provide their opinions on the study. This is a way to verify that the study was well conducted and that the conclusions are justified. Having been through peer-review gives your work credibility.

, Most journals use an online submission process in which you upload your paper online. Once you upload and submit your paper you will receive:


An acknowledgement of submission
A decision several weeks later. The decision will likely come with anonymous reviews from your reviewers. The journal will likely: accept your paper, accept it with minor revision, accept it with major revisions, reject it with an invitation to revise and resubmit, or reject it without an invitation to resubmit.

, Receiving requests for revisions is a standard part of scientific publishing and generally improves the quality of the paper. When you revise your paper you should:Provide a letter in which you answer each of the comments provided by each reviewer and provide page numbers showing how you addressed the comments in the manuscript
Submit the letter with the revised manuscript
If the original journal did not invite you to resubmit, then you can submit the revised version to a different journal and go through a new round of peer review.

, If you are able to answer all of the reviewers' and editors' comments on the manuscript in a way that is satisfactory, your paper is likely to be accepted after you revise it. You will receive another decision which will indicate that either:


The paper is accepted as it is.
The paper is accepted after minor changes. You may receive this decision if the editor is largely satisfied, but has small content corrections or formatting changes that need to be made.

, After your paper is accepted, the journal will send you a draft to look over. These are called the proofs. You should check:


That all the tables and figures appear correctly in the right order.
That there have been no errors in any mathematical formulas.
That the body of the paper is correct and contains no typos or formatting errors.
That the names and affiliations of the authors are correct.

, Read through the contract to make sure you fully understand the copyright implications of the contract. Things to consider are:


Do you as the author retain the copyright? Or will it belong to the journal?
Are you prohibited from making the article freely available online?
Is there an embargo period, meaning that you cannot talk to the press about your results before the journal publishes the paper?

Decide how often to weigh yourself.,
Keep the conditions stable.,
Learn what factors can affect the scale weight.,
Make sure to use the same scale.,
Weigh yourself first thing in the morning.,
Weigh yourself at the same time each week.,
Find ways to manage anxiety surrounding the scale.,
Look for steady changes over time.,
Minimize liquid intake before weighing yourself.,
Avoid weighing yourself after a night out.,
Pay attention to other weight loss clues.",How to Weigh Yourself While Dieting," Some dieters weigh themselves as frequently as every day. Others weigh themselves once every week or every couple of weeks. Research shows that weighing oneself daily is best for weight loss, but you need to look at the the pros and cons of each option to decide what works for you personally.Some dieters find daily weigh ins can help motivate them and keep them strict about restricting calories. If you feel compelled to cheat and eat fast food, for example, thinking of how this will reflect your morning weight may give you pause. This also means you can quickly address any weight gain and adjust your diet and exercise accordingly.
However, daily fluctuations in weight are common. Things like water and salt intake can cause a temporary 1 to 2 pound increase in weight overnight, which may cause unnecessary frustration. Some people find the scale actually diminishes motivation, as these minor changes affect their mood negatively.
You can experiment weighing yourself every day versus weighing yourself every week or two weeks. See which method results in you feeling better about yourself and your diet. Pick the method that you feel will sustain you the most emotionally throughout the difficult process of weight loss.;
, If you're going to be weighing yourself regularly, the conditions should be consistent. If you weight yourself in shoes one day, and barefoot the next, this will cause a change in weight. The time of day can also affect your weight.Keep your clothing options consistent. If you're going to be weighing yourself every morning, for example, make sure to always do so with just pajamas on or, even better, when naked.
Your weight may change by a pound or two throughout the day due to normal bodily changes. You will weigh less in the morning, for example, as your stomach will be empty. It's important to weigh yourself at roughly the same time each day to get an accurate sense of whether you're gaining or losing weight.

, You want to make sure other factors aren't affecting your weight. It's easy to get discouraged if the numbers spike up unexpectedly, so learn common factors that cause inaccuracy in scales. Try to avoid weighing yourself when these factors are at play.Take water weight into account. If you have a glass of water before hopping on the scale, you can ""gain"" as much as a pound. Water weight can work the other way as well. If you weigh yourself after a big workout, you may find you've ""lost"" two pounds, only to get discouraged to find them back again the next morning.
Alcohol also causes dehydration, leading to fluid retention. This translates to holding onto water weight after a night of drinking.
Restaurant foods are often high in salt, which can lead to increased water weight and a misleading number on the scale.
Menstruation can cause a temporary rise in weight before your period. If you know your cycle, it may be a good idea to refrain from weighing yourself right before your period., Scales give you a good estimate of your rough weight. However, the typical bathroom scale isn't 100% accurate. There may be minor differences between one scale and the next. In order to accurately gauge if you're losing weight, stick to using the same scale., This is generally considered the ideal time to weigh yourself. Your stomach will be empty, so you won't have a misleading number due to recently having consumed food or water. As water weight can also cause the number on the scale to change, don't even have a glass of water before hopping on the scale in the morning., If you're not weighing yourself every day, settle on a specific time to weigh yourself each week. Remember, small changes can affect weight. Consistency will help you get a sense of whether your weight is generally going up or down.For example, if you usually have dinner out on Friday, your weight may creep up a bit Saturday morning. If you usually have a vigorous workout Thursday night, your weight may be down slightly Friday morning.
Try to pick a timeframe when there's nothing unusual about your schedule. If things are pretty routine Monday to Wednesday, try weighing yourself every Wednesday morning, for example.

, It's important to weigh yourself while dieting. Weighing yourself can help you track what works and what doesn't and keep your motivation strong. However, many people have anxiety about the scale. If you're having trouble stepping on the scale, find ways to ease your stress.It can help to show yourself how easily weight changes. Weigh yourself once, have a large glass of water, and then weigh yourself again. You'll be surprised how much weight you gained just in water.
Doing things like this can show you how much weight fluctuates. This will allow you to cut yourself some slack if you gain a pound or so one week. Remember, this could be due to a number of factors and your weight will eventually go down if you stick to your diet and exercise plan.

, You can't expect big changes fast. Healthy weight loss is usually in the form of 1 to 2 pounds of week. Track your weight in a journal and pay attention to how it changes slowly over time.You may not lose weight every week, and some weeks you may be frustrated to find you've gained some. During these weeks, remind yourself how far you've come.
For example, think something like, ""Yes, I went from 169 to 171 this week, but remember when I used to be 206? I've come a long way.""

, You never want to step on a scale after drinking water. A glass of water can cause your weight to shoot up over a pound. Try not to drink anything before stepping on the scale., Alcohol and food you would get from a restaurant can cause incredible inaccuracies with the scale. While it's virtually impossible to gain weight due to a single night's indulgences, the scale may say otherwise. Water retention occurs if you've had salty food or alcohol. If you have a cheat night where you go out with friends, don't torture yourself by stepping on the scale in the morning. Wait a few days to weigh yourself again., As the scale can fluctuate due to random factors, embrace other weight loss clues. This will help you feel good about yourself, even when the number on the scale is not moving as fast you want.Pay attention to how your clothes fit. If your clothes are getting looser, this is a good sign you're losing weight even if the scale is saying otherwise — remember that muscle weighs more than fat.
Take your measurements. Even if the number on the scale isn't creeping downward as fast as you want, you'll be happy to see your waist decreasing in size.
Pay attention to how your body has changed. You may be able to run or walk farther as you get more fit.

Apply pressure to the reflex points for you stomach, small intestine, and gall bladder to treat digestive problems.Your stomach reflex point is on the sole of your left foot just beneath the lung reflex point.",How to Use Reflexology to Relieve Chest Pain1," It can be difficult to determine the precise origin of chest pain, which can stem from stress, lung problems, digestion issues, or heart problems.It is therefore best to start by massaging your entire foot, and then focusing in on areas you think might be to blame. This sort of general massage has been shown to have a positive therapeutic effect., Hold the foot and gently rotate it at the ankle. Then rub all over your foot with both hands. Do this before applying any massage oil or moisturizing lotion., Rub the lotion in your hands to warm it up, then apply it to the top of the foot, starting at the ankle and wiping down to the toes. Do the same for the bottom of the foot., Starting with the big toe, pinch it between your index finger and thumb and use your thumb or thumb knuckle to gently press and massage the bottom of the toe for approximately 30 seconds.Twist the toe left and right, then push it down towards the sole of the foot. Repeat this procedure, spending approximately 15 seconds massaging each of the smaller toes. End by using your hand to gently press all the toes and the top of the foot down towards the sole of the foot., Grip the foot you are working on by the Achilles tendon above the heel to provide stability while you massage. Start nearest the big toe. Using your thumb or thumb knuckle, apply gentle pressure by pressing and holding for two seconds, or massaging with tiny circular motions. Move across the foot in three separate lines – top, middle, and bottom of the ball of the foot. Repeat these lines three times., Grip your foot with both hands. Use your thumb knuckles if your thumbs get tired.Start by applying gentle pressure as you pull your thumb across your foot, alternating hands – left to right for your right thumb, and right to left for your left thumb. Work in three lines, dragging each thumb 5 times per line.
Next apply gentle pressure as you pull your thumbs down along the middle of your foot, working towards your heel. Again, work in three lines, dragging your left and right thumb 5 times per line.
Massage the center of your foot by applying gentle pressure with you thumbs and moving in a clockwise direction.

, Using both your thumbs, one atop the other, massage the bottom of your foot just above your heel with a clockwise motion., Applying gentle pressure and using small circular motions, work your way down your instep from your big toe to your heel. Spend approximately two seconds on each point, and repeat the process three times., Rub the heel in a circular motion with your thumb or knuckle for approximately 30 seconds.Then use your thumbs to apply gentle pressure to the tops of the feet as you drag your thumbs along the spaces between your toes, which run from your toe webbing to the highest point of your foot., Now that you have massaged your entire foot, return to the areas you feel might be causing the pain and spend extra time on them.

, The reflexes for your lungs start at the base of your toes and extend down to the bottom of the ball of your foot, where the color of your skin changes. Also massage the corresponding area on the top of your foot., According to reflexology theory, this should help for issues like arrhythmia.,,
The small intestine reflex is located on the soles of your feet in the arch area.
The gal bladder reflex point is on the sole of your right foot, where the left hand thumb is in the picture above.

Eat foods that are rich in vitamin C. Vitamin C has long been considered one of the most powerful immune system boosters.,
Try to eat some chicken soup.,
Increase the amount of zinc you get each day.,
Consume more echinacea.",How to Treat a Viral Infection2," Because of this, it is recommended to increase your intake of vitamin C while you are dealing with a virus.Aside from taking a vitamin C supplement, you can also:


Eat fruits that have high amounts of vitamin C. These include grapefruit, kiwi, strawberries, lemon, lime, blackberries, oranges, papaya, pineapple, pomelo, and raspberries.Eat vegetables that are rich in vitamin C. These include Brussel sprouts, broccoli, onions, garlic, red and green peppers, tomatoes, and radishes. You can also consider making vegetable soup, if you don’t like eating raw veggies., If you have ever wondered why people always give their kids chicken noodle soup when they are sick, it's because chicken soup is a wonder when it comes to recovering from a virus. Not only does chicken soup act as an anti-inflammatory, it also temporarily helps to relieve congestion by unblocking your nasal passages.You can also add onions, garlic, and other veggies to your soup to boost its vitamin and mineral count.

, Zinc governs enzymes in our body that activate different parts of our immune system that fight against infection. Most people choose to take a 25 mg zinc supplement before one meal each day, but you can also add zinc-rich foods to your diet. These foods include spinach, mushrooms, beef, lamb, pork or chicken, and cooked oysters.Zinc has been shown to be most effective when taken for two to three days at the beginning of a cold or flu. Start taking zinc as soon as you think you may be getting sick.
You can also purchase lozenges that contain zinc, which you can suck on. You can buy these and other zinc supplements at your local pharmacy.
Do not take zinc supplements if you take antibiotics (such as tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones), Penicillamine (a drug used in Wilson’s disease), or Cisplatin (a medication used in cancer), due to the fact that zinc decreases the efficiency of these drugs.

, Echinacea is a type of plant that is often made into a tea or taken as a supplement. When consumed, it helps to increase the number of leukocytes (white blood cells that boost your immunity) and other immune-related cells in your body. You can consume echinacea by drinking tea or juice made from the plant, or by taking supplements bought at a pharmacy or health foods store.Other natural remedies to consider include eucalyptus, elderberry, honey, and reishi and shiitake mushrooms.

Take over-the-counter drugs to fight pain and fever caused by a regular viral infection.If you have a cold or the flu, chances are some of your symptoms include a fever and a headache.,
Consider a nasal spray.There are different types of nasal sprays on the market and its important to be able to distinguish between them.,
Opt for a cough syrup if you have severe symptoms.When considering an over-the-counter cough syrup, the main thing to look at is the list of ingredients.,
Seek professional medical care if you have a more severe virus.Certain viruses require professional medical care and treatment, in order to give you the best chance of a cure moving forward.",How to Treat a Viral Infection3," Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (Advil) work to reduce the pain you feel. Acetaminophen also helps to bring your fever down. You can get these drugs at any pharmacy.


The regular, adult dose for Acetaminophen is 325-650 mg tablets, one tablet every four hours. Read the bottle to learn about other doses, such as those for children.The regular, adult dose for Ibuprofen is 400-600 mg, once every six hours until your symptoms ease up., Saline sprays are safe for all ages and can hydrate your nasal passages. There is evidence that using a saline spray may reduce nasal secretions and the use of decongestants.Nasal decongestants, such as Afrin, are only recommended if you have severe congestion problems, because using a nasal spray too often can cause your symptoms of congestion to rebound after you stop using the spray. They should be used no longer than three days in a row to avoid rebound, and should not be used on children.
Corticosteroid nasal sprays, such as Flonase, are generally used to treat chronic symptoms, as it may take several days before you notice any improvement. Still, they can sometimes be helpful in combatting the symptoms of a viral infection. Talk to your doctor, and do not use corticosteroid medication on children under four., In particular, look for the presence of decongestants, antihistamines, and/or pain relievers combined with the cough syrup on the ingredient list. The reason you want to be aware of this is so that you do not double up on your medications and accidentally overdose (for instance, if a pain killer is included in your cough syrup, you will not want to take an over-the-counter pain killer on top of that).


Over-the-counter preparations are safe in adults, as long as careful attention is paid to not accidentally double up on any of the ingredients with other medications.
Avoid using cough syrups in children under the age of two.
Examples of terms to watch for include antitussive, which is a cough suppressant; mucolytic, which breaks up and loosens mucus.

, Signs that you have a more severe illness and should see your doctor include:Developing a rash
A high fever generally more than 103°F (39.4°C)
Getting worse after starting to feel better
Prolonged symptoms for longer than 10 days
A cough that brings up colored phlegm
Wheezing or trouble breathing

Get vaccinated.,
Wash your hands frequently.When we touch things, we pick up whatever microorganisms got there before our hands did.,
Don’t share things that touch your eyes, mouth, or nose.If you want to avoid getting a viral infection, you will have to avoid sharing things that could potentially contain a virus.,
Clean areas of your house after you or another family member have been infected.If someone in the household is ill, it is best to isolate them to their own bathroom if possible and, if not, to at least provide them with their own towel so that germs are not passed on to others.",How to Treat a Viral Infection4," Talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated against certain viruses. There is no vaccine for the common cold, but you should get vaccinated against the flu virus every season. There are vaccines for other viruses, such as HPV (Human Papilloma Virus), chickenpox, and shingles. Be mindful of the fact that getting vaccinated involves getting a shot or two; however, this should not deter you — the benefits of the vaccine are worth the short period of discomfort the shot causes.

, Because of this, it is really important to wash your hands whenever possible. Use warm water and soap to wash your hands as thoroughly as possible. You should wash your hands:


After traveling on public transportation, going to the bathroom, sneezing or coughing, touching your face and mouth, contact with someone who is sick, and handling raw meat.
Before eating or touching your mouth, nose, eyes, or face.

, Avoid sharing:


Food or drinks that someone else has touched with their lips, as well as toiletries, pillows, towels, and chapstick.

, Also, after the illness has passed, it is wise to clean areas of the house that may have residual germs, such as washrooms, bed sheets, and kitchen counters.

Start by massaging your entire hand.,
Warm up and relax your hand.,
Work on your fingers.,
Massage the palm of your hands.,
Move on to the backs of your hands.,
Concentrate on areas that you feel might be causing your chest pain.",How to Use Reflexology to Relieve Chest Pain2," According to reflexology theory, this will help to relax you and flush toxins from your system. Also, general massage has been proven to reduce pain and improve quality of life., Hand reflexology points are located more deeply than the similar points on your foot, so warming up your hand is very important to avoid pain.Gently rub massage oil or moisturizer into the wrist of your hand, using gentle, sweeping motions with your thumb for about 30 seconds.
Continue these sweeping motions as you move up to the palm of the hand, sweeping from the inside of the palm to the edges for about 30 seconds.
Turn you hand over and gently run your thumb from the webbing between your fingers to the top of your wrist.
Grip each finger and give it a gentle side to side twist, rotating the knuckle joint. Move your hand up and repeat with the second joint and top joint of each finger.
Repeat these steps with your other hand.

, Starting with the tip of your thumb, use your thumb and index finger to squeeze and apply pressure in a gentle circular motion for 3 to 5 seconds. Work your way down your thumb two times, then repeat with your other fingers. Do the same for you other hand.

, For each area of your palm, you will move downwards, then back up, and then to the side and start down again. At each point, apply gentle, rotational pressure for 3-5 seconds.Start on the soft padding under your fingers.
Move on to the center of your palm.
Work on the outer edge of your hand, starting under the little finger and continuing to the wrist.
Massage the base of your hand, moving from your thumb to the outer edge of you hand.
Finish by moving from left to right and back again across your wrist.

, Remember to apply much less pressure, as the back of your hand is very sensitive.Starting at the knuckle at the base of your thumb, apply gentle, rotational pressure for 3 to 5 seconds. Work down to the wrist, then move sideways. Continue working from the knuckles to the wrist until you have covered the entire back of your hand.
Apply gentle pressure as you work across your wrist.

, Spend extra time on these areas, applying gentle rotational pressure as you work across them, point by point.


Lung problems – Focus on the soft padding just below your fingers on the palm of your hand, and on the equivalent area on the back of your hand.Heart problems – Work on the fleshy area at the base of your thumbs.Digestive problems – Work on the areas from the base of your fingers to the last knuckle to stimulate your neck reflexes. Massage the center of your palms to stimulate your stomach and gall bladder. Work across the base of your palm to aid digestion in your small intestine.Stress related problems – Work on your entire finger to stimulate the reflex points associated with the head and neck in order to relieve stress."
